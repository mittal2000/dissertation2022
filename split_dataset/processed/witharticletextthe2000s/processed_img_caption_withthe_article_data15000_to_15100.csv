0,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Proposed Cabinet Would Bring Some Fringe Figures In From The Cold,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-administration-cabinet_us_58249c70e4b01019814da7f9,Not to mention his potential appointees are pretty much all white men.,2016-11-10,Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) is one of the people frequently discussed for a spot in a Trump administration.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5824f18b1800002e005036ca.jpeg?cache=G17kfuVWPJ&ops=crop_0_15_2663_1269%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Now that the election is over, the D.C. ritual of jockeying for top positions in the next administration has begun. Insiders give the press names of candidates who are real possibilities; long shots, just to see what reaction they get; friends and, sometimes, even themselves. So far, the names being floated for a Donald Trump administration largely have one thing in common: They’re men. And for the most part, they’re white men. BuzzFeed obtained one list of 41 names under consideration for Cabinet and top White House positions. Of those, only six are women. In other news stories listing potential appointees, no women are named. Many of them are also fringe figures ― people who have never been in government or who have been out of government for some time and are itching to get back in.Trump did not have the support of much of the Republican establishment, and many of the officials who would traditionally get into an administration now may be hesitant to do so for a leader they distrust. Trump may also block them since they didn’t support him. Meanwhile, some figures who have been lurking on the fringe may now have found a home with this unlikely president-elect. Here are the people being discussed so far for some top positions: Transition Chair: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) is currently leading Trump’s transition efforts, but if he no longer can ― he’s been tainted, for example, by the Bridgegate scandal ― tech billionaire Peter Thiel could replace him. Thiel secretly funded Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit that took down Gawker.com and once wrote that women getting the vote was bad for democracy.White House Chief of Staff: Two top candidates for this leading role are believed to be Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, and Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s first campaign manager who is currently a paid commentator for CNN. Steve Bannon, the chairman of the conservative Breitbart News who took a leave to be Trump’s campaign CEO, is another contender. Bannon’s website has peddled some of the major alt-right conspiracy theories and spread the vitriolic rhetoric that fueled Trump’s rise. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and veteran conservative operative David Bossie are other possibilities. Attorney General: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) is frequently talked about as a contender. Giuliani told CNN Thursday he would consider the job “if it really was just me and I couldn’t point to three others that would be just as good or better.” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) has also been talked about as a front-runner, as have Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R). During the campaign, questions were raised about whether Trump improperly made campaign contributions to Bondi’s re-election effort to influence whether she investigated allegations against Trump University.The attorney general oversees the Justice Department and enforces areas like civil rights. Giuliani has boasted that he made New York “safe” by implementing “stop and frisk,” a policing method that disproportionately affects black people and Latinos. He has also said “anything’s legal” during war. Two of Christie’s former top aides were recently convicted of conspiracy and fraud in the Bridgegate scandal, and their testimony has implicated the governor in their schemes. Secretary of State: Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) are reportedly under consideration for this top job. Defense Secretary: Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), one of Trump’s earliest supporters, has been mentioned as a possible defense secretary, as has retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has also been floated as national security adviser. Although Flynn is being talked about, he actually can’t be Defense Secretary yet because he hasn’t been retired from the military for enough time. Other names are Stephen Hadley, who served as a top national security official to President George W. Bush; Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr. (R-Calif.) and former Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.). Homeland Security Secretary: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) and Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke are on the list for this position. Clarke, who is African-American, has been a forceful critic of the Black Lives Matter movement and spoke at the Republican National Convention. He also called for Trump supporters to bring out “pitchforks and torches” to fight a rigged system. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is also a possible pick. The department includes the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that the senator argues should ramp up its deportations.Interior Secretary: Forrest Lucas, a California oil executive, is considered a top contender. Venture capitalist Robert Grady and fracking mogul Harold Hamm are also being discussed, as are three women: former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R), Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R) and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R).Treasury Secretary: Steven Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs executive who was finance chair of Trump’s campaign, is reportedly on the short list. Trump received a significant amount of criticism when he unveiled his 13-member economic advisory team in August. There were six men named Steve on the list ― including Mnuchin ― but not a single woman. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon is also under consideration, although he has said he would not be interested in the role. Other names are Wall Street veteran Carl Icahn and Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), who is chair of the House Financial Services Committee.Education Secretary: Neurosurgeon and former GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson is being discussed for this post, as is Hoover Institution fellow Williamson Evers, who also worked in the Education Department during George W. Bush’s administration. Commerce Secretary: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) and former Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) make this list as well, as do former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R), former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) and Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.). In the business world, financier Lew Eisenberg ― who also chaired a joint fundraising committee for Trump and the Republican National Committee ― is being discussed, along with the former CEO of steelmaker Nucor Dan DiMicco and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross. Health and Human Services Secretary: Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former New Jersey state Sen. Rich Bagger (R) are the names at the top of the list. Agriculture Secretary: One of the names on this list is Texas Agricultural Commissioner Sid Miller, who called Hillary Clinton a “cunt” on Twitter. Other names include Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback (R), former Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman (R), former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (R), former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R), National Council of Farmer Cooperatives CEO Chuck Conner, agribusiness leader Charles Herbster, Indiana dairy executive Mike McCloskey, Iowa agribusiness mogul Bruce Rastetter and Indiana farmer and congressional candidate Kip Tom. Energy Secretary: Fracking mogul Harold Hamm and venture capitalist Robert Grady are the two names most frequently mentioned.Labor Secretary: Victoria Lipnic, commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission since 2010, is frequently mentioned for this position. Veterans Affairs: House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.), who is retiring from Congress, is the man most discussed for this job. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified Jamie Dimon as the CEO of Goldman Sachs; he is the CEO of JP Morgan. A previous version of this article also misidentified Jeff Miller’s congressional district; he represents Florida, not California. This article has been updated to include additional candidates."
1,POLITICS,Donald Trump Lost In His Old New York Stomping Grounds,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-lost-new-york_us_5824c9fce4b02a0512939035,Trump's life unfolded in places that rejected his worldview Tuesday.,2016-11-10,"Donald Trump, seen here in 1978, didn't get much support in his home city.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump on Tuesday became the first person elected to the White House without winning his home state since Richard Nixon lost California in 1968. However, the extent to which the president-elect’s old stomping grounds went for Hillary Clinton goes much deeper than simply losing the Empire State, which Clinton carried Tuesday with 58.8 percent. According to DNA Info’s breakdown of the city’s election returns, Trump’s childhood home Jamaica Estates in Queens went overwhelmingly for Clinton, with 84.79 percent of the neighborhood’s voting precinct supporting the former secretary of state and a mere 13.36 percent supporting the president-elect. Trump’s current neighborhood was also fertile ground for Clinton; she received 64.27 percent of the Midtown precinct, where Trump Tower is located, more than twice Trump’s 30.74 percent. The other neighborhood most closely associated with Trump ― the 10-block condo development on Manhattan’s Upper West Side that bears Trump’s name on four buildings ― also rejected his candidacy. Clinton earned 75 percent in the precinct surrounding Trump Place, while Trump won 20.93 percent of the precinct’s votes.From the beginning of his campaign, Trump contended that he would be competitive in his home state. “Just so you understand, we are going to play New York,” Trump said in September. “We’re not just doing this for fun. We’re going to play New York.”However, the demographics of the state, anchored as they are by the greater New York City area, were not ones that Trump performed well with on Tuesday. Just over 22 percent of the state is foreign-born, nearly twice the national number of 12.9 percent, and in New York City that number is over 37 percent. Similarly, New York state’s 19 percent Hispanic population is one of the country’s largest. However, Trump’s 37 percent showing on Tuesday was a slight improvement on Mitt Romney’s 35 percent in 2012 and Trump vastly outperformed previous Republican presidential candidates in the largely rural and largely white upstate area. In rural Herkimer County, for example, Trump received 65 percent of the vote, a significant improvement from 2012, when Romney won the county with 48.6 percent of the vote. It almost goes without saying, but Trump lost New York City. Clinton carried the country’s largest city with 78.49 percent of the vote, trouncing Trump, who received 18.4 percent. Clinton’s strongest borough was Manhattan, where she received 86.36 percent and Trump a paltry 9.87 percent. However third-party support meant that Trump’s poorest borough was the Bronx, where he earned the support of 9.56 percent of voters. "

The changes have been felt even though the world is just 1 degree Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels.“We’re already seeing salamanders shrink in size, we’re seeing migratory birds change their migratory routes, we’re seeing species interbreeding now, because of just a small degree of warming,” said James Watson, a professor at the University of Queensland and senior author of the report.Scientists are currently gathered in Marrakech, Morocco, to work out details of the landmark Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep the world from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius. Anything hotter than that will likely cause a slew of troubling events: melting glaciers, rising seas, extreme weather and an uptick in disease.But aside from severe impacts for humanity, those shifts will drastically change worldwide biology.“The fact is, it’s not one or two species in one or two places,” Watson said. “It’s entire systems and entire processes. All the things which live in those systems are almost certainly changing their behavior, the way they live, the way they move.”The recent election of Donald Trump has cast serious doubts on the future of the Paris deal. The U.S. is the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter and the president-elect, a denier of climate change, has threatened to pull out of the accord. A similar move by America with the Kyoto Protocol set the fight against climate change back 20 years.Leading environmental groups have stressed the need for urgency in curbing greenhouse gas emissions.“The climate crisis is already having very serious consequences for life on the planet,” said Jean Su, associate conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The 1-degree Celsius rise in temperature already has the world spinning out of control in terms of the widespread harms to species, and also people ... The need for strong climate action couldn’t be clearer or as necessary as right now.”Su said the election of Trump “will purely galvanize grass-roots support for environmental action.”Watson said the report was “not just doom and gloom,” noting there was still time, albeit limited, to act on “low-hanging fruit” like environmental protection and investment in renewable energy. But ecosystems will only tolerate so much.“There’s no doubt we’re in for dramatic warming still,” he said. “We’re literally going into climatic spaces that are beyond the norm. With another degree, it’ll almost certainly be 100 percent of species affected. What we don’t know is how those species are going to react.”"

I was in New York City, and it was exhilarating to see real democracy in action. Maybe, I thought, I’d even get to witness history. As the night wore on, though, the initial euphoria of the possibility of seeing the first female U.S. president being elected was replaced by disbelief. Like many others here, I headed home in the early morning with results still pouring in. Around 1 a.m. on my subway ride home, just as Pennsylvania was leaning towards Republicans, I looked at an election chart from the website FiveThirtyEight. The red and blue lines had completely changed positions since the morning. “This website always gets the election results right,” someone had recently told me.Except this time when it didn’t. It wouldn’t be too much longer until media outlets had called Pennsylvania for you. By the time I got home, it was over. I knew then that you would be the next American president. The only thought on my mind was: “What do I tell to my kid tomorrow morning?” A question that an emotional Van Jones, the CNN commentator, had also shared. As soon as my son learned the election results this morning, he told me that we should perhaps start packing and plan to leave this country after school breaks for summer holidays. I’m Turkish, and I came to the U.S. to study journalism just over a year ago. I came to get a better future for my kids and myself. The American values of freedom of expression, belief and rule of law that Hillary Clinton mentioned in her concession speech are dear to my heart. So are responsibilities like being a law-abiding member of society and paying my taxes. I worked very hard to get here, yet I feel like there is no place for me in your America. I’m just another Muslim with a funny name.Mr. Trump, my son knew your name before we moved to America. We have a tower named after you in Istanbul’s Mecidiyeköy district. Every time we passed by it, I would tell him about where the name came from.My son is intelligent and hardworking. When we moved to this country, he had to sit through additional exams, some even more difficult than those of his American peers, just so he could start school. He’s still trying to adapt to the life here, and he is slowly on the way to making new friends. Yet, he’s old enough to recognize your speeches about certain people and religions ― for instance, when you talk about a blanket ban on Muslims ― as offensive. When my son asks about it, my husband and I tell him to never deny his religion, but not to make too much fuss about it either. In an ironic way, I now understand what some of the black or Hispanic parents that I have interviewed in the Bronx during my reporting classes are going through when they do the “police talk” with their teenage sons.Recently, my son’s school in Manhattan held a mock election to simulate the U.S. presidential campaign. Thankfully, the school is incredibly supportive and has a zero tolerance policy for bullying, scapegoating or name-calling foreigners and religious minorities. But outside the school, on streets in the U.S., who knows what will happen? How will people know what an innocent young boy he is? What will stop him from being labeled an outsider, a threat? And who can say you won’t designate Turkey a terrorist country one day, effectively banning all of my family from entering our new home country regardless of our spotless legal record and all of the creativity and skill we contribute to this country?On our way to my son’s school this morning, a group of his American friends on the bus were passionately discussing the election results. There was much chitter-chatter like, “Michelle Obama would make a great president,” or “When was America great anyway?” But one comment by an older boy stood out.“We don’t have democracy when the president is Republican and every branch is overrun by the Republicans,” he said. He is right.Later in the morning, my daughter called and said similar things, jokingly naming this election, “America: The Season Finale” and pointing to an end to the diversity in this country as we know it. How should I answer her question about the relevance of democracy when, in most states, the winner takes all the electoral votes? If every branch of a tree were the same, would we enjoy the diversity that Mother Nature provides us? True, we should also be vigilant and weed out woodworms so that they don’t destroy the tree from within. But to cut the branch altogether is never the ideal solution.I have to admit though, this is not the first time I face the anger of the discontented. We had a similar election result back in 2002. In general elections that year, conservative voters in Turkey gave its governing Justice and Development Party, or AKP, a resounding victory and bashed seculars and liberals like me. They were the underdogs fed up with elitists’ treatment of them and their conservative lifestyle. Fourteen years on, liberals can hold on to mostly coastal towns like my hometown İzmir near the Aegean Sea and a few similar ones by the Mediterranean. My friends and I used to look at the Turkish electorate map and joke that in the next election, we would probably be pushed into the sea. Looking at the U.S. electorate map last night after many of the results were in, and seeing a similar pattern of overwhelming reds in the central and rural parts of the country versus few blue states left on the coasts, I felt an eerie similarity.Diversity of our opinions, though is part of a country’s richness. We don’t have to agree on issues, but we must meet on the least common denominators and respect each others’ opinion, beliefs and existence.As a minority mother, I have a hard time trying to make sense of your America. I want to ask you: “Have you ever seen this country more divided?” As a journalist, I know that I have to be objective and to never ignore the concerns of “the other half.” I want to say to this to you: “I hope to get to know you and the ‘forgotten men and women’ you care so deeply about, so that I can be better at explaining things to them and telling stories to help us understand each other.” Back in April, I had the honor of meeting America’s first black president and his wife at the White House just nine months after I arrived in this country. This shows that American dreams do come true for immigrants like us. My worry is that with this election result, U.S. President Barack Obama’s legacy will go down the drain without retaining any of the good things he did for this country.Mr. Trump, please believe that there are immigrants like me in your country. I don’t know if I will ever get the chance to meet you. But I want to believe that when you are sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, you will not look to banish me or my son from it because of our faith.

It was filled with emotional outcries and bewilderment that Donald Trump is our next President.Many of you are shocked at how this could have happened. So I'm gonna take a second to explain it to you. If you are someone who is shocked by the results I’m guessing you live on the coast. That is to say you live in a state that borders the Atlantic or the Pacific.It is also to say that you have never held a manufacturing job. You can most likely look out your window and see your neighbor's house if not their apartment building. It’s also to say that when you walk down the street to go to Starbucks you most likely pass either a Muslim, an African American, a Latino or a homosexual. If you live in a big city you probably passed all of those people.You see that’s the difference. You don't have a clue about what people in the Midwest experience as the American way of life. If you live in rural Arkansas you don’t interact with a Muslim, an African American, a Latino or a homosexual on a daily basis. If you’re from the Midwest your experience with black culture is Kanye West interrupting Taylor Swift at the VMAs. And that’s true for every minority out there. You see we’ve done terrible disservice to the American heartland. We’ve drained their resources. We’ve moved their factories. But worse of all we’ve removed the people who could provide diversity. Smart people go to college and don’t move back. Gays and Lesbians leave the MidWest the first chance they get.Without diversity in the heartland fear of the outsider becomes entrenched. And coastals are just as much to blame. They too surround themselves with like minded individuals. Think about the last dinner party you attended. If you’re a liberal did that party include someone that was voting for Donald Trump. According to Pew Research Center 24% of liberals have stopped talking to someone because of opposing political viewpoints, compared to 16% of conservatives and 10% of those with mixed political viewpoints.When Trump was talking about Obamacare, the Trade Deals, and Immigration it didn’t mean anything to the coastals. They don’t have an impact on your lives. But the whole middle of the country have seen their jobs disappear, their factories close and head to Mexico and China, and their standard of living decline.Coastals don’t hear about these issues because they watch CNN, listen to NPR and read the New York Times. Those media outlets don’t discuss how unemployment numbers don’t include people who still haven’t found a job after their unemployment insurance runs out.The media is to blame for this shocking presidential election. They’ve boosted up the American ideal “The Coastal Lifestyle” and ignored the disillusioned and disenfranchised from the Flyover states. Well those people did the one thing no one can take away from them as an American citizen. They voted, and just like Adolf Hitler in Germany they voted for the guy who told them he was going to “Make America Great Again”.But the time for panicking has come and gone. When should you have panicked? It was when your conservative Jewish friend said they were voting for Trump despite the KKK stumping for him! That’s when you should have realized this was always going to happen. If the conservative Jews can get in bed and vote for the same candidate the KKK is voting for that’s when you know we’re up shits creek!!!So many people on Facebook are asking the same question: “What do I tell my child?” You tell them they live in a bubble of diversity and acceptance. It’s a wonderful place to live but it’s a complete fantasy because out there in the Heartland all they see is white."

Richard Burr (R) has apparently survived an unexpectedly tough challenge at the polls on Tuesday, defeating Democratic former state Rep. Deborah Ross.Burr didn’t expect much fight from Ross, who led the North Carolina ACLU for a decade. He got a slow start on his campaign, but is projected to hold on.A loss by Burr, a Republican senator who defended CIA torture and chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee, would have been one of the most remarkable stories of Election Day.But the two-term incumbent ― who also served as one of Donald Trump’s national security advisers ― rode a strongly negative campaign to victory.He tried repeatedly to use Ross’ progressive credentials against her, casting her as a “radical” and tying her to the sorts of unpopular, unpowerful defendants that the ACLU often defends.Ross’ work to stop a life sentence for a 13-year-old mentally disabled African-American defendant was something Burr characterized as defense of a sex offender. He cast Ross’ defense of free speech as support for the Ku Klux Klan. He portrayed her concerns about sex offender registries ― including vigilantism and the unintended identification of sexually abused family members ― as helping predators.That tack apparently succeeded with voters. But Burr had plenty of his own problems to run from. He had pledged to fight for term limits when he first ran, and ended up serving 24 years. News accounts revealed how he jetted around the globe with his wife at the expense of corporations and lobbyists. His reputation for not working very hard was reinforced by news that he missed most hearings while on the Armed Services Committee, many to attend fundraisers.And late in the campaign, it came out that he jokingly said a bull’s-eye should be on Hillary Clinton’s photo on a hunting magazine. He apologized, but not before sparking outrage.The outrage, though, does not appeared to have hurt. Some analysts also believed FBI Director James Comey’s re-opening of the Clinton email probe may have hurt Ross and other Democrats.Burr’s return to the Senate ensures that Clinton will have at least one more senator who has publicly pledged to block her Supreme Court nominees permanently.Democratic insiders can take one lesson from the race. In the conservative Tar Heel State, they nearly won by backing a strongly progressive candidate, even if she wasn’t their first choice. Former North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan turned the party down, as did Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx. But Ross took the plunge. And unlike the recycled, bland candidates Democrats chose elsewhere, sh excited voters and nearly knocked off Burr. It’s a model Democrats might consider for the future."

Can we answer the same after Tuesday night?Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The city of nearly 300,000 people will now fully subsidize preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds in households with incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and provide progressively smaller subsidies to families with earnings above that level. An estimated 6,000 children will benefit from the initiative.Dayton will be increasing income taxes by one-quarter of a percentage point to generate $4.3 million to make preschool more affordable. The city of over 140,000 people will provide income-based preschool tuition assistance to the city’s 1,900 4-year-olds to ensure “universal preschool,” city officials claim.The two ballot measures’ successful passage marks an important achievement for progressive activists, who have increasingly made preschool affordability a policy priority at the state and local level. There is abundant evidence linking early childhood education to the healthy development of children’s brains, advocates note.Ethan Rome, executive director of the Child Care and Early Learning Action Hub, which fought for passage of the two referenda, lauded the outcomes in both Ohio cities.“While candidates for president and all types of elected office talked about the importance of affordable child care on the campaign trail, Ohioans took the issue into their own hands and won game-changing victories that will create a brighter future for thousands of children a year,” Rome said in a statement."

McConnell dodged both questions.“I’m not going to go back and relitigate events of the past,” he said when asked about Trump’s plan for a border wall. “We have a new president. I would like to see him get off on a positive start. I think we should look forward and not backward and kind of rehash and relitigate the various debates we had internally and with the Democrats over the past year.”When pressed about his personal preference, McConnell again demurred.“We’re going to be talking to the president about his agenda,” McConnell said. “Border security is important. I think even our Democratic friends realize we haven’t done a very good job of that. Achieving border security is something that I think ought to be high on the list.”Asked later about what he had to say to undocumented immigrants who might be concerned about their futures, the majority leader once again chose not to answer.“I’m not gonna discuss the immigration issue today,” McConnell said. “We will be discussing that internally with the new administration in the coming months.”Trump has given mixed signals on his plans for immigration reform, but has remained consistent that he wants a wall on the country’s southern border and wants to massively expand deportation infrastructure to target more undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday morning, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Trump is no longer calling for “mass deportation” and that he wanted to kick out “only people who have committed crimes.” In truth, Trump has objected to the words “mass deportation,” but not to the concept of removing a great many people.He has said he would deport criminals but also a large number of other people ― such as those who committed civil offenses like overstaying their visas ― and that others who came into Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s grasp would not be released if they were low-priority, as they sometimes are under President Barack Obama. Trump has said repeatedly that he wants a real, physical wall on the border, one that would go beyond existing fencing, which he has deemed inadequate. His repeated pronouncements that the wall would be a literal one have not stopped some supporters from claiming it wasn’t what Trump actually meant. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) said in July that “you can’t do” a 1,200-mile physical wall, and that it would more likely be a “technological wall” instead. The GOP has already signed on to Trump’s border proposal, at least in part. The official party platform approved at the Republican National Convention this summer calls for a wall along “the entirety of the southern border” that “must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.” "

Despite Bayh's strong reputation, he lost to Republican Rep. Todd Young.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican Congressman Todd Young is projected to win Indiana’s open U.S. Senate seat on Tuesday, defeating Evan Bayh, a Democratic former senator and governor in the Hoosier State. The victory is a disappointing loss for Democrats who had hoped Bayh’s popularity in the state would outweigh Indiana’s otherwise Republican voting tendencies. Bayh led Young in the polls for much of the contentious race.Young, an attorney and retired Marine who ousted a sitting Democrat to win his House seat in 2010, benefited from support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the Hoosier State. Trump won Indiana comfortably ― with a boost from his running mate, Mike Pence, who has served as the state’s governor since 2013.Ultimately, though, Young’s victory is due more to Bayh’s weaknesses than to his or Trump’s strengths. Young and his backers managed to erode Bayh’s early lead by depicting him as a corrupt Washington insider who had lost touch with his Hoosier roots. Bayh’s lucrative post-Senate career, in which he leveraged years of public service for high-paying corporate gigs, provided ample grist for the Republican narrative against him.Bayh struggled to overcome this line of attack since belatedly entering the race in July. At times he even seemed to invite it, such as in August when he misstated the address of his Indianapolis condominium ― suggesting he no longer spent much time in the state. Young takes over for Republican Dan Coats, who announced his retirement in March 2015. As a result of Young’s win, 2017 will be the first year since the late ‘80s that neither Bayh nor Coats has represented Indiana in the Senate. The two politicians traded the seat for years, with Coats first retiring at the end of 1998, Bayh taking over and Coats returning to the seat in 2011 after Bayh retired.Young’s original opponent for the open Senate seat was former Democratic Rep. Baron Hill, the very man Young defeated to win his House seat in the Republican wave of 2010. Hill withdrew his candidacy in July, however, after senior Democrats persuaded Bayh to throw his hat in the ring.It was not a bad bet for Democrats desperate to regain control of the Senate. If any Democrat could win statewide office in Indiana this year, Bayh, heir to a vaunted Hoosier political dynasty, was the man to do it. His father, Birch Bayh, served Indiana in the Senate for decades.He even enjoyed flush finances, entering the race with $10 million in cash left over from his last term in the Senate.But the fact that Bayh’s highly profitable ― and controversial ― work in the private sector since leaving Congress contributed to his defeat may provide a small measure of solace to progressives who only swallowed their disdain for Bayh out of political expediency.Bayh’s liberal critics argue that the veteran Hoosier lawmaker is a uniquely hypocritical personification of special interests’ dominance in the nation’s capital.When Bayh announced his retirement from the Senate in February 2010, he claimed that frustration with partisan gridlock and “entrenched” special interests was behind his decision to move on.As it turns out, Bayh was actually busy plotting his entry into the very world of big-money influence-peddling he had been publicly decrying. A copy of Bayh’s Senate schedule from 2010, which The Associated Press first reported on in October and HuffPost subsequently obtained independently, shows that after announcing his retirement, he held, as the AP put it, “more than four dozen meetings and phone calls with headhunters and future corporate employers.”In his final months in the Senate, Bayh appears to have been working overtime to prove his worth to the titans of finance and big business he was courting. For example, Bayh had a series of meetings with major bank and private equity executives in March 2010.

Todd Young (R) speaks during October's debate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican Congressman Todd Young is projected to win Indiana’s open U.S. Senate seat on Tuesday, defeating Evan Bayh, a Democratic former senator and governor in the Hoosier State. The victory is a disappointing loss for Democrats who had hoped Bayh’s popularity in the state would outweigh Indiana’s otherwise Republican voting tendencies. Bayh led Young in the polls for much of the contentious race.Young, an attorney and retired Marine who ousted a sitting Democrat to win his House seat in 2010, benefited from support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the Hoosier State. Trump won Indiana comfortably ― with a boost from his running mate, Mike Pence, who has served as the state’s governor since 2013.Ultimately, though, Young’s victory is due more to Bayh’s weaknesses than to his or Trump’s strengths. Young and his backers managed to erode Bayh’s early lead by depicting him as a corrupt Washington insider who had lost touch with his Hoosier roots. Bayh’s lucrative post-Senate career, in which he leveraged years of public service for high-paying corporate gigs, provided ample grist for the Republican narrative against him.Bayh struggled to overcome this line of attack since belatedly entering the race in July. At times he even seemed to invite it, such as in August when he misstated the address of his Indianapolis condominium ― suggesting he no longer spent much time in the state. Young takes over for Republican Dan Coats, who announced his retirement in March 2015. As a result of Young’s win, 2017 will be the first year since the late ‘80s that neither Bayh nor Coats has represented Indiana in the Senate. The two politicians traded the seat for years, with Coats first retiring at the end of 1998, Bayh taking over and Coats returning to the seat in 2011 after Bayh retired.Young’s original opponent for the open Senate seat was former Democratic Rep. Baron Hill, the very man Young defeated to win his House seat in the Republican wave of 2010. Hill withdrew his candidacy in July, however, after senior Democrats persuaded Bayh to throw his hat in the ring.It was not a bad bet for Democrats desperate to regain control of the Senate. If any Democrat could win statewide office in Indiana this year, Bayh, heir to a vaunted Hoosier political dynasty, was the man to do it. His father, Birch Bayh, served Indiana in the Senate for decades.He even enjoyed flush finances, entering the race with $10 million in cash left over from his last term in the Senate.But the fact that Bayh’s highly profitable ― and controversial ― work in the private sector since leaving Congress contributed to his defeat may provide a small measure of solace to progressives who only swallowed their disdain for Bayh out of political expediency.Bayh’s liberal critics argue that the veteran Hoosier lawmaker is a uniquely hypocritical personification of special interests’ dominance in the nation’s capital.When Bayh announced his retirement from the Senate in February 2010, he claimed that frustration with partisan gridlock and “entrenched” special interests was behind his decision to move on.As it turns out, Bayh was actually busy plotting his entry into the very world of big-money influence-peddling he had been publicly decrying. A copy of Bayh’s Senate schedule from 2010, which The Associated Press first reported on in October and HuffPost subsequently obtained independently, shows that after announcing his retirement, he held, as the AP put it, “more than four dozen meetings and phone calls with headhunters and future corporate employers.”In his final months in the Senate, Bayh appears to have been working overtime to prove his worth to the titans of finance and big business he was courting. For example, Bayh had a series of meetings with major bank and private equity executives in March 2010. In June, Bayh helped kill legislation that would have narrowed a loophole that allows hedge fund and private equity managers to pay a lower tax rate than many of their lowest-level employees. (Bayh’s campaign notes that in voting for Obamacare in 2009, Bayh helped pass a 3.8 percent tax hike on investment income, which was in the legislation.)He later helped weaken a provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law using language proposed by financial behemoths like Apollo Global Management, where Bayh ultimately landed one of his plum post-Senate gigs.Bayh’s subsequent work as a well-paid senior adviser for Apollo is now the subject of additional scrutiny.

It was the day her daughter, Janelle, was born, but it was also the day when something precious to her was stolen.Antoine, of Orlando, Florida, was experiencing contractions that were 20 minutes apart when she decided about 10:30 a.m. to take a walk in hopes her water would break.While she was walking, she came across a young man.“I just looked at him and smiled, and then he had something in his hand,” she told Orlando station WKMG-TV. “He was smoking, and he kind of threw it out and he just lunged at me.”Antoine said the unidentified man grabbed a gold necklace worth $1,500 off her neck, a gift she’d been given 10 years ago for her birthday. He put it in his pocket and walked away, she said.“Who robs a pregnant woman?” she told the TV station.Antoine said she was shocked.“When he snatched the chain, he put it in his pocket and proceeded to walk past me like nothing happened,” she told Fox 35 Orlando. “I was like, ‘What did you do that for?’ and I’m thinking in my mind, ‘What just happened? Did this really happen?’”Antoine said she then took out her phone and told the thief she was calling the police. That’s when he ran back toward her, but she then ran into the road as she phoned for help. The robber then ran off, she told the Fox 35 TV station.“I was like, if he punches me and I fall down and I’m on my due date, I don’t want anything to happen to the baby,” she told WKMG-TV. “I already carried this baby for nine months. I’m not going to let something happen to her.”When help arrived, Antoine was rushed to the hospital, where she gave birth about 5:30 p.m., according to the Palm Beach Post.She didn’t get the necklace back. “What hurts the most is that I know he most likely sold it for next to nothing if he did get it sold,” she told Fox 35.She filed a report with the Orange County Sheriff’s Department, which released this sketch of the robber on Monday.Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Line at 800-423-TIPS."

Tuesday, as Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto defeated Republican Joe Heck. Masto’s victory makes her the first Latina senator.Reid’s Nevada seat appeared to be the only one in the Senate that Republicans had a good chance of flipping on Election Day. Cortez Masto and Heck were neck and neck in the polls as voters cast their ballots on Tuesday, with Cortez Masto holding a narrow advantage after early voting.The race was one of a half-dozen or so that would ultimately decide whether Republicans retain their majority in the Senate. Heck, a three-term Republican congressman, struggled to keep himself at arm’s length from Donald Trump, the most unpopular presidential candidate in modern history.After audio emerged of Trump bragging about sexual assault, Heck announced that he no longer planned to vote for the real estate businessman. “My wife, my daughters, my mom, my sister and all women deserve better. All Americans deserve better,” Heck said.The blowback from rank-and-file Republicans was fierce, and Heck later cast himself as an undecided voter who was certain not to vote for Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton. He then described Trump as someone who’d make a good commander-in-chief, but wouldn’t clarify how he planned to vote.Trump’s high unfavorable ratings, and a string of sexual assault allegations, appeared to take a toll on Heck in the weeks leading up to the election, as the Republican’s support slipped among crucial independent voters. And in a year in which many voters wanted a shakeup in Washington, D.C., many saw Heck as an establishment candidate complicit in Beltway gridlock.Cortez Masto, a former attorney general of Nevada and the daughter of a Mexican immigrant, got a boost from some big names in the run-up to the election. Nevada’s significance in the presidential race and the Senate’s power balance brought both Clinton and President Barack Obama to the state days before ballots were cast. After being introduced by Cortez Masto at an October rally, Obama cast the race as a choice between electing the first Latina senator, “who believes everyone deserves a chance,” or someone who waffled over supporting Trump. “What the heck?” Obama asked.Democrats tried to give Clinton and Cortez Masto an edge by running up early-voting numbers that would put Trump and Heck in a hole they couldn’t climb out of. A week out from the election, voting data according to party affiliation showed a significant advantage for Democrats in the crucial Clark County, surrounding Las Vegas. In particular, Democrats were eager to turn out Latino voters who’d be repulsed by Trump’s xenophobia and excited to send the first Latina senator to Washington.The Senate race was a major test for the Nevada political machine built by Reid, who is stepping down after 30 years in the upper chamber and was intent on leaving it in Democratic control. “I am going to do everything I can do to prevail, to help her prevail,” Reid said in the spring."

The Philadelphia suburbs, in particular, could go a long way to determining who takes the Keystone State haul of Electoral College votes.Voters supporting Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at polling places up and down Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, seemed resigned to their candidate losing on the final day of the 2016 presidential campaign.Clarke and Cyndy Remmey cast their votes for Trump at a municipal building in their hometown of Doylestown, the county seat, Tuesday morning, taking turns as one went inside and the other stayed outside with their puppy. Both think Democratic nominee HIllary Clinton will be the next president.“I voted for Trump, but I don’t vote for him enthusiastically,” Clarke Remmey said. “The person I voted for, I don’t want them to be president.” But he considers both candidates unsuited for the highest office and believes Clinton to be dishonest.Clarke Remmey is still expecting a Clinton win, however. He voted for Republican Sen. Pat Toomey and Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican vying to replace his older brother, retiring Rep. Michael Fitzpatrick (R). He said he hopes that divided government will force Clinton and the GOP Congress to compromise on a “pro-growth” agenda that combines corporate tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending.Cyndy Remmey also voted for the Republican candidates, and is just glad this negative election soon will be over. We need the conversation to change in our house,” she said. “There’s not much else talked about,” between the couple and their children, ages 14 and 20.At the same polling location, Dawn Keeley of Doylestown also felt relieved to have voted. “I’ll be glad that it’s over. I think everybody’s anxious,” Keeley said. Keeley voted for Trump, mainly citing her desire for lower taxes, but didn’t have much good to say about him or Clinton. “I didn’t like either option. It felt like the lesser of two evils,” she said. Clinton, she said, is likely to defeat Trump.Some voters chose Trump mainly because they dislike Clinton, including Pat Anderson of Morrisville, whose first choice would have been Vice President Joe Biden. “I’d love to have seen a woman president, but can my children and grandchildren look up to her? No,” she said. “I don’t want to put a crook in the White House.” Nevertheless, she predicted Trump would lose.At a voting location in Quakertown, Trump supporter Mark Altorgge seemed resigned to a Clinton victory. “Either way, the country will go on,” he said.Whatever level of enthusiasm or optimism Trump and Clinton voters in Bucks County may have felt on Tuesday, their ballots could prove highly consequential. According to the HuffPost Pollster average of opinion surveys, Clinton was had 45.5 percent to Trump’s 41.4 percent ahead of voting Tuesday.The tally in suburban counties like Bucks could give either candidate an edge statewide, and offset the overwhelmingly Democratic support expected in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.With most states clearly leaning toward one candidate or the other, Pennsylvania is a major target for both campaigns, as evidenced by Clinton and Trump each staging events in the state Monday. Democrats have won Pennsylvania in every presidential election since Bill Clinton captured the state in 1992, in large measure on the strength of the vote in Philadelphia and its surrounding counties. Bucks County itself has gone to the Democratic presidential candidate in each of same contests.But the presidential results in Bucks County don’t mean it’s a Democratic stronghold. The 8th Congressional District, which includes all of Bucks County and a sliver of neighboring Montgomery County, has only been represented by a Democrat in the House for 18 years of the last 101 years.In the end, supporting the GOP was more important to Donna Harvey of Quakertown than the candidate himself, who’s made her uncomfortable at times. That’s despite her anger at establishment Republicans, who she feels didn’t show Trump enough support. “The Republicans who didn’t stand behind him have a lot to answer for,” she said.“I believe in most of what he says. I just don’t like the way he says it,” Harvey said. “He has said things at times that were too impulsive.” Still, his stance on issues like abortion, gun rights and the Supreme Court guided her vote. Harvey wasn’t sure who would win. In Morrisville, Alena Dlin, an immigrant from Belarus, cast her first-ever vote as an American citizen for Trump. “It felt great. I felt like I fulfilled my civic duty,” she said.Still, Dlin acknowledged being torn. “It was a long and painful battle with myself,” she said.“I actually think that we as a country should have found better candidates on both sides. But I had to make peace with the choice there is.”Dlin was turned off by Trump’s interruptions of Clinton during the debates, dislikes how he insults entire classes of people, and said she believes most of the accusations women have made about the GOP nominee.But she decided to set aside the negative attributes of each candidates’ personality and chose between them based on what issues were most important to her. Dlin doesn’t want Clinton to continue President Barack Obama’s economic policies and thinks a new approach to health care reform is needed because the Affordable Care Act didn’t do enough to make care more affordable, she said.And Dlin looks to Europe’s struggles with refugees from the Syrian civil war and favors Trump’s plan to bar Muslim immigrants from entering the United States.Even so, Dlin had little confidence Trump could win over enough Americans to take the White House: “We are not ready for him as a country.”CORRECTION: An earlier version incorrectly described the geographic makeup of Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional District. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Six other precincts will have their hours extended based on exactly how many minutes voters were unable to cast ballots. The Cole Mill and Bethesda Ruritan precincts received 60-minute extensions. Creekside Elementary School and Glenn Elementary School precincts received an extra 45 minutes, Forest Hills Clubhouse and Greater Emmanuel Temple of Grace received an extra 30 minutes, McMannen United Methodist Church received 25 minutes, and Neal Middle School will stay open just 20 minutes longer.After check-in machines at some polling sites in Durham County experienced glitches earlier on Tuesday, the board of elections ordered the county to transition to paper poll books for voter check-in. As the board noted, the electronic malfunction caused a delay with voter check-in, not with the ballots themselves, since all voters in Durham vote by paper ballot.The glitches caused concerns throughout the county ― especially after the Bethesda Ruritan club precinct ran out of authorization-to-vote forms and had to delay voting for a short period of time. Robby Mook, the campaign manager for Hillary for America, urged the state board of elections to extend voting hours. North Carolina’s NAACP also called on the county to fix the problem and extend hours.“We demand that they fix this glitch,” said Rev. Dr. William Barber, president of North Carolina NAACP, in a statement. “There were no glitches in early voting. Why now and why in a heavy black voting area?”Thirty-seven percent of Durham County’s registered voters are black, according to CNN. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a voting rights advocacy group, said in a press call on Tuesday morning that it had received calls from voters who feared there may not be enough paper ballots and that some voters were receiving provisional ballots.But Samuel Gedman, the deputy director of elections for Durham County, said that won’t be an issue. “There’s an emergency paper process that we can go to in case there’s a power outage or some other problem with the building,” Gedman told The Huffington Post. “What we didn’t anticipate was going for the full day. What we’re doing now is just running supplies to make sure they have enough paper material to last them through the day.”Voting rights group Democracy North Carolina filed a lawsuit in Wake County asking a state judge to take these delays into account and keep polling precincts open in at least five locations until 9 p.m. The lawsuit alleged that “many voters will lose their right to vote in this election” if the state board of elections is not compelled to extend voting hours until that time.The court in Wake County denied the request to extend voting hours later Tuesday evening. In a statement, Allison Riggs, an attorney who helped bring the lawsuit, lamented the ruling.“There is no good reason to close these polling places without giving people who were turned away the ability to return and cast their vote,” she said. “It is unacceptable to have Election Day ruined by technical problems.”Julia Craven reported from Durham. Cristian Farias reported from New York."

He gave a victory speech Wednesday morning after the tight race for the state’s highest office. “This has been an extremely hard fought race, but the people of North Carolina have spoken and they have chose a change in leadership,” Cooper said in a statement. “We are confident once the results are certified we will confirm tonight’s victory.” McCrory, however, refused to concede, saying that the race was too close. He also said the final decision wouldn’t be delivered until Nov. 18, after provisional ballots had been counted. “The race is not over in North Carolina,” he said on Wednesday morning. “We’re going to check everything. We are going to make sure every vote counts in North Carolina.”All precincts in the state have reported their results, and unofficial tallies have the two candidates tied at 49 percent.North Carolina was a key battleground state in 2016, and went to Donald Trump on election night. Throughout the gubernatorial race, Cooper often polled higher than McCrory, who is the first Republican governor to lead the state in 20 years.McCrory’s time in office has been marked by his signing into law some of the nation’s most controversial legislation. Shortly after he took office in 2013, McCrory repealed the Racial Justice Act of 2009, which allowed inmates on death row to appeal death sentences that were sought or imposed on the basis of race. He reasoned that it “created a judicial loophole to avoid the death penalty and not a path to justice.” That July, McCrory ended unemployment benefits for tens of thousands of people and signed a bill mandating that abortion clinics meet the same standards as surgical centers. McCrory signed one of the nation’s strictest voter ID requirements into law in August 2013. The law was struck down by a federal appeals court in July after three judges determined that GOP lawmakers had chosen to implement specific ID requirements ― as well as to reduce the number of early voting days and to change registration procedures ― in order to keep black voters from the polls. In March, McCrory signed HB 2. The law prevented local governments from passing any anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay and transgender people, and mandated that individuals can only use restrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. The bill, which is one of the most far-reaching in the country, has caused the state to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.Weeks later, McCrory signed an executive order widening the law to include protections for sexual orientation and gender identity. The order did not reverse the bathroom portion of the bill. McCrory also signed a bill in July that removed police camera footage from the public record. Cooper’s time as the state’s top attorney has required him to defend laws signed by McCrory even if he didn’t agree with them. But on several occasions, Cooper has chosen not to do so. He urged McCrory to not sign the voter ID bill in 2013 and flat-out refused to defend North Carolina’s same-sex marriage ban the following year. Cooper has also spoken out against the law removing police footage from the public record. "

The Associated Press and NBC also said Bennet would win.Bennet’s victory marks the end of a campaign against an unconventional opponent in Republican rival Darryl Glenn, a relatively unknown candidate who won the primary in June despite lagging well behind a crowd of better-known rivals in both funding and establishment support.“My name is Darryl Glenn,” he told the crowd at the state GOP convention in April, introducing himself to most of them for the first time, “and I’m an unapologetic Christian-Constitutional-conservative-pro-life-Second-Amendment-loving American.”Glenn’s funding gap persisted into the general election: He entered the race with just under $60,000 on hand, compared with Bennet’s $6 million.The Bennet camp deployed that cash on positive ads promoting their candidate’s bipartisan record in the Senate, running up a consistent, double-digit polling lead throughout the summer:Glenn countered by attacking Bennet on national security issues like the senator’s support for the Iran deal, and attempted to portray him as a “typical Washington insider.”He also picked up endorsements from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ― who was heavily favored by Colorado Republicans over Donald Trump ― along with the early backing of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a far-right group.While Glenn substantially increased his fundraising efforts later in the campaign, even with a late, $800,000 ad-buy on his behalf by Restoration PAC, a conservative super PAC, he struggled to shake the perception ― emphasized by Democrats ― that he was “too extreme.”Glenn’s actions on the campaign trail reinforced that narrative.In September, he accused The Denver Post of a “smear campaign,” then cut off all communication with the paper, after it reported on inconsistencies in the candidate’s explanations for an assault charge that was filed against him in 1983. (The charge was later dropped.)Glenn cited the story as reason enough to decline to participate in more than one televised debate, because one of the additional debates would have been moderated by The Denver Post, the state’s largest paper.Later that month, still down by double digits, Glenn told The Durango Herald he “took it as a complement” that the Republican National Committee and other national Republican groups hadn’t extended him financial support. “They know I can beat Michael Bennet on my own,” he explained.“If national Republicans thought Darryl Glenn had a snowball’s chance, they’d be bringing money into Colorado by the truckload,” Colorado political analyst Eric Sondermann said at the time, noting Glenn suffers from either “non-credible spin, or willful self-delusion.”After a late October CBS/YouGov poll indicated Glenn had closed the polling gap to just a five-point deficit, the Bennet campaign went all-in on Glenn as an unapologetically hard-right “fringe” candidate.“What do you really know about Darryl Glenn?” A Nov. 2nd spot asked viewers, rhetorically, before proceeding to spell it out:“Darryl Glenn doesn’t believe in climate change. He’s for eliminating the Department of Education. And Glenn wants to outlaw abortion even in cases of rape and incest.”The ad closed with a clip of Glenn, who has said he would refuse to work across the aisle if elected. “I’m running against Democrats,” he says in the video. “I’m running against evil.”"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ― who was heavily favored by Colorado Republicans over Donald Trump ― along with the early backing of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a far-right group.While Glenn substantially increased his fundraising efforts later in the campaign, even with a late, $800,000 ad-buy on his behalf by Restoration PAC, a conservative super PAC, he struggled to shake the perception ― emphasized by Democrats ― that he was “too extreme.”Glenn’s actions on the campaign trail reinforced that narrative.In September, he accused The Denver Post of a “smear campaign,” then cut off all communication with the paper, after it reported on inconsistencies in the candidate’s explanations for an assault charge that was filed against him in 1983. (The charge was later dropped.)Glenn cited the story as reason enough to decline to participate in more than one televised debate, because one of the additional debates would have been moderated by The Denver Post, the state’s largest paper.Later that month, still down by double digits, Glenn told The Durango Herald he “took it as a complement” that the Republican National Committee and other national Republican groups hadn’t extended him financial support. “They know I can beat Michael Bennet on my own,” he explained.“If national Republicans thought Darryl Glenn had a snowball’s chance, they’d be bringing money into Colorado by the truckload,” Colorado political analyst Eric Sondermann said at the time, noting Glenn suffers from either “non-credible spin, or willful self-delusion.”After a late October CBS/YouGov poll indicated Glenn had closed the polling gap to just a five-point deficit, the Bennet campaign went all-in on Glenn as an unapologetically hard-right “fringe” candidate.“What do you really know about Darryl Glenn?” A Nov. 2nd spot asked viewers, rhetorically, before proceeding to spell it out:“Darryl Glenn doesn’t believe in climate change. He’s for eliminating the Department of Education. And Glenn wants to outlaw abortion even in cases of rape and incest.”The ad closed with a clip of Glenn, who has said he would refuse to work across the aisle if elected. “I’m running against Democrats,” he says in the video. “I’m running against evil.”"

EMILY’s List, the women’s political action committee, endorsed Edwards and accused Van Hollen of going after its donors. In October, Van Hollen was leading in polls by nearly 30 points in his matchup with Szeliga. Van Hollen served four years in the Maryland House of Delegates and eight years in the Maryland Senate before being elected to the U.S. House in 2002. He’s been a trusted ally of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who appointed him to recruit Democratic candidates in 2006 and lead House campaign efforts for the next two elections. He now serves as the Democrats’ top member on the Budget Committee.The father of three currently represents Maryland’s 8th District, which extends from Montgomery County, directly north of Washington, to the Pennsylvania border.With Van Hollen’s win, Maryland, a heavily blue state, will have its first all-male congressional delegation since 1973. He will be serving alongside a fellow Democrat, Sen. Ben Cardin."
28,POLITICS,Women No Longer Have To Pick Between A Paycheck And Escaping Abuse In These 2 States,Melissa Jeltsen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paid-safe-leave_us_58239673e4b0d9ce6fc0a934,Some good news out of Tuesday's election.,2016-11-09,Voters approved two ballot measures that would allow domestic violence victims paid leave to attend to their safety needs.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58239a32180000290030d09c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s a lose-lose situation: If you’re a victim of domestic violence, you’re likely to have to skip work on short notice ― to seek medical attention, to talk to police and prosecutors, or even to relocate for your own safety. But missing work means losing money, or even worse, your job, at a time when financial independence is key. Victims in Arizona and Washington may not have to worry about that anymore. On Tuesday, voters in both states approved ballot measures that require employers to offer paid sick leave and paid “safe leave” to workers, as well as raise the minimum wage.While most people understand the concept of paid sick leave, which allows employees to take time off when they’re ill without cutting into their paychecks, the idea behind paid safe leave is less widely known. In essence, it allows victims of domestic violence, stalking and sexual assault to take paid time off if they need to access services related to the abuse they suffered. Arizona and Washington will join five states ― California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon and Vermont ― and Washington, D.C., which already have laws requiring employers to provide paid safe leave to employees if they are victims of domestic violence. A growing number of municipalities and counties also offer paid time off for victims. New York City may soon follow. Ellen Bravo, executive director at Family Values @ Work, a network of state coalitions working to enact paid sick leave, said it makes sense to pair sick leave with safe leave. “The purpose of paid sick leave is that it’s a job measure. It helps people stay employed,” she said. “If a person is experiencing violence, that’s a time when they most need economic security so they can either get away or take another step to safeguard themselves.”Kelly Starr, managing director of Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence, applauded the measure’s passage in her state.“We envision a world where people make choices about their relationship based on what’s best for them and their children, not based on the financial impact of those decisions,” she said. “This gets us one step closer to that vision.”Both raising the minimum wage and requiring paid safe leave is equally important for survivors of violence, Starr said.“We just know how closely access to money is tried to people’s safety and stability,” she said. One of the main reasons people remain or return to abusive partners is financial insecurity, she added.Shannon Rich, director of public policy at the Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, said survivors in her state will no longer have to make the difficult choice between lost wages and accessing critical services. Medical treatment, counseling and legal services all equal “time away from work that puts survivors at risk of loss wages or loss employment,” she said. “When survivors have access to workplace resources that help them build economic resiliency, they and their families are more likely to remain safe.”Domestic violence costs the U.S. at least $8 billion a year in lost productivity and health care costs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and victims report an average of 7.2 days of work-related lost productivity per year due to abuse.______Need help?

Although little else has shifted in Denham’s Central Valley district, this year Democrats succeeded in flipping the voter registration advantage in their favor and mobilizing more Latinos.In the final months, political trackers moved Denham’s race from “leaning Republican” to “tossup” ― and Democratic polling found Eggman leading by 1 point.“Nothing changed in this district,” Mike Dunbar, editor of The Modesto Bee’s opinion page, told The Huffington Post in October. “The only thing that changed is Donald Trump is running for president.”The Bee didn’t endorse Denham this year, after backing him in his previous elections."

So many of them woke up on Tuesday eager to see history in the making: Generations of women flocked to the voting booths, ready to see the first woman elected to the Oval Office. (Though of course, as we now know, there were many women less ready, who helped hand victory to Trump.)It wasn’t to be. Little girls across the country went to bed in tears or woke to the news: Instead of making history, Americans elected a man with a track record of demeaning women. It would be another kind of historic moment, far more terrifying to women.Talking to our daughters about this has not been easy, but Clinton’s message was of hope.“I know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling,” Clinton said on Wednesday. “But someday someone will and sooner than we might expect.”This was the second concession speech in which Clinton referenced that damn ceiling.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) held on to his Senate seat Tuesday, a major win in a race that was widely projected to go to Democrats. Johnson defeated progressive favorite Russ Feingold, who lost the seat to Johnson in 2010. Feingold consistently led in the polls throughout the race, and Democrats saw it as one of their best opportunities to take a seat back from Republicans. “I really wanted to get this done, but obviously something is happening in this country tonight,” Feingold said at his party with supporters Tuesday night. “I don’t understand it completely. I don’t think anybody does, but we as Americans have to do the best we can to deal with the pain in this country and get people to come together.”Re-electing Feingold was also a top priority for progressives, who saw him as one of their top champions when he was in the Senate. He was the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act and the only Democratic senator to oppose former President Bill Clinton’s 1994 crime bill. He also voted against the Iraq War. But in the weeks before Election Day, the race began to tighten. Conservative groups backed by the Koch brothers threw millions of dollars more into the Wisconsin race in the final days and national Republicans boosted Johnson.The race took on a personal tone, with Johnson calling Feingold “hypocritical” and “phony,” and saying he had no respect for him.Johnson, like many GOP candidates, also struggled to deal with the Donald Trump effect. He supported the GOP presidential nominee, but tried to distinguish that support from an endorsement.“I made two promises to Wisconsinites ― to always tell them the truth, and to never vote with my re-election in mind ― and I am honored that they have shown their faith in me for a second and final term,” Johnson said in a statement. “Together, we can find areas of agreement to take on Washington dysfunction and grow our economy, protect our national security, and fix our country’s problems.”This piece was updated with comments from Feingold and Johnson."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582362ea1800002e00503166.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Shares of U.S. oil and gas companies spiked Wednesday after Donald Trump won the presidency, but the biggest winner seems to be the ailing coal industry.Oil giants BP, Chevron and Exxon Mobil made modest gains of less than 1 percent. But stock in bankrupt Peabody Energy, the world’s largest privately owned coal company, skyrocketed over 47 percent. ConocoPhillips, a Houston-based oil giant specialized extracting gas from coal seams, climbed nearly 3 percent. Trump vowed in May to revitalize a coal industry that had all but collapsed amid a series of ill-timed bets on Chinese demand and competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. Like Peabody, Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Patriot Coal have filed for bankruptcy in recent months.The president-elect, who has denounced scientific evidence of climate change as a “hoax,” said he plans to scrap President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, his signature effort to combat global warming. The plan, stalled since February by court challenges, would have empowered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to force utility companies to slash emissions.In an ironic twist, hope for a resurgence of the world’s dirtiest fossil fuels comes as world leaders are gathered in Marrakech, Morocco, for the 22nd Conference of the Parties. Last year, the climate conference yielded the historic Paris accord, in which 180 countries agreed to curb greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to avoid the worst effects from global warming. The treaty, which Trump threatened during his campaign to unravel, went into effect last Friday. The solar industry suffered a major rout on Wednesday. SolarCity, the Elon Musk-led solar installer looking to merge with Tesla later this month, plunged nearly 6 percent. First Solar Inc. fell about 3 percent. SunPower Corporation plummeted almost 15 percent. Trump has repeatedly slammed energy produced from renewable sources as too expensive and complained that wind turbines kill eagles. In fact, the price of clean energy has fallen drastically over the last eight years, and the renewable energy industries are producing more jobs than oil or gas. “Let me tell you: The miners in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, which was so great to me last week and Ohio and all over, they’re going to start to work again, believe me,” Trump said at a rally earlier this year. “You’re going to be proud again to be miners.”Part of Trump’s appeal to struggling coal miners in Appalachian states stemmed from his accusation that Obama had waged a so-called war on coal. But the industry has been contracting for decades, including under Republican presidents. In 1985, coal employed 177,000 people. By the end of 2008, that number had fallen to just 86,000. Now it’s just about 56,000."

The initiative in South Dakota won while the initiative in Washington lost.Josh Silver, CEO of Represent.Us, the lead national reform group supporting the initiatives, called them “the most transformative money in politics reforms” in the country and hailed the passage of the South Dakota initiative as having “happened because progressives and conservatives led the charge.”Represent.Us supported the two initiatives and empowered local groups and actors on the ground. In Washington, the unsuccessful campaign to pass I-1464 was led by a bipartisan coalition called Integrity Washington. The Yes on 22 campaign in South Dakota also featured bipartisan support and was chaired by a Republican ex-state senator and a Democratic former state representative.The initiative language was packaged to attract this bipartisan consensus. This included tying together public campaign financing with strong lobbying and ethics reforms and transparency rules.It also involved tailoring the public campaign finance system to make it more amenable to conservatives. The South Dakota initiative will create a system of “democracy vouchers,” providing each registered voter with a certain number of $50 credits to use as campaign contributions to candidates who choose to participate in the publicly funded system. Voters in Seattle approved a ballot initiative that created such a system for the city’s elections in 2015.The campaign overcame strong opposition from Americans for Prosperity, the main political arm of the billionaire Koch brothers, to win in a conservative Republican state.“Voters are sick and tired and want to embrace solutions,” said David Donnelly, CEO of the pro-reform group Every Voice, which also supported the initiatives.These weren’t the only campaign finance or lobbying reforms on the ballot on Tuesday. Voters in Howard County, Maryland, and Berkeley, California, approved the creation of a small-donor public financing system. In San Francisco, voters enacted an initiative to implement new lobbying and ethics rules. In Missouri, voters passed an initiative to reinstate campaign contributions limits. And in California and Washington state voters passed referendums calling for the overturn of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision."

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) coasted to re-election Tuesday, defeating former Lt. Gov. Patty Judge for a seventh term in the upper chamber. Grassley, 83, drew the ire of Democrats and a fair number of independents earlier this year when, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he refused to hold hearings on President Barack Obama’s U.S. Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. Though Grassley hadn’t faced a competitive election since he first gained his Senate seat in 1980, Democrats had hoped that his association with Garland’s stalled nomination would lead voters in the Hawkeye State to abandon the veteran lawmaker. Moreover, Democrats hoped that Judge’s name recognition in the state, where she also served as agriculture secretary, would make her a formidable challenger. For Judge, the moment that pushed her “over the edge,” she told The Huffington Post, was when Grassley said he was holding up the Supreme Court nomination for the benefit of his Iowa constituents, “that he was doing it for us. That was enough. Time to stop that.”Like so much else this election cycle, the controversy surrounding Garland’s nomination was drowned out by the unprecedented bluster and controversy of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Judge’s campaign tried to shift focus to Grassley’s support of Trump, but Grassley’s longstanding ties to Iowa plus Trump’s deep support in the state made it a much less potent narrative for Judge. “Chuck Grassley’s refusal to condemn Donald Trump’s candidacy following the revelation of Trump’s disgusting statements about sexual assault is pathetic,” Judge said in a news release.Grassley, for his part, offered only tepid support for Trump. “You stop to think, there’s only a few saints who have been president of the United States,” he told reporters after video surfaced of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. Grassley’s role in determining the next Supreme Court justice will depend heavily on whether the GOP retains its control of the Senate. The Senate Judiciary Committee’s ranking member, Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy, has repeatedly called on Grassley to hold hearings on Garland’s nomination. However, Grassley has waffled over whether he is open to holding a lame-duck hearing for Garland, and if Hillary Clinton wins the White House and the Democrats retake control of the Senate, Republicans in the upper chamber may prefer to confirm Garland rather than risk a more liberal nominee from Clinton. “You know, they asked me to speculate, and I shouldn’t speculate because who knows what is going to happen after the election. My position has not changed. The new president should make the appointment,” Grassley told reporters in September.Judge’s loss will likely lead to a fair amount of soul-searching within Iowa’s Democratic circles. Judge was viewed with skepticism by some activists in the state who took issue with her record on the environment and unions, but she was the favorite of many Democratic officials, who viewed Judge’s less-well-known primary opponents, such as state Sen. Rob Hogg, as not having the name recognition necessary to take on Grassley.CORRECTION: An earlier version had the wrong number of terms Grassley has served."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).“Once a century a generation is called on to restore American democracy. Today our generation is called,” Teachout said in a concession statement Tuesday night. “And if there’s one thing I learned on the campaign trail ― it is that we are more than brave enough and more than smart enough to take our democracy back. This is our moment. We may have lost this race, but we’re not going away.”Teachout drew fierce financial opposition from three billionaires, turning the race into a microcosm of her critique of post-Citizens United politics. Hedge fund kingpins Robert Mercer and Paul Singer each poured at least $500,000 into a super PAC devoted to defeating Teachout, a tremendous sum for a single House race.Teachout’s fundraising brought in more than $1.6 million, relying on smaller donors who made an average contribution of $19. Informed by her academic study of U.S. political corruption, Teachout advocated public financing of elections and the repeal of Citizens United, while her economic platform called for breaking up big cable companies, forcing banks to lend to small businesses, and raising taxes on hedge fund magnates.In a speech to supporters late Tuesday night, she invoked the legacy of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.Faso is a former state assemblyman who made an unsuccessful bid for governor in 2006 against Eliot Spitzer. He eventually joined the law firm Manatt Phelps & Phillips as a lobbyist, where he was entangled in an ethics scandal involving New York state pension funds. The firm paid $550,000 in 2010 in a settlement that cited a meeting Faso arranged between an investment client and a state retirement fund.Faso attacked Teachout during the campaign as a tax-hiking purveyor of a “crazy liberal agenda,” and vowed to cut government spending and the national debt. The National Republican Congressional Committee ran an ad on behalf of Faso that dismissed Teachout as a “zany professor” in the Sanders mold.Teachout didn’t exactly hide her association with Sanders, who appeared at a rally on her behalf in September and helped to raise funds for her campaign. “This is about whether or not super PACs and big money can buy a seat in Congress to protect their profits, or if a grassroots movement will succeed,” Sanders wrote in an email to Teachout supporters last week. “These billionaires know that [Teachout] will fight in Congress to take on corruption, stop bad trade deals, and fight for working people.”New York’s 19th District went for President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012, but its largely rural, white and working class electorate has been represented by Republican Chris Gibson since 2013.Teachout’s full concession statement is below:I am so incredibly proud of this campaign. We gave the billionaires trying to buy our elections a real run for their money-faceless men, cowards who spent $6.7 million to shut us up-but we barked back with an average contribution of $19. It’s because of the parents, teachers, veterans, farmers, and small business owners in the 19th Congressional District that this race was as close as it is. We showed them that we the people will not be dictated to, and our fight continues. Once a century a generation is called on to restore American democracy. Today our generation is called. And if there’s one thing I learned on the campaign trail – it is that we are more than brave enough and more than smart enough to take our democracy back. This is our moment. We may have lost this race, but we’re not going away. We can still stop the TPP. We can still stop the AT&T merger. We can and must organize to overturn Citizens United. We are the unique threat they fear.This post has been updated with Teachout’s concession statement."

Aside from the initial panic that Trump’s win sparked in the global markets (which has since leveled off), it appears that stock traders ― like many others ― were assuming Hillary Clinton would win the election. The traders banked on a reactive rush to buy guns as alarms were raised about hypothetical gun control measures under a Democratic administration.“The No. 1 driver of firearms sales is fear,” Brian Ruttenbur, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, explained last year. “Primarily, fear of registration restrictions, banning and things like that.”With the election of a candidate backed by the National Rifle Association, that kind of fear is less likely to be whipped up.“The stocks are selling off because Donald Trump is a solid gun rights supporter and there are no longer worries about new gun control laws that Hillary Clinton could have pursued,” Chris Krueger, an analyst at Lake Street Capital Markets LLC, told HuffPost. “This means that there likely will not be a surge in sales at firearms retailers in the coming months and that the industry can return to a more normalized growth rate.”“Heading into the election, the two stocks were trading up partly on the thought that a Clinton election would lead to several months of increased sales,” Krueger said. “Long-term, Trump’s election is good for the industry.”Or as gun safety advocate Mark Kelly told HuffPost earlier this year, “[Trump] has said over and over again that he’s supported by the NRA, that he’s the strongest Second Amendment advocate anybody’s ever seen. I’m pretty sure he would not stand up to the gun lobby in any way, shape or form.”Kelly leads Americans for Responsible Solutions along with his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.).In the past, gun sales ― and, correspondingly, gun manufacturers’ stocks ― have leaped in response to calls for gun control or to events likely to drive calls for gun control.This past June, gun shares rose sharply after a shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killed dozens of people.

Eight fire engines, five specialist rescue units and more than 70 firefighters attended the scene using heavy cutting equipment to free those trapped.Television pictures showed the tram lying on its side across the tracks not far from the Sandilands stop near a junction where the line divides. Police said investigations were ongoing into the cause of the accident which took place in heavy rain.Local resident Hannah Collier, 23, told local media she had seen very seriously injured casualties being taken away on stretchers.“I was in bed watching the election when I heard a massive crash at about 6:15 am, which I thought was the wind,” she said. “Then I heard people shouting and then the emergency services arriving.”Prime Minister Theresa May said her thoughts and prayers were with those affected by “this terrible incident.”Wednesday’s incident was the greatest loss of life in a British rail accident since seven people were killed and 70 injured when a high-speed train from London came off the tracks at Potters Bar station north of the capital in 2002."

But they tried to remain positive.“It’s clear that Donald Trump is about to be one of the most powerful people in the world, but even he does not have the power to amend and change the laws of physics, to stop the impacts of climate change,” said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union for Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy group based in the U.S., at a press conference held shortly after the election was called early Wednesday. “He has to acknowledge the reality of climate change, he has a responsibility as president-elect now.”The U.S. presidential election results came as a surprise to many who on Tuesday thought Hillary Clinton would be elected and plans to continue the Obama administration’s work on climate change would make press conferences a relative non-event. But Trump’s name is on everyone’s lips as many wonder where America will stand in future negotiations.Some groups have not been as diplomatic.“The election of Trump is a disaster for our continent,” Geoffrey Kamese, a senior program officer for the group Friends of the Earth Africa, said in a statement. “The United States, if it follows through on its new president’s rash words about withdrawing from the international climate regime, will become a pariah state in global efforts for climate action.”The U.S. delegation had previously planned to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the amount released in 2005, by between 26 and 28 percent by 2025. The prospect of a presidency helmed by Trump, who has said that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, throws that into question. He has threatened to ignore those pledges and leave the Paris deal, end all funding on the issue, appoint climate deniers to lead major government agencies and roll back President Barack Obama’s sweeping environmental legacy. His election won’t help the fight against climate change.The previous climate pact, the Kyoto Protocol, failed to meaningfully address climate change because the United States backed out, a move that set back climate change progress two decades.But climate advocates tried to spin the fallout from Trump’s election positively, arguing that other nations aren’t likely to wait for the U.S. ― the world’s second largest polluter ― to take action.“Other major countries in this process will continue to go ahead with the climate commitments that they have made under Paris, not because they’re trying to please the United States, but because it’s in their own self interest to protect their people from the impacts of climate change,” Meyer said. However, he continued to note inaction on behalf of America could certainly impact other international negotiations.Katherine Egland, chairman of environmental and climate justice for the NAACP, stressed that for the Paris Agreement to succeed, “no one country can be perceived as not doing its fair share.”“We remain a nation of honor ― our word is our bond,” she said. “We have signed a binding agreement along with scores of other countries and we will demand that agreement be honored.”Mariana Panuncio-Feldman, senior director of international climate cooperation for the World Wildlife Fund, said despite the outcome, “the momentum for climate action has never been greater.”“At this point, given the progress that we have seen, we are confident that the nations of the world will keep focusing on the work that needs to go ahead,” she said at a press conference. “With the momentum that we have behind us we need to remain confident that the arc of climate justice will bend towards solutions.”"
39,THE WORLDPOST,Russian President Vladimir Putin Congratulates Donald Trump On Election Win,"By Denis Pinchuk, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vladimir-putin-donald-trump_us_5822e56ce4b0aac6248858bb,Shocker.,2016-11-09,Russian leader Vladimir Putin suggested a constructive dialogue was now possible with Donald Trump becoming president.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5822e62a190000a502c31c32.jpeg?cache=9N9GU6hW59&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MOSCOW, Nov 9 (Reuters) - For all their mutual praise, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are likely to disagree on many things.But Trump’s election win could hand Moscow an elusive prize - the lifting or easing of Western sanctions.Rolling back those sanctions, imposed by the United States and the European Union to punish Moscow for its 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, could spur investment in Russia’s flat-lining economy.That might make it even easier for Putin, who is trying to plug holes in the state budget inflicted by low oil prices and sanctions, to win a fourth presidential term in 2018 by allowing him to show he has returned the economy to growth.“Clearly the chances of sanctions being lifted on Russia have risen substantially,” Charles Robertson, Renaissance Capital’s global chief economist, said. “That would improve the investment climate for Russia.”Russia’s rouble currency and stocks gained on the Trump election victory. Ukraine’s dollar-denominated bonds tumbled to multi-month lows, reflecting pessimism about what a Trump presidency means for the divided and indebted country.The Kremlin had been bracing for fraught relations if the White House had been won by Hillary Clinton - a politician Putin once accused of stirring up protests against him and who state media portrayed as an anti-Russian warmonger.Trump was portrayed in a more positive light. Putin described him as “very talented” and in Kremlin-backed media he was cast as a plucky political maverick.Still, few in Moscow had believed the Republican candidate would win, apart from a group of Trump-supporting nationalists who gathered in a Moscow bar decorated with a triptych of Putin, Trump and French Front National leader Marine Le Pen.Once it became clear he had won, Russia’s parliament erupted in applause and Putin told foreign ambassadors he was ready to fully restore ties with Washington.State TV ran a clip of a Russian doppelganger of Trump taunting a cowed Clinton lookalike and Margarita Simonyan, the boss of RT, the Kremlin’s English-language TV news channel, said she would drive around Moscow with a U.S. flag to celebrate.But Russian glee was tempered by a recognition that Trump’s pre-election promises might be diluted and that deep contradictions between Moscow and Washington would remain, even if Trump and Putin adopt a friendly tone in public.EASING SANCTIONSTrump’s attempts to ease restrictions on doing business with Russia could also be constrained by Congress, which has shown it has little patience for the Kremlin’s military adventures.Executives with Western firms say the biggest obstacle to deals with Russia is not the sanctions themselves but the prospect that more could be imposed and the zeal with which existing sanctions are enforced.If a Trump White House were to send a signal to businesses that it was taking a more lax approach, investments could start flowing again with sanctions still in place.A softer U.S. stance could also weaken European sanctions resolve.The bloc’s measures have already started to look wobbly, with some member states finding ways to circumvent them, others saying it is time to discuss moving on, and some business groups in countries such as Germany lobbying against them.Until now, Washington has helped stiffen European resolve. When Russia placed a Eurobond in May this year, many European banks decided not to take part because they did not want to fall foul of U.S. financial regulators.“America was the leader there and amazingly has been able to hold Europe together (on sanctions),” political analyst Masha Lipman told Reuters. “With Donald Trump in the White House I think there may be changes, something that might be beneficial for Russia.”Putin needs sanctions lifted as they risk hurting his re-election prospects.Russia’s central bank is forecasting economic growth of up to 1 percent next year, well below the level Russian households have come to expect. After previous slumps, recoveries have been driven by foreign lending and investment.There are already some signs that the economy is hurting support for Putin, a trend that is only likely to grow in the 18 months until the Russian presidential election.HARD BARGAINKremlin-watchers said that, even if U.S.-relations were less antagonistic with Trump in the White House, any deal would involve hard bargaining on both sides.Russia is seeking formal recognition from the world that Crimea, part of Ukraine, is now Russian territory, something it has only got so far apart from a handful of nations. It also wants Kiev to do more to implement a peace deal covering eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists hold sway.In Syria, where Russia is helping President Bashar al-Assad fight a war with air strikes and military assistance, Moscow wants the West to drop ideas about changing the government, abandon help for what it says are hardline Islamists, and drop talk of possible no-fly zones.One possibility is a quid pro quo, with Russia making concessions on Syria in exchange for the United States ceding ground on Ukraine and sanctions.“For Russia the key point is Ukraine. If Trump says that America does not care about Ukraine, then that is all that Russia wants to hear right now,” Georgy Bovt, editor of the Russkiy Mir magazine, told Reuters.“On Syria it will be easier to reach a deal. I think that on Assad, Russia will be willing to compromise because Ukraine is more important for Russia.”PERSONALITIESMuch has been made in Russian and Western media of the perceived similarities and differences between Putin and Trump, who have never met.Both are fond of tough talking and some Russian politicians have suggested the pair might be able to forge a close working relationship similar to the one the Russian leader enjoyed with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.Trump has said he might even meet Putin before his inauguration. Putin’s spokesman said there were currently no plans for such a meeting.People familiar with both men’s leadership styles advised caution however, saying both were relatively thin-skinned when it came to criticism.Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think-tank close to the Foreign Ministry, told Reuters the fact that Trump was an untested politician would also be a worry for the Kremlin.“He’s a loose cannon and you never know what to expect from him,” he said.There were also concerns the two men might be too alike.“The problem is that both of them, Putin and Trump, are macho,” Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-connected analyst and former pro-Putin lawmaker, told Reuters. “They could try to take the measure of each other. We can’t let that happen.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58237ec0180000290030d032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s surprise general election win in the early hours of Wednesday has already resuscitated plans to build the Keystone XL pipeline. TransCanada, the company behind the proposed 1,179-mile oil conduit from Alberta to Nebraska, announced plans on Wednesday to meet with Trump officials to once again pitch the pipeline. President Barack Obama rejected Keystone XL last November after seven years of reviews, a move hailed by environmentalists.“TransCanada remains fully committed to building Keystone XL,” Mark Cooper, a spokesman for the company, said in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post. “We are evaluating ways to engage the new administration on the benefits, the jobs and the tax revenues this project brings to the table.” The company did not say whether it planned to formally reapply to build the pipeline. Former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper urged Trump to reconsider Keystone XL in a congratulatory tweet on Wednesday. Trump said in May that he would support the pipeline if the U.S. government could get a share of its revenue, which may not be legal.“I want it built, but I want a piece of the profits,” Trump said during a speech on his energy policies to oil-industry workers in North Dakota. “That’s how we’re going to make our country rich again.” Still, Trump’s core campaign pledge to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement could put TransCanada’s plans in jeopardy. In June, the company used a legal clause in NAFTA to sue the U.S. government.Oil, gas and coal stocks surged in the hours after Trump claimed victory. Shares of renewable energy companies, by contrast, plummeted.Trump has called scientific evidence of climate change “bullshit” and “a hoax,” and has vowed to reverse much of Obama’s energy policies. During his campaign, he threatened to pull out of the historic climate accord that was reached in Paris last December and went into effect last week. "

A raucous crowd at North Carolina State University welcomed the Democratic presidential nominee hours before polling sites opened across the state. Clinton encouraged those in the crowd to “bring out your friends, your roommates [and] strangers on the street” and to “talk about what’s at stake.”“I really believe it’s the most important election of our lifetimes because we’ve never had a clearer choice,” she said. “It is a choice between division or unity, between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon that could risk everything.”“We don’t have to accept a dark, divisive vision of America,” she added. “Tomorrow you can vote for a big, whole-hearted America.” Clinton ran through her positions on equal pay for women, making community college free, lessening student loan debt, addressing climate change and reforming the criminal justice system. She also denounced HB 2, which stops local governments from passing anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay and transgender people and orders that individuals can only use restrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates.“It’s not just my name or Donald Trump’s on the ballot — it’s the kind of country we want,” she said.North Carolina is a critical state for the former secretary of state and her Republican opponent Trump in this year’s presidential race. Clinton has held a steady lead for most of the race, but a low early turnout among black voters in North Carolina could hurt her chances of winning the state.Much of this is due to members of the state’s Republican Party aggressively limiting early voting opportunities. The state GOP sent out a memo in August encouraging precincts to make “party line changes to early voting,” and 23 county election boards reduced early voting hours. Nine boards completely eliminated Sunday voting. Since the Supreme Court struck down portions of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, North Carolina has closed 27 polling locations. The North Carolina NAACP has sued county election officials for canceling voter registrations. Election officials in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties purged voter registrations from the rolls after campaign mailers sent to voter addresses were returned as undeliverable. The NC NAACP alleged the cancellations were an effort to suppress the black vote. On Friday, a federal judge ordered county election boards to restore the registrations."

LOUIS ― An activist who protested the 2014 police shooting of a teenager in nearby Ferguson is mobilizing voters against a Missouri voter ID measure that opponents say could disenfranchise blacks, Latinos, disabled people, students and the elderly.While most of America is focused on the top of the ticket in Tuesday’s election, 26-year-old community organizer Kayla Reed is trying to get Missouri voters to look lower down the ballot, where a constitutional amendment known as Amendment 6 would require voters to show a photo ID or other proof of identification before they will be allowed to vote.“The bottom of that ballot impacts our communities directly and quicker,” Reed said. “We want to put value in the bottom of the ballot, especially for people who are often left out of the conversation.”Missouri’s voter ID measure, like others developed around the country in recent years, was pushed by Republicans who claim it’s needed to combat voter fraud ― which rarely takes place in person. Missouri lawmakers overrode Gov. Jay Nixon’s (D) veto of the voter ID legislation in September, putting it on the ballot for voters to decide.Missouri has 220,000 valid voters who don’t have a state-issued photo ID, according to a 2014 estimate by the Missouri secretary of state. An additional 130,000 voters have IDs that are expired.Reed hosted a “Black Vote Brunch” on Saturday with more than 200 people, spreading the word about the amendment to fellow organizers, community members and local politicians. Reed also has been using the hashtag “#donttouchmyvote,” which she described as a social media conversation on the never-ending struggle for the right to vote, even after the 1965 Voting Rights Act was passed during the civil rights movement. “There’s always been an attack to limit people’s voice,” Reed said.“This is really a response to an attack on black people. Which is really what our Republican statehouse has continued to do since Ferguson,” she added. “So we’re just trying to keep the momentum up with innovative ways around those issues.”Reed has had help from Washington-based civil rights group Advancement Project for the past month, with activists on the ground in Missouri helping mobilize voters and support Reed and other local organizers. Judith Browne Dianis, executive director of Advancement Project’s national office, said Missouri’s measure is “trying to silence black people.”“African Americans have come too far from the days of the Missouri Compromise and the Dred Scott decision to be told when to vote and when not to,” Dianis said in a statement to HuffPost. “We will support the fight against Amendment 6, and we will continue fighting for an affirmative national right to vote.”North Carolina recently lost its attempt to reinstate a restrictive voter ID law. An appeals court struck down the law as racially discriminatory ― a ruling left undisturbed by a deadlocked Supreme Court in August.While the presidential election is capturing most of the attention, Reed stressed it’s important for voters to tune in to the not-so-flashy propositions on the ballot.“This election has been devastating to the hopes and morality of people of color with both presidential options, honestly,” Reed said. ”So, we wanted to really focus on local issues and a way to re-engage people in a healing and fun environment while also doing political education.”"

The retail pharmacy giant once helped float Theranos to a $9 billion valuation, vaulting its founder and CEO, Elizabeth Holmes, to tech industry stardom. But in October 2015, The Wall Street Journal exposed major problems with the company’s marquee product, which claimed to be able to run 240 different tests on a single drop of blood.Theranos vehemently denied the report, but new revelations kept coming. Nine months later, Walgreens abandoned the scandal-struck company, vowing to no longer use its laboratories to test blood from patients at its walk-in clinics. Theranos’ valuation plummeted, wiping out much of Holmes’ $4.5 billion net worth ― held largely in company stock ― seemingly overnight. Walgreens is now accusing Theranos of violating some nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements that were part of its original partnership with the startup, according to court filings. Walgreens spokesman Jim Cohn confirmed to The Huffington Post that the suit had been filed Tuesday in Delaware. He declined to comment further.But John Carreyrou, the star Wall Street Journal reporter who led the investigation against Theranos, said on Twitter that Walgreens is suing for $140 million. A major hedge fund investor said last month that Theranos had used a “series of lies” to convince it to invest $100 million, and sued the startup for fraud. That same week, Theranos announced plans to lay off 40 percent of its staff and get out of the blood-testing business.Theranos did not respond to a request for comment."

Those who would know can’t recall it happening, and the Trump campaign refuses to comment.It’s a small fib in the grand scheme of things, not one that will change voter perceptions. The cake, as they say, is baked.But the fact that Trump’s lying is taken for granted, that he casually will say he won Michigan’s “Man of the Year” and plow right on with conviction, says a lot about his campaign and its lasting impact on future elections. Acts that used to engender strong backlash have become mundane. Even worse, important political precedents have been broken and troubling social trends have been normalized. Donald Trump is now the first major party candidate in 40 years not to release his tax returns during the election. Such an act of secrecy carried political downsides just four years ago when Mitt Romney was hesitant to make his information public. But from here on, there is a precedent that future candidates can cite should they choose the path of non-disclosure.Trump has been openly hostile to the media. He refused to allow a traveling press corps to fly with him ― a major departure from past nominees. And as documented by The Huffington Post’s Michael Calderone, he has called reporters “dishonest” “lying” “scum,” threatened lawsuits, pledged to “open up” libel laws, and singled out correspondents by name at rallies. At those rallies, the treatment of the press has become so alarming that journalists occasionally have had to rely on law enforcement protection to get in and out. And not for lack of reason.Trump called for the jailing of his opponent, something unheard of in modern democratic presidential campaigns ― and widely denounced as being more customary of a banana republic. “Lock her up” is a staple chant of his campaign rallies. And though it happens less frequently, talk of assassination now pops up with some regularity, too.Trump made it socially acceptable to broach topics that were once deemed far too offensive for a politician. He effectively encouraged a white nationalist and anti-Semitic following by halfheartedly denouncing its members. He personally retweeted an anti-Semitic image and then expressed regret for taking it down. The Anti-Defamation League condemned his closing ad for playing up anti-Semitic tropes. This reporter ― like others ― was on the receiving end of anti-Semitic vitriol beyond anything experienced in prior campaigns. Others who weren’t even Jewish received that treatment as well. Trump made it more acceptable to single out and target minority groups. Certainly, there have been xenophobic and nativist threads in campaigns past. But rarely have they been such prominent features of a major nominee’s candidacy: from calling Mexicans rapists to publicly pushing a ban on Muslims entering the country. By the end of campaign, Trump’s tactic had become so customary that the usual denunciations he received were simply left unsaid. Trump upended decades of bipartisan precedent on nuclear weapons policy, saying that he would be comfortable with more proliferation. His positions were so outside the mainstream ― but so under-discussed ― that former Sen. Bill Bradley felt compelled to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars and launch a super PAC ad campaign to spotlight them. It wasn’t just liberals. Staunch conservative foreign policy figures found Trump’s position utterly unacceptable too. Trump invited a foreign power to hack his opponent’s emails. He later said he was just joking. But, sure enough, after Russian hackers allegedly stole the emails of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and those emails began appearing on WikiLeaks, Trump made them a major component of his closing argument. One might view this as an act of political opportunism. But the precedent set has been troubling for others. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), for one, warned Republicans that they shouldn’t encourage foreign meddling in an election.Trump also openly admonished veterans and current military leaders. He mocked Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for having been captured as a prisoner of war. And recently, as part of a routine denunciation for how the U.S. and Iraq are handling the campaign to recapture Mosul from the Islamic State, he called the military and civilian leadership a “group of losers.” Candidates have criticized the military in the past. But this was personal in a way that major party politicians have not behaved before.Trump attacked the spouses of his rivals. He went after Bill Clinton for his affairs and indiscretions ― which, one could argue, is fair game since Clinton is a former president who has been in the arena. But Trump’s retweeting of an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz, the wife of primary opponent Sen. Ted Cruz, was shocking in the moment and certainly set a new standard for the treatment of an opponent’s family. Trump politicized a national security briefing. He declared in a forum that the intelligence officials who briefed him weren’t happy with President Barack Obama, a statement that intelligence officials later said was both highly unlikely and highly inappropriate.Trump openly delegitimized the election process by repeatedly suggesting the results would be rigged. Other candidates have referenced vote-rigging and election fraud in the past. But none have made it such a prominent feature of rallies, let alone refused to commit to accepting the final vote tally during a debate. One former GOP operative, who literally wrote a book on rigging elections, was appalled by the talk. “The stuff he is talking about, it is ridiculous ― if it wasn’t so dangerous,” said Allen Raymond, author of How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative. Trump’s comments, he added, were “an existential threat to the republic.” One can go on, of course. Trump also may have set a record, though perhaps not a precedent, in terms of the number of women accusing him of sexual assault as he has run for president (he denies all charges). He isn’t the first politician to hold raucous rallies, but he probably is the first major party presidential candidate to encourage his supporters to rough up the protesters and certainly the first to say he’d cover their subsequent legal bills. Other candidates have dabbled in conspiracy theories, but none with the frequency as Trump. Defenders of Trump ― and there are many millions ― will argue that some of these acts are virtues; that he is suited for the presidency precisely because he upends norms and conventions. They may also argue that Hillary Clinton has committed sins of a similar nature, and that when it comes to matters of honesty and integrity, she is worse.Certainly, Clinton has her problems. She misled about her handling of a private email server during her time at the State Department. She lied when she said she did not have classified material cross her server. And she has been slow to disclose matters from her time at the State Department and with respect to her family’s foundation. But on the whole, she isn’t in the same ecosystem as Trump. To argue otherwise is to live in a post-truth universe. As documented by Daniel Dale of the Toronto Star, Trump has made 560 false claims from mid-September through Sunday, or roughly 20 per day. They happen so frequently that they become, like much of his other conduct, part of what seems like a new normal. In recent rallies, for example, Trump has told crowds that he had “just left” Arizona ― where he hadn’t been in days ― and was spending $100 million on his campaign, even though he is dozens of millions of dollars short of that goal. The night after he declared in Michigan that he had once received that state’s “Man of the Year” award ― with no apparent evidence to back it up ― he appeared at a rally in Pennsylvania where, once again, he regaled the crowd with the story of how he’d won that honor.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

During an interview on radio show “The Brian Lehrer Show,” the former “30 Rock” star got candid about Trump’s campaign, noting the real estate mogul “could have won” had he made some better decisions. “[Hillary Clinton] was beatable, if he had unified with the party. You don’t have to be a political insider to think of the two or three things he might have done to have vastly improved his chances,” Baldwin said, later adding, “He just keeps getting it wrong, every time he opens his mouth. It’s tragic, really.” “I often wonder — and I hate saying this — if there’s something wrong with him, medically. It’s this compulsive need to burn every bridge — he’s a pyromaniac in that sense,” the actor said, before admitting he feels bad for the GOP candidate’s family. Baldwin, 58, also spoke about playing The Donald on “SNL,” a role he admitted he was initially reluctant to play. Now, he’s grateful he got the chance. “I think people were ready to take in that version of him, which is so aggressive,” Baldwin said. In terms of writing the sketches, Baldwin noted that Trump essentially supplied all the material the writers needed just by opening his mouth.“He’s the head writer of his own comedy routine,” he said. As for Hillary Clinton, Trump’s biggest opponent, Baldwin said he hopes that if she wins, her side is “gracious.” “I hope they don’t catch the disease of the other side, which is an aggressive, in-your-face, spiking the ball in the end zone,” he said. “I’d like to see the Clinton camp and Clinton supporters — if they win — elevate the whole thing.” Baldwin said this whole election cycle has made him realize one thing: how much he’s going to miss President Barack Obama, “who was one of the most gracious men who ever occupied the White House in history.” And when asked if he’ll get back into the makeup chair to don Trump’s signature orange glow on “SNL” after the election, Baldwin said, “I certainly hope not.” “I hope it’s over,” he quipped. “I want my weekends back so I can be with my kids.” You can listen to Baldwin’s entire interview here.

49,POLITICS,2 Ohio Cities To Vote on Expanding Early Childhood Education,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cincinnati-dayton-early-childhood-education_us_582123ace4b0d9ce6fbe4b2b,Cincinnati and Dayton could be indicators of a larger national trend.,2016-11-08,"Voters stand outside the Hamilton County Board of Elections in Cincinnati, Ohio, as early voting begins statewide on Oct. 12, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Voters in the midsize Ohio cities of Cincinnati and Dayton will decide on Tuesday whether to raise taxes to expand access to early childhood education.The two ballot initiatives, along with a business tax increase on the ballot in Oregon, reflect growing political momentum behind increasing access to preschool through local and state-level policymaking.Issue 44, the early childhood education referendum in Cincinnati, would raise property taxes to generate $48 million in new revenue for schools, of which $15 million would go toward expanding preschool access. The program would fully subsidize preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds living at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level ― $24,300 for a family of four ― and provide progressively more modest support for children in households with incomes above that level. The initiative’s backers estimate the preschool expansion would affect 6,000 children in the city of nearly 300,000. Issue 9, the early childhood education referendum in Dayton, would raise income taxes by one-quarter of a percentage point to raise $4.3 million in revenue for expanded preschool access, as well as millions for other essential city services like road repair and law enforcement. The funds will go to providing income-based preschool tuition assistance for Dayton’s 1,900 4-year-olds. City officials claim the expansion will amount to “universal preschool,” according to local NBC affiliate WDTN News.Although there is not much polling data available for the two initiatives, Cincinnati’s referendum has the support of a broad array of community stakeholders, including large labor unions and top business groups like the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber of Commerce. Also, Oregonians will decide whether to approve Measure 97, which would levy a 2.5 percent tax on corporations’ annual in-state sales of more than $25 million. Backers of the measure are promoting it as a way to increase education funding in the state, including expanding preschool programs. A majority of Oregon residents oppose the measure, however, according to a poll released earlier this month.There is abundant research showing that preschool has a positive impact on children’s cognitive development that can affect them for the rest of their lives. A RAND Corporation study commissioned by backers of the Cincinnati initiative estimates that every $1 invested in early childhood education yields returns of $2.50 to $4.20 in economic returns, such as savings from reduced spending on law enforcement.But preschool remains unaffordable for the vast majority of American families, including middle-income households. The cost of child care for a 4-year-old, which consists largely of preschool costs, is more than the costs of in-state public college tuition in nearly half of states, according to a study by the Economic Policy Institute.As a result, government programs subsidizing or providing preschool education have become an increasingly popular progressive cause. New York City became the largest city to guarantee preschool for 4-year-old children with a program that began in September 2014.Ethan Rome, executive director of the Child Care and Early Learning Action Hub, an advocacy group backed by organized labor and community organizations that supports the Ohio ballot measures, said he was optimistic about the impact of the ballot measures, regardless of the outcome. He emphasized the ascendance of child care affordability as a national priority.“We have the first presidential election in which both candidates have made child care an issue,” Rome said. “Donald Trump barely has positions on anything, but he has a child care plan and even a child care ad.”"

During his 23-year tenure leading the group’s legal strategy, he has never known a liberal Supreme Court. For almost a generation, neither has much of the country.But the election on Tuesday could change that.“For much of my career, the strategy has been to keep cases away from the Supreme Court rather than push cases toward the Supreme Court for fear of what the outcome might be,” Shapiro said. “That conversation will be recalibrated depending on what the next Supreme Court will look like.”That look could change drastically in the near future. The death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February has opened the door for the first time in nearly than 50 years for the possible flip of the Supreme Court’s ideological balance ― from a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a 5-to-4 liberal majority on all the issues where competing visions of the Constitution are at stake.And that liberal majority could even be more pronounced and long-lasting if the next president gets a chance to replace all three of the oldest sitting members of the court ― Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83; Anthony Kennedy, 80; and Stephen Breyer, 78.As evidenced by the Republican Party’s blockade of President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to Scalia’s seat ― and a recent shift to even more years of obstruction if Hillary Clinton is elected to the White House ― conservatives are well aware that they have controlled the Supreme Court since Richard Nixon defeated Hubert Humphrey in 1968. And they don’t want to give that power up.What has that power meant? Well, if you were born after Nixon was first elected president, you simply have no clue what a liberal Supreme Court looks like.Here’s another way of phrasing that: If you are anywhere between the ages of 0 and 47 years old ― that includes both of this article’s authors ― you have never lived a day of your life with a left-of-center majority in the most powerful institution in the judicial branch of government. That has had a tangible impact on what world you live in.“Over the course the past decade and even longer than that, we’ve seen a rightward shift in the law in a number of different areas,” said Brianne Gorod, chief counsel for the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive legal advocacy group that is beginning to take stock of what this shift would mean for its work. “The possibility of a fifth Democratic appointee on the court won’t change things overnight, but it does present a real opportunity to course-correct.”In ways big and small, the conservative court dominance that began in the late 1960s has meant increasing power for corporations and the rich; decreasing rights for citizens and labor unions; a harsher and more punitive criminal justice system; higher barriers for access to the courts; and the stalling, gutting or full-scale rollback of civil and voting rights.Often viewed as a transitional court from the liberal powerhouse led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Burger court inaugurated conservative control of the court in 1969 ― the year Nixon appointed Warren Burger to replace the retiring Warren. In time, Nixon made three more appointments that pulled the court to the right, but with a stronger center that made the changes heralded by the Warren era appear subtle.“The Warren court had made the promotion of equality its central mission ― voting equality, school equality, equality for criminal defendants,” said Columbia law professor Michael Graetz, co-author with Linda Greenhouse of The Burger Court and the Rise of the Judicial Right, released in June. “In the Burger court, equality was no longer terribly important. And a whole series of other values ― local interests, states’ rights, business interests ― took precedence. So you had a transformation in the guiding values of the court due to the Nixon appointments.”Among other changes to the constitutional landscape, the Burger court struck down and then quickly reauthorized the death penalty, gutted school busing designed to end segregated schools, put important limits on affirmative action policies, and upheld the unequal distribution of public school funding based on property tax lines.Further, the new conservative majority weakened the post-Watergate campaign finance laws and declared that corporations had both a First Amendment right to spend unlimited sums on ballot initiative campaigns and on commercial advertising.“If you’ve seen drug commercials, that’s due to the Burger court,” Graetz said. “And they laid the foundation for corporate speech that the court created in Citizens United. So it was a very pro-business court.”The rightward pull continued unabated when the leadership of the court changed hands to Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who was later joined by other Ronald Reagan appointees that included Kennedy and the late Scalia. By then, the conservative majority was somewhat looser thanks to the countervailing force of a moderate Reaganite, Sandra Day O’Connor, and the far more liberal John Paul Stevens and David Souter, nominated by Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, respectively.It’s those “bad” Republican appointments that led the party and its allies to be ever more careful and judicious with its vetting of nominees to the Supreme Court. And in a sense, the elder Bush’s appointment of Justice Clarence Thomas to succeed liberal lion Thurgood Marshall did just that, solidifying the court’s conservative stranglehold ― which the later nominations of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer by President Bill Clinton couldn’t quite shake out.“At the time, liberals thought the Rehnquist court was the worst ― certainly I did,” said Ian Millhiser, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and author of Injustices: The Supreme Court’s History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted. “And it did shut down most liberal hopes that they could advance their agenda through litigation.”As fate would have it, it was the retirement of O’Connor ― precipitated in part by Rehnquist’s ailing health and eventual death ― that dashed those hopes further, ushering in the more radically conservative Roberts court, so named after its current chief justice, John Roberts. In the 11 years since he’s been at the helm, the court’s legacy, now at an inflection point, has been defined by its extreme pro-corporate bent and its dismaying record on race issues.According to a study by Lee Epstein, William Landes and Richard Posner, the Roberts court is the most pro-corporate court in generations. Where the win rate for business petitioners had been 54 percent under the Burger and Rehnquist courts, the Roberts court sided with business 64 percent of the time.Similarly, a study by the Constitutional Accountability Center examined cases in which the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest corporate lobby group, took a side. Its analysis found that the Roberts court sided with the Chamber 69 percent of the time. That was significantly higher than the Chamber’s 43 percent and 57 percent success rates in the Burger and Rehnquist courts, respectively.The court’s corporate tilt has allowed corporations to force consumers and small businesses into arbitration hearings that favor the company rather than pursue lawsuits. It has stripped states of laws protecting patient privacy and safety from pharmaceutical companies. The court has even allowed mutual fund advisers to get around laws preventing them from lying to investors by hiding behind fictitious names.Of this long line of cases, perhaps none looms larger than Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the 2010 decision that extended the corporate political speech rights that the Burger court, in Graetz’s words, created “out of whole cloth.” The court not only opened the door to the current era of super PACs and dark money, but also rewrote the definition of corruption in the law.Taken together, the Roberts court’s pro-corporate record, as constitutional lawyer and current Democratic congressional candidate Jamie Raskin writes, “aggressively enlarges the political and social power of corporations by imputing to them the individual constitutional rights of the people.”On matters of race, the Roberts court fares no better — although Kennedy, at least in recent years, appears to be reconsidering his stance on affirmative action and certain civil rights protections.“The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,” wrote Roberts early on in his tenure in a school integration case ― spelling out his colorblind vision for the Constitution and prompting the court’s then-most-senior liberal, Stevens, to accuse him of rewriting the history of Brown v. Board of Education.Fast-forward to 2013, and Roberts, in his 5-to-4 majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, helped put a bullet through the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965 because, in his view, “things have changed dramatically” in the South ― and “extraordinary measures to address an extraordinary problem” were no longer justified. Racism, in Roberts’s worldview, seemed a thing of the past.No longer subject to the Voting Rights Act, emboldened Southern states immediately sprang into action. North Carolina, having come under full control of the Republican Party in 2013, went forward with a “monster” voting law that specifically targeted African-American communities for a reduction in early voting sites, times and locations. The state also implemented voter identification laws specifically tailored to make it harder for African Americans to obtain the necessary identification to vote.This past July, the scheme by North Carolina Republicans was found by a federal court to be a specific attempt to disenfranchise African Americans in the state. The court said that the laws “target African Americans with almost surgical precision.” (If Roberts had any say in the matter, he would’ve blocked that ruling from being enforced for this presidential election.)Since Scalia’s death put the prospect of a fifth Democratic appointee within the realm of the possible, this dire history could well remain in the Supreme Court’s rearview mirror very soon. For someone like Gorod, whose work at the Constitutional Accountability Center includes thinking of ways of getting courts to adopt a historic yet progressive reading of the constitutional text, this may very well be a turning point.“If a majority of the court is truly committed to following the text and history of the Constitution and respecting the laws passed by Congress, that should produce more progressive outcomes than we’ve often seen from the current court ― in areas ranging from campaign finance and voting, to race and access to the courts,” she said.The ACLU’s Shapiro, for his part, said his organization will likely seize on this shift, even if he’s not there to spearhead it all ― in areas such as criminal justice, abortion rights, access to justice, and racial equality, to name a few.“It certainly opens up possibilities that haven’t existed for a while in the Supreme Court,” he said."

During his 23-year tenure leading the group’s legal strategy, he has never known a liberal Supreme Court. For almost a generation, neither has much of the country.But the election on Tuesday could change that.“For much of my career, the strategy has been to keep cases away from the Supreme Court rather than push cases toward the Supreme Court for fear of what the outcome might be,” Shapiro said. “That conversation will be recalibrated depending on what the next Supreme Court will look like.”That look could change drastically in the near future. The death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February has opened the door for the first time in nearly than 50 years for the possible flip of the Supreme Court’s ideological balance ― from a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a 5-to-4 liberal majority on all the issues where competing visions of the Constitution are at stake.And that liberal majority could even be more pronounced and long-lasting if the next president gets a chance to replace all three of the oldest sitting members of the court ― Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83; Anthony Kennedy, 80; and Stephen Breyer, 78.As evidenced by the Republican Party’s blockade of President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to Scalia’s seat ― and a recent shift to even more years of obstruction if Hillary Clinton is elected to the White House ― conservatives are well aware that they have controlled the Supreme Court since Richard Nixon defeated Hubert Humphrey in 1968. And they don’t want to give that power up.What has that power meant? Well, if you were born after Nixon was first elected president, you simply have no clue what a liberal Supreme Court looks like.Here’s another way of phrasing that: If you are anywhere between the ages of 0 and 47 years old ― that includes both of this article’s authors ― you have never lived a day of your life with a left-of-center majority in the most powerful institution in the judicial branch of government. That has had a tangible impact on what world you live in.“Over the course the past decade and even longer than that, we’ve seen a rightward shift in the law in a number of different areas,” said Brianne Gorod, chief counsel for the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive legal advocacy group that is beginning to take stock of what this shift would mean for its work. “The possibility of a fifth Democratic appointee on the court won’t change things overnight, but it does present a real opportunity to course-correct.”In ways big and small, the conservative court dominance that began in the late 1960s has meant increasing power for corporations and the rich; decreasing rights for citizens and labor unions; a harsher and more punitive criminal justice system; higher barriers for access to the courts; and the stalling, gutting or full-scale rollback of civil and voting rights.Often viewed as a transitional court from the liberal powerhouse led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Burger court inaugurated conservative control of the court in 1969 ― the year Nixon appointed Warren Burger to replace the retiring Warren. In time, Nixon made three more appointments that pulled the court to the right, but with a stronger center that made the changes heralded by the Warren era appear subtle.“The Warren court had made the promotion of equality its central mission ― voting equality, school equality, equality for criminal defendants,” said Columbia law professor Michael Graetz, co-author with Linda Greenhouse of The Burger Court and the Rise of the Judicial Right, released in June. “In the Burger court, equality was no longer terribly important. And a whole series of other values ― local interests, states’ rights, business interests ― took precedence. So you had a transformation in the guiding values of the court due to the Nixon appointments.”Among other changes to the constitutional landscape, the Burger court struck down and then quickly reauthorized the death penalty, gutted school busing designed to end segregated schools, put important limits on affirmative action policies, and upheld the unequal distribution of public school funding based on property tax lines.Further, the new conservative majority weakened the post-Watergate campaign finance laws and declared that corporations had both a First Amendment right to spend unlimited sums on ballot initiative campaigns and on commercial advertising.“If you’ve seen drug commercials, that’s due to the Burger court,” Graetz said. “And they laid the foundation for corporate speech that the court created in Citizens United. So it was a very pro-business court.”The rightward pull continued unabated when the leadership of the court changed hands to Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who was later joined by other Ronald Reagan appointees that included Kennedy and the late Scalia. By then, the conservative majority was somewhat looser thanks to the countervailing force of a moderate Reaganite, Sandra Day O’Connor, and the far more liberal John Paul Stevens and David Souter, nominated by Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, respectively.It’s those “bad” Republican appointments that led the party and its allies to be ever more careful and judicious with its vetting of nominees to the Supreme Court. And in a sense, the elder Bush’s appointment of Justice Clarence Thomas to succeed liberal lion Thurgood Marshall did just that, solidifying the court’s conservative stranglehold ― which the later nominations of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer by President Bill Clinton couldn’t quite shake out.“At the time, liberals thought the Rehnquist court was the worst ― certainly I did,” said Ian Millhiser, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and author of Injustices: The Supreme Court’s History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted. “And it did shut down most liberal hopes that they could advance their agenda through litigation.”As fate would have it, it was the retirement of O’Connor ― precipitated in part by Rehnquist’s ailing health and eventual death ― that dashed those hopes further, ushering in the more radically conservative Roberts court, so named after its current chief justice, John Roberts. In the 11 years since he’s been at the helm, the court’s legacy, now at an inflection point, has been defined by its extreme pro-corporate bent and its dismaying record on race issues.According to a study by Lee Epstein, William Landes and Richard Posner, the Roberts court is the most pro-corporate court in generations. Where the win rate for business petitioners had been 54 percent under the Burger and Rehnquist courts, the Roberts court sided with business 64 percent of the time.Similarly, a study by the Constitutional Accountability Center examined cases in which the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest corporate lobby group, took a side. Its analysis found that the Roberts court sided with the Chamber 69 percent of the time. That was significantly higher than the Chamber’s 43 percent and 57 percent success rates in the Burger and Rehnquist courts, respectively.The court’s corporate tilt has allowed corporations to force consumers and small businesses into arbitration hearings that favor the company rather than pursue lawsuits. It has stripped states of laws protecting patient privacy and safety from pharmaceutical companies. The court has even allowed mutual fund advisers to get around laws preventing them from lying to investors by hiding behind fictitious names.Of this long line of cases, perhaps none looms larger than Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the 2010 decision that extended the corporate political speech rights that the Burger court, in Graetz’s words, created “out of whole cloth.” The court not only opened the door to the current era of super PACs and dark money, but also rewrote the definition of corruption in the law.Taken together, the Roberts court’s pro-corporate record, as constitutional lawyer and current Democratic congressional candidate Jamie Raskin writes, “aggressively enlarges the political and social power of corporations by imputing to them the individual constitutional rights of the people.”On matters of race, the Roberts court fares no better — although Kennedy, at least in recent years, appears to be reconsidering his stance on affirmative action and certain civil rights protections.“The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,” wrote Roberts early on in his tenure in a school integration case ― spelling out his colorblind vision for the Constitution and prompting the court’s then-most-senior liberal, Stevens, to accuse him of rewriting the history of Brown v. Board of Education.Fast-forward to 2013, and Roberts, in his 5-to-4 majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, helped put a bullet through the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965 because, in his view, “things have changed dramatically” in the South ― and “extraordinary measures to address an extraordinary problem” were no longer justified. Racism, in Roberts’s worldview, seemed a thing of the past.No longer subject to the Voting Rights Act, emboldened Southern states immediately sprang into action. North Carolina, having come under full control of the Republican Party in 2013, went forward with a “monster” voting law that specifically targeted African-American communities for a reduction in early voting sites, times and locations. The state also implemented voter identification laws specifically tailored to make it harder for African Americans to obtain the necessary identification to vote.This past July, the scheme by North Carolina Republicans was found by a federal court to be a specific attempt to disenfranchise African Americans in the state. The court said that the laws “target African Americans with almost surgical precision.” (If Roberts had any say in the matter, he would’ve blocked that ruling from being enforced for this presidential election.)Since Scalia’s death put the prospect of a fifth Democratic appointee within the realm of the possible, this dire history could well remain in the Supreme Court’s rearview mirror very soon.

53,POLITICS,Democrats Could Win More Than A Dozen State Legislative Chambers On Election Night,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-state-legislatures_us_58221412e4b0d9ce6fbf0ac5,Trump is a big factor in many states.,2016-11-08,"The New York State Senate in Albany, N.Y. is one of more than a dozen state legislative chambers where Democrats could win control after Tuesday's elections.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585868f81800002d00e4391b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With a renewed push in state elections ahead of the 2020 census, Democrats are competing to win at least 14 state legislative chambers on Tuesday. These victories could push five states into unified Democratic control in 2017.Ever since the Democratic wipeout at the state level in 2010, Democratic Party officials, donors and outside groups have organized to put money and energy into the effort to win state legislatures.The party could flip legislative chambers in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Washington and West Virginia. Many of these states are on favorable terrain for Democrats with presidential election turnout expected to boost voting for the party’s base of minorities, the young and women. This is especially true of states with high Latino and Asian populations including Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico. In 2012, Latinos and Asians voted overwhelmingly for Democrats and are expected to deliver even bigger margins for the party this time around thanks to the anti-immigrant demagoguery of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.There is no competitive Senate race in four of these states. That means that the Republican Party has not invested heavily to get out the vote for their Senate candidate, which hurts those down ballot. Democratic down-ballot candidates in states like Colorado, Iowa, Maine and Michigan will be boosted by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s advanced get out the vote operation while Republicans will have to rely on Trump’s unfunded operation. Get out the vote efforts will likely play a major role in determining these legislative races where victory margins will be smaller than the top of the ticket.In Arizona, Democrats would need to flip four seats in the state Senate to win control. In Colorado, Democrats only need to win one seat in the state Senate to win back full control of the legislature. They already control the governor’s mansion. Democrats in Minnesota, New York and Washington are also hoping to win back full control of their respective state legislatures and governor’s mansions. This may be easiest in Washington where Democrats need to win two seats in the state Senate. Their top targets are in districts that will likely lean Democratic in the presidential election. In Minnesota, Democrats need to win 13 seats in the state House to take control. Many of these seats were won on Democratic turf due to the more Republican-friendly 2014 electorate and could be won back with a more Democratic-friendly presidential level turnout.Nearly everything is up in the air in New Hampshire. Democrats hope to retain control of the governor’s mansion and use their usual presidential turnout bump to flip both the state House and Senate. Control of the state’s House has flipped in each of the past three elections as the electorate has moved between midterm and presidential levels of turnout.New York may be the most complicated of these states as Democrats technically already have a majority in the state Senate. That majority, however, is not functional as a splinter faction called the Independent Democrats, or IDC, caucus with the Republicans to give them minority control of the chamber. There is a slight chance that non-IDC Democrats will win a majority, but they would have to do so over pro-Trump sentiment on Long Island and in upstate New York.In Maine, Democrats hope to win three seats in the state Senate to take full control of the legislature. This will give them a better position to push back against Republican Gov. Paul LePage during the next two years of his administration. Similarly, in Michigan, Nevada and New Mexico, Democrats hope to win control of legislative chambers heading into their gubernatorial election year in 2018. Republicans control the governor’s mansion in each of these states and Democrats will make Michigan and New Mexico top targets in the next election.Riding a wave of anti-Trump sentiment from minority groups, Democrats in California are likely to wipe out the Republican Party in the state and win a legislative supermajority.Some smaller victories could also put Democrats in a better legislative situation in certain states. Democrats in North Carolina are hoping Attorney General Roy Cooper can defeat the unpopular incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory, but they do not expect to win back control of the state legislature. They are, however, looking to win enough seats to deny Republicans the supermajority to override the incoming governor’s veto.Republicans still have at least one ray of sunshine in the 2016 state legislature race. Kentucky’s House of Representatives is expected to flip to Republican control this year. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has helped to raise money for the party to flip the lower chamber and win full control of the government in his state. The Democratic majority in the Kentucky House is the last such majority in the South.Stay tuned for further updates on 2016 state legislatives elections tonight.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Things on your end may seem the same as they ever were, but for those of us who have been around awhile, it’s been a troubling year.You were born healthy to a middle class family in the most powerful nation the world has ever known. Your parents are generous, educated and loving. You live 30 minutes from Boston, a city known for its universities, biotech startups and museums. You are off to a good start.But today, just 11 days after you were born, your country is making a historic choice. You will learn in school someday about what happened the day America elected either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, and what happened in the year that led up to that moment.Long ago, before either of us had gotten here yet, our political system split in two. The two parties weren’t opposite, per se, and they both, for the most part, had the same goal of helping most of us live better, more prosperous lives. (There are some major, major exceptions to this, but that’s for another time). Over the years, there were some steps forward, and certainly some steps back. But then, eight years ago, things took a turn. Barack Obama, the first black man to lead the United States, became president. He believed all people should be treated equally in this land. During his eight years in office, queer people got the right to marry one another. Transgender people finally began to have their voices heard. A black man became the attorney general. Then a black woman did. As in decades past, protest movements like Occupy and Black Lives Matter rose up to demand better treatment for people of color, women, poor people, Muslims, and other groups our society has failed to treat with respect and dignity. Other people ― people who look like me ― started to listen for a change. Actually listen. I hope someday you tell me how old fashioned this all sounds to you.This work of progress is a work in progress, but today we face our biggest challenge yet. Trump ― a cheater, a liar, a sexual predator, a bigot, a misogynist and a demagogue ― unleashed a political fury unlike anything that any of us has seen before. He amplified the once-fringe voices of people who sync their moral philosophies to drumbeats of hate. Trump and his followers attacked women, immigrants, people of color, Muslims, Mormons, the disabled and queer people. They even attacked me for being a Jew, and for doing my job as a journalist.That’s not all. Trump continued the unusual and toxic tradition of his party to deny scientific evidence of climate change. I imagine that may also seem bafflingly funny to you once you’re old enough to read this. If he wins, he stands a good chance of winning again in four years, and after that time his policies will have produced 3.4 billion tons more of carbon pollution than if Clinton’s proposals prevail. I can’t wait to show you New York City someday, but I’m hoping it won’t require us to go snorkeling.There’s a lot about Clinton that I don’t like, either. But I believe she will propel us forward as a people, and she, by the very nature of who she is, will make history. Tonight some of my friends and colleagues will join her at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan. The ceiling there is made of glass. You’ll understand the significance of that someday, but I hope that, too, will seem antiquated to you.Today I voted for Hillary Clinton. Someday maybe I’ll be voting for you.All my love,Your godfather, Uncle Alex"

I have heard from students, faculty and community members who are dissatisfied with our response, and I understand why,” Blank said. “A noose is a symbol of some of the worst forms of racial hatred and intimidation in our country’s history. We understand this and we should have communicated this more forcefully from the beginning.”“I understand the deeply hurtful impact this has on our students and communities of color,” she continued. Despite the language in the above tweet, the two fans were not actually asked to leave the game, simply to remove the noose from their masks. Both the school and the UW-Madison Police Department said at the time that the masks were a form of “free speech” and there was nothing they could do once the noose was removed. (The two fans reportedly put the noose back on later.)The school’s position, however, appears to has shifted since then, following complaints by student-athletes including basketball star Nigel Hayes. In a tweet, Hayes said he was offended by the imagery the night of the incident, adding, “Is this what [Wisconsin] and [the Wisconsin Badgers] supports?”In a separate tweet the next day, Hayes shared a photo of the school’s carry-in policy, which said items “must be of an appropriate nature.”“Noose around neck of the image of our black president in a jail suit is appropriate?” he asked. Chancellor Blank said Monday that Wisconsin has not only taken away the season tickets of the fans in question, but plans to quickly change the school’s carry-in and ticket policies before next Saturday’s game against Illinois.“We will learn from this incident and do better next time,” she said. Even after Blank’s comments, student-athletes including Hayes and 20 football players shared an open letter to the school on Monday in which they called attention to the difficulties that people of color face at the school and asked Blank to create “real programs” to improve their experience. “It is painful that someone in our community would show up to an athletic event with a mask of our sitting president, who happens to look a lot like us, with a noose around his neck. That moment was like a punch in the face to not only student-athletes of color, but also current students, faculty, and alumni of color,” the letter reads. “This incident was yet another blow and reminder that there are people in this community that may not value diverse populations.”Below you can read the full letter:Many people believe that student-athletes of color are immune to the racial injustices that affect other students of color on campus. However, our experiences are not shielded by the ‘W’ we wear on our chest, our experiences are one in the same. We are loved during competition, but then subjected to racial discrimination in our everyday lives too. It is painful that someone in our community would show up to an athletic event with a mask of our sitting president, who happens to look a lot like us, with a noose around his neck. That moment was like a punch in the face to not only student-athletes of color, but also current students, faculty, and alumni of color. This incident was yet another blow and reminder that there are people in this community that may not value diverse populations. When we travel and play in other stadiums, fans have told us to get out of their country, or to go back to Africa, but it hurts to receive that treatment at home. It does not end at overt racial issues, but it is also seen through microaggressions."

I’m embarrassed.” Paul Sieveke, 40, said he feels more concern and embarrassed from this political race than he has in a long time. “It has brought forth the underlying fear and tensions of a minority of the U.S. population and shows that they have not moved past a lot of the ideas and beliefs from the ‘50s and ‘60s, in terms of race relations, class structures, and personal entitlements,” he told The Huffington Post in an email. “This race has brought a platform for the racist, the sexist, the fear-mongering minority to fully get behind and push their ideologies to the center of the presidential race.”William Gilchrist, a 32-year-old businessman from Chicago, said he feels a “personal sense of shame” at how far Trump has come in this election cycle.“I get a lot of, ‘I’m sorry, dude,’ from non-Americans,” said Gilchrist with a laugh. “For most of us expats, we thought it was hilarious that Trump was even running for president.

Several American expats told HuffPost this week that they’ve cast their absentee ballots for Clinton. Monday was the last day to apply in-person for an absentee ballot or to postmark one. Some said Clinton is the best person for the job (Ching Jui Young, a 28-year-old financial consultant from LA, said she is a “wonderful candidate”). Others, like Gerard Lechau, have called the former secretary of state the “lesser of two evils.”Lechau, a lifelong Republican who has lived in Singapore for four years, said he’d always voted along party lines.“But not this time,” the 36-year-old said. “I voted for Hillary. It’s one of those things.

But Donald is not the right person to carry that torch.”A few expats here said they’ve voted for third-party candidates. Sarah Lifferth told the Straits Times that after months of deliberation, she and husband decided to cast ballots for independent candidate Evan McMullin. “I could not allow myself to vote for either Trump or Clinton. I don’t think that either of them have America’s best interests at heart,” Lifferth said. ”We talked for months about this, trying to figure out who we could vote for and still sleep at night.”Jason Park, a Korean-American who has lived in Singapore for three years, said many of his Republican friends have chosen to vote for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson. “They say, ‘OK, there’s no way I’m voting for Hillary, but I can’t vote for Donald Trump either.” Trump supporters may be a rare sight in Singapore, but they’re not entirely absent. A 44-year-old expatriate identified only as Kelly told the Straits Times that while she was “turned off by some of Trump’s demeaning comments about women,” she believed the business magnate could “bring change that the U.S. desperately needs.”Paula Robinson, a mom of two from Tennessee, said she recently saw a man wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat in her local mall. “It shocked me,” the 36-year-old said. Robinson, who has lived in Singapore for nine years and works in public relations, said she chose to vote for Clinton after thoroughly researching each of the candidates. “I vote on the issues and not the party,” she said. “I gave Trump a fair shake but I couldn’t seem to find anything positive about him. Let’s forget all the vile stuff he says to rile everybody up; I just don’t think he has enough experience and he’s too arrogant. He wouldn’t get anything done in office.”Living so far away, Robinson said she’s aware that her vantage point offers a significantly different perspective about the state of American politics compared to people living back home.“I know in some ways we might be out of touch with the reality of what’s happening for people in the U.S. and I take that into consideration, too,” she said. “Like Obamacare might look great from here, but when I look at the rates that my mother and brother are going to have to pay, I think, ‘Holy crap, that’s a lot. Your own perception is your reality and I try to keep that in mind.” By the same token, however, American expatriates said that living abroad may offer a more nuanced perspective of the political climate.“Being an expat, you become a global citizen and you start to understand political complexities from a global context,” Gilchrist said. “So when someone like Trump says he wants to monitor every Muslim who comes to America, to the average American, they might think of Pakistan or Iran, but I think of Indonesia, [Singapore’s neighbor and] the world’s largest Muslim country. You just get a broader perspective of the world.” In their absence, some expats say America has changed ― a transformation illuminated by this election. “It’s amazing to me how much more vocal and physical manifestations of racism have come out,” said Robinson, whose family lives just outside Nashville, Tennessee. “I go home every year to visit but this year was different. A lot of open-minded friends and family seemed a lot more closed-minded. Some were using racial slurs. It was wild. My childhood best friend was one of the most open-minded, caring people I knew, and I hate to call her racist but she’s become borderline racist. It was scary to me.”This election, many expats added, may determine whether or not they want to return home.“I have two children, and my wife and I have talked a lot about retuning to the U.S.,” Lazarus said. “But we’re waiting to see what happens after the election. Neither of us wants to raise children there if Trump is president.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

63,POLITICS,Asian-American Early Voting Doubled In Key Battleground States,Jessica Prois,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/asian-american-early-voting_us_58221dc3e4b0aac6248772c5,"“When it comes to battleground states, it becomes a battle of yards and inches.”",2016-11-08,"A voter, left, was assisted in the voting process by interpreter Ping Chan on Tuesday in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Key battleground states have seen a hike in early voting from Asian-Americans.Florida, Arizona, Virginia and North Carolina saw about twice as many early ballots from Asian-Americans this year compared to 2012, according to Catalist, a Democratic analytics firm. In Georgia, that number was almost triple.“It’s possible in several of these states, the Asian-American population could mean the difference between victory or defeat,” Karthick Ramakrishnan, the founder of AAPI Data, a research group that focuses on Asian-American and Pacific Islander demographics and policy, told The Huffington Post. “When it comes to battleground states, it becomes a battle of yards and inches.”The factors contributing to a jump in turnout likely include greater voter registration efforts from Asian-American advocacy groups, as well as a growing Asian-American population, said Ramakrishnan, who’s also a professor and associate dean at the School of Public Policy at the University of California, Riverside.On a local level, advocacy groups including Asian Americans Advancing Justice deployed volunteers in key places like Atlanta to host voter drives and increase registration. AAAJ members also offered to help people with limited English proficiency through the voting process. Ramakrishnan also pointed to more outreach from candidates.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have established Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) outreach groups. Clinton’s AAPI platform includes a push for more comprehensive immigration reform, an issue many Asian-Americans have said is critical to them.Trump, who announced the formation of his Asian Pacific American Advisory Committee in September, pledged to meet with the members of that group and with other AAPI organizations to discuss topics including education and employment. In total, Asian-Americans make up about 4 percent of the overall eligible voting population. They are the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S., but they have the smallest voter turnout. Forty-seven percent of eligible Asian-Americans showed up to vote in 2012, compared to 48 percent of Hispanics, 66 percent of blacks and 62 precent of whites, according to the U.S. Census. Barriers to the Asian vote include limited English proficiency, a lack of experience with the U.S. voting system and a perception that the population is too disparate.“Campaigns can be reluctant to reach out to Asian-Americans because they think the community is too diverse,” Ramakrishnan said.But he noted that’s changing rapidly, citing a quote from U.S. Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) ― who said in July that Asian-Americans have “gone from being marginalized to becoming the margin of victory.” Kimberly Yam contributed to this article.

Some events, such as extreme heat, are up to 10 times more likely to occur due to global warming.“Over time we’ve been able to build up a picture of what’s happening to the planet’s vital signs,” Maxx Dilley, director of the WMO’s climate prediction and adaptation branch, said at a news conference.Those vital signs now come from a planet in flux. Last year, the warmest in recorded history, average temperatures rose 1 degree Celsius above pre-Industrial Age levels for the first time, the WMO said. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere also hit 400 ppm for the first time in 4 million years.The WMO released its in-depth survey at the 22nd Conference of the Parties in Marrakech, the year’s largest conference centered on climate change.World leaders have pledged to do everything they can to keep the planet from warming beyond 2 degrees Celsius, the level scientists say we must stay beneath to avoid the worst effects of climate change.But some of those effects have already begun.A drought in east Africa killed nearly 260,000 people from 2010 to 2012, and superstorms like Hurricane Sandy in the U.S. in 2012 and Typhoon Haiyan in Southeast Asia in 2013 have caused billions of dollars in economic damage. The WMO also pointed to environmental changes including melting ice sheets and rising seas.“We’re scientists, so we look at the facts: The rates of ice melting and the rates of greenhouse gas increases and the rates of temperature increases, they are very serious matters,” Dilley said. Although hesitant to offer an opinion on the findings, he said, “When you take off your scientist hat and you look at it, it’s very concerning.”However, the agency said the ongoing climate summit, the first since the landmark Paris climate agreement was ratified, still fosters an era of hope.“This year we are all very inspired by the Paris agreement,” said Elena Manaenkova, deputy secretary general of the WMO. “It’s a feeling of confidence that actions are being taken.”"

She described her pride in what his administration has accomplished, and for “showing us all what intelligence, dignity and grace really look like.”And if you’re not already dreading this couple’s departure from the White House, the president’s tribute to his wife during his speech should do the trick."

Advocacy groups set up registration booths at mosques, schools, and community centers throughout the year. Imams were encouraged to preach about voting during services. A Council on American-Islamic Relations survey released in October suggested that 86 percent of all registered American Muslims planned to vote and 72 percent said they were voting for Clinton. Four percent of the survey’s 800 participants said they were voting for Trump, three percent for Jill Stein, and two percent for Gary Johnson.On social media, American Muslims shared Election Day photos and thoughts using the hashtag #MyMuslimVote.

The driveway was empty and the windows were dark. Her 3-year-old son itched to put the Hillary Clinton sticker on the door, the sticker they leave for residents who aren’t home reminding them to vote. But she didn’t want to give up so quickly. She approached the door one more time, and gave it seven serious knocks in rapid succession.Wetmore-Arkader stepped back and waited, listening for any movement inside. A crowd had started to gather behind her ― which included her two other small children, three more parents and more children ― all wearing Hillary stickers. Thirteen seconds later, the door cracked opened. A middle-aged woman caught the eye of Wetmore-Arkader and then the eager faces looming behind her. Sunday afternoons are for football and play dates, dinners after church. But it was two days before the election, and the race between Clinton and the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, had tightened. Pennsylvania was a critical battleground state and the Philadelphia suburbs like this upper-middle class enclave in Montgomery County had started to feel like the center of the universe. This Sunday was different.“There’s a lot of us, sorry,” Wetmore-Arkader said.The woman laughed.“We’re coming en masse,” Wetmore-Arkader joked. “We’re looking for Mr. Thomas.”There was no Mr. Thomas at that address. But there were three women who lived there with that last name. Wetmore-Arkader quickly figured out that she was actually looking for a Mrs. Thomas. She had the right house. Except the woman she needed was in New York. Wetmore-Arkader was undeterred. “We are just looking to make sure that she has a plan to vote and that she’s planning on voting on Tuesday,” she said.“Yes to all of the above,” the woman replied.“She knows where she’s voting?” Wetmore-Arkader asked. “She doesn’t need any further information?” She gave the woman one of the stickers, telling her to “put it somewhere she can see it.”Wetmore-Arkader, 39, had followed the script she’d been given perfectly. Just six months ago, she had been working from a different set of talking points. She’d been a huge supporter of Clinton’s opponent, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. She had phone-banked for him and promoted him to friends on Facebook and over email. It had taken her weeks, maybe even a month or two, to mourn his defeat and join the other side.Clinton had seemed to Wetmore-Arkader like just another standard politician ― especially, she said, compared to Sanders and President Barack Obama. But she started to realize that maybe she had taken Clinton for granted. “She’s like the cousin that’s at like every other Thanksgiving that you just kind of know what they’re doing on the periphery,” she said.The more Wetmore-Arkader thought about Clinton, the more she started to see things in her that she admired. Clinton set aside her career to support her husband just as she had. A year ago, Wetmore-Arkader and her husband moved from Los Angeles to Haverford, five minutes from where she was volunteering. Her husband is a doctor at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Clinton “came back stronger than anybody could imagine,” she said.After leaving the Thomas residence, Wetmore-Arkader walked back to the street with another volunteer, Lainey Quinones, 38, who also had first supported Sanders. Quinones also felt like she didn’t really know Clinton beyond her basic resume, the real and imagined scandals and sexist labels. “It made me realize that I don’t see her,” she said. “And we don’t see women in politics the same way. Even as a woman, I realize you hear these little catchphrases and you just absorb them.”Like “nasty woman.”Quinones began to rethink Clinton while watching the candidate keep her cool through the daylong Benghazi hearing in late October of last year. She was home taking care of her six-month-old daughter. “I watched it,” she said. “I was like, I would be sweating bullets. That’s pressure under fire.”The two reached another house just as the residents pulled up in their SUV. “Are you finding a lot of Trump supporters?” the woman in the passenger seat asked. The volunteers were looking for her. The Clinton operation was targeting infrequent voters. She hadn’t voted in the last election, so she had made their list. “I said, you don’t vote once, they’re going to know that,” the SUV’s driver joked. Just a short drive away, volunteers had turned their garage into a war room. In another home, a contingent of Clinton supporters had converted their living room into a campaign phone-banking operation. Volunteers had been dispatched all over the county to quiet streets dotted with high-end SUVs and Tudors that looked like they came out of the pages of fairy tales. Everyone was serious but upbeat. Everyone had a clipboard they needed to code depending on who was home and what they said about their intentions to vote.At the headquarters where Wetmore-Arkader picked up her door-knocking route, Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) stopped by to give a pep talk. There was no way, he said, Clinton would get as many votes in Philadelphia as Obama had in 2012. But he believed she could make up the difference in the suburbs. “You’re directly responsible for that ― no pressure,” he said. “I really believe these four counties ― and Montgomery’s the biggest ― are the foremost important counties in the country right now, so keep going. Don’t let me stop you.”Wetmore-Arkader didn’t need any more convincing. “I started sitting down with my own personal history in politics, just being raised in a generation of men and being so overwhelmed with emotion when Barack Obama went into office and having just had my first child and realizing that she was growing up in a world where she’s only known a black man to be the president and I thought, ‘Why am I not backing a woman?’ Because then my children in their lifetime for the first 12 years of their life will only know a black man and a woman being president of their country,” she explained. “It’s an emotionally overwhelming thing for me because it’s not my history.”For the past six weeks, Wetmore-Arkader had been volunteering for Clinton. She said another former Bernie supporter who had become a Clinton convert inspired her. He’d door-knocked with his kids and posted pictures of their activities on Facebook. When she goes out campaigning, she said she makes sure to take her 8-year-old daughter. “I’m going to take her into the voting booth with me on Tuesday and she’s going to push the button,” she said. “So when she grows up I can say that she’s actually the one who voted for Hillary Clinton.”"

71,POLITICS,Supreme Court Refuses To Block Trump Team's 'Poll Watching' Crusade In Ohio,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-trump-poll-watching_us_58208311e4b0d9ce6fbd192b,Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that state law already prohibits voter intimidation.,2016-11-07,"Either way, somebody will be upset with the Supreme Court.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582083e1150000d80453218d.jpeg?cache=GADq6p2E8e&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Racing against the clock, the Supreme Court on Monday denied a last-minute request to restore a sweeping court order that might have kept the Donald Trump campaign from mobilizing poll-watching efforts in Ohio. Democrats argued that those efforts could intimidate and disenfranchise minority voters.The one-page order didn’t include any reasoning or identify the justices who voted down the request. But the court is often reluctant to intervene so close to an election. The justices traditionally want to avoid confusing voters or poll workers ― a concern particularly relevant in the many states, like Ohio, where people have already voted early.In an unusual statement, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg broke from her colleagues’ silence and explained her vote ― possibly to head off criticism that she didn’t recuse herself from the case after her controversial comments about Trump over the summer.“Mindful that Ohio law proscribes voter intimidation ... I vote to deny the application,” Ginsburg wrote. Lawyers for the Ohio Democratic Party filed the request with the Supreme Court late Sunday night, after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit sided with the Trump campaign and put on hold a broad set of prohibitions that essentially would have shut down any attempts by Trump allies to monitor polling places.Although poll watching is not illegal, voter intimidation is. In a series of quick-moving lawsuits last week, state Democratic parties in several states argued that the Trump campaign, state Republican parties and controversial Trump adviser Roger Stone were crossing the line into illegal voter intimidation.After losing the first round in Ohio on Friday, the Trump campaign’s legal team cried foul before the 6th Circuit, contending that Democrats didn’t have evidence of actual voter intimidation and were relying solely on campaign statements and heated rhetoric to make their case.In-person voter fraud, in truth, is virtually nonexistent. But Trump has repeatedly called on his supporters to monitor “certain areas,” suggesting that Democratic sympathizers might vote several times and steal the election from him. Stone, for his part, has been actively engaged with the group Stop the Steal, which is also named in the Ohio lawsuit as a recruitment initiative that may lead to voter intimidation.The Supreme Court didn’t express any views on the merits of these allegations in Ohio.Besides the proximity to Election Day, it’s also likely the justices didn’t second-guess the appeals court because the case directly implicates the Trump campaign. The justices may have wished to avoid a ruling that might be seen as siding with one candidate ― although pundits will undoubtedly read its lack of action as doing just that.The Supreme Court’s ruling is merely the latest legal setback that Democrats have faced in battleground states in their efforts to counteract Trump’s talk of vote rigging. State Democratic parties filed similar lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Michigan, but those cases either are still pending or resulted in adverse rulings. In a related development Saturday, a federal judge in New Jersey declined to impose sanctions on the Republican National Committee over alleged violations of a 1982 consent decree, which has kept the GOP under court supervision for organizing so-called ballot security measures in urban areas. But the judge left the door open for the Democratic National Committee to come back after the election and submit evidence of illicit activity from around the country ― and based on that, argue for an extension of the consent decree.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The Republican nominee simply insisted that “rank-and-file” FBI agents would continue to pursue the case.But at Trump’s fifth and final campaign rally of the day Sunday, an event in Virginia that did not begin until just after midnight due to his packed multi-state schedule, the sentiment toward Comey, who is a Republican, was anything but placid. Voters in the crowd of thousands, who had gathered in the cold to catch a glimpse of the GOP nominee at the Loudoun County Fairgrounds, said politics were at play and that Clinton deserved to be impeached.“I think it’s disgraceful. I think he’s essentially destroyed the reputation of the FBI,” said Connie Morrissey, a West Indies immigrant who works in finance, expressing disbelief that the FBI was able to sift through more than 650,000 newly discovered emails in nine days. “Somehow she is not in prison. She’s not going to be indicted. That tells me, as far as HIllary Clinton is concerned, there is one law for her, and one law for the rest of us.”Many supporters said they saw something nefarious behind Comey’s decision to close the case.“I’m thinking somebody threatened him or something because he seemed to have backed out in the end there. There have been a lot of people killed over the Clintons, over the years,” claimed Mike Lennett, a courier from Fairfax.James Flanagan, a former worker for a traveling carnival, suggested Comey was somehow bought off, telling HuffPost that “payoff” was involved.“I think she gives everyone her money,” added Andrea Simpson from Springfield.Negative attitudes toward Comey even seemed to extend to those in the crowd who are employed by the government. Loudoun County is the fastest-growing locality in the Virginia Commonwealth, thanks in part to the mix of affluent communities that sit in close proximity to Washington, D.C., as well as a rapidly growing minority population.A woman in the crowd who identified herself only as Krista said she felt sorry for Comey. Krista works at the Department of Justice, and like many Trump supporters, feels the system she is part of is “rigged” against the New York businessman.“I think he’s honestly a political stooge,” she said of Comey. “I think he sways ― whatever Obama tells him to do, he does. It’s really disappointing. I think the whole system is so rigged and corrupt. Trump is the most refreshing politician I’ve seen. I just want to see him win. They’re all corrupt.”Virginia Jordan, a 69-year old public defender from Orange County, said she believed that “pressure” had been put on Comey “the whole way.” Still, she held out hope that the former secretary of state would face charges over the Clinton Foundation.“He’s only said they won’t do anything to her about the emails. They haven’t said that about the Foundation,” she told HuffPost.Taking the stage nearly three hours late, Trump marveled at the crowd still remaining at such a late hour. The barn was filled to its 2,000-person capacity, and hundreds more supporters lined up outside, craning their heads to see the candidate. He called the speech a “midnight special” and mocked Clinton over her schedule.“This is a marathon. Hillary right now is fast asleep,” he said, before launching into his traditional stump speech.The late play by Trump’s campaign for a state like Virginia is a quixotic one. While the state has gone for both parties in recent elections, Clinton has led Trump there in nearly every poll conducted since the beginning of the campaign. Clinton currently maintains an edge of 6 points in the state, according to the final poll from the Wason Center for Public Policy. Some in the crowd said they believed Trump could turn Virginia red again. Others, however, were less enthusiastic.“Northern Virginia is so blue,” said Krista. “Even with this huge turnout, I just don’t see it. He’s been down in the polls, and all that. I don’t think he’s going to win Virginia.”“I’m hoping it’ll be like Brexit,” added Jordan, referring to the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union. “I’m just hoping the silent majority will rise up and say ‘no more.’”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
73,POLITICS,Waiting Forever To Vote? This Website Wants To Hand You Free Pizza.,Max Greenwood,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-election-pizza-polls_us_5820d73be4b0d9ce6fbdca8f,“We’re just trying to bring a little bit of joy to people waiting to vote.”,2016-11-07,A hot slice of heaven for voters who face grueling lines at the polls and growling stomachs.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5820dcb91600002e002c8e9e.jpeg?cache=zTZKVSNmvk&ops=crop_0_158_5058_3098%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Hot, fresh pizzas are on their way to fatigued voters in long lines at the polls, thanks to two Portland, Oregon-based web developers.Pizza to the Polls, a nonpartisan initiative to get free pizza to hungry voters, launched Sunday in hopes of remedying at least one aspect of voter frustration. The message is simple: It doesn’t matter whom you vote for, as long as you vote.The brainchild of Scott Duncombe and Noah Manger grew out of the remains of the Americans Against Insecure Billionaires With Tiny Hands PAC, an anti-Donald Trump super PAC launched earlier this year by a Portland activist.Here’s how it works: Voters can report long lines at their precincts through Pizza to the Polls’ website, using the precinct’s address and a social media post about the voter line. Duncombe and Manger’s group, using donated money, then orders a pizza from a nearby shop, which delivers the pie right into the hands of the voter.“I had been doing work with nonpartisan civic voter engagement groups for a long time, so I had been on the ground at a lot of polling places with lines in, like, Colorado and Montana, and I felt the joy of handing people, in line or volunteering, a pizza,” said Duncombe, a software engineer for a financial tech company. “I was reflecting with some of those friends who were doing this too, and we started thinking, ‘I wonder how we can get pizza to more people.’”Duncombe, who also served as the PAC’s treasurer, said Pizza to the Polls is his way of putting the PAC’s leftover money to a “friendlier effort.”“After I became treasurer, I had access to that fund, and we didn’t have any plans for it,” he said. “This felt like a good way to make sure that money went to a good cause.”So Duncombe partnered with his friend Manger and used the PAC’s remaining money ― about $2,500, according to Duncombe ― to start Pizza to the Polls. As of Monday morning, it had gotten about $1,000 in donations and given away about $500 worth of pizza at polling locations in Ohio and Florida.While Pizza to the Polls came out of an anti-Trump PAC, Duncombe said there’s no political strings attached when it comes to the pizza.“It’s for everyone who’s there: voters, poll workers, volunteers. We’re just trying to bring a little bit of joy to people waiting to vote.”"
74,POLITICS,Voting Is A Roadmap To Freedom In This North Carolina Black Church,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/voting-rights-freedom-church_us_581fa289e4b0aac624851fe8,Members of Ezekiel AME Zion Church are eager to cast ballots to make their voices heard.,2016-11-07,"A voter casts his ballot during early voting at the Beatties Ford Library in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Oct. 20, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58179de7150000b700530dde.jpeg?cache=ZcOqmRqRUq&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LEXINGTON, N.C. ― In the pulpit of Ezekiel AME Zion Church, Rev. Allen Stimpson kneels.“We thank you for giving us a wonderful president,” the reverend says during prayer on Sunday morning, adding that as “we face a new era,” he prays everyone will “make the right choice.”Election Day is approaching, and Stimpson, like many other black pastors, is making sure members of his congregation have the tools they need to get out and cast a ballot.Many Americans find political as well as spiritual guidance in their places of worship, with faith often determining how people view issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. In the black church, though, the connection between faith and politics is especially intimate, particularly when it comes time to vote. It isn’t just about the issues ― it’s about black folks getting out and voting for whomever we believe is going to recognize our humanity.“We paid a dear price for the freedom to vote and, had it not been for [that] freedom, we’d still be in shackles,” Stimpson, 64, told The Huffington Post.“The role of the church is to inform the people about who the candidates are and making sure they’re able to get to the polls,” he continued. “We do not tell them how to vote, but we just make sure all the issues are on the table ― the issues that affect the church [and] affect the community.”Uplifting civil rights is in the blood of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Often called “The Freedom Church,” the denomination was born when black Christians fled mixed congregations to form their own sanctuaries. Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass are well-known freedom fighters who called the church home. That connection between faith and freedom is what brought me home to Ezekiel, my family’s church. Today, in this swing state with historically low black voter turnout, black churches like Ezekiel see voting as one way to continue the fight for civil rights. In that spirit, Ezekiel has held voter registration drives and hosted canvassers who inform the congregation about their voting rights. The church will also provide transportation to the polls.My grandmother, Virginia Evans, is a 69-year-old registered Democrat who has been voting since she was in her twenties ― right after the Voting Rights Act was signed to prohibit racial discrimination at the polls. This history is what makes voting such an obvious choice for her.“Our forefathers have fought for us to have the right to vote,” she said. “Also, we have a voice in our country ― for what it’s going to be and what it’s not going to be.”Mother Amanda Little, a 69-year-old registered Democrat in Ezekiel’s congregation, cast her first ballot in the 1970s. She feels the same way.“To vote is a privilege for everybody, because, a while back, our black generation couldn’t vote,” she said. “So it’s a privilege that we are able to vote and give our voices to whatever that is needed in the Democratic Party or the Republican Party.”Black voters, especially women, can turn the tide of an election. That’s likely why both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump have made most of their pitches to black voters in church.It’s also why some members of the Republican Party in North Carolina don’t seem to want citizens like my grandmother and Mother Little to cast ballots.Last week, the North Carolina NAACP sued the state after election officials in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties allegedly removed voters from the rolls because campaign mailers sent to their addresses were returned as undeliverable.On Friday, U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs ordered the county election boards to restore the registrations, saying removing voters from the rolls en masse is a violation of the National Voter Registration Act.At least 3,500 voters have been removed from the rolls in the past 90 days, according to Penda Hair, an attorney for the NAACP. And black voters have been disproportionately affected by the cancellations: In Beaufort County, black voters account for over 65 percent of the cancelled registrations, even though black people make up only 25.9 percent of that county’s population.The NAACP argued that the cancellations represented an attempt by the Republican Party to suppress the black vote, leading to early voting turnout that is lower this year than it was in 2012.“We’ve not seen this kind of intentional suppression since the days of Jim Crow,” said Rev. William Barber, the president of the NAACP, on Friday.After a memo from the North Carolina GOP urged “party line changes to early voting,” 23 county election boards in the state voted to reduce early voting hours. Nine boards dropped Sunday voting altogether. These changes hurt black voters the most, since they tend to vote on Sundays and make use of early voting.Ezekiel’s home is in Davidson County, a very red county that did not opt out of Sunday voting, and the congregation members who spoke with me said they hadn’t had any issues casting ballots.“I haven’t faced nothing, because it’s so easy to voice here,” said Mother Lucy Knotts, an 83-year-old registered Democrat. “We don’t have no problems here in Lexington. We just go and vote.”“I just enjoy going voting,” she added with a laugh. “It’s one of the things we can do.”Stimpson, however, had a different experience in East Bend, North Carolina.This year, his early voting site had been changed, and the 64-year-old had to walk upstairs to cast his ballot ― something he’s never had to do before. Walking up steps is one way elderly and disabled voters can be discouraged from casting ballots.“They’re trying to stop the Democrats from getting into office because, if they do, we may have a better government,” my grandmother said of the alleged suppression efforts. “And everybody will have their equal rights and their equal opinion as to what is happening to our government.”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Edgar Hoover.,2016-11-07,James Comey explains his decision not to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton in July.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FBI Director James Comey, with his surprise announcement Sunday that the bureau had found nothing new in the latest version of its investigation into Hillary Clinton, has now managed to infuriate both halves of the country, convincing them the nation’s premier law enforcement agency has unfairly tilted the campaign. Comey’s entrance into the election, according to Tim Weiner, author of Enemies, the definitive history of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, has set the FBI back to the dark days of J. Edgar Hoover, when the agency operated outside the confines of Congress, the White House or the law itself.For Weiner, too much attention has been focused on Comey’s motives for announcing publicly that the FBI had discovered new emails related to Clinton’s private email server. Instead, what matters is the outcome: chaos.“There’s a phrase in the law, ‘knew or should have known.’ It’s pretty all-encompassing. James Comey knew or should have known what he was doing last Friday, and what the effect might be,” Weiner said in an interview that occurred before Comey re-entered the election by announcing that nothing new had been found.“Nobody wants to go back to the days of J. Edgar Hoover. Comey has consistently said that the FBI can never go back to those dark days. But here we are. Somewhere far off, pulling wings off flies in a dark starry chamber in the sky, J. Edgar Hoover is smiling.” Comey’s downfall, said Weiner (who is not related to Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin’s estranged husband), was the same independent streak that made progressives such fans of his when he stood up to President Bush in refusing to re-authorize a secret mass surveillance program.“Mr. Comey has a record dating back to 2004 of challenging and defying higher authorities, including President George W. Bush in the famous Stellar Wind matter, and is clearly a man who prides himself as a pillar of moral rectitude, who is willing to defy presidents and, in this case, his superiors at the justice department,” Weiner said.The problem comes when Comey doesn’t recognize that the modern FBI is supposed to operate within constitutional limits, such as on Friday, when revelations surfaced that the FBI director had defied Justice Department protocol as well as guidance from the attorney general in updating Congress on a potential new investigation.“If you don’t have an FBI that looks to the law and the constitution and the strictures of the Justice Department, then you are going back to the days of J. Edgar Hoover and you are putting our 240-year experiment with American democracy at risk,” he said. “The law is not what the FBI says it is. The law is what the courts and the constitution says it is.”Undoing the damage will take some time. “To quote Richard Nixon’s chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, who went to prison for his own acts of political warfare, ‘once the toothpaste is out of the tube, it’s hard to get it back in,’” Weiner said. “You can’t unring that bell.”The unprecedented role of the law enforcement agency in the election has left it a less credible arbiter if problems emerge on Election Day, he argued. “The statue of justice has a blindfold and a sword, but most importantly, a scale. This whole past week has thrown the scale out of whack. That is bad, win, lose or draw on Tuesday,” he said. “And God help us all if the loser on Tuesday decides that he is going to defy the results, not in Florida or Ohio but in the United States in the Electoral College.”Having studied the more than 100-year history of the bureau, Weiner said that he was surprised not to see GOP nominee Donald Trump himself pursued.“Here’s the surprise to me, as somebody who has studied the conduct of the FBI for years,” he said. “You have a candidate in this election whose campaign manager came under investigation for some very unusual and profitable connections in a foreign country. You also have a candidate who appears, on the evidence produced by excellent reporters, to have bent the tax laws of the US to the breaking point. You have a candidate who is scheduled to stand trial in a civil racketeering case, involving a purported university, and you have a candidate who has bragged about a pattern of sexual assault. Where’s the long arm of the law there?”The Trump campaign’s efforts at voter suppression, he said, also may merit a closer look. “You have a campaign that appears set to act in defiance of what’s left of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on Election Day. Where’s the long arm of the law to protect the American people there?”Comey’s problems have been long in the making. He trapped himself this summer when he decided to announce the non-findings of the Clinton investigation in a thoroughly public manner, replete with condemnations of Clinton. Having done so, he felt bound to be unusually public with the latest incremental development in October, when a new batch of emails was found on Anthony Weiner’s computer. And, presumably, he felt similarly bound on Saturday when the agency learned that nothing new had been found. Comey reportedly worried that the information about the new emails would either leak or emerge in subsequent House Republican investigations, leading people to wonder if the election would have gone to Trump if Comey had only been more forthcoming. At least now the country need not deal with that counterfactual.Comey will have to live with results of his decision. “Comey is a man with a record of doing what he believes is the right thing no matter what his superiors tell him, rightly or wrongly. And in this case, I surmise, he felt he was damned if he did, and damned if he didn’t,” Weiner said. “But now he’s damned.”"

78,POLITICS,Some Of 2016’s Biggest Polls Are Works In Progress,Natalie Jackson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-50-state-polls_us_5820d64ee4b0d9ce6fbdc7ce,"Fifty-state polls are the hot new thing this year, but pollsters admit they’re still learning how to use them.",2016-11-07,"Members of the community came to Univision's Vote For Your America Community Celebration on Nov. 3, 2016, in Norwalk, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s a new kind of poll in the mix this year, an approach known as the 50-state internet poll. It’s notable because it provides an unprecedented trove of data on the status of the presidential election in every single state ― including the deep-red and solid-blue states that no one ever bothers to watch closely.The outcome of the vote in those places isn’t really in doubt. But thanks to new developments in polling, we actually have an idea of just how big each candidate’s advantage or disadvantage is in the underpolled states. Three pollsters have embarked on 50-state polls this year, surveying thousands of voters in each state and releasing their findings regularly. The most ambitious 50-state poll comes from SurveyMonkey, which has released daily updates on every state for the last two full weeks of the campaign. UPI/CVoter has released updates for every state for the last couple of weeks as well. And the Ipsos/Reuters poll has been polling most states for a couple of months. But why do pollsters bother to survey all the states if we know how some will turn out?“That’s where the world is going,” said Cliff Young, U.S. president of Ipsos Public Affairs. “The world is going toward large N-sizes in polls as well as aggregating. It’s only natural that any single pollster will opt for larger and larger samples.” “Taking on an election and correctly projecting the outcomes is a way to demonstrate the power of the platform,” said Mark Blumenthal, SurveyMonkey’s head of election polling and a former Huffington Post editor.The 50-state trackers aren’t giving you completely new data every day. They’re giving you the past several days’ data with a couple hundred more cases added on from yesterday’s polls. (At the same time, they’re dropping older data to ensure things stay current.) Most of these are what we call “rolling” averages, showing the average level of support for each candidate across a span of several days. Some trackers use a data window of as little as three days, while others are looking at several weeks’ worth of polls at any given time.“There’s some risk involved, but I think that’s where the world is headed,” Young said.The risk Young refers to is that the concept of surveying enough voters to create separate polls in all 50 states ― rather than just a national poll ― is new. In order to produce estimates for each state, the pollster needs at least a few hundred interviews per state. Telephone polls are too costly a way to obtain that kind of sample size, but online polls are cheaper and able to handle the volume more easily.The question is how well online polls are able to cover every state. These polls work by recruiting people to a “panel,” meaning they agree to take surveys in exchange for some type of reward, like a small amount of money or points toward prizes. Pollsters try to match the people available in the sample to the known demographics of whatever population they want to represent in the poll. That means the panel needs enough people of all demographic groups to be able to target a representative sample. Panels have to be very large and well-curated to achieve this in every one of the 50 states. The pollsters doing these 50-state web polls are quick to acknowledge the untested nature of the work. “This year we shifted from [telephone surveys] to online for our U.S. polls,” said Yashwant Deshmukh, founder and director of CVoter International. “We just wanted to cover as much as possible in order to learn on what worked and what didn’t at macro and micro levels in our model.”Young similarly emphasized that Ipsos’ polls are a work in progress. “We’re still learning how to optimize the sample,” he said.Blumenthal, too, spoke of a learning process. “SurveyMonkey has done lots of work on all aspects of survey research,” he said. “We’re learning from that to make the best estimates we can. Everything we’re doing is about learning lessons to enhance the experience of our customers ― both the tools that they have and the data quality.”A couple of other online polling firms, YouGov and Morning Consult, have used polls plus a statistical technique called multilevel regression and poststratification, or MRP, to project the election in every state. MRP is a way of using data at the national level to estimate opinion in the states. Instead of relying solely on how people say they will vote in the survey, MRP incorporates information about the respondents and the states they live in that’s known to predict vote choice. Because these methods use other data besides polls, we haven’t included them in the HuffPost Pollster charts. Young predicts we’ll see a lot more of these 50-state polls in the future. But for now, he said, testing out the method is a way to get a leg up on the competition. “We’re learning this electoral cycle,” he said. “And next cycle, we’ll have it in good shape.”"

Wrong. Hillary Clinton wants to mess up your football, too. Hillary wants to change the name of the Redskins.”“Hillary’s priorities,” it concludes, “are not your priorities.”Clinton was among the political leaders ― including President Barack Obama and at least 50 U.S. senators ― that called on Washington owner Daniel Snyder to change the controversial name. Many Native Americans have opposed the name for decades, with prominent Native American groups labeling it a “dictionary-defined racial slur.” Trump, in contrast, has said he supports keeping the name. Watch the ad above.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The only American currently in space has cast his vote, NASA announced Monday.Astronaut Shane Kimbrough officially filed his electronic absentee ballot from the International Space Station days ago, after Kate Rubins submitted her ballot before returning to Earth last week. Thanks to a 1997 Texas law, the two Americans ― registered as residents of Houston, where the Johnson Space Center is located ― can vote while in orbit.The astronauts listed their addresses as “low-orbit Earth,” which is where their spacecraft circles. NASA actively encourages its members in space to participate in elections with the motto “Vote While You Float.”Logistically, voting is a long process for people who spend years away from Earth. The astronauts must decide which elections they’ll vote in a year ahead of time, and receive the electronic ballots six months prior to the election. Rubins planned ahead and took her ballot with her to space in July. “There are some fantastic folks on the ground that got me an absentee ballot before I launched,” Rubins said in an interview. “It’s incredibly important for us to vote in all of the elections.”Although the astronauts couldn’t get the immersive experience of voting in the election, at least they avoided the long lines at the polls.

As many mental health experts have observed, the turmoil of the 2016 presidential race has caused many people ― especially women ― significant emotional distress. More than half of Americans say the election is a very or somewhat significant source of stress, according to an American Psychological Association survey. One therapist even coined the term “Election Stress Disorder” to describe what she was seeing in so many of her patients. But as Americans casts their ballots on Tuesday, one nonpartisan event at polling sites across the nation encourages voters to seek out a moment of calm and compassionate reflection in the midst of the chaos. The Elevate the Vote initiative is bringing “meditation flash mobs” to nearly 1,000 polling locations in all 50 states to “[elevate] the consciousness of every U.S. voter on election day.” The synchronized meditation will be broadcast live to smartphones around the globe at 6:00 p.m. Eastern. More than 25,000 people have pledged to join in person or online, according to the event’s organizers.The goal of the flash mobs is not only to soothe election anxiety, but to overcome divisiveness and separation through mindfulness, according to Jacob Devaney, one of the event’s organizers and a co-founder of the nonprofit media organization Unify.“People are pissed off, they’re angry, they’re hurt and they feel hopeless ... So we thought, why not really try to hold a space for healing the divide that came from this whole bitter process?” Devaney told The Huffington Post.“Whoever becomes our next Senate and president, we’re going to need mental clarity, inner peace and compassion,” he added. It’s now been proven scientifically that meditation can encourage these qualities by reducing anxiety, increasing focus and encouraging empathy and compassion. Elevate the Vote isn’t the only event aiming to bring a little more mindfulness to Election Day. Buddhist teacher and author Ethan Nichtern will be leading a guided compassion meditation and discussion at his Election Night Dharma Gathering in Manhattan. For those who are unable to attend personally, the event will be live-streamed on Shambhala Meditation Center of New York’s Facebook page. On Nov. 9, the Rubin Museum of Art in New York will host a special “Election Exhale” meditation session. So remember to cast your vote tomorrow, first and foremost. And once your ballot’s in, take a few minutes to meditate ― whether in a flash mob at the polls or in the quiet of your own home ― to combat election-related stress and find a little more compassion for others. “I’d like to see us feel connected,” said Devaney. “We need to see through the divisiveness and recognize our common humanity with other people.”Elevate the Vote’s organizers point to the 1776 inscription on the Great Seal of the United States: “E Pluribus Unum,” or “Out of many, we are one.” It’s a reminder we could all use right about now. Head to the Elevate the Vote’s website to find or organize an event in your city.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

But analysts said the voters who turned out in historic numbers this weekend have likely given Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, a critical edge heading into Election Day.“I do believe this thing is tracking towards a Clinton victory,” wrote Steve Schale, a respected Florida Democratic strategist who has been following early returns closely. A Republican consultant in the state, David Johnson, said he believed Clinton could win by as much as three points, thanks in part to the shortcomings of his own party’s get-out-the-vote efforts.“We used to have a great statewide operation,” Johnson told the Naples Daily News. “Now I’m not convinced that’s going on, because I don’t see the evidence. And I see it on the Democrats’ and their allies’ side.”Roughly 6.4 million people voted early in Florida, a record high number that will likely make up about two-thirds of this year’s total electorate, experts said. President Barack Obama won the state in 2012 by just 74,000 votes.One week ago, early returns had Democrats fretting. Turnout among black voters was lagging, and while Latinos were submitting ballots in large numbers, so were white voters seen as more likely to support Trump.Those trends shifted during the last four days. Black turnout jumped substantially, boosted by Obama’s multiple Florida visits and Sunday’s “souls to the polls” voting drive led by black churches.Black turnout in Florida will end up higher than in 2012, Daniel Smith, a University of Florida political science professor and election data analyst, predicted on Sunday.Meanwhile, the state’s Latino turnout accelerated. The number of Latinos who voted in person through Saturday was up fully 100 percent from 2012. It appears likely that more Latinos in Florida will have voted early in 2016 than they voted overall in 2012.Smith also noted that 36 percent of the 907,000 Latinos who have voted this year didn’t vote at all in 2012. “That’s a full 12 points higher than whites, and will likely be the key to who wins the presidency,” he said.“There is no question in my mind,” Schale said, “that the electorate will be more diverse [this year] than 2012.” If that’s right, and turnout levels stay high, it’s “hard to see a path for Trump,” he added.Over 53,000 ballots were cast on Sunday alone in Miami-Dade, Florida’s most populous county and a Democratic stronghold, smashing the previous all-time daily record of 42,810 that had been set on Friday.Well over 80 percent of Miami-Dade residents are Latino or black, and total early voting in the county went up 61 percent compared to 2012. In Broward, the state’s second most populous county, a record-setting Sunday capped off an early voting period that saw returns increase 47 percent from 2012. Democratic-leaning Orange County also set a single-day turnout record on Sunday.Slightly more registered Democrats than Republicans have voted in Florida thus far, but Democrats’ advantage is lower than it was at this point in 2012 ― and historically, more Republicans vote on Election Day in Florida.Yet analysts said Democrats should receive a larger-than-normal boost this year from voters with no party affiliation, who are expected to make up one-fifth of the electorate. In 2016, that bloc of voters has been significantly less white and more Latino and Caribbean than the electorate as a whole.Correction: An earlier version of this story identified Miami-Dade and Broward as Florida’s largest counties. They are the state’s most populous counties, but not, in geographic terms, the largest. This story was also updated Monday morning with new information about Florida’s early voting returns.

87,THE WORLDPOST,Philippine President Duterte's Beef With The U.S. May Be More Personal Than Political,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rodrigo-duterte-us-philippines-relations_us_58122414e4b0390e69ce8869,Rodrigo Duterte's inflammatory rhetoric doesn't mean an end to the 70-year alliance.,2016-11-07,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte inspects Japan's coast guard drills in Yokohama, Japan, in October.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58123e03190000b800c2f65e.jpeg?cache=vbRxmM8L9Q&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the five months since Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte took office, he has seemingly done all he can to dismantle the 70-year alliance between his country and the United States. From declaring he wants all U.S. troops out of the Philippines within two years to calling President Barack Obama a “son of a whore,” Duterte is a persistent headache for Washington.The Philippine president’s anti-U.S. rhetoric has become even more pronounced in recent weeks. During two trips abroad last month, Duterte denounced America’s political influence and vowed a pivot toward China. In Beijing on Oct. 20, he stated, “I announce my separation from the United States.” But although Duterte routinely states his dislike of the United States’ presence in the Philippines, it’s not yet clear that his bluster will lead to any drastic changes in the alliance. Philippine officials often walk back their president’s drastic announcements, and many of Duterte’s long-standing disagreements with the U.S. have little to do with politics.“Duterte’s own personal interactions with Americans and U.S. officials in the Philippines have given him a personal set of grievances toward the United States that mixes with the intellectual,” Malcolm Cook, a senior fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told The WorldPost.Duterte’s animosity toward the U.S. extends back before he was elected president in May. He has spoken publicly about previously being denied a visa to travel to the U.S. to visit a girlfriend, and described his personal hatred of America in interviews during his campaign. One prominent source of Duterte’s dislike of U.S. influence in the Philippines is an incident that occurred while he was mayor of Davao City. In 2003, an explosion at the Evergreen Hotel in Davao and the mysterious set of events that followed angered Duterte.The blast happened in the room of an American man, Michael Terrence Meiring, who escaped prosecution and fled the country shortly after. Philippine officials claimed FBI agents aided in his escape, and conspiracy theories of Meiring being linked to the CIA flourished. Duterte viewed the case as symptomatic of the United States’ negative influence in the country. In addition to the events that Duterte takes as personal affronts, Cook said, the president comes from an ideological background that views American colonialism and influence in the Philippines as the root cause of many of the problems facing the country today. Duterte’s dislike of the U.S. is an anomaly in the Philippines, however, where the vast majority of the population holds a favorable view of America. A 2012 Pew Research Center survey puts Philippine support for the U.S. at 92 percent ― almost 10 points higher than the U.S. views itself.Duterte enjoys similar levels of support, but his presidency is still in its early stages and a major shift away from the U.S. could affect his popularity. Previous administrations, most recently President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, also attempted to gain more foreign policy autonomy. These attempts largely failed to break the Philippine-U.S. interdependence, according to Cook. So far, most of Duterte’s tangible changes in policy have been minor or disadvantaged the Philippines more than the United States. On Monday, he canceled an order to buy 26,000 police rifles from the U.S. ― a sale that Washington had already halted over concerns about the rise in extrajudicial killings. Duterte’s announcements that would mark a major shift, such as removing all troops from the country or calling for a separation from the U.S., are often framed as personal statements about what he advocates, but not necessarily what he plans for the Philippines. “The assumption that whatever the president says ... is government policy, doesn’t apply here,” Cook said. But even as experts are skeptical that Duterte would actually make any long-term, drastic changes to the alliance between the U.S. and the Philippines, it is clear that some of his existing policies present challenges to the relationship.Duterte’s brutal drug war, which has killed at least 2,300 people since he took office, has made him a target of international criticism and strained diplomatic ties. On Saturday, police shot to death an imprisoned mayor who Duterte had claimed was involved in the drug trade.

88,THE WORLDPOST,Philippine President Duterte's Beef With The U.S. May Be More Personal Than Political,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rodrigo-duterte-us-philippines-relations_us_58122414e4b0390e69ce8869,Rodrigo Duterte's inflammatory rhetoric doesn't mean an end to the 70-year alliance.,2016-11-07,Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (center) and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a welcoming ceremony in Beijing. Duterte has been on a charm offensive toward China.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582097e21600002f002c8d36.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the five months since Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte took office, he has seemingly done all he can to dismantle the 70-year alliance between his country and the United States. From declaring he wants all U.S. troops out of the Philippines within two years to calling President Barack Obama a “son of a whore,” Duterte is a persistent headache for Washington.The Philippine president’s anti-U.S. rhetoric has become even more pronounced in recent weeks. During two trips abroad last month, Duterte denounced America’s political influence and vowed a pivot toward China. In Beijing on Oct. 20, he stated, “I announce my separation from the United States.” But although Duterte routinely states his dislike of the United States’ presence in the Philippines, it’s not yet clear that his bluster will lead to any drastic changes in the alliance. Philippine officials often walk back their president’s drastic announcements, and many of Duterte’s long-standing disagreements with the U.S. have little to do with politics.“Duterte’s own personal interactions with Americans and U.S. officials in the Philippines have given him a personal set of grievances toward the United States that mixes with the intellectual,” Malcolm Cook, a senior fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told The WorldPost.Duterte’s animosity toward the U.S. extends back before he was elected president in May. He has spoken publicly about previously being denied a visa to travel to the U.S. to visit a girlfriend, and described his personal hatred of America in interviews during his campaign. One prominent source of Duterte’s dislike of U.S. influence in the Philippines is an incident that occurred while he was mayor of Davao City. In 2003, an explosion at the Evergreen Hotel in Davao and the mysterious set of events that followed angered Duterte.The blast happened in the room of an American man, Michael Terrence Meiring, who escaped prosecution and fled the country shortly after. Philippine officials claimed FBI agents aided in his escape, and conspiracy theories of Meiring being linked to the CIA flourished. Duterte viewed the case as symptomatic of the United States’ negative influence in the country. In addition to the events that Duterte takes as personal affronts, Cook said, the president comes from an ideological background that views American colonialism and influence in the Philippines as the root cause of many of the problems facing the country today. Duterte’s dislike of the U.S. is an anomaly in the Philippines, however, where the vast majority of the population holds a favorable view of America. A 2012 Pew Research Center survey puts Philippine support for the U.S. at 92 percent ― almost 10 points higher than the U.S. views itself.Duterte enjoys similar levels of support, but his presidency is still in its early stages and a major shift away from the U.S. could affect his popularity. Previous administrations, most recently President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, also attempted to gain more foreign policy autonomy. These attempts largely failed to break the Philippine-U.S. interdependence, according to Cook. So far, most of Duterte’s tangible changes in policy have been minor or disadvantaged the Philippines more than the United States. On Monday, he canceled an order to buy 26,000 police rifles from the U.S. ― a sale that Washington had already halted over concerns about the rise in extrajudicial killings. Duterte’s announcements that would mark a major shift, such as removing all troops from the country or calling for a separation from the U.S., are often framed as personal statements about what he advocates, but not necessarily what he plans for the Philippines. “The assumption that whatever the president says ... is government policy, doesn’t apply here,” Cook said. But even as experts are skeptical that Duterte would actually make any long-term, drastic changes to the alliance between the U.S. and the Philippines, it is clear that some of his existing policies present challenges to the relationship.Duterte’s brutal drug war, which has killed at least 2,300 people since he took office, has made him a target of international criticism and strained diplomatic ties. On Saturday, police shot to death an imprisoned mayor who Duterte had claimed was involved in the drug trade. He was killed in his jail cell, with authorities saying he had resisted during a search.The U.S. has criticized the killings, but officials are still painting a relatively rosy picture of the ties between the two countries. In late October, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited the Philippines and vowed that both sides were committed to good relations and would be able to “work through” Duterte’s rhetoric. "

But making that shift in investment is far more complicated in practice, as the world struggles to wean itself from the easily obtained energy sources that have garnered billions in profits in the industrial age.The timing of the finance meeting, hosted by Casablanca Finance City, was particularly notable, coming the same day the landmark Paris climate agreement took effect, the most comprehensive international plan to address climate change that world leaders have ever reached. Now, negotiators are about to meet again in Marrakech for the 22nd Conference of the Parties, where over the next two weeks they will hash out a strategy to meet those goals.But the fight will be long, and it will be expensive.Addressing climate change is expected to cost the world tens of billions of dollars annually through 2020, in the form of efforts to curb emissions and adaptations to changes that are already underway. A recent report from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate estimates that local and national governments and large banks will need to invest up to $90 trillion by 2050 to keep the planet from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius, the level at which scientists say the worst effects of climate change take hold.But despite their eye-popping size, these numbers are possible, according to financial experts. Here’s how. Invest NowThe price of renewable energy has fallen considerably in recent years, enough that “low-carbon technology is becoming more than competitive with fossil fuels,” said Mark Lewis, a managing director at Barclays, the United Kingdom-based bank.While the $90 trillion figure is gargantuan ― “more than has ever been invested in infrastructure in the whole history of the world,” according to James Close, director of the World Bank’s climate change group ― the money is there. It’s just that much of it is still allocated to developing fossil fuels.Large financial institutions need to divest their portfolios from investments in oil and coal, Lewis said, and embrace renewables to build climate-positive momentum.“Clean energy now, in many situations, is cost competitive, if not the cheaper solution,” added Anthony Hobley, CEO of the Carbon Tracker Initiative. “It’s no longer a case of ‘nice to have.’ It’s the financially obvious choice.”Tax CarbonOne of the best ways to speed that transition is a carbon tax, which would require governments and companies to pay a fee for emitting greenhouse gases. It may be the most controversial climate policy, and recent moves to institute such fees have prompted protests in places like Canada. Most notably, Australia implemented a carbon pricing scheme in 2011 and then rolled it back three years later, citing a slowdown in economic growth.But carbon taxes are “absolutely key” to discouraging investment in fossil fuels, said Gerard Mestrallet, chairman of Paris Europlace, a French financial think tank. Such a strategy would quantify climate risks, as each ton of carbon emissions would come at a hefty price. It would also undercut profits for big polluters and push investment toward low- and no-carbon alternatives like solar and wind.“We must put a value on the climate risk associated with greenhouse gas emissions,” Mestrallet said.Develop SustainablyCities across Africa and Southeast Asia are expected to boom in the coming decades, and will need to meet the basic energy needs of the estimated 1.2 billion people who still live without electricity.“The gentleman who doesn’t have light really doesn’t care where his electricity comes from,” said Chinelo Anohu-Amazu, director general for Nigeria’s national pension commission. It’s up to governments to make sure that energy is provided sustainably, she said, and renewables should be seen as the first choice rather than a novel idea. Through sustainable development, clean energy can “become a lifestyle, not an event,” she said. Don’t Expect A Fairytale EndingWhile large governments, including from the U.S. and China, have taken important steps in recent months, the burden to act can’t rest on one nation’s shoulders, said Carbon Tracker Initiative’s Hobley. Cooperation is key.“We can’t assume some fairytale government is going to legislate us on a fairytale pathway,” he said, urging business leaders to act. “We have a mission, all of us now, get out and communicate to the financial markets, the decisions made now can destroy [investment] value or they can create it.”The Paris Agreement, while historic, is voluntary; nations that don’t follow through on their pledges face no legal repercussions.A recent report from the United Nations found that, even if all current pledges are fully implemented, the predicted emissions through the year 2030 would be on track to warm the world between 2.9 and 3.4 degrees Celsius by the end of this century ― far above the threshold of dangerous warming. And to avoid that, the UN Environment Programme has said that nations need to deepen their emissions cut pledges another 25 percent.Sean Kidney, CEO of the Climate Bonds Initiative, a nonprofit focused on transitioning investments to green technology, stressed that timing is key. Investors who don’t act now will be left behind.“It’s time to run, not walk,” he said."

The burglar, who’d stolen cash and other items from the couple’s bedroom, exited the car and ran away.“As he ran away, the male resident stood up on the fence and shot the fleeing man using the compound bow and arrow, hitting him in the buttocks or lower back area,” the New South Wales Police Force wrote in a Facebook post.The burglar got into a Mazda Tribute that was parked nearby, which was hastily driven away.Police officers attended the scene and seized the bow and arrow as evidence. They are yet to track down the burglar, who so far is not believed to have attended any local hospitals for treatment to his injury.It’s not clear whether the homeowner will face charges over his use of the weapon. Compound bows do not require a permit in New South Wales, per the BBC. “Inquiries into the incident continue, including use of the bow and arrow,” police added in the statement."
