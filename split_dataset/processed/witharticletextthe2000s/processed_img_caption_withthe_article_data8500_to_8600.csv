Your feelings, circumstances, and point of view, for example. Do you make an effort to understand",2017-07-25,"<p>Understanding each other? Possibly, one might be trying to understand the other.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5977d1d42100008860fc8aa9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Do you want to be understood? Your feelings, circumstances, and point of view, for example. Do you make an effort to understand other people, even your closest friends? Most people, while wanting to be understood, do not simply have the time or energy to listen closely, really empathize and attempt to understand one another. Yet, innately, we each desire to truly feel understood.Why is it that while we want to feel understood, the ability to understand one another is so challenging? Here are some tips to create more understanding in our lives, especially for those who we care about:1. Assume the least about the other person, reserving your judgment as much as possible, while showing genuine empathy.“Our days are happier when we give people a piece of our heart rather than a piece of our mind.” This quote summarizes how empathy and understanding can bring satisfaction to us while providing comfort to others. This cycle of satisfaction and comfort can also prevent and solve many problems in our social lives. Appreciating our differences in opinion, meanwhile, is a building block to understanding one another. 2. Try to listen to understand, rather than listening to reply.“The biggest communication problem is that we do not listen to understand. We listen to reply.” It is okay if we fail to understand but have the courage to reply I don’t know to how to reply to that. That sounds tough. It’s better to face the truth instead of replying without showing understanding. Consider friends and family. We might not have an answer for why someone could be feeling frustrated, angry or upset. The wisest thing to do, according to the above quote, is to try and just listen, and be a vessel of comfort.3. Give your own self the most understanding. Quite possibly, the reason we don’t have the time or energy to understand one another could be because we don’t have a close understanding of ourselves. Do you give yourself permission to express yourself? Do you think it’s okay to feel a certain way? Be kind to yourself. Your skills in understanding others can strengthen, essentially through practice, by learning first and foremost to understand yourself.4. Consider learning to understand others as a strength, not as a weakness.Perhaps some might consider showing understanding or empathy as a weakness. Question this. Think about how many quality friendships you might gain, or lives you might uplift, by becoming more understanding. As I have written before, quality relationships are shown in very recent research to be the No. 1 predictor of health and happiness long into old age. This is one convincing reason to have more understanding in our lives. 5. Remember, you get back what you ask for.Oprah once wisely said, “You get in life what you have the courage to ask for.” The fact of the matter is, our journeys take effort. You might be searching to be understood. Or want to be more understanding towards a loved one. Whatever it is, be courageous enough to look for it, and the return might be closer than you think.While we are each a work in progress, becoming more understanding will certainly give us more comfort and support in our lives, while strengthening close bonds. Try these 5 tips, and hopefully you will see the added benefit!"

So Why Are Millions at Risk of Starvation?,"Abby Maxman, ContributorAbby Maxman joined Oxfam America as its president in 2017.

In just 10 years, 167 million fewer people are undernourished. But we cannot let another day go by without acknowledging that millions more children, men and women are currently at risk of starvation, and this progress is in danger of being reversed. Knowledge is power, as the old adage goes, and we are convinced that if more Americans know about this crisis we can save more lives. This February, the world’s first famine in six years was declared in parts of South Sudan. Though it was recently downgraded, conditions in South Sudan have actually continued to deteriorate, and we are still on the brink of the worst humanitarian catastrophe of our time. The United Nations has warned that millions of families could face starvation in this lean period between growing seasons – primarily in Yemen, Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan – and that 1.4 million children are severely malnourished and at imminent risk of death.In South Sudan, families wade through miles of swamp to reach food, and people in Nigeria eat sand to ward off starvation. In Yemen, we see children with bloated stomachs from water retention and brittle, sparse and yellowish hair from lack of keratin. Some Somali farmers report 100 percent of their livestock are dying. Why are parents in these countries forced to decide between medical attention for one sick child and food for another? Why are we still asking these questions today, when we should have the power and resources to end this suffering?There is no one simple answer, and we know that extreme weather patterns exacerbate dire conditions in these countries. It is no coincidence that the four countries teetering on the edge of famine – Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria – are all embroiled in violent conflict, whether it is prolonged civil war or violent extremist organizations exacerbating other vulnerabilities such as drought or weak governance. A decade ago natural disaster was the driver of 80 percent of the world’s humanitarian need. Today, that has been completely flipped on its head: conflict, a human-made disaster, has now taken its place.Conflict prevents people from accessing food sources – their farming and grazing lands, functioning markets and sources for food and income like fishing and beekeeping. In South Sudan, for example, the land is incredibly fertile, but conflict drives families from their homes before the end of a planting and harvest cycle. As violence rages on, millions of people won’t have enough to eat, will suffer from disease and will drink unsafe water trying to survive. Many will starve to death or die from disease. Finally, conflict disrupts basic social services and normal patterns of trade. In Yemen, this has put millions at risk of famine, acute watery diarrhea, and cholera – this is outrageous and unacceptable in 2017. Conflict also prevents humanitarian organizations from delivering food to those caught in the crossfire. South Sudan is the most dangerous country in the world for aid workers; more than 80 humanitarians have been killed by warring parties in South Sudan since the conflict erupted in 2013. In Somalia, a long-running conflict, combined with a prolonged drought, is pushing people over the edge as they have lost their livelihoods and survival strategies. The risk of famine has been elevated because insecurity is preventing humanitarian organizations from reaching the most vulnerable Somalis. Without safe access to deliver food, water and vital supplies, especially in areas which are on the brink of starvation, our organizations will be able to save far fewer lives. So what can be done? Again, there is no simple answer. Ultimately, there must be an end to the conflicts driving these humanitarian crises. Powerful countries like the United States, Britain, influential regional parties and others must not turn inward. Without applying strong political pressure for peace, these countries effectively bear responsibility as parties to the hunger crisis. Until that peace comes, donors and diplomats must work together to ensure that humanitarians have sustained access to the people in dire need of assistance – and the resources needed to respond quickly when safe access is available. With greater resources, we can scale up our assistance and we can save more lives – by providing food, clean water, hygiene and sanitation support and assistance once people start the road to recovery.That’s why our two organizations have banded together with six others for the very first time in the U.S. The Global Emergency Response Coalition is embarking on a campaign to cut through the news that has been dominating headlines in the U.S. to raise much needed awareness and funds for the hunger crisis. We hope the American public, celebrities and corporations will join us in supporting the Hunger Relief Fund and in saying that no child should starve or die of preventable diseases in 2017. No single person, or even country, can end the conflicts in South Sudan, Nigeria, Yemen and Somalia. No single aid organization can respond to all of those suffering. We are all responding with urgency, but we cannot keep up with the need and we cannot do it alone. We believe we are stronger together, and with the support of the American people, we can make a lifesaving difference for millions of people.

To a degree, they’re variations on a theme but with enough diversity to make them worth passing along as the produce in the farmers’ market changes from week to week. Each vegetable demands its own approach and its own set of ingredients and techniques, and making the best use of them is interesting and delicious.Anyway, pasta with the vegetables of the moment is one of the best non-meat/fish dinners you can eat.The other week young artichokes finally appeared in our nearby farmers’ market. Readers who live in Europe – or California for that matter – must be puzzled: No, I do not know why Italian markets are swirling with artichokes in February and March while we in New York have to wait for the hot weather.In our house, artichoke hearts are often cooked with white wine, herbs, garlic, lemon and what not – sort of à la grecque – or used in paella-like rice dishes. And twice or three times a summer we’ll eat them with dried pasta. Last year’s version was Sicilian in origin (via Twitter); it featured the particular flavor of capers, and the trimmed artichokes had been sliced thin before cooking.This year we wanted bigger pieces of artichoke – more to chew on – and, because we had some excellent cherry tomatoes, these would provide savoriness and moisture – as well as light acidity, but in a less distinctive way than capers.I made the artichoke mixture a while in advance, taking care not to overcook the artichokes so they could be reheated while remaining firm-tender. I started with a medium onion (a juicy, sweet new-season one), diced, and a small clove of garlic, sliced, and sweated them in olive oil with salt and a little parsley. When they were tender, I added five (or was it six?) little artichokes, trimmed down to their hearts and tender inner leaves and quartered (quartering them yields bite-size pieces and makes it very easy to cut out any fuzz the artichokes may contain, though if you’re able to get truly young ones there may not be any: most of ours were fuzz-free). (I’d prepared the artichokes earlier in the day and held them in the fridge submerged in water acidulated with lemon juice. I’d also blanched, skinned and quartered half a dozen cherry tomatoes, sprinkled them with salt and drizzled them with olive oil, and left them at room temperature to improve in flavor and texture.)Along with the artichokes, I added a few leaves of fresh mint to the pan and a spoonful or two of water, then covered the pan and simmered over very low heat until the artichokes could be easily pierced with a thin-bladed paring knife – but were not completely tender. This took seven minutes; start checking after five. I set the pan aside, off the heat.For pasta I used mezze maniche (see photo), whose broad, stubby size was a good match for the artichoke pieces; rigatoni would be a fine choice too, as would penne or ziti. Because there were lots of artichokes and because mezze maniche are large and bulky and thus take up more space in the bowl, I used only 150 grams (say, 6 ounces) total for the two of us. When the pasta went into boiling salted water, I reheated the artichokes, added the tomatoes and cooked for a minute or so to warm the tomatoes and finish cooking the artichokes. I checked for seasoning and made sure there was a generous amount of liquid – juices from the initial cooking of the artichokes and from the tomatoes – then drained the pasta and stirred it into the artichoke mixture, adding enough of the pasta water to make sure that everything was nice and moist. Once I’d transferred it to a warmed serving bowl, I drizzled it with my best olive oil; I might have added more fresh mint, but it wasn’t needed – use your judgment on this.This was a purer artichoke experience than last year’s. There were no sharp edges from capers; the sweet onion and sweet-tart tomatoes were entirely harmonious without being monotonous. Also, the larger pieces of artichoke made this a very different dish. It’s hard to know which Jackie and I preferred. I suppose we’ll need to make the 2016 version soon and compare the two."

I am on my way to a speaking gig at the Chautauqua Institution. As my cab speeds to JFK, I think, “Mom will want to know that I am flying; let me give her a quick call.”I can’t call her anymore. After seven years of a heroic battle with stage four metastatic lung cancer, she died on April 25, two weeks after her 80th birthday. Early in her diagnosis, she was given six months to live. But because of the excellent medical care she received through the Affordable Care Act, she lived for seven years beyond her diagnosis.Last Tuesday, I went to Washington and stood outside of Sen. Mitch McConnell’s office to join my voice with a chorus of faith leaders demanding that the Affordable Care Act not be repealed. Because someone else’s mom needs cancer medicine. Someone else’s dad has diabetes. Someone’s baby will die without health care.We were a Love Army of all races, ages, religions, genders and professions. As a Christian Clergy, I must adhere to Jesus’ call to take care of the least of those among us: to feed and clothe the poor; to heal those who are sick. When we do this for our human family, we do it also for the Christ.All of our sacred texts call us to compassion and mercy. They call us to take care of those who can’t take care of themselves.My colleagues and I were arrested in Washington because this fight is personal. As clergy, we will bury the sick denied health care. For the last three weeks, faith leaders have risked arrest to take a stand for Health Care and we will keep speaking out because someone else’s parent is sick. The 32 million people who will lose their healthcare ― they are real people with personal stories, hopes and dreams and loved ones.People of faith are standing up in waves and waves of protests around the country and in DC.

The curtain opens with Sen. John McCain, less than a week after undergoing surgery paid for by taxpayers, making a triumphant, dramatic return to the Senate floor. The hero, who recently revealed he has brain cancer, receives a standing ovation moments before voting to take away health care from tens of millions of Americans. President Trump tweets, “Brave – American hero,” as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell takes a final bow.End Scene.If only this dismal performance in the Senate today were just that – a performance. But alas, this is what happened in Washington today – only no one in the Republican Party seems to see the irony.With his pivotal vote, Sen. McCain, who joined 49 other Republican Senators, voted to proceed to debate over a health care bill (Vice President Pence cast the final vote to break the tie). Only, there’s a small hiccup. That bill does not actually exist. Senators and the American people are both completely in the dark. To quote Sen. Rand Paul, they have “no earthly idea what we will be voting on.”Sadly, it doesn’t really matter. Every single iteration of the Senate health care bill to date would strip health coverage from tens of millions of Americans, gut Medicaid to give billions to GOP cronies and campaign donors, and put health care out of reach for millions more. The second version of the Senate health bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act promised to cut off health coverage from 22 million people, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). When a few Republican Senators defected, Sen. McConnell went even further: he announced a vote to “repeal and delay.” In other words, repeal the ACA without any plan to replace it.If you thought TrumpCare was bad, McConnell’s latest gambit is even more heartless: if the Senate votes to repeal only, the Congressional Budget Office says 18 million people would lose coverage in the first year alone, and that number would increase to 32 million by 2026. Think about that for a minute.While Sen. McCain and his colleagues are privileged to have access to excellent health care offered to Congress—and paid for by us—millions of Americans are not so fortunate. From increasing premiums and deductibles on the middle class to capping and cutting Medicaid – a program that serves as a lifeline for seniors, people with disabilities, and families with children – the Senate’s health plan can be summed up in three words: immoral, destructive, and deadly.It’s obvious the majority of Republican senators are turning deaf ears to their constituents who are demanding that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) not be replaced or repealed. Instead, they are sending a clear and unequivocal message to sick people or those of us at any moment at risk of getting sick: to go ahead and die.If, in the end, Sen. McConnell succeeds in jamming through repeal legislation, it will be not just a tragedy for millions of Americans, but also a serious blow to our democratic process. Our democracy is still intact – at least for now. And make no mistake: any Senator who votes to pass a bill that takes away health care to the most vulnerable will feel the wrath of constituents at the ballot box."

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-sessions-humiliation_us_5977b52ee4b0a8a40e836d44,The president says his attorney general should have protected him from the Russia investigation.,2017-07-25,"President Donald Trump reacts as he meets with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri (not pictured) in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on July 25, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5977b638210000a134fc8a69.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – Having publicly scolded his attorney general for a week now, President Donald Trump made it clear Tuesday he’s prepared to scold him some more rather than fire him.Both at a White House news conference and in a Wall Street Journal interview, Trump said he was “disappointed” in Jeff Sessions ― apparently for failing to protect the president from the ongoing investigation into his campaign’s ties to the foreign government that helped Trump win the presidency.“He should not have recused himself…. And if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office and I would have quite simply picked somebody else,” Trump said of Sessions in the Rose Garden in a joint appearance with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri.Trump would not, however, say what he planned to do about Sessions. “We will see what happens. Time will tell. Time will tell,” Trump said.In the Journal interview, the president was more explicit about the reason behind his disappointment, specifically citing the Russia investigation: “If Jeff Sessions didn’t recuse himself, we wouldn’t even be talking about this subject.”The remarks help keep Russia front and center six months into Trump’s presidency, despite his attempts to dismiss the issue as “fake news” dreamed up by Democrats as an excuse for Hillary Clinton’s election loss to Trump in November.The U.S. intelligence community – which included the FBI ― released a report in January concluding that Russia actively tried to help Trump win by stealing private emails from Democrats and releasing embarrassing ones in the final months before the election.Sessions in March recused himself from the ongoing investigation into the Russian interference after his own undisclosed meetings with Russian officials came to light, which left the probe under the charge of Sessions’ deputy, Rod Rosenstein.Two months later, Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey. In sworn testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee last month, Comey said he believed the president fired him for refusing to a drop a related investigation into the Russian contacts of Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn.The day after firing Comey, Trump told the Russian foreign minister and ambassador that he had done so to relieve the “pressure” from the former FBI director’s Russia probe.After the firing, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel in the investigation, which has become a focus of Trump’s anger ever since.That ire appeared to boil over after recent reports that Mueller may be seeking Trump’s tax returns in connection with the investigation. Trump refused to release his returns during the campaign, a break from decades of protocol for presidential candidates.“Frankly, I think is very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself?” he told the New York Times in an interview last week, and then complained that Sessions had not given him any warning.In the days since, Trump became increasingly aggressive about Sessions in his statements on Twitter.In a Monday morning tweet, Trump called Sessions “beleaguered” – but failed to point out that it was Trump’s own criticism that was beleaguring him.And in his Tuesday morning tweet session, Trump dropped even that ambiguity. “Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!” Trump wrote, before going on to attack the FBI, too. “Problem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!”It is unclear how Trump would proceed if he does manage to rid himself of Sessions, who was the first sitting senator to endorse him last year.It’s difficult to imagine any replacement candidate winning Senate confirmation as attorney general who does not promise to leave Mueller and his Russia investigation alone.In the meantime, Mueller’s probe will continue, unless Trump is able to appoint an acting attorney general willing to fire Mueller – a move certain to unleash political backlash even from Republicans."

Tures, ContributorProfessor of Political Science, LaGrange College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/if-the-election-were-held-today-trump-would-get-99_us_59779aeae4b01cf1c4bb73d1,"In a recent poll, he barely mustered a majority in 17 states.",2017-07-25,<p>Based on Electoral College Votes Of States Where Trump Has A 50%+ Approval Rating In Gallup Polls </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59779b012100001700fc89f2.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Gallup polls showing President Donald Trump’s approval ratings state by state were released this week. And it’s not a good sign for the incumbent, who barely musters a majority in 17 states, totaling 99 Electoral College votes.Nationwide, only 39 percent of people surveyed approve of the performance of President Donald Trump. But as we know, of course, from the 2000 and 2016 election, that you need a majority of Electoral College votes, not the most ballots in the popular vote contest. But the news still isn’t good for President Trump.Currently, Trump has a 50 percent approval rating or higher in 17 states, according to Gallup Polling. He leads West Virginia with a whopping 60 percent of the vote (his highest nationwide), followed by North Dakota (59 percent), South Dakota (57 percent), Wyoming (56 percent), Montana (56 percent), Alabama (55 percent), Oklahoma (54 percent), Idaho (53 percent), Kansas (53 percent), Arkansas (53 percent), Kentucky (53 percent), Nebraska (52 percent), Alaska (51 percent), Louisiana (51 percent), Utah (50 percent) and South Carolina (50%). That’s good for 99 Electoral College votes, according to 270toWin.com.Trump still has a chance in Missouri (49 percent), Mississippi (48 percent), Indiana (47 percent), and Ohio (47 percent), as each of these states gives the President a higher approval rating than his popular vote total. This would boost Trump to 144 Electoral College votes. However, he did better than 50 percent in each of these states, so that’s a bad sign for the GOP President.Trump’s got work to do in New Hampshire (45 percent), Iowa (45 percent), Nevada (44 percent), Wisconsin (43 percent), Georgia, (43 percent), Pennsylvania (43 percent) and Arizona (43 percent), having won all but Nevada in 2016. This would get him to 217 Electoral College votes. He won Michigan (42 percent), Texas (42 percent), Florida (42 percent) and North Carolina (42 percent), although those states certainly don’t look so easy today for Trump. Maine comes in at 42 percent.Every other state, from the West (Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, and New Mexico), to the Midwest (Minnesota, Illinois) to the Northeast (New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey) to the Delmarva region (Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, plus Washington DC) give Trump an approval rating of less than 40 percent. That’s 219 Electoral College votes just to start with for those with less than a 40 percent approval rating, while Trump only gets a 60 percent approval rating for just five of West Virginia’s Electoral College votes.There’s still several ways Trump could win. For example, the economy could go recession-free for the next 3.5 years, having ended its last one in 2009. Democrats could renominate Hillary Clinton, whose approval rating is as low at Donald Trump’s (39 percent). Public opinion could swoon over a triumphant Trump victory over North Korea. And maybe Trump manages to get through a slew of scandals over Russia, conflicts of interest, with the public giving the president a pass if he pardons himself.So far, the Republican Party has to decide whether to continue to vigorously defend President Trump, or seek to distance themselves from the chief executive. If you’re in the GOP and represent one of the 33 states that gives Trump less than a 50 percent approval rating, you may not be exactly hitching your wagon to a star. It may be time to look to one’s own fortunes, rather than a president who has been more than willing to throw fellow Republicans, whether they are conservative, moderate or liberal, under a bus.John A.

Then it hits you. You do not own a sofa anymore. This simple realization makes you want to cry.On my first night in Vietnam, my phone got snatched right out of my hand as I was trying to locate a restaurant on the map. In 21st century, a phone is never just a phone. It was my single access to my online bank accounts and I needed to be able to receive confirmation messages from my bank in order to buy a plane ticket online with my credit card. So, with the loss of my phone I was no longer able to have control over my financial accounts.I had been traveling for five months in Asia and I wasn’t a naive traveler expecting everything to be a rose garden but just the thought of being forced to go back home because of what happened in Vietnam, made me feel depressed and angry. Misfortunes, of course can happen to you anywhere in the world. Especially in large, crowded cities… I decided to suck it up and give a chance to the country, I didn’t want to let it to cloud my judgment just because it is a well known, default requirement for long-term travelers to always keep an open-mind about the places that he or she travels.God forbid if you dare to think or share a negative opinion about one country you may be stoned to death by the online travel communities…We must all keep a positive attitude, because traveling is simply amazing, inspiring and romantic… And it is. Just not all the time…Later on when I got robbed down to my passport in an intercity bus in Peru and had to take another 16 hours bus ride to reach Lima in order to apply for a new one, I wasn’t feeling the “magical energy” of Peru at all. All I could think was having my passport re-issued so I could leave the country as soon as possible.Acknowledging the fact that traveling can be a very challenging life style doesn’t make us forget how privileged we are. Yes, no one is forcing us to travel, we are volunteering to do so.But one single question is meandering in my mind. So does most of the people who have stable, 9 to 5 jobs as well. So how come it is ok for them to rant about their co-workers, their stressful deadlines and horrible bosses but it is not ok for us to rant about rude people, scammers, horrible hostel rooms and etc. Why do we have to always polish the bright side of traveling and keep the not-so-fun parts to ourselves?There will be some countries that you fall in love with, there will be some countries you hate. It is not about the scenery, the history, the beaches or the climate… It is all about what you experience.We, travelers are not just being whiny babies when they talk about our misfortunes, in fact we are facing a lot of dangers than a person who lives in a familiar environment. When we say we are not feeling safe or we are not feeling healthy, we are not exaggerating. There are many priceless moments we experience through traveling but also there are very bad ones as well. Talking about them neither makes us spoiled, ungrateful kids nor diminishes the greatness of traveling. Being honest is way better than than keeping an appearance, wouldn’t you agree?Solen Yucel is a traveler & blogger who believes that establishing human connection and learning through each other’s experience is the true essence of her journey.

He oversaw the passing of a law in late 2015 that hampered the country’s system of checks and balances.Signs of resistance to the bills abounded. The European Union offered a stern warning about them to Poland last week. The European Commission’s first vice-president, Frans Timmermans, said approving them would “ruin the already tarnished view of Polish democracy.” He threatened the use of Article 7, which would suspend Poland’s voting rights within the EU.The State Department warned on Friday that “the Polish government has continued to pursue legislation that appears to undermine judicial independence and weaken the rule of law in Poland.”Poles protested the bills in more than 100 cities across the country on Saturday, and thousands took to the streets in Warsaw again on Sunday night.Duda’s decision “has pulled Poland back from the brink of all-out assault on the rule of law,” Amnesty International said in a statement."

The release, which describes the bar as an “oasis,” featured a $12 cocktail pictured in front of a wall described as being marked with bullet holes. “Yes, that bullet hole-ridden wall was originally there and, yes, we’re keeping it,” the release read, per Gothamist. Brennan, a 31-year-old former attorney and Toronto transplant, told the publication that her intention was to be “cheeky” and play up a rumor that the location was formerly a corner store that sold guns ― a claim that has since been debunked.“Just looking at the angle I don’t know if that is possible that that’s a bullet hole,” she said. “We call it that because if you look at the history, someone seriously said, ‘Isn’t that the place where we could buy guns?’ And then we were like, ‘OK.’” She also initially planned on selling 40-ounce bottles of rosé in brown paper bags; she has since taken that back.Brennan has been receiving criticism for her insensitive marketing since. Residents have been posting complaints on Summerhill’s Yelp and Instagram accounts. They also posted signs around the neighborhood denouncing the restaurant.“Wow, what a disappointment,” Yelp user Nicole M. wrote. “The owner is making a point of displaying her privilege and indifference to systemic poverty that has plagued the Crown Heights area in the past by promoting rosé in brown bags and an alleged bullet ridden wall? Gross. Way to also ignore the detrimental effects of gentrification as well.”Following the online backlash, organizers Justine Stephens, Jon Villaran and Paola Ayala put together an open forum to allow people a space to voice their concerns. “Crown Heights still struggles with gun violence, and for them to market the experience of their bar — an ‘aesthetic’ as Brennan has referred to many times— is distasteful and an outrage,” the organizers told HuffPost in a joint statement.“What Summerhill did (and is continuing to do) invalidates the culture of a community with a storied past,” they continued, noting that this is a trend for gentrifying businesses in New York City. “Becca chose to focus on negative stereotypes of Crown Heights past and instead tried to accentuate a history that this community is trying to overcome. Crown Heights is more than just gun shots and malt liquor, it’s a community of people that have lived there for decades that have stories of their own, and Becca refused to acknowledge that.”Residents gathered in front of the self-proclaimed “boozy sandwich shop” for the open forum on Saturday. Participants chanted “Bye-bye, Becky!” and held signs reading “This is what gentrification looks like.”Crown Height’s mostly black population has shrunk while white residents’ population doubled between 2000 and 2010, according to The New York Times.Participants took turns voicing their opinions on what was problematic about Summerhill. Among them was Toya Lillard, a Crown Heights resident for more than 20 years, according to Gothamist.“People of color are not props or backdrops,” said Lillard, who is black. “If you are new to this community you are duty bound to do some research. To be culturally literate. To know where you are. To know what came before you. It’s not our job to inform you or educate you. It’s yours.”Residents also addressed the dangers of using these stereotypes for profit when they are, unfortunately, some people’s reality.“I ain’t never wanted to go to no beachfront with a f**king wall that look like gun holes been in it,” one woman in the video below said during the open forum. “I’ve witnessed people die in front of me. Nobody talks about the PTSD that we go through ... Don’t tie something to our culture. Half of that s**t was pushed on us.”Though Brennan was present, Gothamist reported that she didn’t engage with community members. Instead, her team handed out a statement of apology during the forum.“I deeply apologize for any offense that my recent comments might have caused,” read the statement, which a representative for Summerhill sent to HuffPost. “I did not intend to be insensitive to anyone in the neighborhood, and I am sorry that my words caused pain. I made light of serious issues and that was wrong.” The statement continued:Summerhill is a neighborhood restaurant where everyone is welcome. The reason we maintained the distressed wall is the aesthetic. We have kept other elements of the original space as well to create a visually engaging experience.Stephens, Villaran and Ayala told HuffPost that Brennan’s response was “appalling, but not surprising.” “We reached out on several occasions to have her comment at the forum and let her listen to the ENTIRETY of the community of Crown Heights, but she refused to and instead had us speak with her media representatives and employees who were equally as dismissive,” they said. “At one point, Jon was confronted by an acquaintance of Becca who called the event a riot, again focusing on negative stereotypes of this community and refusing to hear us.”The organizers issued a list of demands for Brennan, including a verbal apology, a detailed business plan on how Summerhill will incorporate local residents and people of color as employees at living wages or higher, the removal of “bullet holed” walls, employee participation at community meetings, food and service at an affordable cost and a public report on the actions the restaurant has taken regarding the demands. The organizers said an hour after the open forum, they received a response from Summerhill representatives stating that they listened and would like to have a conversation that allows them to work together.But for the organizers, they just want two things: “We are hoping that Summerhill will close and for other new businesses to take a closer eye at respecting the communities around them.”"

In it, Lowe played television lawyer Dean Sanderson, who moves back to his hometown after a stint in Hollywood thinking his time on the small screen qualifies him to head up his family’s law firm. “The Grinder” ran from 2015 to 2016, but Fox canceled it after its 22-episode Season 1 run, much to the disappointment of its loyal fanbase. Though overall ratings were slow to grow, critics largely praised the series for its wit, as well Lowe and Savage for their on-screen comedic delivery.But now, “The Grinder” fans may be in luck. During an interview with HuffPost at Build Series, Lowe hinted that the “The Grinder” may return in some capacity. “I hear a rumor that there might be life to ‘The Grinder’ in some sort of special or movie or something like that,” Lowe said. “I don’t think you’ve seen the last of ‘The Grinder.’ Too many people liked it. It was such a good show. And I feel like ‘Arrested Development’ and ‘Family Guy,’ all shows that were canceled before their time ― ahem, by Fox ― I think there’s probably more to be done.”Lowe, for one, really enjoyed his time on the show, which also starred Mary Elizabeth Ellis, Natalie Morales and Hana Hayes.“It’s my favorite comedy I’ve been in, and that’s saying a lot because I was in ‘Parks and Recreation,’ which was a great show. But I think ‘The Grinder’ is probably one my favorite things I’ve ever done.”So, it’s safe to say Lowe would be game for a reboot of sorts? “In a minute,” he said. Before that, catch Lowe and his two sons, Matt and John, on “The Lowe Files,” which premieres Aug. 2 on A&E. The show follows Lowe and his two sons as they travel through the country to explore unsolved mysteries. And check out more from the Build Series interview below."

Winston Blackmore was married to more than 20 women at once, the court held, while James Oler had five wives.The government had worked to prosecute Blackmore and Oler ― rival religious leaders in the small community of Bountiful, British Columbia ― since the 1990s. The case finally went to trial this April. Blackmore and Oler pleaded not guilty to one count each of polygamy, a charge that carries a maximum of five years.Although polygamy is illegal in Canada, it has been practiced in Bountiful since the religious enclave along the Idaho border was founded in 1946. The community has a population of around 1,500 people, most of whom are related.Blackmore and Oler were both bishops in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, which advocates polygamist marriage. Blackmore was excommunicated from the church in 2002 and now runs a rival sect.Much of the media attention in the case has focused on Blackmore, an outspoken proponent of polygamy who is estimated to have married 28 women in total and fathered about 145 children. Some of his wives were as young as 15 years old when they were married. Blackmore is now 61.For years, Canadian media has reported extensively on Blackmore and life in Bountiful. Questions have been raised about course content, teacher training and student evaluations at the publicly funded local schools. Young men in the community seen as competition for older leaders have reportedly been driven out or made to work for little pay on farms. Girls have been pushed into child marriage and trafficked within the larger fundamentalist Mormon community. And there have been widespread allegations of child marriage and sexual abuse.Earlier this year, a formerly married man and woman from Bountiful were convicted of taking a 13-year-old girl across the U.S. border in 2004 to become the child bride of American sect leader Warren Jeffs. Jeffs is now serving a life sentence for child sexual assault.Legal wrangling in the Canadian case had earlier focused on whether the law banning polygamous marriage was a violation of the nation’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The British Columbia Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that anti-polygamy measures did not violate the charter’s protection of religious practices, thereby allowing the case against Blackmore and Oler to proceed."

They may also be supporting possibly shady business deals between Russians and the Trump Organization.According to a report distributed by Reuters, public pension funds in at least seven states invest millions of dollars in the CIM Group that owns the Trump SoHo Hotel in New York City and pays a Trump company to operate it. CalPERS paid CIM $1,722,418 in management fees for the first three months of 2017.Two public interest advocacy groups, Free Speech for People and the Courage Campaign, are organizing a campaign to get the pensions to divest from the Trump projects. They charge ""The money used for this investment comes from mandatory deductions from the paychecks of public employees. These employees are thus forced to indirectly subsidize President Trump beyond the Constitution's mandate of a fixed salary."" Constitutional lawyers questioned by Reuters expressed concern that the investments, which produce payments to the Trump organization and Donald Trump, violate Article II of the U.S. Constitution. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a federal lawsuit charging that Trump’s business holdings violate the Constitution’s “emoluments clause,” which makes it illegal for government officials to “accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” The American Civil Liberties Union is considering a suit against Trump for using his position as President to attract business away from other hotels. A White House spokesperson dismissed all the accusations as “partisan politics.”Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Trump ties to Russia that may have influenced the 2016 Presidential election, apparently has unearthed additional allegations involving Trump Soho. Russia-born businessman Felix Sater, an executive at the Bayrock Group, which was a Trump partner in the project, was accused of being a co-conspirator in a $40 million fraud and money-laundering scheme involving four organized crime families. A 2010 lawsuit brought against Sater alleged that “for most of its existence [Bayrock] was substantially and covertly mob-owned and operated.” In a 2007 court deposition, Sater claimed he met with Trump “on a constant basis.” Bayrock’s office was in Trump Tower and its corporate brochure described the Trump Organization a “strategic partner” and listed Donald Trump as a reference.Trump, who was deposed in 2007 as part of an unsuccessful defamation lawsuit against reporter Timothy O’Brien, said he never would have partnered with Bayrock if had he known about Sater's past. Trump also partnered with Bayrock on the Fort Lauderdale Trump Tower, the Trump Ocean Club in Fort Lauderdale, and a resort in Phoenix.Craig Unger, in an article in the July 13 issue of the New Republic, charges, ""Trump owes much of his business success, and by extension his presidency, to a flow of highly suspicious money from Russia. Over the past three decades, at least 13 people with known or alleged links to Russian mobsters or oligarchs have owned, lived in, and even run criminal activities out of Trump Tower and other Trump properties."" According to Unger, who is a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, Trump buildings and casinos were used to ""launder untold millions in dirty money."" These same investors granted Trump ""lucrative branding deals that required no investment on his part"" and provided him with a ""crucial infusion of financing that helped rescue his empire from ruin, burnish his image, and launch his career in television and politics."" Kenneth McCallion, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Reagan administration investigated ties between organized crime and Trump’s developments in the 1980s. He is quoted in the Unger article saying, “They saved his bacon."" Unger's article is well documented and should be read by federal investigators and the special counsel looking into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election.In the 2007 deposition, Trump claimed, “It’s ridiculous that I wouldn't be investing in Russia. Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment.” No wonder Trump is trying to limit the scope of the investigation being conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller and threatens that he will fire Mueller if he crosses some ill-defined “red line.”Trump SoHo is in many ways a typical Trump luxury “product.” It is a 46-story, 391-unit hotel condominium, valued at $450 million, that opened in 2008. A one-bedroom suite starts at $387 a night plus taxes and fees. The penthouse costs over $2,000 a night.Although Trump Soho carries the family name, it ain’t “owned” by Trump and was built without any of Trump’s money. His key role, other than branding, appears to be striking a deal with the Bloomberg administration to build the hotel in an area zoned for manufacturing that precludes permanent housing. Trump was also involved in marketing the project, unveiling plans on his television show, The Apprentice. His Season 5 winner became a partner developing the property.Despite, or because of the Trump connection, Trump SoHo has had a series of major problems. The Wall Street Journal reported that Bank of America suffered losses when it dropped out of financing the project. Other investors were forced to restructure the debt. The management company had trouble selling the condominium units.A federal lawsuit brought in 2011 by ten wealthy apartment hunters including French soccer star Olivier Dacourt was settled Trump-style, meaning out-of-court. The plaintiffs charged developers with fraud for providing them with “deceptive” sales figures.” They were told the building was “30, 40, 50, or 60 percent,” sold when 16% were under contract. Under terms of the agreement, they each received back 90% of the $3.16 million deposit they made on the $17 million units. The Trump spin on the settlement was typical. Steven Goldman, a lawyer for the defendants, said, “There was no admission of guilt or liability at all.” Ivanka Trump, who personally managed the hotel for the Trump Organization declared, “Business is so strong that we’re delighted to get the units back.”A May 2017 story on radio station WNYC reported that Trump SoHo was having new financial trouble. Room prices were down, one of its five-star restaurants had closed, and staff was being laid-off. A Trump spokesperson responded to the station by email, “As is typical in the hospitality industry, hotel rates and occupancy fluctuate due to factors such as seasonality and macro-economic forces . . . The hotel continues to receive top accolades.”Public pension funds have no business investing in companies that do business with the Trump Organization.

These numbers are amazing,” said Hadi Partovi, chief executive of Code.org, a nonprofit that provides free coding instruction to students around the world and has advocated for greater diversity in the computer science field. “This is a great reflection on the U.S. public school system. Every American should be proud — the U.S. is really leading the way.”Of the 111,262 high school students who took the College Board’s Advanced Placement computer science exams in May, 27 percent were girls, a jump from 23 percent last year. Twenty percent of the test-takers were Latino or African-American, up from 15 percent in 2016.The increases are largely due to a new AP computer science class launched in 2016-17 that focuses less on Java coding and more on what the College Board describes as the “big ideas” behind computer science, such as how the Internet works, the global impact of technology, big data and cyber security, and the creative aspects of programming.The new class, called Computer Science Principles, was designed to attract students with no prior computer experience and who don’t necessarily want to pursue it as a career, said Maureen Reyes, executive director of AP program management at the College Board, which oversees Advanced Placement courses and exams as well as the SAT and PSAT tests.The College Board’s other AP computer science course, called Computer Science A, focuses more strictly on coding. “Students should be able to write, run, test and debug solutions in the Java programming language, utilizing standard Java library classes and interfaces from the AP Java subset,” according to the course description.“That course was not attracting the diverse group of students we had hoped,” Reyes said. “So we worked with the National Science Foundation and higher education instructors to design a class that students would find more engaging.”About 2,500 high schools nationwide offered Computer Science Principles last year and 50,000 students took the exam, making it the most successful launch in the 60-year history of the College Board, Reyes said. More than 400 additional schools have committed to offering the course in the 2017-18 school year.“We found the class appeals to a lot of students who otherwise wouldn’t enroll in AP computer science,” Reyes said. “And from what we hear from students, parents and teachers, the need is exploding. It’s a useful course regardless of what your career goals are.”The number of girls enrolled in Advanced Placement computer science had been steady at about 17 percent since the mid-1990s, when the course was first offered, but began edging upwards about a decade ago, thanks in part to organizations like Girls Who Code, Tech Bridge and the Girls Scouts of America, which encourage girls to learn science, math and technology.African-American and Latino students also increased their numbers in advanced computer science classes. In 2007, only 12 percent of those taking the AP Computer Science test were underrepresented minorities, but in 2017 that figure rose to 20 percent, or 22,199 out of 111,262.That shift is primarily due to increased access, said Partovi. More schools in high-poverty areas are offering computer science instruction, and organizations like Code.org and #YesWeCode offer free coding lessons to young people who otherwise might not get coding experience.Ideally, every school should teach computer science as a staple subject, like English or math, from kindergarten through 12th grade, Partovi said. And participation rates should reflect the demographics of the general population.“Every parent should ask their children’s school, are you teaching computer science? Why not?” he said.California’s State Board of Education took a step in upgrading the state’s computer science curriculum last week by setting guidelines for new standards. The new standards, set to be announced by August 2019, will reflect current industry trends, focus on solving real-world problems, emphasize the creative aspects of programming and cover concepts that don’t require ownership of a computer, according to State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson.The board also created a 21-member advisory panel of computer science teachers and tech education experts to oversee implementation of the new standards.Oakland Unified is among the districts that’s gotten a jump-start on expanding its computer science offerings. Last year, using grants from Salesforce and Intel and guidance from Code.org, the district started offering general computer science classes to almost all 9th-graders and more than 1,000 middle school students, and launched AP Computer Science Principles classes at six high schools. More than 3,000 students were enrolled in computer science classes last year, up from 200 students in 2014. The district plans further expansion next year.Computer Science Principles was immensely popular with students, and the high participation rate nationwide was not a surprise, said the district’s computer science manager, Claire Shorall, who also taught the class last year at Castlemont High School in East Oakland.“I had kids in my class who would have never in their lives thought they’d be taking computer science end up with passing scores on this test,” she said. “For me, as a teacher, that was really exciting.”Her class of 21 students was 70 percent girls and almost entirely African-American and Latino. Most had never studied computer science before. But they found the broader concepts “incredibly relevant to their lives,” Shorall said.For a unit on cyber security and big data they studied technology that police use to predict crime. A chapter on data analysis led to a dissection of public housing statistics. One student created a mobile software application on gentrification. Others designed video games using their own artwork.A team of girls at another Oakland school created an app for girls that included a quiz about menstruation. Rev. Jesse Jackson happened to be visiting that day and took a look. The girls were mortified, Shorall said.“They said, ‘Oh no, that isn’t for you!’ ” she laughed.“Basically, this class helped them navigate the most ubiquitous thing in their lives — technology,” she said. “It gave them the language and the background to understand concepts they deal with daily. … You really see that ‘lightbulb’ moment.”This story originally appeared on EdSource"

My family came here fleeing an economic meltdown in Argentina with the expectation that we would be able to resolve our immigration status by residing in this country or eventually some form of legislation such as the amnesty President Reagan granted immigrants in 1986.Instead, we encountered a broken and cruel immigration system that leaves people in desperate straits. People risk their lives repeatedly to capture even a hint of the elusive American dream. We saw this just today in Texas, where authorities found at least 100 migrants crammed into a tractor-trailer with no ventilation. Ten undocumented migrants died in the truck in what authorities say is a people smuggling operation.One of the most common cliches leveled against undocumented immigrants in this country is that they should be punished for coming here to seek a better life and that they should “get in the back of the line” to resolve their immigration status. The truth to these assertions is that there is no actual line available for unauthorized immigrants either already living in this country or seeking to come here.There is no viable process for undocumented immigrants to follow to become U.S citizens. People know that, so they take recourses that may endanger their lives or force them to live here in the shadows.The United States immigration system has three different routes for immigrants to obtain temporary or permanent status into the country - employment, family reunification or humanitarian protection. All three of these categories are highly regulated with limits on the number of people who can obtain the status.Obtaining a visa to the United States for employment is no easy task. Only a very limited number of worker visas exist for highly specialized positions such as scientists, professors, and multinational executives, but none for industries that low income immigrants traditionally work, such as the food industry or construction. Guest worker visas for agricultural workers are also limited and temporary and in most of these cases, an employer must petition for the worker. Family based immigration is restricted to close family members. My father placed hopes that his U.S. citizen siblings would be able to petition him as a resident, but unfortunately, the process would have taken decades and requires the petitioner to prove certain levels of income that is restrictive for most immigrants.Humanitarian protection is another option which is limited in scope and inaccessible to many immigrants in need of asylum. Despite fearmongering against refugees by the Trump administration, the United States has a stringent vetting process for asylum seekers. Multiple international and U.S. agencies screen applicants and set numerical limits on how many refugees are admitted into the country. Asylum seekers must prove that they have a “well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, membership in a particular social group, political opinion or national origin.” Immigrants fleeing economic crisis do not qualify as refugees The immigration system in the United States does not offer “a line” for aspiring undocumented immigrants so they can begin the process of becoming U.S. citizens. People like my parents and millions of other immigrants spend years, sometimes decades in the shadows waiting for common sense immigration reform that will allow them to lead normal lives without the fear of deportation. Instead of telling immigrants to “get in line,” we should focus on creating that line and providing a fair process for immigrants to come into this country. A good start is the Dream Act legislation introduced by Senator Durbin (D-Ill) and Senator Graham (R-S.C.) which would grant permanent legal status to more than 1 million young people who arrived in the United States before they turned 18, lived here for at least four years, passed security checks and met other criteria such as enrolling in college or the military. Although Legislation such as the Dream Act will provide relief to millions of people who work and contribute to this country, it is a Band-Aid to fix our broken immigration system. Instead of more deportations or a useless wall, we need broader comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. It is the clearest way to ensure we do not see any more tragedies involving immigrants desperate to achieve the American dream.Thomas Kennedy is a communications fellow with the Center for Community Change."

Then he urged Republicans to “let Obamacare fail.” Then he asked Congress to go back to the drawing board and create a new replacement health care bill.At this point, it seems that Senate leaders may try any or all of the above.As a registered Republican, and as a mother of a child with a severe heart condition, I feel it’s important to say that this push to rid the country of the ACA, no matter what, misses the point.The focus should not be about weakening the ACA. It should not be on repealing it. And it definitely should not be on replacing it with a law that cripples a program like Medicaid, potentially leaving tens of millions of children without adequate health care coverage.Republicans and Democrats need to come together to do the exact opposite; they need to come to the table to strengthen health care for children.During our meetings earlier this month with nine members of Congress, I spent a good deal of time sharing what it’s like to be parent of a child with a medically complex disease in the midst of a health care debate. I already live with dread and uncertainty, wondering if my child’s next cough or fever is a prelude to a long hospital stay.My son Max – you likely know him as the mini-Darth Vader from the 2011 Volkswagen Super Bowl commercial – has undergone a dozen grueling heart surgeries since birth. He was born with tetralogy of Fallot, and lives with a pacemaker and artificial pulmonary valve.Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies dropped us or raised our premiums after each surgery. Now we pay a higher premium to have access to great care, but at least we no longer fear losing that coverage or facing exorbitant premium increases after Max’s treatments.Six years ago, I watched Max crisscross our nation’s capital dressed as mini Darth Vader as reporters clamored for an interview. Wearing his costume in stifling heat, he gained a platform and used it to shine a light on children’s health care.Our recent trip was our sixth visit to Capitol Hill, and never were the stakes higher. There was pressure – doing media interviews and speaking to senators and congressmen – and I witnessed a young man bravely share how difficult it is to live his life and how he needs Congress to protect him and all the kids he represents.Max said in a People.com interview that he wants to be the face of children’s health care. Not what your average 12-year-old has to ponder. Pretty bold, I thought. He is after all living with a serious heart defect. He definitely dreams bigger than I.Max is not alone. He was joined on Capitol Hill by 46 other children’s hospitals’ patients and their families from 28 states, canvassing the House and Senate buildings with their personal stories and heartfelt pleas to solve child health care. They were part of the Speak Now for Kids Family Advocacy Day hosted by the Children’s Hospital Association.Our visit was supported by Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), where Max has been treated since he was 3 months old. Our battle is ongoing, as it is for millions of families caring for kids with medically complex diseases like cancer, cystic fibrosis, diabetes and heart disease. We all came out to let lawmakers know that we would be in dire straits without government support for health care. I know firsthand how distressing this can be.I’ll be honest – we’re an upper middle-class family and had never qualified for Medicaid or other assistance even though we have fought on behalf of those who do. But this year, after Max was airlifted for an unexpected emergency treatment for a severe heart infection culminating in a 32-day hospital stay at CHLA, our rainy day fund was depleted.For the first time ever, our medical expenses exceeded 20 percent of our income, meaning that we qualified for supplemental insurance through a state program largely funded through Medicaid. I never thought in a million years we’d require something like that, but I’m so grateful it was there when we needed it.As a regular citizen, I sometimes think – does voicing my opinion on Capitol Hill really matter? Will we change minds so entrenched in each side of the debate? Will we ever find compromise and cooperation between the parties?I hope members of both sides can reach across the aisle and work together to improve health care for children. No matter who is in control of the White House, the House or the Senate – my son will still have severe heart disease, a condition that is not going away in his lifetime. Our current health care system shouldn’t be abandoned, nor should any revisions cut coverage to children; it needs to be strengthened for millions of families like ours.I spend untold hours worrying if Max will have access to affordable health insurance in the future. I pray lawmakers will protect him from being penalized for having a pre-existing condition.And you know what I learned in Washington D.C.? This matters to Max.He is learning to fight for his health care just as he fights for his life, with a strong spirit and a positive attitude. He is advocating to senators and representatives as eloquently as he advocates for himself with his medical team.“I have a condition that will be with me the rest of my life and I just want to able to take care of myself without worrying about how I am going to pay for it,” my son told California Senator Dianne Feinstein in a face¬-to-face meeting in her office. She listened and urged us to share our stories to help “win the war” for child health care.We are asking everyone to act, and act now. It’s time to work together on behalf of the millions of sick children in need. It’s not welfare; millions of kids are stricken by diseases and chronic illnesses through no fault of their own and they are entitled to the best care.“We were born like this,” Max explained to Republicans and Democrats alike. “We didn’t do anything to deserve this. It just happened.”Max learned that the ability to try, to speak out, and to count in the eyes of legislators – it matters. We urge families across the country to do the same. Don’t let up, because much more work needs to be done. And to our elected leaders, Max and I ask this: Please don’t just “let Obamacare fail,” and please protect Medicaid and make it better for the millions of children dependent on it.Max’s final plea to both sides of the aisle – think of him and kids like him, and come up with a bipartisan solution to improve our health care system."

Shannon Kennedy and Julie Ann Samanas visited W.W. Bridal Boutique in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, to look for wedding attire July 8, but were told by an employee that they would have to shop elsewhere as the salon’s owners were opposed to same-sex marriage, Philadelphia Gay News reported. “She said, ‘I don’t know if you’ve heard, but we’re Christian and we don’t believe in that; our faith doesn’t let us believe in that,’” Kennedy told the paper. She and Samanas didn’t challenge the staff member, whose name has not been disclosed, and left without incident. “I think we were kind of in shock,” she said. “It was unexpected. Afterwards, you think of everything you should have said.”The couple, who are planning a March wedding, spoke out about the incident on social media that same day. In a Facebook post, Samanas wrote: The post had been shared over 350 times and received more than 150 comments as of Monday afternoon. “Marriage is the union of two people who love each other deeply and want to spend their life with another. Love doesn’t discriminate and neither should the world,” one person wrote. Added another: “Business suicide right there!!! And certainly deserved!!!” W.W. Bridal Boutique faced a similar backlash in 2014 when co-owner Victoria Miller refused an appointment for a lesbian couple over the telephone, citing her religious faith. “We feel we have to answer to God for what we do,” Miller, who co-owns the boutique with her husband, Tom, told reporters at the time. “Providing those two girls dresses for a sanctified marriage would break God’s law.” In an email Monday, Miller doubled down on that stance, telling HuffPost that her company’s decision to turn away same-sex couples is not “an attempt to deprive anyone of the opportunity to live their lives as they see fit,” but simply a matter of her religious beliefs. “We have provided formalwear for our customers from all walks of life, including the LGBTQ community. We have always served everyone with respect and dignity,” she wrote. “It is just this event, a same-sex marriage, which we cannot participate in due to our personal convictions.” She added, “We simply ask that we be given the same ability to live our lives according to our convictions.” Bakeries, florists and other wedding-related venues have become a hotbed of controversy as of late, with some business owners claiming they should not be required to provide services to same-sex couples because their religious beliefs forbid it. This fall, the Supreme Court will hear the case of Colorado’s Masterpiece Cakeshop, whose Christian owner turned away a gay couple seeking a cake for their 2012 wedding.Catch the latest in LGBTQ news by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter.

The official language, Catalan, has thrived for centuries, despite the establishment of Spanish as the rest of the country’s official language in the 1700s. Castells, or adults and children climbing on each other’s shoulders to form human towers, continues to be a popular activity at festivals. And in Vilafranca del Penedès, an hour outside of Barcelona, the local winery Bodegas Torres is researching and rediscovering wine varieties long thought to be extinct.It just so happens that many of these revived regional varieties thrive in hotter, drier climates. So Bodegas Torres is regrowing these ancestral vines to assuage the wine industry’s looming climate-change crisis.Growers in Mediterranean-climate regions in Western Europe, California and Australia report that increasing temperatures are leading to early harvests. For the time being, these early harvests result in higher-quality wines. But as temperatures climb higher and higher, driven by human-related greenhouse gas emissions, researchers believe that climates throughout these regions will become unsuitable for growing popular varieties. A 2013 study reported that lands suitable for growing wine grapes will decline by 25 percent (Chile) to 73 percent (Australia) by 2050. In 2016, a paper analyzing viticulture data in France and Switzerland from 1600 to 2007 found that climate change is indeed behind the higher temperatures driving the reported early harvests across Western Europe.RELATED: Climate Change Is About to Change Your WineBenjamin Cook, the 2016 paper’s lead author, explains that although early harvests may be a boon for growers in some areas, the increased heat will have different effects on wine-grape production in wetter climates like France, compared to drier regions like California or Spain. “In California, it doesn’t rain from May to September, so if you don’t have the water stored in the ground, or water available from reservoir to irrigate, that can have a negative impact on grape production,” Cook says. He added that in addition to California, “areas that already have dry summers — the Mediterranean climates — those are the areas where the adaptation for drought is going to be very important.”Despite Spanish winemakers’ imminent need for a solution to these increasing temperatures, Bodegas Torres’ ancestral-wine project was actually motivated by a desire to preserve local heritage. “All this research that we are doing by the ancient Catalan varieties, it’s something we are doing for the land, for the history of Catalonia,” Mireia Torres Maczassek, the winery’s director of research and development, said. Climate adaptability, it turns out, is a happy side-effect.During the 19th century, many vineyards in Western European countries like France and Spain suffered from phylloxera, a microscopic aphid that attacks the grapevines’ roots and causes rot. The Penedès region lost many red wine varieties to the scare, and afterwards, wineries planted white varieties that had been grafted with phylloxera-resistant American rootstock. But decades later, the local winemaker Miguel A. Torres believed that the Penedès region might still host a few survivors of the pest eradication. During the 1980s, Torres posted ads in local newspapers, asking farmers to respond if they spotted any unidentified or unusual vines in their fields. By 1996, Bodegas Torres, with Miguel A. Torres as its president, produced its first healthy ancestral grape species: Garró, a tannin-heavy, dark blue grape.RELATED: In the Future, Your Champagne Will Come From EnglandNow, almost 30 years later, this viticulture-flecked archaeological research project has led to an environmental research collaboration with France’s National Agricultural Research Institute, as well as the rediscovery of 46 grape varieties (although only a few are capable of producing wine). Inside the winery’s experimental greenhouse, rows of bright green vines stretch toward the sun, awaiting their replanting in micro-test fields.Torres Maczassek explains that the process of identifying and reviving a wine variety is a tedious one. After conducting identification and DNA analyses to determine whether the supposedly unknown vine already “exists,” they extract tissue from the tip of the ancestral plant’s shoot. The tissue is then grown in vitro for a year, and afterwards grown in a soilless mineral solution to gain more biomass. The healthy vines are then planted in experimental vineyards in different nearby climates, and finally, their berries are used to create wine.Some of these varieties thrived extremely well in the arid testing environments, due to characteristics like their berries ripening near the end of autumn, and to water-retention mechanisms like restricting or slowing leaf growth. A century from now, when hotter weather has made some of the grape varieties used today obsolete in Catalonia and other regions, these ancestral vines will be more capable of bearing fruit.RELATED: Alcohol: Climate Change’s Next Victim?Even if the future’s higher temperatures are anthropically induced, Markus Rienth, a professor of viticulture at Changins, a school in Switzerland with a focus on viticulture and oenology, says that the reason the varieties rediscovered by Bodegas Torres are better suited for hotter global temperatures is that numerous regions have gone through their own climate changes in the past. “We had this Climatic Optimum during the Middle Ages, and temperatures were pretty similar to now. Then it cooled down, and now it’s heating up again,” Rienth said. “That could be a reason those varieties perform better now.”Elizabeth Wolkovich, an ecologist at Harvard University and co-author on the 2016 study, says these ancestral varieties alone don’t carry the burden of keeping the world supplied with wine during a hotter future. In a review published this past June, she and her co-authors wrote that although the amount of genetic diversity among well-known and commonly used wine varieties is extremely small, differences in their seasonal development are vast. Wineries, she hypothesized, could crossbreed to produce super-climate offspring. In the case of Bodegas Torres’ ancestral-wine project, that means producing varieties that both taste great and can thrive in hotter temperatures.Despite the predictions of higher global temperatures in the near future, speed unfortunately is not something Torres Maczassek and her colleagues can promise. Even after regrowing a healthy variety, it can take nearly 20 years for the Spanish and Catalan governments to officially recognize these living dinosaurs and green-light them for mass production. But if their plan works, we’ll at least have decent reds and whites to sip on — perhaps at a time we need them most.“In the future, I don’t know what is going to happen,” Torres Maczassek said. “We are trying to do as much as possible.”This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: When Your Child Is a Psychopath, My Family’s Slave"
29,POLITICS,Progressives Actually Like Democrats' New Message,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressives-actually-like-democrats-new-message_us_59766598e4b0c95f375dc6f7,"With some caveats, of course.",2017-07-24,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), left, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and other Democrats arrive to introduce ""A Better Deal"" in Berryville, Virginia. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597668871a00008381dc052b.jpeg?cache=f1FiJ4wVc2&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Leading progressives praised the new message unveiled by top congressional Democrats on Monday that stresses economic policy, suggesting the party is moving on from the internecine finger-pointing that has dogged it since November’s election.Under the slogan “A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future,” House and Senate Democratic leaders laid out a three-pronged platform with ideas for creating decent-paying jobs; lowering household expenses, chief among them prescriptions drugs; and improving access to the education and training Americans need to compete in the job market.The proposals represent the party’s first major attempt to recalibrate its central themes ahead of the 2018 midterm elections and restore its historic reputation as the party of ordinary working people following Republican Donald Trump’s surprise victory in 2016′s presidential race. In a symbolic bid to emphasize their desire to reach a wider swath of Americans, party leaders announced the new agenda in Berryville, Virginia ― some 65 miles from the halls of power in Washington.Prominent liberals, who have been nudging the party in this direction for years, mostly welcomed the rebranding effort.“This is a very refreshing message ― it doesn’t sound like poll-tested messaging. It sounds authentic and passionate and bold,” said Tamara Draut, vice president for policy and research at Demos, a progressive think tank and advocacy group.“A ‘Better Deal,’ and more importantly, what [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer and [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi are saying about their new focus, is extremely strong,” said Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, a nonprofit fighting to expand Social Security and Medicare. “It’s not perfect, it’s not exactly what the grassroots is demanding. But as a starting point it is very, very strong.”All of Us, a pressure group that has threatened to help challenges in primaries against Democratic lawmakers deemed insufficiently progressive, mixed praise with demands for greater action.The group termed the agenda “a step toward embracing progressive populism” that “doesn’t go far enough.”The plan from the leading Democrats “is still unclear about where the party stands on tackling climate change, health care, rising racism, and free higher education, and if they’re willing to force the billionaire class to finally pay their fair share,” All of Us said in a statementNina Turner, president of Our Revolution, a group formed to carry on the legacy of the Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, also noted the omission of climate change and racial justice policies, as well as a plan to provide free college education. She credited the party for acknowledging major deficiencies, but said the real proof would be in efforts to follow through on the agenda’s lofty goals.“I hope this is not just a cute way to try to appease folks by forming another committee. We don’t need a committee ― we need a commitment to real policy changes,” she said.A Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity to comment said the new message was focused exclusively on economic policy, which did not indicate any less of a commitment to combatting climate change, fighting for racial justice and other matters.Efforts by Turner and her allies to hold Democrats to their populist facelift began almost immediately. Groups including Our Revolution, All of Us, Democracy for America and the National Nurses United debuted their “People’s Platform” initiative on Tuesday, calling on Democratic congressional leaders and candidates to get behind eight progressive bills. All but one of the bills, which range from single-payer health care legislation to automatic voter registration, have already been introduced in the House.After an unveiling press conference in Washington, D.C. ― featuring Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, and other progressive lawmakers ― several dozen activists went to the Democratic National Committee building to drop off more than 115,000 online petition signatures in support of the platform.At the latter event, there were once again signs of the strained relations between the most progressive elements of the party’s progressive base and the establishment. Activists were surprised to see that the DNC, apprised of the event in advance, had erected barriers preventing them from speaking on the steps. The DNC told HuffPost that it puts up protective barriers whenever there is a demonstration, friendly or not, and noted that it offered activists water and doughnuts.Turner, who was allowed to address the crowd from the steps, acknowledged the security justification, but nonetheless cried foul.“I’m feelin’ some kind of way right now,” she said. “Because if something like this, can happen to somebody like me, then imagine how other people are treated!”Even with the criticism, the response is a far cry from the mockery elicited by an earlier, leaked draft of the Democratic slogan last week: “A Better Deal: Better Skills, Better Jobs, Better Wages.” The phrase’s similarity to the tagline of ads for Papa John’s pizza chain and prominent placement of “Better Skills” ― an apparent nod to a much-maligned economic theory that blames joblessness on a dearth of skilled workers ― drew scorn from all corners of the political world. The details of the proposal and removal of the offending “Better Skills” clause quieted much of the criticism.“Absolutely, we need to help people get the skills they need,” said Draut. “But it is not the first thing we need to do and it is definitely not the first thing people want to hear. Even people with the right skills are having a hard time getting ahead.”A senior aide to a House Democrat credited Schumer’s political instincts for the party’s populist pivot.“Chuck Schumer knows which way the wind is blowing. Can’t say that for other members of leadership,” said the aide, who requested anonymity to comment.“A Better Deal” combines several well-known, albeit recent additions to the Democratic canon ― a nationwide $15 minimum wage; a $1 trillion infrastructure package; 12 weeks of paid family leave; protecting Social Security and Medicare ― with new ideas, including a small-business tax credit for job training and apprenticeship programs. These latter proposals are likely to find favor with the party’s pro-business wing. In presenting ways to lower families’ costs of living, however, Schumer, Pelosi and their deputies embraced an anti-monopoly, economic populism that bears little resemblance to the centrist triangulation of former President Bill Clinton, or even the free-trade-friendly technocracy of former President Barack Obama.“You have seen a shift away from the centrist politics and policies of the Democratic Party toward bold ideas that meet the challenges facing working people today,” Draut said. “It is a progression under way for some time now that has solidified.”Specifically, Democrats want to empower the Medicare program to negotiate lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, create a new federal agency to investigate and enforce action against prescription drug “price gouging,” and demand that drug companies explain significant price increases.The party is also taking on the issue of corporate consolidation, promising tougher antitrust rules aimed at curbing mega-mergers and having a federal watchdog ― a “21st century trust buster” ― enforce the new regulations even after a merger takes place.The growing size and reach of a handful of corporations ― from banks to airlines to tech giants like Amazon, Google and Facebook ― has been a subject of growing interest among progressive intellectuals who blame new monopoly power for problems ranging from the 2008 financial crisis to wage stagnation and the decline of rural America.Top proponents of bold antitrust action, which elected Democrats have sometimes been slower to get behind than policy gurus, were enthusiastic about the new platform and the rhetoric used to promote it.The Democratic leaders also promised to follow up with additional proposals aimed at making child care more affordable; cracking down on foreign trade abuses; ensuring high-speed internet access; and improving retirement security. Signs have emerged that the party is eager to emulate the fiery tone and economic message of Sanders, one of a small number of elected officials who can pack arenas on short notice and, according to at least one poll, the nation’s most popular politician. In a Sunday New York Times op-ed previewing the new agenda, Schumer echoed Sanders’ populist themes, promising a “better deal so that this country works for everyone again, not just the elites and special interests.”“Democrats have too often hesitated from taking on … misguided policies directly and unflinchingly — so much so that many Americans don’t know what we stand for,” he wrote. Sanders, now a member of Senate Democratic leadership despite maintaining his voter registration as an independent, was among those plugging “A Better Deal” in a 3-minute promotional video accompanying the rollout in Berryville.Of course, the party has not embraced all of the Vermont senator’s policy preferences ― steering clear of single-payer health insurance and free college tuition plans that were the cornerstones of his presidential campaign.The decision not to stick uniformly to the slate of proposals favored by the left won the approval of some Democratic moderates.“There’s something in there for all wings of the party,” said Ladan Ahmadi, a spokeswoman for Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank. Ahmadi cited the inclusion of job training tax credits as an example of the type of policies more accommodating to the likes of Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), a fiscal conservative. Yet in a Sunday appearance on ABC’s “This Week” Schumer went further than either he or Pelosi have ever gone toward endorsing government-run health insurance ― i.e., a single-payer system. That idea is gaining traction with the Affordable Care Act, a public-private patchwork, on the chopping block.Predicting that Republicans would fail to repeal Obamacare and that the two parties would then come together to stabilize the marketplaces created by the law, Schumer said, “we’re going to look at broader things ― single payer is one of them.”Other options “on the table,” he added, include lowering Medicare’s age eligibility to 55 and allowing consumers to buy into Medicare or Medicaid.Those weary of the party’s attempts to pin the blame for Trump’s election on the interference of either the Russian government or former FBI director James Comey expressed relief that Schumer was willing to take a hard look in the mirror.“It’s about time! It only took them about 8 months to realize that the Russia narrative ain’t working,” said Turner, who is also a former Ohio state senator.In the aftermath of the election, Democrats have been plagued by feuds between warring factions of the party with competing explanations for recent electoral failures.The disagreements over the party’s message and focus remain real, but the largely positive reactions to “A Better Deal” suggest a fragile detente has taken hold.“I’m not interested in replaying the past,” said Lawson, who backed Sanders over Hillary Clinton in the Democrats’ 2016 presidential primary race. “I’m interested in moving forward and winning and taking on the billionaire class and putting in place policies that work for the American people. The way you do it is making clear whose side you’re on.”This article has been updated with details about the People’s Platform initiative and events on Tuesday. "
30,POLITICS,Democrats Are Finally Waking Up To The Monopoly Problem,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-antitrust_us_5976572fe4b0a8a40e817612,"The party is putting antitrust reform at the core of its new agenda, ""A Better Deal.""",2017-07-24,Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) says antitrust law reform is a major plank in Democrats' populist-leaning “A Better Deal” agenda.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597658861a00003300dc04e3.jpeg?cache=x3eKhxAO8p&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democrats rolled out a new, populist-leaning agenda on Monday that they’re branding “A Better Deal.” Although specific legislative proposals haven’t been laid out yet, the rough outline suggests a significant shift in party thinking on an issue that touches all Americans: monopoly power.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), writing in The New York Times, named antitrust law reform as one of the major planks in the new agenda. Corporate mergers, he said, have driven up prices for consumers and given them fewer choices. That, in turn, has concentrated wealth in fewer hands and made income inequality worse.“Right now our antitrust laws are designed to allow huge corporations to merge, padding the pockets of investors but sending costs skyrocketing for everything from cable bills and airline tickets to food and health care,” Schumer wrote. “We are going to fight to allow regulators to break up big companies if they’re hurting consumers and to make it harder for companies to merge if it reduces competition.”The focus on monopolies in the Democratic Party’s image reboot drew cheers from the progressive wing of the party, especially as it came from a party leader known for his ties to Wall Street:Decades ago, it would have been unremarkable to hear mainstream Democratic politicians condemn corporate consolidation and its effects on consumers and workers. But when it comes to monopolies, the modern, more business-friendly Democratic Party isn’t the same trust-busting party it was a century ago. Look no further than one Democratic senator’s reaction this month to the prospect of Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods:As Matt Stoller recently wrote in The New Republic, corporate consolidation ”pervades every corner of American life,” from our airline tickets and drug prices to our cable bills and favorite beers. The concentration of economic power over the last several decades has happened under the watch of Democrats as well as Republicans. If Democrats want to find new relevance in the Donald Trump era, Stoller and others have argued, they need to tackle the issue of corporate mergers. The prominence of corporate consolidation in the “Better Deal” platform is a victory for party progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who have been hammering the issue for years. In a speech last year sponsored by New America ― a think tank that’s been churning out research on monopoly power ― Warren said that economic consolidation “threatens our markets, threatens our economy, and threatens our democracy.” Noting that nine American airlines have become four, Warren said the concept of “too big to fail” is now “hiding in plain sight all across the American economy.” In a guide to the antitrust plank of their agenda, Democrats said they would propose new standards to make it easier for regulators to prove that consolidation will hurt competition, and would block the largest mergers by default until the companies could prove the value of consolidation to the public. They also proposed creating a new “competition advocate” that would field complaints from the public and recommend investigations to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department.The party singled out a handful of industries for busting up: airlines, cable and internet providers, agrochemical producers, and eyeglass makers. The latter, they noted, is dominated by Luxottica Group, parent company to Oakley and Ray-Ban.Judging from the “Better Deal” rollout, Democratic leaders may be willing to confront the party’s lax attitude toward consolidation in recent decades. Speaking on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, Schumer said that the “the old Adam Smith idea of competition, it’s gone.” He offered one particular example of consolidation ― the Exxon-Mobil merger ― which happened in 1998, under the Bill Clinton administration. “How the heck did we let Exxon and Mobil merge?” Schumer asked. “And that was Democrats.”"

She is the last of my grandparents and I value her wisdom, love and friendship.Dear Grandma,Dad always valued his relationship with you. He said you never made him feel like an in-law — he felt like a son. This is something he told me up until days before his death.As my father’s health deteriorated, I began to lean on you for guidance. During the darkest moments of my life you have offered encouragement, advice and honesty. As I reflect on my father’s illness and my mother’s selfless caregiving, I realize these qualities were inherited from you. I watched my mother transform into a hero as she became Dad’s caregiver. She selflessly cared for Dad for 7 years. Many times I looked at my mother in awe and wondered where her courage, kindness and resilience came from. How could I not realize these characteristics are an inherited quality from you? You are the strongest woman I know, you are living proof that life goes on despite the detours life throws in our path. You beat cancer, heart issues, survived World War II and so much more. You are one of the most vivacious, optimistic, and resilient people I have ever known.After my father died, I counted down the minutes for you to arrive. Your hug instantly brought me back to my childhood. During one of the saddest times of my life you made me feel safe and warm. I didn’t want to let go and return to reality. As we grieve the traumatic loss of my father, I watch you selflessly hold us up. You are the light in the darkness, guiding us as we find our way in this new life without Dad.You are the definition of bravery and wisdom.If there’s one thing I don’t tell you enough is “thank you.” Thank you for your unconditional love, your support, for being the matriach of our family. Thank you for being you. At 86 years old, you are the kindest, strongest, funniest, most amazing woman I know. You are our angel on Earth, and every single day I hope to make you proud. You taught my mother how to be the best person she can be.I love you more than all the stars in the sky, Grandma.Love,Your oldest grandchild,Lisa"

What kind of life would she have if we returned to the old insurance set-up?""",2017-07-24,"Health care activists make themselves comfortable outside of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office, in protest of the GOP's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5970c2521a00003400dbfc2a.jpeg?ops=crop_750_274_4426_2913%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Joel Cobbs has had it with the health care debate in Washington.People aren’t working together. His congressman won’t reply to his letters ― Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) hasn’t responded to the more than two dozen notes with questions about health care that Cobbs has sent him ― or hold in-person town halls. It seems to Cobbs, a 28-year-old technical writer based outside of Atlanta, that Collins is simply afraid to take questions about his party’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.So Cobbs, who leans Democratic, is trying something new. Last week, for the first time in his life, he signed up to run for office. He’s mulling a run against Collins.“How can you represent people when you’re not even willing to meet with them? You’re going to cower in the corner where it’s safe?” Cobbs asked. “That really gets on my nerves.”A Collins spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment about why the congressman won’t respond to Cobbs or hold in-person town halls.Cobbs is not alone in being moved to action by the health care debate.As Senate Republicans’ fight over Obamacare repeal reached a fever pitch last week, Run for Something saw a nearly 500 percent increase in its daily candidate recruitment. The organization, which recruits and trains Democrats under the age of 35 to run for office, typically has five to 10 people sign up on the weekends and 15 to 20 sign up on a weekday. Between last Sunday and Tuesday, more than 220 people signed up. Cobbs was among them.EMILY’s List, which recruits Democratic women to run for office, didn’t see an uptick in sign-ups over the past week, per se. But the number of people signing up has been “very steadily climbing” every month this year, said Julie McClain Downey, the group’s national director of campaign communications. The health care debate appears to have inspired many of these women. “EMILY’s List has seen a massive increase in interest from women running this cycle,” Downey said. “More than 16,000 have contacted us, many of them specifically mentioning health care as a reason why they are running.”There has been a surge of Democrats signing up to run for office since President Donald Trump entered the White House. There are many reasons for this, but it’s hard to see a more universally motivating factor than health care.Pretty much everybody has had a health scare, or watched someone they love face a serious condition. And they worry about being able to afford care in those crucial moments. When a politician votes to take away insurance from people in those circumstances ― House Republicans passed a bill that would eliminate pre-existing condition protections and knock 23 million people off insurance; Senate Republicans are wrestling with passing a bill that would kick 32 million people off of insurance ― it isn’t just politically risky. It’s deeply personal.That’s a big reason why the majority of Americans oppose repealing Obamacare, despite years of Republicans bashing the law. And although some people may not have liked the idea of standing up against a major new government health care program, it’s entirely different when someone tries to take away the vital benefits they’ve come to rely on as a result of that program. It’s enough to make people fight back in ways they haven’t before.“Republican elected officials are playing partisan politics with a literal life-or-death issue,” said Amanda Litman, a co-founder of Run for Something. “People are signing up to run because their kids are at risk of losing coverage or their families have struggled because of lifetime caps. This isn’t an abstract policy with a faceless statistical impact.” The issue has even driven some people to take on longtime members of Congress. Mai Khanh Tran, a pediatrician and two-time breast cancer survivor, announced last month that she’s challenging Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), a 12-term congressman and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Tran, a Democrat, says explicitly on her campaign page that she’s running because of Royce’s efforts to gut the Affordable Care Act ― he voted more than 40 times to repeal the law when President Barack Obama was president, and he supported the House bill in May that eliminates pre-existing condition protections.“As a physician I am saddened by Ed Royce’s callousness, as a mom I am hurt, and as a citizen I am angry,” Tran said. “There is simply no way many of the families that I serve as a pediatrician will keep their insurance coverage.”Neither Royce’s congressional office nor his campaign office responded to a request for comment.For Cobbs, the decision to run is even more personal. He has epilepsy and has relied on pre-existing condition protections to get affordable care.

Mai Khanh Tran, a pediatrician and two-time breast cancer survivor, has announced that she will challenge the 12-term congressman for his House seat because she disagrees with his efforts to repeal Obamacare.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597644e91a00003300dc04ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Joel Cobbs has had it with the health care debate in Washington.People aren’t working together. His congressman won’t reply to his letters ― Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) hasn’t responded to the more than two dozen notes with questions about health care that Cobbs has sent him ― or hold in-person town halls. It seems to Cobbs, a 28-year-old technical writer based outside of Atlanta, that Collins is simply afraid to take questions about his party’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.So Cobbs, who leans Democratic, is trying something new. Last week, for the first time in his life, he signed up to run for office. He’s mulling a run against Collins.“How can you represent people when you’re not even willing to meet with them? You’re going to cower in the corner where it’s safe?” Cobbs asked. “That really gets on my nerves.”A Collins spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment about why the congressman won’t respond to Cobbs or hold in-person town halls.Cobbs is not alone in being moved to action by the health care debate.As Senate Republicans’ fight over Obamacare repeal reached a fever pitch last week, Run for Something saw a nearly 500 percent increase in its daily candidate recruitment. The organization, which recruits and trains Democrats under the age of 35 to run for office, typically has five to 10 people sign up on the weekends and 15 to 20 sign up on a weekday. Between last Sunday and Tuesday, more than 220 people signed up. Cobbs was among them.EMILY’s List, which recruits Democratic women to run for office, didn’t see an uptick in sign-ups over the past week, per se. But the number of people signing up has been “very steadily climbing” every month this year, said Julie McClain Downey, the group’s national director of campaign communications. The health care debate appears to have inspired many of these women. “EMILY’s List has seen a massive increase in interest from women running this cycle,” Downey said. “More than 16,000 have contacted us, many of them specifically mentioning health care as a reason why they are running.”There has been a surge of Democrats signing up to run for office since President Donald Trump entered the White House. There are many reasons for this, but it’s hard to see a more universally motivating factor than health care.Pretty much everybody has had a health scare, or watched someone they love face a serious condition. And they worry about being able to afford care in those crucial moments. When a politician votes to take away insurance from people in those circumstances ― House Republicans passed a bill that would eliminate pre-existing condition protections and knock 23 million people off insurance; Senate Republicans are wrestling with passing a bill that would kick 32 million people off of insurance ― it isn’t just politically risky. It’s deeply personal.That’s a big reason why the majority of Americans oppose repealing Obamacare, despite years of Republicans bashing the law. And although some people may not have liked the idea of standing up against a major new government health care program, it’s entirely different when someone tries to take away the vital benefits they’ve come to rely on as a result of that program. It’s enough to make people fight back in ways they haven’t before.“Republican elected officials are playing partisan politics with a literal life-or-death issue,” said Amanda Litman, a co-founder of Run for Something. “People are signing up to run because their kids are at risk of losing coverage or their families have struggled because of lifetime caps. This isn’t an abstract policy with a faceless statistical impact.” The issue has even driven some people to take on longtime members of Congress. Mai Khanh Tran, a pediatrician and two-time breast cancer survivor, announced last month that she’s challenging Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), a 12-term congressman and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Tran, a Democrat, says explicitly on her campaign page that she’s running because of Royce’s efforts to gut the Affordable Care Act ― he voted more than 40 times to repeal the law when President Barack Obama was president, and he supported the House bill in May that eliminates pre-existing condition protections.“As a physician I am saddened by Ed Royce’s callousness, as a mom I am hurt, and as a citizen I am angry,” Tran said. “There is simply no way many of the families that I serve as a pediatrician will keep their insurance coverage.”Neither Royce’s congressional office nor his campaign office responded to a request for comment.For Cobbs, the decision to run is even more personal. He has epilepsy and has relied on pre-existing condition protections to get affordable care. He and his wife just had a daughter, too, and he worries how she would be hurt just by virtue of being female, given that pregnancy and health issues stemming from domestic violence were considered pre-existing conditions under the health care system in place before the Affordable Care Act took effect.“I have an 11-day-old baby girl. Unfortunately, society has made that her pre-existing condition,” Cobbs said. “What kind of life would she have if we returned to the old insurance set-up? Something should be done.

39,BLACK VOICES,The Radical Importance Of Issa Rae's 'Insecure',Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-radical-importance-of-issa-raes-insecure_us_5976241de4b0aad8e51c5bfc,"When's the last time we got to see a black, 20-something year old woman on TV get to be so complicated?",2017-07-24,"Issa Rae, star of one of the best TV comedies in years. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597624be150000521d8b34f7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Sunday night, during the second season premiere of “Insecure” on HBO, we watched 30 hilarious minutes in the life of a deeply melanated, kinky-haired, black woman named Issa. We did not watch her blackness played out as some sort of gimmick. Instead, we watched her in agonize over a bad breakup, have a bad day at work, be petty despite her better judgment, and have an awkward and confusing run-in with her ex.We watched her, in other words, be a regular, flawed, human being.It’s hard to believe that, five years ago, Olivia Pope was the most exciting black female lead on TV. There is, of course, a place for the Olivia Popes and Annaliese Keatings of the television world. These characters are important. But before “Insecure,” there were no prime time shows that so vividly depicted the black, female, millennial experience. At least, not ones that mattered.The fact that “Insecure” follows not one but two dark-skinned black female leads (the second, Molly, played by Yvonne Orji) with real storylines is doubly exciting. Perhaps not since sitcoms like “Living Single,” or “Girlfriends” has a half-hour comedy offered up these kinds of shades and textures of black womanhood.In a perfect world, none of this would be cause for so much celebration, or provide so much fodder for think pieces. But the fact that “Insecure” is the first time that a character like Issa has stood at the center of a narrative on primetime TV makes her rarity and her brilliance worth pointing out. It’s an idea that isn’t lost on Rae, who created and executive produces the show. As she told HuffPost Black Voices senior editor Lilly Workneh last year: “Black people don’t really get a chance to be regular, boring, and go through everyday things. But this is very much a slice of life show.”As much as a catalyst in the ever continuing Hollywood diversity conversation as Olivia Pope was, her emergence at just around the same time as the debut of HBO’s “Girls” and Comedy Central’s “Broad City” highlighted a deep television void: When was the last time we got to see a young black woman on television come of age, be messy, make mistakes, kick back with her other black girlfriends, have unapologetic drunken sex, fight, and make up?The problem wasn’t that television was missing a “black version of Girls,” or that to rectify the situation there needed to be a direct equivalent to the dozens of shows that explored the free, white and 20-something female experience, but that featured black women.The real issue was that, like always, the industry was incredibly slow to realize, to even consider, that representations of black women on television can also span age and socio-economic status, that the genre doesn’t always have to be a hard-hitting work drama, that black women do in fact have coming-of-age stories worth telling. Web series like “An African City” and “roomieloverfriends” got that, but the lack of a smart and funny black millennial perspective on primetime cable or network TV was glaring. There’s a moment in episode one of the new season of “Insecure” that crystalizes what makes the series, and Issa, so special. It’s a scene that echoes a similar montage in season one where Issa, getting ready for a night out where she’ll potentially run into an old flame, practices what to say, going from seductive to aggressive to coy. In “Hella Great,” she stands before another mirror trying on different identities, figuring out how she’ll react when the ex-boyfriend she cheated on last season, Lawrence, arrives at her place for the first time in weeks. Will she be humble, apologetic? Will she be stand-offish in a bid to make him think she’s moved on?“I’m so glad you made it...I really missed you...you haven’t changed a bit...but I have, I’m not a cheater anymore!” Issa tries, before shifting to nonchalance ―“Oh, hey. I forgot you were coming.”There’s something so incredibly human, so relatable about this moment of candid vulnerability. Here, alone with her thoughts, Issa gets to act out all the sides of herself, even the sides she’ll never show, with a humor and honesty that plays on the stereotypes thrust on black women, and the stereotypes that we unconsciously thrust upon ourselves. The show is chock full of these candid, honest, real moments of young black womanhood that have been missing from our screens for some time. Half a decade after the debut of “Scandal,” Issa is vital to the ongoing progression of black and brown stories on television. She isn’t a “boss,” like Mary Jane Paul or Olivia Pope, her messy drama is more petty than epic, and thus relatable as hell to a whole generation of 20-something black women who have been craving for a show that speaks to them on a deeper, more visceral level.

Her quiet gasps soon turned into one big horrified scream, however, as her hands balled up in front of her, perhaps too petrified to reach up and pull it off.By Monday, the video, which appears to have been shot in the U.K., had been liked more than 18,000 times and retweeted more than 12,000.As for what happened to the slug, well, a photo shared on Twitter later showed one crushed on the ground with the caption: “It’s dead.”Why the group was passing around a slug in the first place is a question left for another day.

43,MEDIA,The New York Times Doesn't Get Its Apology From 'Fox & Friends' Over ISIS Segment,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-times-fox-news_us_59763313e4b0c95f375d57df,"A Times spokeswoman called a weekend segment questioning its journalists' patriotism ""sheer hypocrisy.""",2017-07-24,"A ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" co-host questioned the patriotism of New York Times journalists. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59763939210000a31afc8691.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Monday’s “Fox & Friends,” co-host Steve Doocy briefly addressed a weekend segment of the show that The New York Times had called “malicious and inaccurate,” but he didn’t issue the on-air apology sought by the newspaper.The Times’ unusual request for a public apology from Fox News stemmed from remarks made Friday by head of Special Operations Command Gen. Tony Thomas, who said at an Aspen Institute Security Forum that a “prominent national newspaper” hampered efforts to catch Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi by publishing leaked information after a May 16, 2015, raid in Syria.The Pentagon had announced the day of the raid that U.S. commandos killed senior ISIS leader Abu Sayyaf and captured his wife, an event also widely reported in other news media, including on Fox News.Thomas did not name the publication in question on Friday, but Fox News chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge, the panel’s moderator, wrote later Friday that the general “appeared to be referring” to a Times report published on June 8, 2015. A Times spokeswoman said Doocy’s Monday “update” to earlier coverage of Thomas’ remarks failed to address larger concerns with a “Fox & Friends Weekend” segment, one of which she said was “sheer hypocrisy.” The Fox & Friends weekend crew blasted the Times, even questioning journalists’ patriotism, without mentioning Herridge reported on intelligence gathered from the ISIS raid when it occurred. On May 17, 2015, Herridge reported on air how U.S. forces obtained “a treasure trove of information, including cell phones, laptop computers and documents” that “reveal how the ISIS network communicates and earns money to finance its operations in Iraq and Syria.” She said “the newly recovered intelligence” from the raid “may bring U.S. closer” to getting Baghdadi. Thomas’ claims, covered Friday on the network’s website, received significant play the next morning on the weekend edition of “Fox & Friends,” a favorite of President Donald Trump. Guest Lt. Col Tony Shaffer said the Times’ reporting on the ISIS raid was another example of the media being more worried about “supporting a political agenda than actually protecting the American people,” a critique co-host Pete Hegseth appeared to agreed with. An on-screen chyron read: “NYT Foils U.S. Attempt To Take Out Al-Baghdadi.”About 20 minutes after Thomas’ remarks were first discussed on the show, the president tweeted that “the Failing New York Times foiled U.S. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist, Al-Baghdadi” and put “their sick agenda over National Security.”Thomas’ Friday remarks ― and the president’s tweet during the 6 a.m. hour show ― were discussed in later segments of the three-hour show. The co-hosts’ comments about the Times, and the show’s on-screen images and graphics, contributed to a portrayal of the paper’s journalists as damaging national security by impeding the capture of Baghdadi. Hegseth said Saturday that the Times is “not just failing in its credibility, it’s failing our country.” The paper, responded co-host Abby Huntsman, is “failing the American people.”During a discussion about news organizations withholding information due to national security concerns, Hegseth said journalists used to do so “because they were patriots.”“And so I ask the so-called journalists at the failing New York Times,” he said, holding a copy of the paper, “are you patriots or not?”Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said the government did not request that the paper withhold the June 2015 story. “The New York Times story in question was published on June 8, more than three weeks after the raid,” the spokeswoman said. “Furthermore, The Times described the piece to the Pentagon before publication and they had no objections. No senior American official complained publicly about the story until now, more than two years later.”The Washington Post reported Saturday that Thomas had once “told reporters” that the Times’ June 2015 article hurt their pursuit of Baghdadi, but those comments don’t appear to have been published previously. A spokesman for the Special Operations Command declined Monday to confirm that Thomas’ comments Friday were in reference to the Times. “General Thomas did not give a specific publication or a specific article,” a spokesman told HuffPost. In a Sunday letter to Fox News, Ha took issue with how “Fox & Friends” co-hosts framed Thomas’ remarks, including Clayton Morris saying “al-Baghdadi was able to sneak away under the cover of darkness after a New York Times story” and Hegseth saying the U.S. government “would have had al-Baghdadi based on the intelligence that we had except someone leaked information to the failing New York Times.”“Neither the staff at Fox & Friends, nor the writers of a related story on FoxNews.com, appeared to make any attempt to confirm relevant facts, nor did they reach out to The New York Times for comment,” she wrote. Though the network’s coverage was based on Thomas’ “misleading assertion,” Ha said, that “does not alleviate Fox News of the obligation to seek information from all the stakeholders in a story.”“With this segment, Fox & Friends demonstrated what little regard it has for reporting facts,” she wrote. Ha also reached out separately to Herridge, who later updated her online article with a statement from the Times. On Monday, Doocy played the clip of Thomas’ remarks and noted that the Times had issued a statement in response that had been published on Fox News’ site. He did not mention the request for an apology over the weekend co-hosts framing Thomas’ comments in a “malicious and inaccurate” way.In a Monday statement, the network said the “the FoxNews.com story was already updated online yesterday and Fox & Friends provided an updated story to viewers this morning based on the FoxNews.com report.” “For all of their hyperventilating to the media about a correction,” the statement continued, “the New York Times didn’t reach out to anyone at Fox News until Sunday afternoon for a story that ran Friday night.”In a statement Monday in response to Doocy’s update, Ha cited Herridge’s May 2015 coverage, and the co-hosts’ coverage Saturday, as an example of “sheer hypocrisy.”“The host railed against The New York Times for covering a raid, stating that the U.S. government ‘would have had al-Baghdadi based on the intelligence that we had except someone leaked’ to The New York Times when Fox News had covered the same raid three weeks earlier in a segment in which their correspondent said, ‘The newly recovered intelligence may bring U.S. closer to Baghdadi’s kill or capture,’” Ha wrote. “According to the curious logic of the Fox & Friends host,” she continued, “Fox News itself was unpatriotic.” In an additional statement later on Monday, Fox News again defended its coverage online and on-air and also suggested that the Times was trying to distract from criticism it received over the decision to name a covert CIA official. “Neither Fox News’ report nor the subsequent on-air coverage was inaccurate,” the statement read. “We find it beyond disappointing that the New York Times, in an attempt to distract from their recent debacle, decided to blame Fox News for comments made publicly by General Thomas during a widely viewed panel at the Aspen Security Forum. It might behoove the Times to actually check in with their reporter Eric Schmitt to see whether Gen. Thomas’ comments have merit and whether Schmitt’s reporting in 2015 revealed intelligence that allowed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to slip away.”This story has been updated with an additional statement from Fox News."

As such, we are united in opposition to the current Republican health care proposals,” the letter says. It adds that the nuns “stand by our belief that health is a universal right.”The letter was organized by NETWORK, a Catholic social justice organization that endorsed the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 under former President Barack Obama when other prominent Catholic organizations failed to do so. Sister Simone Campbell, NETWORK’s executive director, wrote the letter and as of Monday morning it was signed by 7,150 nuns across the U.S..Campbell, who frequently leads national “Nuns on the Bus” tours promoting social justice, was considered crucial in recruiting Catholic senators to support health care reform in 2010.Monday’s letter targets the GOP’s Better Care And Reconciliation Act (BRCA), though Senate Republican leaders appear to be shifting focus as they struggle to win a majority for their efforts. “Since this letter was circulated, Senate leadership has repeatedly changed course ― from the BCRA, to a repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a replacement, to amendments of bills from 2015. This is not good governance,” NETWORK said in a press release. The Congressional Budget Office projects that, under various versions of bills being considered, between 22 to 32 million people would lose health insurance.The letter notes Catholic sisters’ familiarity with issues facing America’s needy, and the impact diminished health care access would have on vulnerable communities. “We have witnessed firsthand the moral crisis of lack of quality, affordable healthcare in this country,” the letter says. “We have seen early and avoidable deaths because of lack of insurance, prohibitive costs, and lack of access to quality care.”Sisters delivered the letter to several Republican senators on Monday, bringing with them a doll modeled after Pope Francis with a sign saying: “Let’s have a come to Jesus moment.”Sister Campbell delivered the letter to the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).“Rather than continuing to negotiate partisan legislation that would cause tens of millions of Americans to lose access to health coverage, Congress should seek bipartisan solutions to expand quality, affordable coverage,” the letter says.“Our faith urges us to care for all people and all of creation, especially the most vulnerable,” the letter says, adding that proposals under Senate consideration go “against our Catholic faith teaching.”Several prominent Catholic organizations have voiced opposition to any health care reform that threatens critical elements of the Affordable Care Act. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published a letter last week urging senators to “oppose any effort to repeal” the act “without a concurrent replacement plan that protects poor and vulnerable people...”The Catholic Health Association expressed similar concerns about the effect on Medicaid under GOP proposals. “The proposed cap on federal Medicaid funding and the elimination of the coverage expansion funding, which amount to hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts, will lead to tremendous Medicaid coverage losses for our nation’s most vulnerable and low-income populations,” Sister Carol Keehan, association’s president and CEO, wrote.

Israel has imposed a ban on reporting the incident and has made no public comment.Violence against Israelis is rare in Jordan, a tightly policed country that is also a staunch regional ally of the United States.But tensions have escalated between the two countries since Israel installed metal detectors at entry points to Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem after two Israeli policemen were shot dead by three Arab-Israeli gunmen on Friday near the site.The new security measures have triggered the bloodiest spate of Isreli-Palestinian violence for years. Jordan has called for the removal of the metal detectors and thousands of Jordanians have protested against the Israeli move.In their statement, the Jordanian police said that after the attack they had sealed the heavily protected embassy in an affluent part of the capital and deployed dozens of anti-terrorism gendarmie forces.Initial checks suggested the two Jordanian men had entered the embassy compound as workmen, they said.Many of Jordan’s 7 million citizens are of Palestinian origin. They or their parents or grandparents were expelled or fled to Jordan in the fighting that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948.Israel has in the past given repeated assurances that it understands Jordan’s concerns and does not seek to alter the status quo in the Muslim holy sites of Jerusalem.King Abdullah’s Hashemite monarchy has been custodian of the sites since 1924, paying for their upkeep and deriving part of its legitimacy from the role.(Reporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Editing by Mark Trevelyan and Gareth Jones)"

Gonchar would serve as Charge d’Affaires until Kislyak’s successor arrived.Kislyak, who held the post since 2008, is expected to be replaced by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Antonov.Antonov’s nomination for the post, which has yet to be approved by the Kremlin, comes at a time of intense scrutiny over Moscow-Washington relations following U.S. allegations that Russia meddled in the U.S. election last year.Kislyak’s name has emerged in relation to several of Trump’s associates as a special counsel and congressional panels investigate Russian meddling and possible ties with the Trump campaign.On Friday, the Washington Post reported Kislyak was overheard by U.S. spy agencies telling his bosses he had discussed campaign-related matters, including issues important to Moscow, with Jeff Sessions during the 2016 presidential race.As Attorney General, Sessions recused himself in March from matters connected to an investigation by the FBI following his admission he had talked to the Russian envoy.Sessions has denied discussing campaign issues with Russian officials and has said he only met Kislyak in his role of U.S. senator.Former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign in February after it became known that he had failed to disclose the content of conversations he had with Kislyak and misled the vice president about their meetings.Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner also failed to disclose contacts with Russia when seeking his security clearance, the New York Times reported in April.The White House disclosed in March that Kushner met with Kislyak at Trump Tower in December 2016, in addition to seeing Kislyak when he attended an April 2016 campaign speech in Washington. The White House said the December meeting was to establish “a line of communication.”Kushner also had phone calls with Kislyak between April and November 2016, Reuters reported. Kushner’s attorney has said that Kushner had “no recollection” of the calls as he had participated in “thousands of calls in this time period.”Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump has said his campaign did not collude with Russia.The White House said this week Trump would nominate Jon Huntsman as his new ambassador to Russia.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Yara Bayoumy and Chris Reese)"

With a headline of “Dear God, Not Again, the paper analyzes recent events that include violent deaths on both sides over events at the Al Asqa Mosque in Jerusalem at the Dome of the Rock. This piece of property has profound religious meaning for both Jews and Muslims, and thusly sits as a likely flashpoint for World War III. It bears watching. The Dome of the Rock is atop the Temple Mount, where the Temple of Solomon used to sit. For Muslims, it’s the location where Muhammad is said to have ascended into heaven. The Temple is where ancient Israelis used to pray, where Abraham was prepared to sacrifice his son, and where Solomon offered his prayer of repentance on behalf of the Jews. The site is managed by Jordan, and Jews are allowed to visit but not pray. The site also has deep significance to certain Christians who dwell on end times prophecy, for according to that prophecy, the Temple must be rebuilt as the last act before Jesus Christ returns to rule for 1,000 years. For this reason, American fundamentalist Christians are willing to look the other way at modern-day violence.The point is that what happens here in the daily news is of supreme importance to all people of “the book,” and to countries near and far who are likely to get caught up in the conflict. Evangelical Christians of the sort who voted for and support Donald Trump were deeply disappointed when the administration decided against moving the American embassy to Jerusalem, in part, because it would’ve raised the tension in the area, which these Christians view quietly as a good thing. After all, what could be better than the return of Jesus Christ? The more this view resonates with the mainstream of contemporary life in the United States, the greater the risk of all-out war - Armageddon - in the Middle East.Chuck Colson nailed this conflict beautifully in the prologue of his bestselling book Kingdoms in Conflict. It’s a brilliant 30-page work of fiction from a man with deep knowledge of the inner workings of the White House. The story is about an evangelical President of the United States who must make a decision about intervening as Israeli right-wingers begin to take over the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. In Colson’s story, President Shelby Hopkins is a Southern Baptist with roots in the far right of the party. As events begin to unfold, Colson describes a hastily called meeting with key members of Hopkins’ cabinet, including the Chief of Staff, the Secretaries of State and Defense, the Attorney General, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the national security advisor. His knowledge of the White House and how things work within make for a very real atmosphere of tension in the room.The Soviet army had invaded Iran and now came word that a small Jewish sect known as Tehiya led by the radical Yosef Tzuria were planning to blow up the Dome of the Rock and rebuild the temple of Solomon in its place. Tzuria believed that God had given the entirety of the Holy Land to the Zionists. At the meeting, after discussions among the gathered about how destruction of the Dome of the Rock would mean war, the president, who had been silent until this point in Colson’s story, says in reference to providence, “Gentlemen, we must keep in mind the very real possibility that this situation is beyond us all.” The fictional president is suggesting that God Almighty is directing the path of humanity in this, and it throws a monkey wrench into conventional thinking about the conflict specifically and international relations in general. He refuses to act.His staff, therefore, secretly initiates a plan without the president’s knowledge to send Marines to Jerusalem to protect the Dome of the Rock. It’s seen as an action against our greatest ally, Israel, and when he learns of the plan, it troubles the president deeply. The action was based on intelligence suggesting that Tehiya was about to take over the Israeli government, which would make matters much worse. The staff tries to bring the president to understand the necessity of action, but he responds to his close friend and Chief of Staff Larry Parrish, “You know, Larry, I can’t help thinking—this really could be the time. The generation that saw the Jews return to their homeland is about to pass. It almost has to happen soon. All that is left is for the Temple to be built. That’s the last big sign before—.”In a private discussion, the President and his Chief of Staff talk about the history they’re about to make:“Larry, don’t ‘yessir’ me. Say what’s on your mind.”“I don’t know what’s on my mind, Mr. President. Frankly, sir, you’re scaring me to death.”“You mean that, don’t you, Larry?” The president stood, half turned away, then whirled back to face him, “I didn’t think anything could ruffle you. Tell me why.”“I don’t know how to explain it, if you can’t see it for yourself, sir.” Parrish replied. “You’re responsible for hundreds of millions of lives, including mine, including my wife and kids. And you seem to be guiding us by some obscure, kooky theory about the end of the world.”“What if that obscure, kooky theory happens to be true?”“I’m happy to leave that decision up to God. The end of the world is His business. Our business here in the White House is to prevent the end of the world.”“Well, according to my theology, Larry, the end of the world - ”Parrish interrupted, something he never would have done had he not been deeply distressed. “Your theology is irrelevant right now! You weren’t elected to be the nation’s theologian.”The staff convinces the President to send a harsh letter to Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Arens, but Hopkins refuses to bully the man. They then receive word that Prime Minister Arens and Tehiya’s Tzuria have reached an agreement. Larry Parrish addresses the President:“They (the American people) trust you. You can’t betray them.”“But I only avoid that if I keep trust with God.”“Then keep us out of a war! Surely God did not put you here to cheer on the Israelis while they blunder into World War Three. Harrell has information that Tzuria and Arens have reached an agreement. If we don’t stop them with our marines, they’ll destroy the mosque, probably within the next twenty-four hours. We have to move militarily or there’ll be war.”“No,” Hopkins said vehemently. “I will not lift a hand against God’s chosen people.”In the end, the Israelis destroy the Temple Mount, and the White House seems incapable of unity on a response. It is a helpless scenario, and Colson just leaves us there to contemplate the enormity and chaos of it all.This entire story was Chuck Colson’s way of warning us that it would be extremely dangerous for an Evangelical with a prophetic, apocalyptic perspective on world events to be in the White House. While Donald Trump himself isn’t such a man, he is certainly surrounded by such, including the guy who actually seems to be running things, former Brietbart CEO Steve Bannon. The Christian “leaders” who met, “laid hands on,” and prayed with President Trump recently are generally of the same mind, as noted by Vox Magazine:“By appealing not just to his evangelical base but to a theological, even apocalyptic reading of history, and Trump’s role in it, Trump is not merely legitimizing alternative facts but, more dangerously, writing alternative sacred history. He is cast a religious martyr, or someone who, though assailed on (in their view, bogus) legal or circumstantial grounds will be vindicated through divine favor.”Colson’s 30-year old book is excellent, but that prologue is chilling, because we’re witnessing events in a highly right-wing Israel today that are eerily similar. It’s a time in history when we MUST pay close attention to everything and without the view that Israel can do no wrong. The U.S. provides the Netanyahu government with $10 million in aid every single day, and despite our wishes to the contrary, Israel continues forcing its aggressive settlement plans in the West Bank.Meanwhile, we’re all busy with issues of cultural and personal morals, class warfare, Russian corruption, North Korean missiles, social media, violence in our streets and alleys, and a culture unable to work together for the common good. Let us not be so distracted that we lose our ability to grasp the greater danger."

While extremism and related violence have traditionally been driven by exclusion and poverty, this paradigm is no longer adequate. As shown during the attack at Kenya’s Garissa University, not all extremists are uneducated or from poor families.Complex, interlinked and rapidly evolving circumstances have brought about the need for a raft of interventions geared towards fostering sustainable peace in the border areas. One of the most promising initiatives to-date involves establishing social and economic interdependence across border communities.This is the powerful rationale behind the pact between the Governments of Ethiopia and Kenya, who established a cross-border programme which straddles Marsabit County, Kenya and the Borana/Dawa Zones of Ethiopia known as the “Integrated Programme for Sustainable Peace and Socio-economic Transformation.” This initiative was launched in December 2015 by President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, and Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn of Ethiopia and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Executive Secretary, Ambassador Mahboub Maalim. Short video.The programme, which is implemented in partnership with IGAD and the UN Country Teams of Ethiopia and Kenya, aims at preventing and mitigating potential violent conflicts and extremism in the borderland areas through conflict prevention mechanisms, addressing the root causes of violent extremism and focusing on the humanitarian, security and development nexus. To take this programme another step forward, the Kenyan and Ethiopian Governments signed the programme document on 22 June 2017. To galvanize support for the programme, an event titled “From Barriers to Bridges: The Ethiopia-Kenya Cross-Border Programme” was organized on 10 July 2017 at UNDP New York. It was co-chaired by the Permanent Representatives of Kenya and Ethiopia to the United Nations.Taking stock of the programme to-date, one cannot help but marvel at how far the two countries have come and what can still be achieved. As confirmed by local community elders, local conflicts have diminished and the programme has achieved impressive results in reducing the allure of extremist groups such as Al-Shabaab among local youth, ever since joint interventions by the Government of Kenya, the UN and civil society partners started in 2015.There have been significant socio-economic gains as well. The Isiolo-Merille-Marsabit-Moyale road, which is partially financed by the European Union (EU), is now complete and is expected to be a game-changer in enhancing integration, connectivity and promoting trade between Ethiopia and Kenya. Today 26 July 2017 President Kenyatta joined by Mr Gabiel Negatu, Director General for Africa Development Bank’s Eastern Africa Region, commissioned the Isiolo-Merille-Mersabit-Moyale Highway. This is part of the great North-South trans-continental road; connecting Cape-Cairo. Closer to home, the highway, financed by the African Development Bank and partly by EU, will serve to integrate Northern Kenya with Southern Ethiopia. Upon opening of the One-Stop-Boarder-Post (OSBP), peoples, goods and other resources on both sides of the border will be able travel and trade freely and create a vibrant economic corridor; with jobs for thousands of youths on both sides. Beyond the economic gains, the highway will also contribute to political and security stability of the region. The World Bank has also embarked on a huge infrastructure development programme to link Isiolo with Mandera. The EU is already proposing that the Ethiopia-Kenya cross-border programme be scaled up to include the Mandera Triangle, the Omo and Karamoja clusters. These are all welcome developments for a region with substantial development needs and considerable potential. The areas involved are home to more than half of Kenya’s livestock, which can be harnessed to create bigger and better agro-business industries. The region’s diverse and rich culture and heritage, evidenced by local historical and geographical sites, can be an asset in developing eco-tourism. There is also a latent resource for clean and renewable energy exploitation, as proven by the recent launch of the Lake Turkana Wind Power Project, which is expected to generate 310MW. The recent discovery of major groundwater aquifers and massive oil deposits in Turkana provides further reason for optimism.Cross-border trade could have a positive ripple effect. It is poised to generate tremendous revenue for both countries, reduce risks of conflict, facilitate prevention of violent extremism efforts (particularly if tied to approaches that aim to strengthen social cohesion and societal resilience as well as paying attention to the social/cultural/political dimensions that drive radicalization and extremism), and improve livelihoods, especially among the marginalized and poor communities to expedite the achievement of a core goal of the SDGs - ending poverty by 2030.The UN Assistant Secretary General and UNDP Regional Director for Africa Mr. Abdoulaye Mar Dieye has said, “The Ethiopia Kenya Cross Border Programme has a high peace and development return. If we invest in the region we can boost development and reduce insecurity. This cross border Programme is a regional public good. It resonates far beyond Kenya and Ethiopia and can serve the entire continent"".The Kenya Ethiopia cross-border programme may well hold the key to an innovative approach to operationalizing Mr António Guterres, the UN Secretary General’s prevention agenda by addressing marginalization, radicalization and prevent violent extremism using human development and economic growth to spur peace and stability.Norway’s Ambassador to Kenya, Victor Ronneberg says. “this programme is a testimony of the UN's convening role, to spur dialogue & engagement & reiterates the primacy of multilateralism even more in this day and age.""The momentum has to be maintained and should not falter due to absence of resources. It is therefore critical for the international community to strongly support this initiative.Siddharth Chatterjee is the United Nations Resident Coordinator to Kenya. Follow him on twitter."

Upon opening of the One-Stop-Boarder-Post (OSBP), peoples, goods and other resources on both sides of the border will be able travel and trade freely and create a vibrant economic corridor; with jobs for thousands of youths on both sides. Beyond the economic gains, the highway will also contribute to political and security stability of the region. The World Bank has also embarked on a huge infrastructure development programme to link Isiolo with Mandera. The EU is already proposing that the Ethiopia-Kenya cross-border programme be scaled up to include the Mandera Triangle, the Omo and Karamoja clusters. These are all welcome developments for a region with substantial development needs and considerable potential. The areas involved are home to more than half of Kenya’s livestock, which can be harnessed to create bigger and better agro-business industries. The region’s diverse and rich culture and heritage, evidenced by local historical and geographical sites, can be an asset in developing eco-tourism. There is also a latent resource for clean and renewable energy exploitation, as proven by the recent launch of the Lake Turkana Wind Power Project, which is expected to generate 310MW. The recent discovery of major groundwater aquifers and massive oil deposits in Turkana provides further reason for optimism.Cross-border trade could have a positive ripple effect. It is poised to generate tremendous revenue for both countries, reduce risks of conflict, facilitate prevention of violent extremism efforts (particularly if tied to approaches that aim to strengthen social cohesion and societal resilience as well as paying attention to the social/cultural/political dimensions that drive radicalization and extremism), and improve livelihoods, especially among the marginalized and poor communities to expedite the achievement of a core goal of the SDGs - ending poverty by 2030.The UN Assistant Secretary General and UNDP Regional Director for Africa Mr. Abdoulaye Mar Dieye has said, “The Ethiopia Kenya Cross Border Programme has a high peace and development return. If we invest in the region we can boost development and reduce insecurity. This cross border Programme is a regional public good. It resonates far beyond Kenya and Ethiopia and can serve the entire continent"".The Kenya Ethiopia cross-border programme may well hold the key to an innovative approach to operationalizing Mr António Guterres, the UN Secretary General’s prevention agenda by addressing marginalization, radicalization and prevent violent extremism using human development and economic growth to spur peace and stability.Norway’s Ambassador to Kenya, Victor Ronneberg says. “this programme is a testimony of the UN's convening role, to spur dialogue & engagement & reiterates the primacy of multilateralism even more in this day and age.""The momentum has to be maintained and should not falter due to absence of resources. It is therefore critical for the international community to strongly support this initiative.Siddharth Chatterjee is the United Nations Resident Coordinator to Kenya. Follow him on twitter."

The debris still needs to be analyzed, but the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), seemed confident that the objects were fuel. A spokesperson said Friday there was a “high possibility that the solidified objects are mixtures of melted metal and fuel,” according to the BBC. If true, the discovery could mark a watershed moment for the complex and costly cleanup of the Fukushima plant — an effort that could cost more than $70 billion and up to 40 years to complete, the Japan Times reported.Finding, analyzing and removing the melted fuel in Fukushima’s damaged reactors is one of the most critical steps in the cleanup and decommissioning of the plant, the AP noted. The melted fuel has rendered the reactors so radioactive that a human being could be killed within minutes of nearing one. The search for the molten fuel had long been stymied, however, as extensive damage and staggering levels of radiation have proven insurmountable even for some of the robots invented to probe Fukushima ― some of which have “died” while attempting to approach the facility’s reactors. TEPCO’s Naohiro Masuda, the head of the Fukushima decommissioning effort, said that radiation had destroyed the wiring on many robots, leaving them incapacitated. “It is extremely difficult to access the inside of the nuclear plant. The biggest obstacle is the radiation,” Masuda told Reuters last year. Little Sunfish, created by the Japanese company Toshiba and a team of nuclear researchers, was not just able to survive the reactor but emerged with the potentially critical images. The robot’s expedition “might be evidence that the robots used by TEPCO can now deal with the higher radiation levels, at least for periods of time that allow them to search parts of the reactor that are more likely to contain fuel debris,” M.V. Ramana, a physicist and Fukushima expert, told Japan Times. “If some of these fragments can be brought out of the reactor and studied, it would allow nuclear engineers and scientists to better model what happened during the accident.” The Fukushima disaster, triggered by a massive earthquake and tsunami in March of 2011, was one of the worst nuclear accidents in history.Since the disaster, some sections of the facility were restored and thousands of employees now work on the site, conducting cleanup work, according to a Los Angeles Times report last year. In 2014, one of these employees was diagnosed with cancer ― a diagnosis that officials recognized as being linked to his work at Fukushima. TEPCO said this week it is working on a plan to remove the melted fuel from the facility’s reactors. The company hopes to begin the removal process in 2021."

Fire crews have successfully slowed the 76,000-acre fire’s growth after it grew at an unprecedented speed last week, at one point doubling in just one day. Cal Fire lifted evacuation orders for several areas on Sunday, though residents in those communities are advised to remain cautious. It may be another two weeks until the fire is completely contained. It’s one of dozens of fires that have overwhelmed California and several other western states in recent weeks, including Montana, where an enormous blaze has burned about 200,000 acres and remains entirely uncontained. While an end to the fire is finally in sight, it’s done significant damage. Since igniting last Sunday, the Detwiler fire has destroyed 63 residences, 67 minor structures and one commercial structure. 1,500 structures remained threatened. Ongoing hot, dry weather conditions are helping create an uphill battle for firefighters.“Weather is expected to remain above 100 degrees with low humidity,” Cal Fire said in its Sunday update. “We ask the public to exercise caution and remember that, ‘One Less Spark-One Less Wildfire.’”The cause of the blaze remains unknown, but years of drought have parched California and turned forests into tinder-dry wildfire fuel. Additionally, a record-wet winter spurred excessive brush growth, which has since dried out during this summer’s record-high temperatures, creating even more wildfire risk. "

His series of tweets, which covered a number of topics, also included a call on Republican senators to vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, declaring it dead.Watch Trump’s full speech below."

Paul Stamets, made the announcement Saturday at the San Diego Comic-Con during a panel discussion on the show, and dropped another bombshell.Rapp’s onscreen love, he said, will be played by Wilson Cruz, who is best known for his iconic turn as Enrique “Rickie” Vasquez on the short-lived mid-1990s TV classic, “My So-Called Life.”“Wilson Cruz will be playing my love interest, my partner ― my man love ― and we’re both officers on the ship,” he said during the panel. Although the Sulu character in the 2016 movie “Star Trek Beyond” is gay, Rapp’s character is the first openly gay main character on a “Star Trek” TV series.He said: “And I’m very proud of that. And he’s a scientist!” Rapp and Cruz have a shared past. Rapp was in the Broadway production of “Rent” when it debuted in 1996, Cruz joined the cast in 1998.Rapp promises the romance is going to be the source of good storytelling. “I promise you we passionately believe in what we’re doing and we’ll honor what’s come before,” Rapp told his listeners.Series lead Sonequa Martin-Green, who plays First Officer Michael Burnham, told the crowd that “Star Trek Discovery” will stay true to the original intent of series creator Gene Roddenberry.″‘Star Trek’ has always been a pictorial of diversity and of universality and of unity,” she said. “If you say you love the legacy of ′Star Trek’ but you don’t love that, then you’ve missed it. I encourage you to join with us.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Wilson Cruz was in the original cast for the Broadway production of “Rent” in 1996.

He faces charges of second-degree murder and child abuse resulting in the death of Dylan Redwine, the La Plata County sheriff’s office in Colorado announced.A grand jury indicted Redwine, a truck driver, on the charges after it reviewed evidence presented by a district attorney on Saturday. He was arrested as he drove a truck route through Washington, according toDenver’s CBS4 News.He has denied any involvement in his son’s death and joined Dylan’s mother on the “Dr. Phil” show in February of 2013, where they publicly quarreled over the teen’s disappearance. The boy’s remains had not yet been discovered then.Dylan’s mother, Elaine Hall, called her ex-husband’s arrest “bittersweet” in an interview with CBS4 News.“It’s like, it’s about time but at the same time we know how difficult of a case like this is to prosecute and to come up with all the evidence and make sure that it sticks,” she said.Dylan was last seen alive on Nov. 18, 2012, during a contentious visit for Thanksgiving to his father’s home in Vallecito, a community near Durango in southwestern Colorado.The teen, who lived with his mother on the other side of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado Springs amid a custody battle, had said he did not want to visit father, according to the murder indictment. He discussed staying at a nearby friend’s home instead, and then made plans to visit friends the day after his arrival, according to the indictment.“That was the last contact received from Dylan Redwine,” the sheriff’s department said in a release.Mark Redwine told authorities that he left his son at home to run errands around 7:30 a.m. the morning after the teen’s arrival. When he returned about four hours later, he said his son was gone.It wasn’t until June of 2013 that portions of the boy’s remains were found in woods about eight miles from Mark Redwine’s home. The teen’s skull, which forensics anthropologists said had injuries consistent to blunt force trauma, was found about 1.5 miles from the first recovery site, authorities said.An investigation at Redwine’s home allegedly found the teen’s blood in multiple locations in his father’s living room. A human remains detection dog, which searched the home in August of 2013, also detected the presence of a cadaver scent in various parts of the home, including the living room, washing machine and the clothing that Mark Redwine said he had worn on the night of his son’s arrival. A similar search in February of 2014 detected the same scent in Mark Redwine’s truck, according to charging documents.Mark Redwine, who had joined in the search for his son, had been named a person of interested in the case two years ago."

Truth is, you don’t have to throw a",2017-07-23,<p>You don’t have to throw a chair through a window or quit in the middle of a presentation to cause irreparable damage to your career. Dr. Travis Bradberry explains.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59726f6f1a00001500dc001d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We’ve all heard of (or seen firsthand) people doing some pretty crazy things at work.Truth is, you don’t have to throw a chair through a window or quit in the middle of a presentation to cause irreparable damage to your career.No matter how talented you are or what you’ve accomplished, there are certain behaviors that instantly change the way people see you and forever cast you in a negative light.The following list contains nine of the most notorious behaviors that you should avoid at all costs.1. BackstabbingThe name says it all. Stabbing your colleagues in the back, intentionally or otherwise, is a huge source of strife in the workplace. One of the most frequent forms of backstabbing is going over someone’s head to solve a problem. People typically do this in an attempt to avoid conflict, but they end up creating even more conflict as soon as the victim feels the blade. Anytime you make someone look bad in the eyes of their colleagues, it feels like a stab in the back, regardless of your intentions.2. Gossiping People make themselves look terrible when they get carried away with gossiping about other people. Wallowing in talk of other people’s misdeeds or misfortunes may end up hurting their feelings if the gossip finds its way to them, but gossiping will make you look negative and spiteful every time, guaranteed.3. Taking Credit for Someone Else’s WorkWe’ve all experienced that stomach-dropping feeling that happens when you discover that someone has stolen your idea. Taking credit for someone else’s work­—no matter how small—creates the impression that you haven’t accomplished anything significant on your own. Stealing credit also shows that you have zero regard for your team and your working relationships.4. Having an Emotional HijackingMy company provides 360° feedback and executive coaching, and we come across far too many instances of people throwing things, screaming, making people cry, and other telltale signs of an emotional hijacking.An emotional hijacking demonstrates low emotional intelligence, and it’s an easy way to get fired. As soon as you show that level of instability, people will question whether or not you’re trustworthy and capable of keeping it together when it counts.Exploding at anyone, regardless of how much they might “deserve it,” turns a huge amount of negative attention your way. You’ll be labeled as unstable, unapproachable, and intimidating. Controlling your emotions keeps you in the driver’s seat. When you are able to control your emotions around someone who wrongs you, they end up looking bad instead of you.5. Announcing That You Hate Your JobThe last thing anyone wants to hear at work is someone complaining about how much they hate their job. Doing so labels you as a negative person and brings down the morale of the group. Bosses are quick to catch on to naysayers who drag down morale, and they know that there are always enthusiastic replacements waiting just around the corner.6. BraggingWhen someone hits a home run and starts gloating as they run the bases, it’s safe to assume that they haven’t hit very many home runs. On the other hand, if they hit a home run and simply run the bases, it conveys a business-as-usual mentality, which is far more intimidating to the other team.Accomplishing great things without bragging about them demonstrates the same strong mentality—it shows people that succeeding isn’t unusual to you.7. Telling LiesSo many lies begin with good intentions—people want to protect themselves or someone else—but lies have a tendency to grow and spread until they’re discovered, and once everyone knows that you’ve lied, there’s no taking it back.Getting caught up in a lie, no matter how small, is exhausting and hard on your self-esteem. You have to be authentic if you want to be happy with who you are.8. Eating Smelly FoodUnless you happen to work on a ship, your colleagues are going to mind if you make the entire place smell like day-old fish. The general rule of thumb when it comes to food at work is, anything with an odor that might waft beyond the kitchen door should be left at home.It might seem like a minor thing, but smelly food is inconsiderate and distracting—and so easily avoidable. When something that creates discomfort for other people is so easily avoided, it tends to build resentment quickly. Your pungent lunch tells everyone that you just don’t care about them, even when you do.9. Burning BridgesSo much of work revolves around the people you meet and the connections you make. Dropping an atomic bomb on any professional relationship is a major mistake.One of TalentSmart’s clients is a large chain of coffee shops. They have a relatively high turnover, so when a barista quits, it isn’t usually taken personally. One barista, however, managed to burn every single bridge she had in a single day. The surprising thing is that she didn’t yell or do anything extreme; all she did was leave.Without warning, she showed up to her Monday shift, told the store manager she was quitting (she had found a better-paying job somewhere else), and walked out. The result, of course, was that every shift that she was scheduled to work for the next two weeks had to be done with one less person, as she provided no time to find a replacement.She most likely saw her actions as being offensive only to the manager (whom she didn’t like), but in reality, she created two miserable weeks for everyone who worked at the shop. She ruined her otherwise positive connections, with every single one of her colleagues.Bringing It All TogetherThese behaviors sound extreme and highly inconsiderate, but they have a tendency to sneak up on you. Emotional intelligence certification is a great way to help people in your organization to avoid these behaviors.What other behaviors should I add to this list? Please share your thoughts in the comments section as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more from me? Check out my book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0."

Polish President Andrzej Duda, who has veto power, must now sign the bill for it to become law.After the bill was unveiled last week, thousands of people protested across Poland’s major cities in multi-day demonstrations to oppose the measures. On Saturday, protesters reportedly filled the streets chanting “traitors!” and “disgrace!”Once the bill is signed, the ruling Law and Justice Party, or PiS, will have the ability to force the resignation of all of Poland’s top judges and appoint its own members to the Supreme Court.Opponents of the move argue that it will demolish judicial independence and separation of powers in the country, marking a major shift for a ruling government that has already been accused of pursuing an illiberal agenda.In the lead up to the vote, European Union officials repeatedly warned Poland that the proposed reforms to the judiciary represented a threat to the rule of law and threatened repercussions if they proceeded.After the bill passed the lower house of Polish parliament, European Commission’s First Vice-President Frans Timmermans issued a strong statement urging the government to reconsider and saying that its recent actions “defy European values and standards.”“Subjugating the courts to the governing party in the way proposed by Law and Justice (PiS) will ruin the already tarnished view of Polish democracy,” Timmermans said in the statement.Timmerans earlier this week floated the possibility that the EU would use Article 7 for the first time in the bloc’s history if Poland did not avert its course.

At one point, PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski took issue with a statement from an opposition politician that claimed Kaczynski’s brother ― former President Lech Kaczynski, who died in a plane crash 7 years ago ― would never have approved of the legislation. Kaczynski angrily shouted at the chamber, calling his opponents “scumbags” and telling them to not “wipe your treacherous mugs with my late brother’s name.”But despite the political opposition and public pressure, the PiS was able to push the bill through with its parliamentary majority.The changes to the judiciary, if approved by the president, are set to consolidate even more power in the hands of PiS, which took office with a slight parliamentary majority in late 2015.Since then, the party has made changes to the Constitutional Tribunal ― a body that can rule laws unconstitutional ― and curbed the independence of public broadcasters and civil society groups. Poland has also clashed with the EU over the country’s refusal to take part in a refugee resettlement plan that would more equitably divide asylum-seekers among member states. As a result of Poland’s refusal, the EU is currently seeking legal action against the state.That rift is part of a greater divide within the bloc as governments including Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary come into conflict with Brussels as they embrace increasingly nationalist policies. Although the EU has attempted to put pressure on these countries to adhere to their treaty obligations, the mechanisms at its disposal are often convoluted or ineffective. It is unlikely that the EU would be able to remove Poland’s voting rights over its judicial reforms, for instance, because Hungary would be able to veto such a motion and has indicated its willingness to do so.

It ends on Aug. 15.Zany, who quit her corporate job to paint thought-provoking and politically charged street art full-time in 2016, told HuffPost the inspiration for the project came after she produced this piece of acclaimed aviator Amelia Earthart, who was the first woman to fly a plane solo across the Atlantic Ocean:“The more I thought about it, the idea to start celebrating the people of today who are doing things outside of gender norms seemed like a natural progression,” she said.After drawing up a long list of potential candidates that she could paint, Zany whittled it down to just 10. “The people I chose are pushing the extremes of doing things outside of gender norms,” she added.Check out each of Zany’s proposed murals below, and visit her Kickstarter page here."

It’s not just that Trump has pulled us out of the Paris Agreement—a bigger blow to the climate fell this month in an apparently unrelated way. The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that pharmaceutical companies producing vaccines may be sued by people who feel their health has been adversely effected by them, without the burden of having to provide clinical or epidemiological proof. It’s now up to these companies and their scientists to prove in court that their vaccines not only safely reduce global disease and mortality, but that they are not liable for adverse reactions to their product even in statistically inconsequential numbers of people. In other words, anyone with no more than personal anecdotal information can expect to be taken seriously in challenging centuries of established science in a court of law. [i] This is highly significant because it empowers the whole science-denier movement—which unfortunately is not confined to the U.S.—and this law will soon be applied to other fields of science, of which climate change denial is the most important. If we allow deniers to hinder the progress and inspiration of science with random opinion or circumstantial evidence, then climate disruption will never be solved. We are going to need science. Not the corporate-controlled kind in which money corrupts fossil-fuel and climate-change research in the same ways it once did for the tobacco and sugar industries. Not just engineers—although the contributions of the latter will be vital. We need Big Science. We need bold, visionary ideas to solve our climate issues. And, knowing what we know about climate denial, we also need carefully crafted messaging to make certain that negative fallout, such as the disinformation surrounding 2004’s “Climategate” controversy, never again distracts us from efforts to establish an agreed-upon set of universal scientific standards and measurements. Right now, the predictions for the earth’s survival as we know it are dire. Only last week a Delaware-sized section of Antarctica’s Larsen C ice shelf broke off. 2016 was the hottest year on record, and before that, 2015 and 2014 were the second and third hottest respectively.[ii] Over the previous twenty years, there are some variations due to El Nino, but the numbers are persistently rising. Yet people are misguided and torn about the climate, usually along ideological rather than fact-based lines. My Trump-voter friends harrumph about it all being a hoax, even though they often have the most grandchildren to lose. My other friends and I look at each other and, wide eyed, acknowledge we are the problem—we humans. We face not only our personal demise—which may be relatively comfortable—but drastic repercussions for our progeny. Under what circumstances can we imagine them surviving? Can we even wish them to?We voice our fears: The American Constitution will be a quaint memory. Our grandchildren won’t need a safe abortion if they are starving to death. Disasters in the Everglades, Germany’s Black Forest, or Beijing, will be dismissed as mere environmental depredation, while the powers that remain will struggle to keep their survivors alive. Conflicts and wars will break out over water and food that will take battles for hegemony to unimagined heights. Drugs, warlords, oh my!These are unknowable possibilities but hysteria is not a solution. As we look around, we see the creep of a new reality in which polar bears drown just north of whole islands located in the Tropics. But we also see people moving to the more temperate bands of the globe that will be safer for a while and could remain so over the long term if we act now. Many climatologists whose work has provided the most alarming forecasts remain optimistic, believing that we will come up with a solution because we must.[iii] Climate deniers, supposedly driven by consideration for the world’s economies, are focused on and funded by outmoded industries. Fossil fuels need to be phased out in conjunction with a parallel effort to replace them with practical forms of renewable clean energy. In this country, the Koch brothers and companies like Exxon Mobil have gone against their own scientists’ recommendations of forty years ago[iv] in order to consolidate their current market share. Instead of seeing themselves as “energy companies,” they have clung to being “oil companies.” Their PR efforts have been much too successful in making wind power seem ludicrous or damaging, minimizing our understanding of the potential of solar energy, or taking a NIMBY attitude towards oceanic hydropower.Too bad: they could have provided brilliant and powerful leadership, but instead they’ve deferred to their own historic version of magical thinking—that they will always be what they always were. They won’t, and we can’t afford to indulge them.How to avoid the actuality of doom and gloom? There’s more to the answer than just suggesting that we should prepare for the worst without too much Pollyanna-ism about the best. Research on the Y2K scare (don’t laugh—I know you had a cabinet full of canned ham) has some relevant insight to offer simply because we can’t predict everything we might need to know or do. No one was sure what Y2K was going to be, but many assumed it would come in the form of a computer glitch or bug that was going to “take down civilization as we know it”—at least for a while. In fact, although there were some incidents, few lasting effects were felt by the general population. What was drastic and did happen were the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on September 11, 2001, less than two years after the turn of the century. The preparations for Y2K had prompted government and corporate entities to take serious precautions “despite a lack of full scientific certainty about the extent of danger.”[v] Dramatic as the effects of 9/11 were on American life, they could have been far worse on the economy. Part of our concern about climate stems from the equation that scientific fact is the best basis we have for prediction, but it’s the space between current and future knowledge that allows science-deniers their day. What Y2K researchers offer us are some assurances that precautions as well as direct actions are worth taking. National and local governments must act. Safeguards will not fend off everything but they will make life more manageable for most of the Earth’s population. Better than a reaction to each individual disaster, they would put strategies in place that might be quickly implemented to fend off the consequences of the unexpected.This blog was previously published on the www.SanityPapers.com on July 22, 2017[i] There’s a fascinating discussion in an interview that I did last year with Dr. Bethany Hays about the link between autism and vaccination—she’s a scientific anti-vaxxer with a lot of solid research to count on. She does not discredit science--she relies on its progress, and that’s the difference.

In fact, I’d go as far as to say that for a long period of time, I probably struggled with body dysmorphic disorder. The way I saw myself was not even close to the way others saw me. I saw my flaws, and when I saw them, I exaggerated them and honed in on them.It has only been in the past few months, through rigorous exercise and self-awareness, that I have made peace with my body. I still have work to do, but for the most part I now see my body for what it is: something strong and capable and yes, still imperfect. But that’s OK. For the first time I can remember, I have absolutely no qualms about wearing shorts. Or tank tops. Or even bikinis.But I recently had an experience that made me feel shamed for being comfortable with my body. I took part in a competitive event on the water, on an 80-degree day, and wore a bikini. I made sure this was OK ahead of time. I was told it was. At the finish line of the event, all the participants were told they’d have their photos taken.Though I started the event with a swimsuit coverup on, it eventually became soaking wet and I took it off, leaving me in, yes, my bikini. It was hot and humid anyway, so being in a swimsuit made sense. When I crossed the finish line, I smiled for the photo and didn’t even give my attire a second thought.A few days after the event, I received an email from the organizer including my photo from the finish line, stating that bikini photos would not be posted on the event’s Facebook page along with all the other event photos. I was immediately puzzled by this statement, but decided to let it go and not comment.But over the next few days, it continued to weigh on me. I felt I was being shamed for wearing a bikini, shamed for being a woman comfortable in my own skin. The photos of nearly everyone else in the event were posted, including women who were wearing a bikini top and shorts or men who were shirtless and had swim trunks on. Why that attire was different than a bikini, I’m still not sure.By not posting the photo of me at the finish line, it was if I was being told there was something wrong with the way I looked or the way I carried myself. I felt as if from that point forward, I was being told that I should think twice before deciding to wear a bikini in public. I felt like I was being judged for being OK with my body, something that has literally taken me my entire life to achieve. I realize this may not have been the conscious intention of choosing not to post bikini photos, but that is how it come across to me.In the past, I’d have kept quiet about this situation and let it feed into my negative thoughts about myself, second-guessing whether I should ever wear a bikini again. But I’m different now. I’ve fought hard to get to this point of self-acceptance, and I know other women have, too. So I don’t want to ignore this and sweep it under the rug, making it even more normalized.The unfortunate truth is that as women, society so often tells us we need to look attractive, but not too attractive – because there’s an issue with that, too. There’s this fine line we’re supposed to walk, and I’ll just tell you, it’s a line that’s impossible to balance on. So why even bother?If you are someone who is uncomfortable with your body or sees it differently than others do, I challenge you to consider why this is. Chances are it’s because someone has told you you should be uncomfortable, or that society has made you believe that anything less than perfection means you’re not allowed to be comfortable in your own skin. That’s a lie.And if you are someone who is comfortable with your body, continue to wear what makes you feel comfortable and good, regardless of the experiences that try to tell you otherwise. Don’t let others dictate that for you. Don’t let ignorant people make you feel ashamed for being comfortable in the skin you were born in. At the end of the day, you are the only one who needs to be OK with what you wear and how you look."

In the 18 months he’d served as foreman, the crew made considerable progress, but the terrain they were now forced to conquer was rocky and unforgiving.The early dawn light, softened by the moisture in the air, scarcely lit the winding path to the job site. The distant rhythm of iron sledgehammers thumping in sequence was soothing and forced an early-morning smile from Phineas’ lips. His crew was on the job a full 15 minutes before first whistle.Phineas had earned his reputation as “the most efficient and capable foreman” in the company. The discipline and passion he brought to the site ensured projects were completed on time, and the social niceties he espoused made him a favorite with the men he supervised. A “shrewd, smart business man,” he walked his talk, avoided the alluring depravity of the local saloon, and got along famously with everyone he met.The day wore on with the usual efficiency. Yard by yard Phineas and his crew laid the tracks, blasting through the rugged terrain in the quest to speed travel for busy commuters. By the time he glanced at his watch at 4:30, they had added half a mile to the rail line.With skill Phineas thrust his 43 inch tamping iron into the angled blasting hole and entertained thoughts of the day he retrieved this special rod from the local blacksmith. The brawny craftsman had explained to Phineas with uncharacteristic glee that this iron was unlike any other he had ever seen.Before taking the next swing in his daily exercise of geometry and strength, Phineas signaled his assistant to pour sand in the blasting hole. The layer of sand would protect the powder from exploding prematurely while he packed it with the tamping iron.As Phineas reared back to swing, he was startled by a shrill racket behind him. Peering over his right shoulder, he discovered the crew in the pit had knocked over a large load of boulders they were transferring to a platform car with a crane. Phineas sighed briefly to mourn the setback, then completed his swing with the iron, naïve to the fact that his assistant was also distracted by the noise.The assistant failed to place sand in the hole and the scrape of Phineas’ iron against the rock perimeter of the crevice created a spark big enough to ignite the unprotected powder at the bottom. The raw force of the explosion launched Phineas’ tamping iron like a rocket. It pierced his face below his left eye and continued upward through the top of his head and beyond. The iron finally settled in the weeds 100 feet from the spot where Phineas stood.Phineas’ body flew backward from the impact and he lay silently for a moment, writhing in shock. A thin whisper of air disguised his overwhelming desire to scream─it was all the noise he could force from his lungs. He could feel the wound below his eye where the 13 pound tamping iron—43 inches long and a full inch and a quarter in diameter—had thrust itself through his face. He had no sensation of the massive hole the iron left as it emerged through the top of his head.The world as he knew it changed forever that afternoon.Phineas’ loyal crew rushed to his side and looked into his eyes for any sign of life. They laughed anxiously as Phineas peered up at them and groaned, “I think I’m going to need to see Dr. Harlow.” His sense of humor still intact, Phineas’ men loaded him into an ox cart to take him to town.Sitting upright in the cart with his own strength, Phineas noticed his assistant walking somberly beside him. He leaned over and made a request typical of any foreman leaving the job site, “Hand me the book please.” Like young boys watching their father perform a Herculean feat of strength, the bemused railroad workers stood in awe as Phineas logged his exit from the job site.At 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, September 13, 1848—just one hour after his horrific accident—Phineas Gage stood unassisted on the patio of the town hotel. The local physician, expecting nothing coherent to come from Phineas’ lips, asked his crew for a briefing. “Well, here’s enough work for you Doctor,” Phineas interrupted before anyone could speak, “The iron entered here and came out my head here.”Despite having the front portion of his brain scooped from his skull much like you might a hunk of melon at breakfast, Phineas could think and speak much like he could before the accident. He was treated earnestly in the coming weeks by Dr. Harlow and eventually his physical wounds healed. The accident seemed to leave nothing more than scars and blindness in his left eye.Phineas’ survival and quick recovery baffled everyone. As he tried to return to business as usual on the railroad, they realized something was hauntingly different. His first peculiar new habit was his temper. He cursed like a sailor and gave conflicting orders that followed his mood. Every impulse Phineas had exploded unfettered into action, and he made his men feel like they were an inch tall.The man who never arrived late for work was now apathetic about getting the job done.For the 11 years Phineas lived after the accident, he was transformed. Dr. Harlow’s detailed notes describe a pervasive change in his behavior that could only be explained, literally, by the missing portion of his mind,“The effect of the injury appears to have been the destruction of the equilibrium between his intellectual faculties and the animal propensities. He was now capricious, fitful, irreverent, impatient of restraint, vacillating…His physical recovery was complete, but those who knew him as a shrewd, smart, energetic, persistent business man, recognized the change in mental character. The balance of his mind was gone.” Lessons From PhineasTo put it bluntly, Phineas’ emotional intelligence left his head for good that morning. In removing the front portion of his brain, the tamping iron took with it his ability to turn his emotions into reasoned action. Phineas was left a walking, talking, sentient being, yet one with very little self-control.His intellect remained intact. He could do complicated math problems and understood the logistics of building the railroad. He lived independently, just as he had before the blast. Those he met assumed his rash behavior was just a part of his personality, but previous acquaintances knew differently.Phineas’ grisly accident continues to intrigue us today. His survival was truly a miracle and the changes in his behavior teach us more about the brain than the most sophisticated technology available. Modern devices can map the brain to show which areas are most important for different types of thought, but no gadget can show how a human behaves with a portion of his brain removed.Unlike Phineas, we have a choice in how we respond to our emotions. Each of us takes in information from the world around us through the five senses. Everything we see, smell, hear, taste, and touch travels through the body in the form of electric signals. These signals pass from cell to cell until they reach their ultimate destination, the brain. If a mosquito bites you on the leg, that sensation creates signals that must travel to your brain before you are aware of the pest.Our sensations enter the brain in one place at the back near the spinal chord. Complex, rational thinking happens on the opposite side of the brain, at the front, which is the same part that Phineas lost.When the electric signals enter your brain, they must travel all the way across it before you can have your first logical thought about the event. This is a problem because they pass through the limbic system along the way. This is the area in the brain where emotions are experienced. Signals passing through the limbic system ensure you have an emotional reaction to events first.The front of the brain can’t stop the emotion “felt” in the limbic system. Instead, the two areas communicate constantly. This process of communication is the physical source of emotional intelligence.After his accident, poor Phineas was all emotion. In losing the entire front portion of his brain, he lost his ability to reason and react to his emotions. Indeed, everything he encountered, every experience he had, resulted in a rash emotional response. Phineas had zero ability to manage his feelings or even understand their presence. Every hour of every day Phineas was overcome by his emotions.Our brains are wired to make us emotional creatures. By experiencing the emotional response to an event first, our feelings are strong motivators of behavior. The location of the limbic system ensures that emotions play a critical role in every action we take.The Critical LinkIt should be no surprise, then, that emotional intelligence is critical to success in the workplace. TalentSmart tested emotional intelligence alongside 33 other important workplace skills, and found that emotional intelligence is the strongest predictor of performance, explaining a full 58 percent of success in all types of jobs.Of all the people we’ve studied at work, we’ve found that 90 percent of top performers are also high in emotional intelligence.Naturally, people with a high degree of emotional intelligence make more money—an average of $29,000 more per year than people with low emotional intelligence. The link between emotional intelligence and earnings is so direct that every point increase in emotional intelligence adds $1,300 to an annual salary.These findings hold true for people in all industries, at all levels, in every region of the world. We haven’t yet been able to find a job in which performance and pay aren’t tied closely to emotional intelligence.Bringing It All TogetherAfter the accident Phineas lost his job at the railroad. Intelligence alone was not enough for him to succeed. In the years that followed he had difficulty holding down a job anywhere else. With the rational part of his brain gone forever, poor Phineas didn’t stand a chance.Remember the plight of poor Phineas and don’t take your rational brain for granted.And please share your thoughts in the comments section as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more from me?

70,HEALTHY LIVING,An Iron Rod Through The Head Shows Us What's Important In Life,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-iron-rod-through-the-head-shows-us-whats-important_us_596fcbc5e4b04dcf308d29e3,We have a say in how we respond to our emotions.,2017-07-22,Trajectory of the 43 inch tamping iron that traveled through the head of railroad foreman Phineas Gage on September 13th 1848. The iron’s violent path removed the entire front portion of his brain. His skull and the original iron that went through it are still on public display in the Warren Museum at the Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596fcc3c15000025008b2a70.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was frigid and damp at dawn the last day Phineas Gage arrived to work on time.As he shoved his hands in the pockets of his jacket and cut through the cold, he contemplated the challenges that lie ahead building the Burlington railroad through Vermont. In the 18 months he’d served as foreman, the crew made considerable progress, but the terrain they were now forced to conquer was rocky and unforgiving.The early dawn light, softened by the moisture in the air, scarcely lit the winding path to the job site. The distant rhythm of iron sledgehammers thumping in sequence was soothing and forced an early-morning smile from Phineas’ lips. His crew was on the job a full 15 minutes before first whistle.Phineas had earned his reputation as “the most efficient and capable foreman” in the company. The discipline and passion he brought to the site ensured projects were completed on time, and the social niceties he espoused made him a favorite with the men he supervised. A “shrewd, smart business man,” he walked his talk, avoided the alluring depravity of the local saloon, and got along famously with everyone he met.The day wore on with the usual efficiency. Yard by yard Phineas and his crew laid the tracks, blasting through the rugged terrain in the quest to speed travel for busy commuters. By the time he glanced at his watch at 4:30, they had added half a mile to the rail line.With skill Phineas thrust his 43 inch tamping iron into the angled blasting hole and entertained thoughts of the day he retrieved this special rod from the local blacksmith. The brawny craftsman had explained to Phineas with uncharacteristic glee that this iron was unlike any other he had ever seen.Before taking the next swing in his daily exercise of geometry and strength, Phineas signaled his assistant to pour sand in the blasting hole. The layer of sand would protect the powder from exploding prematurely while he packed it with the tamping iron.As Phineas reared back to swing, he was startled by a shrill racket behind him. Peering over his right shoulder, he discovered the crew in the pit had knocked over a large load of boulders they were transferring to a platform car with a crane. Phineas sighed briefly to mourn the setback, then completed his swing with the iron, naïve to the fact that his assistant was also distracted by the noise.The assistant failed to place sand in the hole and the scrape of Phineas’ iron against the rock perimeter of the crevice created a spark big enough to ignite the unprotected powder at the bottom.

71,QUEER VOICES,Kim Davis's Anti-Gay Views Are Going To Cost Her State Big Time,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-davis-kentucky-ruling_us_59725b64e4b09e5f6ccf43f0,A judge ruled Kentucky liable for legal fees in Davis's case.,2017-07-22,"Kentucky will be liable for more than $220,000 in Kim Davis's anti-LGBTQ case. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5972acc415000021008b30cc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two years after Kim Davis first made national headlines, her anti-marriage equality case is closed, at least for now ― but it will come at a cost to local taxpayers. Davis, who is the county clerk for Kentucky’s Rowan County, steadfastly refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling on marriage equality, citing her religious beliefs. Though Davis was briefly jailed for contempt of court, she went on to become the darling of right-wing conservatives, including former Republican presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee. On Friday, a federal judge awarded $222,695 in legal fees to the attorneys of four couples ― two same-sex, two opposite-sex ― who were denied marriage licenses by Davis. (The clerk briefly refused to issue licenses to all couples in 2015 as her legal troubles began to mount.) However, U.S. District Judge David Bunning ordered the state, as opposed to Davis herself, to pay the fees. His reasoning was simple. “Davis represented the Commonwealth of Kentucky when she refused to issue marriage licenses to legally eligible couples,” he said, according to The New York Times. “The buck stops there.”He then added, “The plaintiffs prevailed by every measure of victory. Plaintiffs obtained marriage licenses that could not be revoked. And two of the plaintiff-couples married on those licenses. That is enduring relief. There is nothing more the court could do.”The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Kentucky praised the ruling as a victory for the LGBTQ community, and noted that Davis’s case should serve as an example to other public officials who violate citizens’ rights. Nonetheless, ACLU Legal Director William Sharp said in a statement, “It is unfortunate that Kentucky taxpayers will likely bear the financial burden of the unlawful actions and litigation strategies of an elected official.” The Liberty Counsel’s Mat Staver, who represented Davis, said in a statement that his organization was pleased that neither his client nor Rowan County were deemed liable, but nonetheless vowed to appeal the ruling.

72,POLITICS,An Undocumented Teen Gains Asylum With The Help Of His Undocumented Lawyer,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cesar-vargas-undocumented-lawyer-client_us_59727244e4b09e5f6ccf6cf6,The real American dream at work.,2017-07-22,"Attorney Cesar Vargas, right, the first openly undocumented attorney in New York, with his client Ivan Ruiz in Manhattan.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597273e62100003700fc823a.jpeg?cache=mtu4Vfgi8d&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― When attorney Cesar Vargas first met his teenage client Ivan Ruiz, a newly arrived undocumented immigrant from Honduras, he noticed Ruiz seemed to wear the weight of his traumatic childhood on his sleeve. Ruiz, 15 at the time, rarely spoke, returning questions about his life in Honduras with long stares and heavy nods. It was only over the course of a year that Vargas would learn the extent of abuse Ruiz suffered while living with extended family members after his parents immigrated to the United States for a better life. Ruiz was barely fed, forced to work long hours and beaten ― even whipped with tire rubber ― as punishment. The abuse became too much to bear. After trekking through Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, Ruiz crossed the border into the United States in spring 2016. His journey wasn’t over, though, and a year ago he was ordered to appear in immigration court.With Vargas’ help, Ruiz recently won a life-changing victory: He was granted asylum. He now spends his days in summer school, soaking up new English words and the novelty of life with only low-stakes, teenage worries. He recently took two girls to the prom and is delicately balancing the affections of another. He is looking forward to the day when he can join a Manhattan-based soccer league, but the $180 joining fee is currently too steep.His case is remarkable for two reasons. At 16, Ruiz is representative of a class of highly vulnerable undocumented minors living under a presidential administration that is pushing people like him out. Even more remarkable is the person who helped get Ruiz to this point ― his lawyer, who also happens to be New York state’s first openly undocumented attorney. It’s the type of legal win that motivated Vargas to work in immigration law. It’s also one that is bittersweet. It means that Vargas’ immigration status, as a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, could now be in more danger than that of his client. DACA, as it is known, is an Obama-era initiative that protects immigrants who came to the country as children from deportation, but its fate under President Trump remains ambiguous. “As an attorney it’s just incredible to make sure that I can successfully win a case on behalf of my client based on the circumstances,” said Vargas, 33. “The other emotion is a mixed emotion. My client is probably going to have a much more permanent immigration status than his attorney.”Ruiz’s story of getting to America was a familiar one for Vargas, who crossed the border from Mexico as a 5-year-old. Vargas was admitted to the bar association in February 2016, after passing the bar exam in 2011. He fought a years-long battle to receive this recognition as a person without legal status. Vargas’ advocacy may have made all the difference for Ruiz, especially in the current political climate. Vargas connected with the teen as a pro bono volunteer with Safe Passage Project, a nonprofit that provides free legal representation and assistance to unaccompanied minors.Undocumented people are significantly less likely to face deportation when they receive legal representation in immigration court. While immigrants are under nearly constant attack from President Donald Trump and government officers are increasingly hostile to their plight, happy endings like Ruiz’s are rare. Safe Passage attorneys are working with about 700 children in the New York City area. It’s only a small slice of the children who need legal help, said Gui Stampur, deputy executive director and co-founder of the group.In Vargas, Ruiz was able to find an advocate and a friend, too. This month, on a sunny day at Safe Passage’s downtown office, Ruiz eagerly told Vargas about his adventures in teenage romance. He squirmed with youthful energy while explaining that he likes “everything” about his new life ― from his summer school classes to his new wardrobe. Back in Honduras, his cousins used to wear his shirts and underwear, he said. It wasn’t unusual for him to go without undergarments. With Vargas translating, Ruiz said he loves living in New York, readily grinning when he correctly guessed a word in English and bragging about having received a new work authorization card. His mood shifted when he briefly touched on the intense physical and emotional abuse he endured in his home country. Ruiz is a member of the Garifuna ethnic group, an Afro-indigenous people who are often subjected to intense discrimination, including from the police. This lack of protection allowed Ruiz’s abuse to go unchecked. Vargas learns more details about this abuse nearly every time they talk. On the day of Ruiz’s last hearing in June, Vargas watched as his sweet, buoyant teenager client broke down when he was asked to go into details about the violence. “That day, to see him completely shut down and relive those moments was very difficult,” said Vargas. It made his client’s victory more sweet.“It’s not just like a [legal] settlement, like here’s a million dollars. It’s like, here’s your life,” said Vargas.It’s been a busy year for Vargas since he gained admission to the bar. He traveled around the country as Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign adviser on immigration policy and Latino issues. He started working to represent undocumented service people and their spouses. Now he’s also working to organize residents in Staten Island to push for immigration reform.Ruiz describes Vargas and his work as inspiring. “He does beautiful work. He’s always there for me, every day,” said Ruiz. "

He is often depicted as a clown.After Scaramucci, a former hedge fund executive, made his White House debut, the dictionary reported that lookups for the word “scaramouch,” which bears an uncanny resemblance to his name, spiked more than 8,000 percent on Friday.Coincidence? Yes. Hilarious? Also yes.Scaramouch, sometimes spelled scaramouche, comes from the Italian word “scaramuccia” which means “skirmish” or “minor fight,” according to Merriam-Webster. Scaramouch was portrayed in the improvised Italian comedy as a “unscrupulous servant” who would often get beaten with a wooden sword by a harlequin. Scaramouch was also made famous by one of Queen’s most catchy songs “Bohemian Rhapsody”: “Scaramouche! Scaramouche! Will you do the fandango?” Though Scaramucci was smooth-talking and confident during the press briefing on Friday, people couldn’t help but point out his namesake’s character flaws.Some people even attached the definition of scaramouch to President Donald Trump and the outgoing White House press secretary Sean Spicer. Only time will tell if Scaramucci can live up to the word his name resembles. And if Friday’s goodbye kiss is any indication, it certainly looks like he will."
75,WEIRD NEWS,The Internet Is In Love With This Enormous 'Stray' Cat Named Mr. Handsome,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fat-cat-chatham-county-mr-handsome_us_59736382e4b0e79ec199986e,"At 31.4 pounds, he'll need to go on a diet when he's adopted.",2017-07-22,"Mr. Handsome is adorable, but he'll need to go on a veterinarian-managed weight loss plan for his health.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597366ea15000021008b3151.jpeg?cache=Hem7ROpqg9&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A sweet and very fat cat is winning over so many hearts online that an animal shelter expects they’ll need to amend their adoption process in response to a deluge of applications.Chatham County Animal Shelter in Pittsboro, North Carolina, posted about the cat, a male who weighs 31.4 pounds, on July 17 after he was brought in as a stray. The post quickly went viral, racking up more than 1,500 likes and 13,000 shares on Facebook. Honestly, it’s not exactly difficult to tell why.The cat — now being called “Mr. Handsome” — has a personality as sweet as his face.“He loves being petted, he loves to be brushed,” shelter attendant Tiffany Foushee — the woman pictured with Mr. Handsome — told HuffPost. “He’s a really good boy.”The man who brought the cat to the shelter said he had been hanging around his home for around three days, shelter attendant Foushee said. Since Mr. Handsome is too big for a kennel, he’s living in the shelter break room for now, where he enjoys lounging in a cabinet.Mr. Handsome will remain on a stray hold — a period of time the shelter refrains from adopting out an animal in case an owner comes forward — until Monday. If no owner is found, he’ll be up for adoption to the public.The adopter will have to agree to a veterinary plan to get Mr. Handsome’s weight under control. A pet being overweight or obese can lead to serious health problems.“He’ll definitely have to go on a diet plan,” she said. Foushee, who has a background in veterinary medicine, estimated that Mr. Handsome’s “goal weight” will probably be around 18 pounds.“He is a large cat, he does have a big bone structure,” she said.Mr. Handsome will also need to get blood work to determine if he has any medical issues like diabetes. He may also need to start taking a joint supplement, since excess weight is putting more pressure on his joints.“His little legs kind of bow out when he walks,” said Foushee.The cat’s internet fame means that the shelter is expecting to receive a flood of interested adopters. If that happens, they plan to use a raffle system to help find the cat a home.After applications are submitted through a draw, the winner will be able to meet Mr. Handsome. The shelter will then do further assessment, Foushee added.Whoever ends up adopting him will have to sign a document committing them to provide Mr. Handsome with the extensive care he needs. If the person the shelter draws ends up not being a good match for Mr. Handsome, they will draw a new winner until they find a him a suitable home.Foushee encouraged the many people who have fallen in love with Mr. Handsome — but will not be able to adopt him, since he can only go to one home — to seek out other cats in need, either from Chatham County Animal Services or their own local communities.“I know he’s special because he’s 31 pounds, but in our shelter for instance, we have 60 cats here not including him,” she said. “There are tons and tons and tons of cats out there.”"

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emissions-regional-greenhouse-gas-initiative_us_5972566fe4b09e5f6ccf3888,"A nine-state coalition could aggressively cut carbon emissions, but they're split on whether to do so.",2017-07-22,New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called for stricter reductions of carbon emissions.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597259b22100003400fc81eb.jpeg?ops=crop_319_114_1979_1420%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"States along the East Coast loudly rejected President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and forged a bipartisan alliance that vowed to “uphold” the international pact to cut planet-warming emissions and “take aggressive action on climate change.”While the formation of the U.S. Climate Alliance made a powerful statement, it’s another, rarely discussed regional league that offers the first real chance to make good on those promises.Eight years ago, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative ― made up of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont ― established an interstate cap-and-trade system that puts a limit on carbon dioxide emissions from the utility sector and allows power companies to buy and sell permits to pollute. The program has proven to be a notable success, reducing average utility bills by 3.4 percent, driving $2.7 billion in economic growth and creating at least 14,200 new jobs through energy conservation projects funded by the revenue it generates.It’s popular, too: Nearly 8 in 10 voters in RGGI states support strengthening carbon pollution limits. Last year, RGGI ― pronounced “reggie” by those in the know ― embarked on a full review to determine whether to adopt a lower cap and stricter standards. The results of that review could come in the next few weeks. Sources familiar with the negotiations told HuffPost that it was “imminent” and said the talks had accelerated following Trump’s drastic rollback of climate policies.The decision for nine Northeastern states would come soon after this week’s vote by California lawmakers to renew the Golden State’s own cap-and-trade law. “The RGGI states are still working to evaluate design elements for the program, and to move forward with a consensus that meets the needs of every RGGI state,” Katie Dykes, the chair of RGGI, told HuffPost by email. “The RGGI states have not set a deadline for the conclusion of program review, but will communicate with stakeholders and provide updates as they are available regarding future meetings and materials.”The group is weighing three different policies that environmental groups characterize as the “unacceptable,” better and best case of the scenarios on the table. Right now, RGGI reduces the amount of carbon that utilities are allowed to spew by 2.5 percent each year, based on the previous year’s emissions. That means the amount of additional emissions reductions gets smaller and smaller every year. Each of the policies under consideration would set the annual reduction rate as a percentage of a fixed baseline.The first standard calls for keeping the reduction rate at 2.5 percent, pegged to a fixed baseline starting in 2021. The second increases the rate to 3.5 percent, beginning in 2021. The third sets the rate at 3 percent, but goes into effect in 2019.The difference in costs between the first and third options is small. Imposing a 3 percent rate on a fixed baseline in just two years would cost utilities less than one-tenth of one penny more per kilowatt hour of electricity over the current standard. Yet the impact on emissions would be dramatic.“What we gain in return for that marginal additional cost is that we avoid 99 million [short] tons of CO2 emissions” from 2017 to 2031, Jordan Stutt, a policy analyst at the Boston-based Acadia Center, told HuffPost. “That’s more than a full year’s worth of emissions for this region. If the states are serious about acting on climate, they can’t ignore those kinds of emissions reductions at that low a cost.”But the states are split. The RGGI negotiators ― who typically work for state environmental regulators and report to governors ― are tight-lipped, but indicators of division have emerged in recent months.New York and Massachusetts appear to want more aggressive targets. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) called for lowering RGGI’s emissions cap 30 percent by 2030 during his State of the State address in January, a goal in line with the 3 percent proposal. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) hinted last month that the state would support reducing emissions by as much as 5 percent each year between 2020 and 2031. Rhode Island and Vermont appear to be backing the two more populous states’ ambitious goals, but remain smaller players. Connecticut, which currently holds the chairmanship of the organization, has not made a major public statement and “generally seems to fall into the ‘just need to keep everyone together’ category,” said Mark Kresowik, a Sierra Club director who is closely following the negotiations. Delaware has taken a similar position, he said.Maryland has taken a slightly different tone. The state threatened last year to pull out of RGGI if the group doubled its reduction rate to 5 percent. (That figure is not actually being considered, but the idea was raised by Massachusetts officials and backed by big corporate and environmental interests.) Instead, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) wants to keep the reduction rate low in an effort to encourage other states to join RGGI.There’s little weight to that argument, said Jackson Morris, director of Eastern energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The two main contenders to join RGGI are New Jersey and Virginia, and both seem likely to enter regardless of the emissions reduction rate.New Jersey had been a founding member of RGGI. Gov. Chris Christie (R) pulled the state out in 2011 and vetoed every bill by the state legislature calling for the Garden State to rejoin, including the most recent attempt last week. But Christie is out of office as January 2018, and both major gubernatorial nominees ― Democrat Phil Murphy and Republican Kim Guadagno, the current lieutenant governor ― have vowed to renew the state’s membership in RGGI. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who also leaves office in January, proposed new state rules to cut emissions and set up a cap-and-trade system in May. That change will likely be implemented only if Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, wins in November. If the regulations are enacted, there’s little doubt that Virginia would join RGGI because it costs more to operate a solo carbon market. “They recognize that to go it alone as a state-only market just makes it more expensive,” Morris told HuffPost. “The bigger the market you have for carbon reductions, the cheaper it is to achieve them.” On the opposite end of the spectrum are New Hampshire and Maine. The Republican governors of both states are longtime foes of renewable energy. But unlike the other states mentioned, New Hampshire and Maine require their legislatures to sign off on joining or leaving RGGI, Kresowik said.Membership in the emissions pact is less at risk in Maine, where control of the legislature is split between the two parties and where RGGI subsidizes the state’s electricity rates, making them the lowest in New England. In New Hampshire, however, both legislative chambers are controlled by the GOP and the 400-member House includes people like state Rep. Michael Harrington (R), who makes a routine show of his calls to repeal RGGI.“There’s no real reason why New Hampshire or Maine would leave,” Kresowik said. “They participate in the regional electricity market, so they would still end up paying for the program and receive no benefit” if they left.But that has not deterred lawmakers like Harrington. “You end up with individuals who do it for political posturing,” said Kresowik.In June, six of the nine RGGI states ― Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont ― joined the U.S. Climate Alliance in response to Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Those same states must now push RGGI to enact more ambitious targets, Morris argued.“This is a clear and present opportunity to start to demonstrate policy outcomes to match the momentum,” Morris said. “Change the oil, tune up the engine and make it better. This isn’t building a car from scratch; this is a proven model.”This story was updated to include a comment from RGGI. "

The identity of the victims was not immediately known.Turkey’s disaster and emergency management authority, AFAD, said the earthquake had a magnitude of 6.3, with its epicenter 11 km (7 miles) from the nearest settlement, the village of Camlik. Other reports put the quake magnitude at 6.7.Across a narrow Aegean Sea waterway in Turkey’s Bodrum, about 70 people were admitted to hospital, with injuries suffered in their attempts to flee the overnight tremor, which struck at 1.31 a.m. (6:30 p.m. ET Thursday).It was the second quake of magnitude exceeding 6.0 in the broader region this year, a level that can cause considerable damage.A hospital official said 100 people were injured, most slightly.Greek authorities sent helicopters to airlift the injured, said Yiorgos Hadjimarkou, the head of the South Aegean region.“Our primary concern right now is (safeguarding) human life,” he told Greek state broadcaster ERT.The Greek coast guard said damage was reported to the port of Kos, which is near a tourist strip of cafes and bars.A ferry was unable to dock because of extensive damage. Private broadcaster SKAI showed images of a damaged quay, with wide cracks in the asphalt.Police sources said the roof of a bar in Kos collapsed, but damage was almost exclusively confined to older buildings.The quake could cause a small tsunami, the European quake agency EMSC said, but Turkish broadcasters cited officials saying large waves were more likely.Several stores were damaged in Bodrum’s Gumbet district by rising sea levels, store owners told broadcaster NTV.The Kostoday.com website showed images of rising sea levels and parts of the flooded tourist strip, with large chunks of rubble elsewhere. One picture showed a small fishing boat on a road. The tidal wave was about 70 cm (28 inches) high, a seismologist told Greek TV.The tremor, whose magnitude was initially reported as 6.9, was very shallow, just 6.2 miles (10 km) below the seabed, the U.S. Geological Survey said.Turkey’s emergency authorities warned against aftershocks, but added there had been no casualties or major damage.“Our people should know that aftershocks are continuing, so they should refrain from entering damaged or vulnerable structures,” AFAD head Mehmet Halis Bilden told broadcaster CNN Turk.Television footage from the province of Mugla showed hundreds of people abandoning buildings and waiting on the streets, as cars shook and items fell off store shelves.Mugla Governor Esengul Civelek told a news conference there were no initial reports of major damage, although Mayor Osman Gurun said power outages hit parts of the province.Turkey’s location between the Arabian tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate renders it prone to earthquakes.In October 2011, more than 600 people died in the eastern province of Van following a 7.2-magnitude quake and powerful aftershocks. In 1999, two massive earthquakes killed about 20,000 people in Turkey’s densely populated northwest.The same year, a 5.9 magnitude quake killed 143 people in Greece."

When we see people we’ve parted ways from and we think we’ve made a mistake. We think we’ve wasted so much time with the wrong people and we get anxious over lost time. We hate ourselves, hate our exes for the time we’ll never get back.But our time, our energy, our passion, our affection is never wasted when we truly love.Love can never be a waste. And there are no ‘wrong’ people, only lessons. Sure, we might fall into relationships with people who end up being terrible for us—people who may cheat or lie, abandon or leave us when we trusted them with everything.But we cannot look at these failed relationships as worthless. We can’t think that we’ve lost so much time in this journey because every broken connection has taught us something, every love has shown us who we are, and every pain has helped us gain resilience, strength, and the will to keep on loving.Because love is always worth it, no matter the outcome.So please, remember that love was never purposeless. You have never failed just because of a failed connection, relationship, or marriage. There is no loss when you give someone your everything, you only gain—wisdom, lessons, understanding, forgiveness, and growth.And if you cared for someone, if their toothbrush found its way to the holder on your sink, if their hand felt familiar and warm in yours, and your heart beat in rhythm with the pounding in their chest, you have not missed out on anything.You have loved, truly loved, and that’s beautiful. You have loved, truly loved, and that’s worth every second in the end.Get your copy of Marisa Donnelly’s book, Somewhere on a Highway, here."

Katz, M.D., M.P.H., ContributorFounder, True Health Initiative",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mac-cheese-and-hot-lead_us_5971f0c9e4b0f1feb89b42a6,"Assuming you aren’t preoccupied with trivialities, like whether or not 30 million people have health insurance, then you",2017-07-21,<p>Some of the new kids’ cereals introduced for 2017</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5971f0f715000026008b2e89.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Assuming you aren’t preoccupied with trivialities, like whether or not 30 million people have health insurance, then you know that the big medical news of the past week was about…Mac and Cheese. We learned there was some bad stuff in it.The particular bad stuff just brought to our attention is called phthalates. Nobody puts phthalates, which are used in the manufacture of “soft vinyl products” like backpacks, lunch boxes, and flooring- into food, Mac and Cheese or otherwise, on purpose. So how does it get in there? It leaches in from food manufacturing machinery, notably plastic tubing.For starters, the image of food production, any food production, involving what sounds rather like IV tubing is a bit disturbing. But I suppose we must concede that’s simply naïve in 2017. The food certainly doesn’t put itself into all those bags, boxes, bottles, jars, and cans that grace modern supermarket shelves. To borrow from Father of the Bride: “welcome to the 90s [and beyond], Mr. Banks!” Still, one has to wonder whether it’s the Mac, or the cheese, that flows through IV tubing? We’ll come back to that.But also, thoughts jump rather readily from somewhat sick food being pumped through something akin to IV tubing, to actual IV tubing running into sick people. So, yes, there are phthalates in IV tubing, and concerns about them, too. The principal concern about these compounds is that they are endocrine disruptors, potentially contributing to infertility, and birth defects. But search the topic, and you find associations with everything from diabetes, to attention deficit disorder.So, is there cause for panic in the recent news that 29 of 30 samples of Mac and Cheese tested were found to contain phthalates?No. For one thing, when we get this kind of news, we tend to react as if the exposure were new; but it’s not. The news about the exposure is new, but the exposure was there all along. Mac and Cheese is no more, nor less, acutely perilous than it was last week, or the week prior. For another, the concentrations of phthalates found were very, very low. For yet another, and for whatever it’s worth, we are exposed to phthalates in other ways, as noted. And lastly, the simple fact is we now live on a planet awash in chemicals of our own devising. They will find ways into us- we have made that inevitable. While we should do all we can to minimize such exposures, the idea of avoiding them is simply unrealistic now on this planet. I think the massive amounts of plastic we keep dumping into the oceans is greater cause for our collective concern than trace amounts of plasticizing chemicals in our Mac and Cheese.Which directs our attention to the matter of “bigger pictures;” I think our concern about Mac and Cheese also should be focused there. While some time ago, Kraft announced with fanfare that it was “no longer” making its iconic Mac and Cheese with artificial flavorings, preservatives, or dyes- the obvious memo hidden there was that they had been making it WITH them all along. And that’s just the tip of the cheesy iceberg. The pasta used is a “macaroni product,” and the cheese involved is a “cheese sauce mix.” I told you we would come back to the whole food-produced-through-IV-tubing thing, and we just did.Opinions vary about both actual pasta (I’m a fan, in particular of whole grain varieties), and cheese (a rather more complicated topic)- but we should all cast a dubious eye at “cheese sauce mix.”In other words, if we are going to worry about “stuff” in packaged Mac and Cheese that might be bad for us, we needn’t bother to search for it with a microscope. It’s the questionable Mac and dubious cheese!This whole topic represents risk distortion, and it’s something we tend to do all the time. We all know, or certainly should, that a dietary pattern of wholesome, whole foods, mostly plants, is monumentally good for us. Such a diet not only minimizes bad chemicals in the food we eat, it – more importantly- minimizes bad food in the food we eat! But are we there yet, or anywhere near there? Of course not! And part of the reason may very well be that we sequentially focus on the low-level toxin du jour as a means of practicing collective procrastination.If there are toxic chemicals in our Mac and Cheese, we can go on eating it, while wagging our fingers, rolling our eyes, and looking around for someone to blame. If we acknowledge that the concern about feeding our kids Mac and Cheese is the Mac and Cheese- well, then, we have to fix it ourselves, and that’s inconvenient.How inconvenient? Well, that obviously tends to be a personal matter. But consider that even as we wallow in appallingly high, and ever rising rates of childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes, we stand by passively as major food companies introduce new products like “Sprinkled Donut Crunch” as the newest part of our 6-year-old’s “complete breakfast.” This is more norm than exception in our culture. Where is the outrage? Our children’s health is being poisoned for profit not with any chemical hidden from view, but with junk masquerading as food, hiding in plain sight.If ever either of us has the terrible misfortune of being shot through the chest, I trust we agree it will come as scant comfort if the last words we hear, as we bleed into unconsciousness, are: good news! I used a lead-free bullet…” Lead is a very important public health problem, as all who bear witness to the terrible saga in Flint, Michigan have abundant cause to know. But in the situation described, it’s the bullet hole that warrants more immediate attention- not the lead. So, too, for trace toxins in junk food.

Especially after looking at photos depicting him as the Great White Hunter, puffing himself up and grinning beside various magnificent creatures that he and his brother had just transformed into carcasses. Or when he sent out this tweet, accompanied by a photo of a bowl of candy: “If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That’s our Syrian refugee problem.” I didn’t agree with the Clinton campaign about much, but I love staffers’ nickname for Donald Jr. and his brother, Eric: “the Storm Troopers.” Look at any picture of them, with their slicked-back hair and resemblance to German soldiers from bygone days, and you can see why.I know it’s petty to focus on appearances, so I’ll let Dorothy Parker do it for me. She once said, “If you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at the people he gave it to.” I’ll leave it at that…but if an image of a multi-chinned president flanked by his chinless adult sons pops into your mind, I don’t blame you.It seems that Donald Jr. may finally have made a mess too big for any diaper to contain. So big that he may have mortally wounded yet another huge beast: the Trump administration. The damning information contained in Don Jr.’s recently released email chain—not to mention the revelations that likely lie ahead—disprove the administration’s foundational lie, which is that there was no collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and agents working for the Russian government.The best indication of how serious the email revelations are is the fact that the windbag occupying the White House actually paused for breath. For a few days, President Trump made zero public appearances and issued few tweets. Then he scuttled off to France, where he literally hid away up in a tower, stuffing himself with rich food while the locals celebrated the French Revolution far below, in streets that had been designated “No Trump Zones.”When Day Is Night and Night Is Day, It’s Hard to Tell TimeIt would have been unimaginable in the days before Trump’s reign of lies, but the president and the Republicans who support him are trying to downplay the Russian collusion revelations—and they just may get away with it. Like his son and namesake, the president of the United States embodies and encourages the debasement that’s swallowing up what’s left of America’s critical thinking and moral compass. We’ve long been a nation where individuals can differ passionately, sometimes fatally, about what’s right and wrong. But under Trump, we’ve become a country where right and wrong simply don’t matter.Catch me red-handed in the act of stealing, murdering, or colluding with a hostile government? No problem. I’ll just yell, “Fake news” and keep on going.Hannah Arendt’s analysis of the trial of Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann warned of “the fearsome, word-and-thought-defying banality of evil.” The last three words are the ones she’s most famous for, and they’re often applied to President Trump. But the words that preface them are a chilling summation of American political discourse today. Is there a better description of the garbage language and logic that Trump and his minions spew out every day than “word-and-thought-defying?”“We are dying, slowly, of stupidity,” is how Jill Lepore put it in The New Yorker last month. I tend to agree—but some of us seem to be more advanced cases than others.On July 12, on his way to France to ogle the country’s First Lady and ruin Bastille Day for Parisians, Trump appeared to sympathize with the plight of Republican senators back home, who had heroically postponed their summer vacations in the hope of stripping away healthcare from the poor and disabled. Trump informed the reporters aboard Air Force One that getting to 50 votes is “this narrow road that’s about a quarter of an inch wide.” In an expansive mood, he added that, “I’d say the only thing more difficult than peace between Israel and the Palestinians is healthcare.”Does the shambling baboon flinging turds in the White House think we won’t remember his other, completely contradictory, statements? Like this one: “I know that we’re all going to make a deal on healthcare. That’s such an easy one.” And this one: “You’re going to have such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the cost. And it’s going to be so easy.”On the Middle East peace theme, there’s this: “There is no reason there’s not peace between Israel and the Palestinians—none whatsoever.” And this: “It is something that I think is frankly, maybe, not as difficult as people have thought over the years.”Of course, Trump is stupid enough to make all those statements—and not be bothered by the fact that his most recent ones completely contradict earlier ones. But unless they get their news from propaganda spigots like Fox News, Americans aren’t stupid enough to accept them.Many of us feel a sense that surely (surely?) this latest, unmistakable evidence of the Trump campaign’s collusion with agents of the Russian government will prove to be its undoing. But given the cynical, craven Republicans in Congress, it will likely take time. Meanwhile Trump is holed up in the White House, getting fatter by the day on the extra scoop of ice cream he insists on having with his dessert (the staff has been instructed to serve one to everyone else at the table, two for Jabba the Leader of the Free World).If you’re not furious enough yet, consider this: That ice cream—not to mention the staggering travel and security costs as the entire extended Trump family jets all over the globe, dodging the press and lining their pockets—is paid for with American taxpayers’ money.My fellow citizens and I may be looking at years of supporting a wealthy sociopath who didn’t ascend to power, he descended (yes, I’m talking about the notorious Trump Tower escalator ride at his campaign announcement; but I’m also referring to the colluding and hate-mongering that ensued). If I’m going to be paying for that bloated billionaire’s room and board, I want it to be in a jail cell, not the White House.Previously published as ‘Blood Will Tell’ in Maria’s SPOTLIGHT column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:How I Found Joy in Domestic Order by Annie Mark-WestfallWhy the Morality in Wonder Woman Matters by Reverend Rachel KesslerLet’s Stop Shaming and Start Supporting Moms by Jami Ingledue"
83,POLITICS,Trump Does Not Acknowledge Or Respect DOJ's Independence. That Can't End Well.,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-justice-department_us_5970cdfce4b0aa14ea783baf,Justice Department alums from both sides of the aisle were alarmed by the president's comments this week.,2017-07-21,"President Donald Trump says he “would have picked somebody else” if he knew before he nominated him that Attorney General Jeff Sessions was going to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, which Trump described as “very unfair to the president.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5970d1e92100003700fc7e3c.jpeg?cache=yNaUNceN62&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It became pretty clear this week that President Donald Trump doesn’t seem to know much about how the Department of Justice operates, or much about some of the people he nominated to key positions at DOJ. Trump’s comments to The New York Times indicate he either doesn’t know or doesn’t care about the normal limits on the relationship between the White House and the Justice Department. And that has a lot of DOJ alums from both sides of the aisle worried. In his remarkable interview with the Times this week, Trump said he “would have picked somebody else” if he knew before he nominated him that Attorney General Jeff Sessions was going to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, which Trump described as “very unfair to the president.” Trump claimed ― inaccurately ― that the “F.B.I. person really reports directly to the president of the United States,” a false assertion he called “interesting.” Trump went on to reveal that he knew very little about Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man he appointed to the crucial No. 2 position in the Justice Department. Trump repeatedly said that Rosenstein was “from Baltimore,” and complained that there “are very few Republicans in Baltimore.” (Rosenstein, in fact, is a Republican. He was born in Philadelphia, has lived in the D.C. suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, for years, and spent much of his career working in the U.S. capital, except for when he commuted to Baltimore as U.S. attorney for Maryland.)This week certainly isn’t the first time Trump violated DOJ norms. His direct overtures to former FBI director James Comey and former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara blurred the divisions between DOJ and the White House and made both men uncomfortable. There was the unusual sight of a U.S. attorney speaking from the White House press room. And Trump met directly with his nominee for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, which CNN reported on Thursday was “virtually unheard of” in past administrations.But his comments this week on Sessions, Rosenstein and special Counsel Robert Mueller went even further beyond the pale for many Justice Department veterans. And Trump’s comments came as The Washington Post reports that the president is trying to learn more about his pardon power. It’s not just Obama administration veterans who have concerns. John F. Wood, an attorney with the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed who served as a counselor to the attorney general and as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri during the George W. Bush administration, told HuffPost he found Trump’s comments “unusual” and a break with the traditional restrictions between the White House and DOJ.“I could not imagine President Bush saying something like that about really anyone who worked for him,” Wood said. “I think it hurts morale. I think it is disruptive, and it undermines the attorney general within the Justice Department. That said, I think people also recognize that President Trump changes his mind frequently, and so you never know if next week he’s gonna say something very supportive of Jeff Sessions.”While Sessions brushed off resignation talk on Thursday morning, Bharara said he thinks Trump’s comments make it next to impossible for him to do his job.Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said that Trump’s attack on Sessions’ recusal on Russia “reveals yet again his violation of the essential independence of DOJ, a bedrock principle of our democracy.”And former Attorney General Eric Holder said that Trump can’t “define or constrain” the Mueller investigation. Doing so would create constitutional, and criminal, issues, he said.Wood said Trump’s comment on Sessions “probably makes people a little bit nervous” about taking positions in the administration, but there are certain positions such as U.S. attorney that are “highly sought after,” despite Trump’s statements. “But I have heard that there are some positions that the Justice Department is having some trouble filling,” Wood said.He said that while he thinks that many Trump White House staffers are more aware of the limitations on DOJ contacts, the president is not.“I think it’s certainly correct that the president is not really familiar with the traditional lines between the Justice Department and the White House,” Wood said. “The president himself is used to shooting from the hip and doesn’t know that there’s some things that he’s better off not getting involved in.”In a series of tweets Saturday, Trump insisted he had “complete power” to pardon and questioned why the Justice Department wasn’t investigating Hillary Clinton or former FBI director James Comey."

They’ve had non-white captains,” he said at the convention. “All sorts of races have appeared, because they see a future world where that is irrelevant and it’s perhaps time that ‘Doctor Who’ and its fans did too,” Baker added.While many fans have welcomed Whittaker’s appointment as the 13th Time Lord, it’s also sparked an avalanche of sexist comments ― which the BBC did its best to shut down via this satisfying statement.Even Baker’s predecessor in the role, Peter Davison, suggested Whittaker may not be right for the role because it means “the loss of a role model for boys who I think Doctor Who is vitally important for.”Baker, who has four daughters, dismissed Davison’s statement as “absolute rubbish.” “They’ve had 50 years of having a role model,” he said."
85,WOMEN,Judge Says Protestors Can't Block Door To Kentucky's Last Abortion Clinic,Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judge-says-protestors-cant-block-door-to-kentuckys-last-abortion-clinic_us_597212f2e4b09e5f6cced8f8,The emergency court order comes before hundreds of anti-abortion protestors are set to descend on Kentucky.,2017-07-21,A judge in Kentucky has said protestors cannot enter a buffer zone outside of the state's only abortion clinic—or block its door in any way. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5972236e15000021008b2f3f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Federal prosecutors in Louisville, Kentucky, have won an emergency court order to enforce a “buffer zone” around the state’s only remaining abortion clinic, preventing protestors from physically blocking the door as they have in the past.The complaint, filed on Thursday, singled out members of the extremist anti-choice group Operation Save America, which will kick off a week of protests against the EMW Women’s Surgical Center on Saturday. Group members have said their goal is to “shut down” what they describe as an “abortion mill.” On Friday, U.S. District Judge David Hale issued a temporary restraining order against a group of individuals including Rusty Thomas ― founder of Operation Save America ― who used their bodies to block the entrance to the clinic during a protest last spring. They sat with their backs against the door and, after refusing to leave, were arrested. In doing so, the complaint argued, they violated the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (or FACE) Act that passed in the mid-1990s to prevent aggressive protesting immediately outside of freestanding abortion clinics across the country.Christine, a 30-something volunteer escort who helps women walk from their cars to the clinic door, was at the clinic on that Saturday in May and described the scene to HuffPost. (For privacy reasons, Christine asked that only her first name be used.)“They swarmed the door, saying ‘Rescue, rescue, rescue!’ which was their cue, and then they all sat down,” she said. “The police asked them to get up and they wouldn’t. Several people went limp and had to be dragged away. There were clients coming up, and they couldn’t get in.”Though it was the first time Christine had encountered protestors who physically block the door, she said she was not particularly surprised. She believes OSA’s sole purpose outside clinics is to “harass” and “intimidate” women and their partners. Before Friday’s ruling, reproductive rights advocates warned that the federal complaint had important implications for the rest of the country, even though it concerns only a few feet of space in front of one single clinic. The buffer zone that protestors are prohibited from entering extends about 15 feet from the patient drop-off zone to the clinic door, and about 7-and-a-half feet from east to west.“The clinic blockade that happened in May is a throwback to the 1990s, when individuals would obstruct entrances to clinics,” Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney for the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project, told HuffPost. “The federal government passed a law preventing that from happening, and since then we really have not seen this type of blockade. The reason why this is so disconcerting now is because we thought it was in the past.”The judge’s ruling on Friday is a win for the EMW Women’s Surgical Center and its patients, but hundreds of extremist protestors are still expected to descend on Kentucky next week. Operation Save America said it plans to show what it claims are graphic images of an abortion procedure outside of Louisville’s City Hall next week. Whatever happens, Christine said that she and her fellow volunteer escorts will do what they always do: put on their orange vests and help women walk from their cars, past the protestors and safely into the clinic.“Of course there are some nerves, but we remain client-focused,” she said. “Protestors are not our concern. Our only concern are the clients and walking them to the door.”"
