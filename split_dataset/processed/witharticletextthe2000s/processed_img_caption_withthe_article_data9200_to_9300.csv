0,POLITICS,Americans Split On Trump's Handling Of Terror Threats,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-terror-poll_us_59387d47e4b0b13f2c66d063,Most say it was inappropriate for the president to bash London's mayor after the London Bridge attack.,2017-06-07,President Donald Trump and London Mayor Sadiq Khan,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593880281d00002900cc1c16.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans are closely divided on the way President Donald Trump has reacted to the threat of terrorism, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, and give him mixed reviews for his tweets responding to the recent terrorist attack in London.Forty-one percent approve of Trump’s handling of the threat of terrorism, while 44 percent disapprove. The remainder are unsure.Among people who voted for Trump, 90 percent approve of his handling of the issue, compared with 6 percent of voters who supported Hillary Clinton. Non-voters and those who supported a third-party candidate are more evenly split, with 35 percent approving, 41 percent disapproving, and one-fourth not sure.Trump issued a series of tweets after Saturday’s London Bridge terror attack, including several decrying the response of the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan.Seventy percent of Americans, including a majority of both Clinton and Trump voters, think it was appropriate for the president to tweet a pledge that the U.S. would do whatever it can to help. Only 16 percent called that response inappropriate.Nearly half think it was appropriate that Trump issued a call to “stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people,” although 34 percent found it inappropriate. Ninety-four percent of Trump voters, but only 15 percent of Clinton voters, found the tweet acceptable.A majority of the public, 55 percent, says it was inappropriate for Trump to blast the London mayor, who said there was “no reason to be alarmed” by the increased police presence in London. Trump tried to portray the remark as downplaying the threat of terrorism. Just 26 percent of Americans say Trump’s criticism was appropriate. Americans are divided more broadly on the proper tone for a politician to take in the aftermath of a terror attack. While 41 percent say it’s worse for a politician not to react strongly enough and to risk appearing weak, 33 percent say it’s worse to react too strongly and risk stoking fear.Two-thirds of Americans say that they’re at least somewhat scared about the way things are going in the world, with one-fourth describing themselves as very scared. Those numbers are mostly consistent with polls conducted earlier this year. Thirty-eight percent say they’re at least somewhat concerned that they or someone in their family will become a victim of terrorism. That’s basically unchanged from the 39 percent who said so in the wake of the May attack in Manchester, England, but up slightly from the 32 percent who said so in February.Want to get more stories like this?

1,POLITICS,How GOP Senators Question James Comey Could Make Or Break Their Reputation,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-senators-james-comey-questions_us_593832b5e4b00610547e7c1e,Pressure is mounting for Republicans to stand up to Trump.,2017-06-07,"Sens. Richard Burr, Jim Risch and Marco Rubio (from left) all have to decide how they'll approach the former FBI director.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593869fb19000036003e5108.jpeg?cache=YcdJBXFxST&ops=crop_52_377_5394_3266%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When former FBI Director James Comey appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday to discuss the circumstances of his firing by President Donald Trump, his reputation won’t be the only one on the line.The Republicans sitting on the dais also face a tremendous amount of pressure. Comey has already submitted written testimony that, among other bombshells, confirms that Trump asked him to lay off the FBI’s investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The senators can either choose to press the former FBI director in his lone public hearing for more information about one of the most critical investigations Congress has undertaken in decades, or they can use the occasion to run political interference for the nominal leader of their party. There will be very little in between.“These people who thought … that they were going to go in there and make this about a different topic, I think those people have realized it’s a dead end,” said GOP strategist Rick Wilson, a vocal Trump critic. “This is clearly a story now about the president trying to suborn and corrupt our federal law enforcement agencies to protect himself and his friends. The magical power of Donald Trump to control what the press covers has reached its limit. This is where it ends.”Republican senators, Wilson added, must start distancing themselves from Trump or “play defense on the indefensible.”Leading up to Thursday’s high-profile hearing, many lawmakers have indicated they want to explore those matters that trouble Wilson and others: namely, the extent to which Trump interfered in the FBI’s Russia probe and the circumstances surrounding Comey’s firing.But the pressure for Republicans to help shield Trump politically will be strong too. The White House has indicated that they want to turn the tables on Comey, with reported plans to attack the former director as a “showboat.” A pro-Trump nonprofit has bought time for a 30-second spot that will run during Thursday’s hearing and question Comey’s credibility.If past hearings are prologue, some Republicans may be persuaded to mimic those lines or at least try to turn the hearing toward different issues, like the origin of leaks that have damaged Trump and Comey’s decision not to raise his concerns about interference in real time. GOP lawmakers have already shown a remarkable willingness to admonish but not abandon the president, even as his scandals pile up.Wilson himself said he doesn’t have much confidence that Republicans will ask the questions they should, adding that it would “absolutely” cost them politically.In the days before the hearing, few Republicans on the Intelligence Committee hinted how they would approach the grilling of Comey. Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said he wants Comey to explain the purpose of the memos he reportedly kept and whether Russian officials engaged with any American citizen. But not much more.That said, the committee includes senators who have been deferential to Trump as well as those who have been more openly critical.Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) scolded reporters for chasing stories that Trump had shared classified information with Russian officials, arguing that the focus should be on those leaking details of the president’s private meetings. Risch defended the administration in an Intelligence Committee hearing on Wednesday when lawmakers questioned Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, and Adm. Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, about conversations they’d had with the president concerning the FBI’s investigation.Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who chairs the Intelligence Committee, has also attempted to shift attention away from Trump and onto the press. When reports emerged that Comey had kept detailed notes on that key meeting with Trump, Burr called on The New York Times to supply the memo and openly doubted that the president had asked Comey to drop the Flynn investigation.“The director of the FBI shared more information with Sen. Warner and myself than any director has ever shared,” Burr said. “I think something as material as that, probably would have been something he would have shared, had it happened.”But along with Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the vice chair of the committee, Burr has also come to Comey’s defense when Trump has criticized him in the past.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a firebrand who has been one of Trump’s harsher critics, will also have a chance to question Comey. As an ex-officio member of the committee, he is allowed to sit in on the hearing. How he will focus his questions is not yet clear. When asked his thoughts about Comey’s prepared testimony on Wednesday evening, McCain simply said that he wasn’t surprised and that more shoes will drop.Because they’re up for re-election only every six years, senators are often less vulnerable to political pressure than their brethren in the House. But Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian, said that senators would still run real risks if they came off as administration patsies on matters as serious as these.“If the scandals turn out to be real and they didn’t ask the tough questions, then they become part of the problem,” Zelizer said of Republicans. “If they don’t say anything, if they let it slide, that’s dangerous. ... It would show partisanship is so powerful a force that our institutions can weaken.”Some preview of how Republicans will handle Comey may have come during Wednesday’s committee hearing with Coats and Rogers. During that session, Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) was one of the most aggressive GOP senators on the question of Trump’s involvement in the Russia probe. Rubio pushed Coats and Rogers on whether Trump had asked them ― as opposed to merely pressuring them ― to interfere in the FBI investigation.When Coats said he wasn’t prepared to answer that, Rubio didn’t leave it alone, arguing that he wasn’t seeking any information that was classified. He was fairly dogged and pointed. And even then Wilson didn’t think the senator went far enough.“As a Republican, as a conservative, I’m deeply concerned that my party has continued to believe that just because Trump makes the media angry, that it’s sufficient enough to forgive every sin,” Wilson said. “I’m worried about representatives who are willing to burn themselves for this guy for nothing in return.”"

David Ige (D) said at a press conference on Tuesday, ahead of signing the two bills into law.Senate Bill 559 and House Bill 1578 commit to expanding methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the state. They also target agricultural practices with the goals of improving soil health and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, according to a statement from the governor’s office.“Hawaii’s natural environment is under threat,” Ige said. “Climate change is real, regardless of what others say. Hawaii is seeing the impacts, first hand.”Sen. J. Kalani English (D), who introduced SB 559, recognized it as a “legal basis to continue adaption and mitigation strategies” for the state, “despite the federal government’s withdrawal from the treaty,” according to ABC News.The bills’ signage came with the support of four Hawaiian county mayors, who have joined hundreds of other mayors across the U.S. in signing a commitment agreement. “We will intensify efforts to meet each of our cities’ current climate goals, push for new action to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius target, and work together to create a 21st century clean energy economy,” declared the mayors, who referred to themselves as “Climate Leaders” in a statement following Trump’s decision to withdraw from the pact on Thursday."
3,POLITICS,Senate Republicans Are Closer Than Ever To Repealing Obamacare,Matt Fuller and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-obamacare-repeal_us_593723f2e4b0ce1e7408aebf,But they're still kind of far away.,2017-06-07,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell doesn't have a bill yet, but he's optimistic.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5937251219000047003e4d99.jpeg?ops=crop_9_19_4895_2900%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republican senators appear closer to ultimately passing a bill that would repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with legislation that would dramatically reduce health insurance coverage for low-income people, only in a less severe fashion than the House measure.Senators still lack an actual bill, and the compromises needed to pass the Senate could imperil the legislation in the House, which will also have to back it. But Tuesday was a pivotal day for discussions in the upper chamber ― and seemingly a positive one ― as Republicans try to build a 50-vote coalition to repeal Obamacare.“We’re getting close to having a proposal to whip and to take to the floor,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters, after nearly three hours of closed-door meetings.McConnell is working with hardly any margin for error. He can afford to lose only two of his 52 Republicans ― with Vice President Mike Pence then breaking the tie ― and it seems highly unlikely that conservative Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) or moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) will vote for the legislation. That means the majority leader must pressure, cajole or even deploy state-specific giveaways that could risk the support of other senators in order to keep the rest of his caucus in line.But even facing those challenges, there was rare optimism among Senate Republicans on Tuesday. “This is what I was hoping to have the leadership be able to share with us, and I feel very good about the fact that we’re moving in the right direction,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said, albeit adding that members still had “a long way to go.”As for why they were increasingly optimistic, GOP senators wouldn’t offer very many details and McConnell suggested that some key issues linger. But the broad outline discussed among members points to a slower phaseout of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion than the House bill entails and a shifting of tax credits from younger people to older people. Unlike the House version, the Senate bill may not allow insurers to set higher prices for people with pre-existing conditions than for healthy people.That legislative vision appeared to sway some on-the-fence members who could prove critical to cobbling together 50 GOP votes. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who had been outspoken in his opposition to the House-passed bill, signaled that he was comfortable with the broad strokes of the Senate legislation, though he warned that he hadn’t seen the final text.Cassidy said the protections for people with pre-existing conditions were a big factor for him, as well as the slower rollback of the Medicaid expansion, which has helped states like his insure more people almost entirely on the federal government’s dime.“What we’ve been told so far, states would have the ability, a lot more power than they do under Obamacare, to shape their future, and I think we’ve gotta return the power to the states,” Cassidy said, seemingly referring to a proposal to set per-capita limits on Medicaid, which would push states to put tougher restrictions on who’s eligible for that program.Asked if the phaseout of the Medicaid expansion was still a concern of his, Cassidy said it was. “I think there’s obviously more to be done, but the phaseout is further down the road and states have a chance to adapt,” he said.The remaining hurdles for Senate GOP leadership center mainly around the future of the Medicaid expansion, which Republicans generally believe is unsustainable. Negotiators have moved away from the House bill, which the Congressional Budget Office said would save $834 billion over 10 years by cutting back Medicaid. The Senate bill would presumably save less with a longer phaseout, yet the program that gives low-income people health insurance would still suffer a painful decrease ― and largely in the name of giving tax cuts to the wealthy.Still, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said the Senate’s approach would strike a better compromise than the House did, by giving states the ability to come up with their own new restrictions on Medicaid.“I don’t want to pull the rug out from under anyone,” Johnson said, “but let’s not leave the rug out there for a couple more years to have more people stand on the rug.”Another, less problematic sticking point involves the Obamacare taxes, which the House bill would almost entirely eliminate. Senators are exploring keeping some of those taxes in place, but that could be problematic for conservative members. Rand Paul, for one, has cited any failure to fully wipe out Obamacare as a reason to vote no on a replacement bill. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters on Tuesday that he thought Paul was “irretrievably gone” on health care, although Paul’s office later quipped that Graham had not yet applied for the open press assistant job in Paul’s office.Even if Paul is not lost yet, other conservatives like Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) are question marks. Both could balk at the more modest Medicaid cuts and the maintenance of certain taxes; they’ve already been cagey about where they currently stand on the bill. Cruz entertained reporters Tuesday with a long explanation about why he supports privatization of the Federal Aviation Administration and then, once a reporter asked about health care, walked away.Other potential swing votes include Sens. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), whose state greatly benefits from the Medicaid expansion, and Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who is up for a tough re-election contest in 2018. But if McConnell can somehow keep them in line, along with Cruz and Lee, he’ll likely have the votes to pass the bill.With the prospect of that growing stronger on Tuesday, Democrats were left with their own predicament: whether to begin negotiating with GOP moderates on a separate bill in order to stave off a conservative, Republicans-only approach. For now, Democratic leadership said they would stay away from any negotiations until Republicans dropped their insistence on a full repeal of Obamacare.“There is no appetite as long as they’re working towards repeal,” said one senior Senate Democratic aide. But there is great appetite as soon as they abandon it.Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) did say that he had discussed health care with Cassidy, who has pushed his own bill. But such discussions had been broadly topical and not specific to any legislation, an aide said.Even if health care legislation passed the Senate with only Republican votes, its ultimate passage would not be secured. At that point, House lawmakers, particularly House conservatives, would have to decide whether they could support a bill that does not let insurers charge people with pre-existing conditions more and thereby lower premiums for other people. The House Freedom Caucus was adamant that an Obamacare replacement had to give insurers that flexibility. Still, a more moderate bill from the Senate could win over some of the House moderates who voted against their own chamber’s bill.Faced with a Senate bill, the House would have several options: It could simply vote yes on the legislation. It could amend the bill and send it back to the Senate. Or the two chambers could set up a conference committee and try to resolve their differences that way.In any case, there are a number of steps to go before any Obamacare replacement reaches President Donald Trump’s desk. But given the willingness of House Republicans last month to support a bill that many of them didn’t like, no one should be certain that Republicans won’t compromise on their principles again.Mike McAuliff, Laura Barron-Lopez and Jennifer Bendery contributed to this report."

But such discussions had been broadly topical and not specific to any legislation, an aide said.Even if health care legislation passed the Senate with only Republican votes, its ultimate passage would not be secured. At that point, House lawmakers, particularly House conservatives, would have to decide whether they could support a bill that does not let insurers charge people with pre-existing conditions more and thereby lower premiums for other people. The House Freedom Caucus was adamant that an Obamacare replacement had to give insurers that flexibility. Still, a more moderate bill from the Senate could win over some of the House moderates who voted against their own chamber’s bill.Faced with a Senate bill, the House would have several options: It could simply vote yes on the legislation. It could amend the bill and send it back to the Senate. Or the two chambers could set up a conference committee and try to resolve their differences that way.In any case, there are a number of steps to go before any Obamacare replacement reaches President Donald Trump’s desk. But given the willingness of House Republicans last month to support a bill that many of them didn’t like, no one should be certain that Republicans won’t compromise on their principles again.Mike McAuliff, Laura Barron-Lopez and Jennifer Bendery contributed to this report."
6,BUSINESS,Uber's CEO Needs To Step Down,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-culture-travis-kalanick_us_593840d5e4b00610547ea53b,A company's culture starts at the top and Kalanick's track record of condoning and encouraging harassment and discrimination are now clear.,2017-06-07,Kalanick and his former girlfriend Gabi Hozwarth last year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59384db62200002d00c6cd28.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Can Uber really change its toxic bro culture if bro-in-chief Travis Kalanick sticks around? The answer now is clearly no.Since HuffPost first published this article on Wednesday, new revelations have emerged about the Uber chief executive that offer even more evidence that Kalanick is not a leader capable of managing a company where employees (and customers) are free from harassment and discrimination. Late on Thursday, Recode published an email Kalanick sent to Uber employees in 2013 advising them on how to behave at an upcoming company party. An excerpt speaks for itself:“Do not have sex with another employee UNLESS a) you have asked that person for that privilege and they have responded with an emphatic “YES! I will have sex with you” AND b) the two (or more) of you do not work in the same chain of command. Yes, that means that Travis will be celibate on this trip. #CEOLife #FML”FML indeed. Is it any wonder Uber has a big problem with discrimination, harassment and bullying when the CEO so clearly feels that the workplace is a kind of profitable frat party? As Uber scrambles to fix the broken workplace, rife with inexperienced managers, weak human resource processes, sexual harassment and bullying, it’s becoming pretty clear that Kalanick shouldn’t be around at the end of the process.On Tuesday, Uber fired a stunning 20 employees ― some senior executives ― for a variety of offenses, including sexual harassment, bullying, bias and retaliation unearthed by an outside law firm.An additional executive was fired, Recode reported, because he had illegally obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India and showed them Kalanick, who took no action. The executive, Eric Alexander, the president of business in the Asia Pacific, believed the customer’s allegation was a hoax. An Indian court sentenced the driver to life in prison for his crime.More firings are likely. Next week, Uber is expected to release a report on harassment and discrimination at a company-wide meeting, the result of a separate investigation led by former attorney general Eric Holder, now a partner at a big D.C. law firm. The company is desperately seeking to change its reputation, in the gutter since at least February, when former engineer Susan Fowler published a blog post detailing horrifying sexual harassment.Not only did Fowler’s boss sexually proposition her on her first day, her complaint to human resources was blown off because her manager was considered too valuable an employee. Fowler said she heard similar stories of sexual harassment from female colleagues.Since then, Uber has taken steps to improve its human resources department and its image, and a stream of top executives have fled.“Culture changes have been well underway at the company for months now,” an Uber spokeswoman told HuffPost. “Moving forward, we’re more committed than ever to turning the page. We want to change.”Just this week, Uber hired Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei, a management consultant and expert in company culture best known for her efforts to change how Harvard’s B-school treats women. Uber also hired a brand consultant from Apple, also a woman, to help improve its image.Thing is, you don’t need fancy consultants to tell you this simple truth about company culture: It starts at the top. The boss sets the example, the tone and the norms for the entire company. (This applies to government, as well. Just ask any White House staffer trying to work under President Donald Trump.)Uber is just now fixing a computer algorithm to determine how much to pay new hires. The old system reinforced gender pay gaps, allowing women to be paid less than men. Kalanick’s vibe is well known at this point: He works obsessively hard, and expects everyone at Uber to do the same. The result is a company worth billions, and a brutal, hard-driving culture with incredibly high turnover.Apple CEO and founder Steve Jobs also had a reputation for driving workers hard, and saying things bluntly. That’s not unusual for a startup founder. At Uber, problems have come when Kalanick has opened his mouth and said incredibly arrogant and misogynistic things.“Do I trigger something in certain people that’s related to something that I didn’t do? Or am I an asshole? I’d love to know,” Kalanick told Fortune magazine’s Adam Lashinsky. “I don’t think I’m an asshole. I’m pretty sure I’m not.” (Kalanick has been keeping a low profile since the recent sudden death of his mother. They were reportedly very close.)Kalanick has amassed quite a track record for inappropriate comments: In an interview with GQ in 2014, he bragged about how his newfound fame as a tech CEO was attracting women. “Yeah, we call that Boob-er,” he said.A recent story in tech publication The Information described Kalanick’s visit to a South Korean karaoke and escort bar with executives, mostly men and at least one woman, who reported being extremely uncomfortable.His former girlfriend told HuffPost recently that when she was with him, they’d frequently attend parties, where most of the women were models flown in to serve as, essentially, decor.After a video of Kalanick fighting with an Uber driver went viral earlier this year, he finally admitted his behavior was a problem. “It’s clear this video is a reflection of me ― and the criticism we’ve received is a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,” Kalanick wrote in a blog post titled “A profound apology.”Who decided it was profound?“This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it,” he wrote.He’s begun meditating, according to Uber board member and HuffPost founder Arianna Huffington.Kalanick, it is worth emphasizing, is not a 20-something prodigy running a tech company. He is a relatively experienced executive who has been running Uber since 2010. He is 40 years old.This was an adult male admitting he’d behaved like a child. He hasn’t yet proven whether he has the chops to actually grapple with his behavior.Companies that have managed big culture shifts usually do it with new leaders. Microsoft, for example, seems to have really changed its way since hiring Satya Nadella to replace Steve Ballmer, known for fueling a toxic, competitive culture.Kalanick has admitted he needs leadership help, and this week’s hires are part of the change, it seems. But it’s not at all clear that this is enough. Indeed, the company’s HR chief, Liane Hornsey, who is close to Kalanick, seemed to downplay the idea that sexual harassment is even a problem at Uber just last month in an interview with USA Today. She said pay and “pride” are more at issue.Fowler’s “blog shocked me,” Hornsey said. “But, what did surprise me, was when I did the listening sessions, this didn’t come up as an issue. It wasn’t one of our big themes. Other things came up that are in that area, that our values are masculine and a little aggressive, but the harassment issue, I just didn’t find that at all.”But it seems Hornsey was downplaying the situation. Of the 215 claims investigated by Perkins Coie, the law firm whose report led to this week’s firings, 47 involved sexual harassment, Uber’s only female board member told CNBC on Wednesday.Leaders aren’t solely responsible for the way a company operates. “Leaders set an example,” Joseph Badaracco, a professor at Harvard Business School, told HuffPost recently. Still, he said, companies need to have systems in place that reinforce employee behavior. Workers need to have strong managers, understand the rules of the workplace, and know that misbehavior will not be tolerated. A fast-growing startup inevitably has a lot of problems as it expands. A majority of Uber’s managers are in a supervisory role for the first time, creating all kinds of complications. Uber also hired very quickly ― a notoriously way to build a company culture ― and basically had been using its human resources department as a recruiting arm, not a place to help employees with issues.But for all the layers of ingredients that brought Uber to where it is, it would seem that problems came baked in with one of its very first workers.The headline and opening paragraphs of this article have been updated to account for the disclosure of Kalanick’s 2013 memo to employees."

I believe that that the private sector creates good paying jobs when we have a robust economy with lower taxes and less regulation.”Georgia’s minimum wage is technically $5.15 an hour, though in almost all cases it is superseded by the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour. For a single adult in the three counties in Georgia’s 6th District, the minimum living wage is $12.01 per hour, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Living Wage Calculator.In keeping with the cautious tone of Ossoff’s campaign, Ossoff spokeswoman Sacha Haworth would not say how much of a hike in the federal minimum wage Ossoff would support if elected.Instead, she reiterated in an email Ossoff’s commitment to a living wage, to be achieved through an unspecified “increase in the federal minimum wage indexed to cost of living and implemented at a pace that allows employers to adapt their business plans.”Voters in Georgia’s 6th District will choose between Ossoff and Handel in a June 20 runoff election. Ossoff failed to break the 50-percent threshold necessary to win outright in a first-round election in April, but still garnered 48 percent of the vote.Ossoff’s campaign has generated excitement among national Democrats and progressive activists who see his bid as an opportunity to pick up a symbolically important victory against President Donald Trump. Ossoff himself has raised $8.3 million and the DCCC has invested more than $5 million in the race. Fearing Republican humiliation, outside conservative groups have meanwhile injected $9 million into the race since the start of the primary.Ossoff’s delicate maneuvering on the minimum wage and other issues reflects the unique challenge he faces in trying to flip the 6th District after former Rep. Tom Price’s Cabinet appointment created a vacancy there. Price won re-election in November by 23 percentage points. Trump, by contrast, edged Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by just 1.5 points in the district.Turnout is generally lower in a special election, so Ossoff is trying to capitalize on the energy of liberal anti-Trump activists and growing communities of color in the district, while securing just enough support from Republican and independent voters turned off by Trump’s governance. With the help of abundant financial resources, Ossoff’s centrist approach appears to have had some success: The latest poll has him leading Handel by 1 percentage point.Nationwide, 55 percent of Republicans favor raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10, according to an April 2016 HuffPost/YouGov poll.But regardless of their views, the wealthy Republicans in Georgia’s 6th are less likely to be affected by the minimum wage one way or another, said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. That makes them more likely to either oppose increasing the minimum wage, or at least tolerate a politician who opposes it, Swint ventured.Abramowitz of Emory University suggested that it is unlikely that Ossoff will emphasize the minimum wage for that very reason.“They need to hold onto the 10 to 15 percent of Republicans who want to vote for Ossoff right now,” he said.One way Handel’s remark could work to Ossoff’s benefit, Swint added, is if he forces her “to try to spend some capital explaining what she meant. To the extent that it takes her off of her agenda, it’s a distraction.”Still, the affair is “not fatal” to Handel, he said, because her victory depends on Republican turnout, and that particular comment is unlikely to keep Republican voters from coming out to the polls.“If the Republican base turns out, she will win,” he concluded.

9,POLITICS,Thalia Cassuto Remembers When Birth Control Became Legal. She's Fighting To Keep It That Way.,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/griswold-v-connecticut-anniversary_us_59380c87e4b0aba888ba8628,The 86-year-old is lobbying Congress on the anniversary of a landmark Supreme Court case on contraception.,2017-06-07,"Thalia Cassuto, 86, talks about birth control access with Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday, the 52nd anniversary of Griswold v Connecticut.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593836482200002d00c6ccac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Thalia Cassuto, 86, remembers when birth control was banned in some states. She can still picture herself in 1955, 25 years old and walking up the stairs of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Queens to get her first diaphragm. Birth control was legal in New York at the time, but not in neighboring Connecticut.“In those days, if you did it before you were married, you had to really hide it,” she said. Cassuto, then a third-grade teacher, said she was “still growing up” in her mid-twenties and wanted to take some time to focus on her career before becoming a mother. “I was out to be certain I was a professional and good at what I was doing before I was going to go home and have children,” she said.A decade later, in 1965, the Supreme Court ruled in Griswold v. Connecticut that the state’s ban on contraception ― a 19th-century law that prohibited any person from using “any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception” ― violated “the marital right to privacy.” In 1972, the high court clarified that unmarried people also had the right to use birth control without “government intrusion.” Cassuto, now a women’s rights activist in upstate New York, thought during the Obama administration that the fight to protect birth control access was over and won. But 52 years after the landmark Griswold decision, progress on the issue seems to be moving in reverse.President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are moving to defund Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest provider of birth control to low-income women. And the Trump administration is now rolling back an Obama-era rule that required employers to cover contraception in their health insurance plans ― a benefit that has guaranteed birth control access at no cost to 55 million women. The moves are “part of a large sweep of things that mean that men in blue suits are telling us what to do with our bodies,” Cassuto said. “They’re not understanding the dignity of women.”Cassuto traveled to Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, the anniversary of the Griswold decision, to lobby her congressman the issue. She has also attended town halls in the district of Rep. John Faso (R-N.Y.) and even showed up at his local office to denounce his vote against Planned Parenthood funding.“I was taking my love of country for granted under President Obama,” she said. “I don’t take that for granted anymore ― I know I have to work for it. It’s like my country is sick, and I have to take care of it.”Nearly 9 in 10 sexually active women have used birth control, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before President Barack Obama passed the Affordable Care Act, more than 20 percent of American women of childbearing age had to pay out of pocket for contraception. Now, only 4 percent of women are shouldering the cost. The law, in addition to federal investments in family planning through organizations like Planned Parenthood, has contributed to an all-time low in unintended pregnancy and the lowest U.S. abortion rate since the procedure became legal in 1973. Now that Republicans are in charge, they are framing the issue as one of “taxpayer-funded abortion.” The longstanding Hyde Amendment prevents any federal dollars from paying for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest and protecting the life of the mother. However, because some of Planned Parenthood’s clinics offer abortion services, Trump and many GOP congressman believe the organization should not be eligible for funding that subsidizes contraception for low-income patients. Further, because some people believe (erroneously) that certain forms of birth control are akin to abortion, Trump has decided to allow any employer or insurer to refuse to include any of it in their health plans for moral reasons.Tom Price, the secretary of Health and Human Services, said the move will “safeguard the deeply held religious beliefs of Americans.” Dawn Laguens, an executive at Planned Parenthood, said the Griswold anniversary is a reminder of what’s at stake under a government that decreases birth control access. “Over the past half century, birth control has provided enormous benefits to women and their families, and has been nothing short of revolutionary for women and society,” she said in a statement. “But under the Trump administration, we are now facing an immediate future where a woman’s ability to make a most basic and personal decision ― when and if to have a child ― could be limited by her boss.”Cassuto said she “shriveled” when she heard Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan and remembered bans on abortion and contraception, and a society where white men were considered “better” than other people. “That’s the problem,” she said. “People think there was a glorious past. There wasn’t. It wasn’t glorious at all. It was frightening.” "

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tore into one of President Donald Trump’s nominees on Wednesday for saying that Islam is “a deficient theology” and that Muslims “stand condemned” for rejecting Jesus Christ.Sanders went after Russell Vought, Trump’s choice for deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, as he testified in his Senate Budget Committee nomination hearing. The Vermont senator brought up a January 2016 post that Vought wrote on a conservative blog in which he argues that someone can’t really “know God” without focusing on Jesus.“Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology,” Vought wrote at the time. “They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ his Son, and they stand condemned.”Such a statement is “indefensible, it is hateful and Islamophobic, and an insult to over a billion Muslims throughout the world,” Sanders told the room. He asked Vought, who sat facing him, if he thinks his past comments are Islamophobic.“Absolutely not,” replied Vought, a former vice president of the conservative Heritage Action for America. “I’m a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith. That post … was to defend my alma mater, Wheaton College, a Christian school that has a statement of faith that includes the centrality of Jesus Christ for salvation.”Sanders interjected, “Do you believe that people in the Muslim religion stand condemned?”“Again, senator, I’m a Christian,” began Vought, “and I wrote that piece …”“I understand that,” said Sanders, getting agitated. “I don’t know how many Muslims there are in America. ... Are you suggesting that all of those people stand condemned? What about Jews? They stand condemned too?”“Senator, I’m a Christian ... ,” Vought began again.“I understand that you are a Christian!” Sanders shouted. “There are other people of different religions in this country and around the world. In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?”Vought said he respects all people and repeated that he wrote his post based on being a Christian. That was it for Sanders.“I would simply say, Mr. Chairman, that this nominee is really not someone who is what this country is supposed to be about,” Sanders said, gathering up his papers. “I will vote no.”Fellow committee member Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) scolded Sanders, indirectly, by saying through gritted teeth that he hopes his colleagues “are not questioning the faith of others and how they interpret their faith to themselves.”Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) later told Gardner he didn’t think Sanders was questioning anybody’s faith but rather “the nominee” was questioning the faith of others. He said Vought is up for a job that is “supposed to uphold the trust of the whole country,” and it is “irrefutable” that his past comments dismiss the religious philosophy of millions.“I’m a Christian,” Van Hollen said, “but part of being Christian, in my view, is recognizing there are lots of ways people can pursue their god.”Vought’s confirmation vote hasn’t been scheduled yet."

Energy demand is expected to soar by at least 30 percent over the next three decades as China’s middle class grows and countries across Africa and South Asia emerge from poverty. And, thanks to aggressive investments in nuclear, hydro and renewable energy, China and the European Union are far better-positioned to dominate those new markets, according to a new 66-page report from the CNA Military Advisory Board.“American resolve at this point has not been sufficient to put us into the lead,” Lee Gunn, a retired U.S. Navy vice admiral, told HuffPost by phone. “We fear the instability around the world in everything from trade to political influence that will result from the reduction in American views, values and economic and political power.”Losing control over emerging energy industries could damage national security, said retired Lt. Gen. Richard Zilmer of the U.S. Marine Corps.“Leader of the free world post-World War II is something we very comfortably fell into,” Zilmer told HuffPost by phone on Tuesday. “If you agree that energy drives an economy and the economy drives the ability of a nation to have a strong diplomatic arm and a strong military arm and a strong national security posture, with this change in energy, sourcing and distribution, we run the risk of becoming junior partners in the relationship.”In January, China set aside $360 billion to spend on green energy by 2020. In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged in a sweeping foreign policy speech to spend $900 billion on infrastructure and clean energy abroad. The European Union is investing aggressively in zero-emissions energy, particularly offshore wind turbines, and has established a consortium in Africa to develop renewables in countries there. Russia, whose geopolitical power is largely tethered to its oil and gas reserves, has ramped up its plans to build up nuclear power stations in energy-thirsty India.“We are behind even Russia in deploying advanced energy to India,” Leo Goff, the research lead and chief author of the study, told HuffPost.The research team and 15 former military officials began putting together the report last year, well before President Donald Trump announced the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. But the researchers said the report is making projections for the next 30 years, and warned against reading too much into its near-term political implications.“What’s happening in China right now with their development of alternative energy and, more importantly, their move to put alternative energy in Africa and India, that has little to do with Paris,” Goff said. “That has to do with China cleaning up its own air, and we believe their moves in Africa and India and other parts of the globe are about influence and securing future energy needs.” “We think this really transcends Paris,” he added. “It’s for the long haul.”"

The “Hidden Figures” star appeared onstage at the Hammerstein Ballroom alongside activist Gloria Steinem and Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards to accept the Board Of Directors’ Tribute award, Time reported. The women were being honored for their work during the Women’s March in February.In her acceptance speech, Monae encouraged her fellow creatives in the fashion and entertainment industries to use their platforms to create change.”As human beings, it is going to be our responsibility to take care of one another,” Monae said.“Women’s rights are human rights. LGBTQ rights are human rights,” she continued. “So as human beings let’s never forget that none of us are free until all of us are free.”Ending her address, Monae left the audience with some inspiring words about bridging the current divisions in the world. “I never wanted to be a politician because artists get to be honest,” Monae said. “We get to tell it like it is through our work ... Let’s continue to speak out against the sexism, the racism, the homophobia, the Islamophobia, and all those things that are constantly trying to divide us.

13,POLITICS,Pentagon Distancing Itself From Donald Trump On Qatar,Alana Horowitz Satlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pentagon-trump-qatar_us_5937c755e4b0aba888ba14d7,The president this week inflamed already-mounting tensions in the Gulf.,2017-06-07,The military isn't on board with its commander in chief's comments.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5937cec91d00004600cc1979.jpeg?cache=ZsfG6t3IE8&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Pentagon is distancing itself from President Donald Trump over remarks he made on the United States’ relationship with Qatar.Trump this week took credit for a recent diplomat shakeup in the Middle East. Several Arab countries, including key U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE, cut ties with Qatar over its support of the Muslim Brotherhood. Those countries consider the largely nonviolent group to be a terrorist organization, but the official U.S. policy is that it’s not. Trump’s recent tweets seemed contradict that stance, however.Asked about the commander in chief’s comments, Department of Defense spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis told reporters that, “I can’t help you with that... I will only tell you that we have, with regard to our bases there, continued presence in our operations.”Davis also praised Qatar for what he called an “enduring commitment to regional security.” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert echoed those remarks, telling reporters on Tuesday that, “our relationship with Qatar is one that’s strong” and U.S. Ambassador to Qatar Dana Shell Smith retweeted an earlier statement she’d made about the “great partnership” between the two countries.Trump’s comments came as a shock to officials in Qatar, which Trump had only weeks ago called a friend.“We were surprised” by Trump’s comments, Qatar’s Ambassador to the U.S., Meshal bin Hamad Al Thani, told the Daily Beast. “It’s unfortunate to see these tweets. We have close coordination with the United States. They know our efforts to combat financial terrorism and terrorism.”It’s only the latest example of Trump’s Twitter rants creating friction with a key U.S. partner. Earlier this week, he lashed out at London Mayor Sadiq Khan, calling his reaction to the city’s recent terror attack “pathetic.” Both British Prime Minister Theresa May and the acting U.S. ambassador to the U.K. Lewis Lukens praised the mayor in response. Khan then suggested the U.K., widely considered the United States’ closest ally, cancel Trump’s upcoming visit.Trump has also publicly squared off with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over refugees and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto over a proposed border wall. He also irritated basically the entire world by pulling out of the Paris climate agreement.“Fundamentally, Trump in the last 4½ months has demonstrated that he doesn’t understand or doesn’t care how America has engaged the world for the last 70 years,” former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder told HuffPost."

He told Comey that he would leave the department if they did.“Look, I don’t know what’s going on, but before you guys all pull the rip cords, please give me a heads-up so I can jump with you,” Christopher Wray, the assistant attorney general who ran the department’s criminal division, told Comey, according to a 2007 report in The Washington Post.Comey went on to become director of the FBI, but President Donald Trump fired him in May as the agency investigated possible collusion between Trump officials and Russia. On Wednesday, the president announced via Twitter that he would nominate Wray to succeed Comey.Trump doesn’t like Comey. But former colleagues say Wray shares some of the characteristics of his predecessor. “Chris, in so many ways, is cut from the same cloth as James Comey is,” Bill Mateja, who worked with Wray in George W. Bush’s Justice Department, told HuffPost. “They have terrific moral compasses, and they’re very motivated to do the right thing and will do the right thing no matter what.” Wray is, however, “much more introverted” than Comey, Mateja said. He said Comey and Wray had a strong relationship.While Wray earned bipartisan praise after Trump’s announcement, his work on Bush-era programs and some of his work in private practice is sure to raise questions during his confirmation hearings. Wray represented New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) during the “Bridgegate” trial, in which two of the governor’s top former aides were sent to prison for their role in closing lanes on the George Washington Bridge for political retaliation. The governor was not charged.Another partner at Wray’s firm, King and Spalding, is an adviser to the trust that holds Trump’s business assets. The firm has done work on energy issues in Russia, and a 2016 biography of Wray on the firm’s site noted he represented “an energy company president in a criminal investigation by Russian authorities.” Wray was also involved in a Republican effort under Bush to crack down on voter fraud, which didn’t turn up much. (Trump has claimed there was widespread fraud in the 2016 election, but offered no evidence.) As part of a 2008 Inspector General investigation into allegations that Democrats and liberals were being unfairly blocked from the Attorney General’s Honors Program and Summer Law Intern Program, Wray told investigators ideology was only considered in hiring to make the program more diverse.He did not donate to either presidential candidate in 2016, but has donated to Republicans in the past, including Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. In 2003, he provided briefings to Ashcroft on an investigation into who unmasked Valerie Plame, a CIA agent, amid concern the attorney general was too involved in an investigation involving political allies.“Christopher Wray’s firm’s legal work for the Trump family, his history of partisan activity, as well as his history of defending Trump’s transition director during a criminal scandal makes us question his ability to lead the FBI with the independence, even-handed judgment, and commitment to the rule of law that the agency deserves,” Faiz Shakir, the national political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. “Given that Wray touts his deep involvement in the Bush administration’s response to the 9/11 attacks, which includes his connections to some of the most unlawful legal memos on Bush-era torture programs, the Senate should press Wray to come clean about his role in the programs,” Shakir added. Wray was just 36 when he was nominated to lead the DOJ’s criminal division in 2003, making him the youngest lawyer to lead the division in two decades at a time when there was significant emphasis on counterterrorism initiatives. He had joined the department six years earlier, as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Atlanta before becoming an associate deputy attorney general in 2001. Some people wondered whether Wray was too young for the job, but he earned praise from department colleagues, including Comey, who told the National Law Journal at the time that Wray was a “spectacular choice.”He also earned a reputation for not getting tied up in office politics and being a hard worker. Trump has publicly criticized Comey as a “showboat” and “grandstander.”“The hard cases would inevitably be assigned to him. The guy comes in to work. He doesn’t gossip. He stays as long as it takes. He’d be there on the weekends when the air conditioner wasn’t running,” Daniel Griffin, who worked with Wray in the U.S. attorney’s office, told the National Law Journal in 2003. On his first day at the Department of Justice, Wray was tasked with figuring out how the FBI had misplaced boxes during the trial of Timothy McVeigh, who was sentenced to death for setting off a bomb at a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 that killed 168 people.After graduating from Yale Law School in 1992, Wray went to clerk for J. Michael Luttig, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, where his modesty made an impression.“He’s not flashy. He’s not showy. He’s understated,” Luttig told The New York Times.Wray began his career as a federal prosecutor working on violent crime cases, but eventually moved more toward fraud and public corruption, according to the National Law Journal. As head of the criminal division, he pursued high-profile corruption cases against lobbyist Jack Abramoff and former Reps. Randy Cunningham (R-Calif.) and William Jefferson (D-La.). He also oversaw the Enron Task Force, charged with investigating and prosecuting officials after the company’s collapse.Mateja, the former DOJ official who served with Wray in the deputy attorney general’s office, said Wray was not traditionally partisan. “There’s no denying that Chris is a Republican, but there’s a difference between Republicans that serve in public offices who are deeply Republican, versus those who just happen to be Republican,” he said. “Chris is one of those ones where he doesn’t wear politics on his sleeve.”But Mateja said Wray was a conservative who grew up in a Justice Department run by Ashcroft. And, if confirmed, Wray could spend the next 10 years of his term shaping the bureau.“His vision can’t help but be formed by that experience,” Mateja said. “He’s going to approach things much more in that conservative, Republican tone than what we saw over the last eight years, that’s for sure.” "

Wray to be the next director of the FBI, he announced on Wednesday.Wray served as assistant attorney general under President George W. Bush from 2003 to 2005. The Yale Law School graduate now works as an attorney in private practice.“During his previous service at the Department of Justice, Christopher was the leader of major fraud investigations, and was a key part of the team overseeing the Justice Department’s actions in the war on terrorism following the 9/11 attacks,” Trump said in a statement. “He is an impeccably qualified individual, and I know that he will again serve his country as a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity once the Senate confirms him to lead the FBI.”Wray represented New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) in the wake of the “Bridgegate” scandal. Christie told NorthJersey.com that he had “the utmost confidence in Chris.”“He’s an outstanding lawyer,” Christie said. “He has absolute integrity and honesty, and I think that the president certainly would not be making a mistake if he asked Chris Wray to be FBI director.”Wray was interviewed for the job last week, the White House said. Trump was also said to have considered politicians including Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and, mostly notably, former Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.). He appeared to reverse course following pushback from Democrats.Trump’s critics on both sides of the aisle ― including Matthew Miller, who served as Justice Department spokesman under former Attorney General Eric Holder, and Jack Goldsmith, who served alongside Wray in the Justice Department during the Bush administration ― praised the president’s decision to tap Wray.“Wray is smart, serious, and professional. He doesn’t have quite the range of experiences that his two predecessors did. But he has deep experience with federal criminal law and the FBI,” Goldsmith wrote. “I think Trump’s firing of [former FBI Director] James Comey was a travesty. But Wray is a good choice, a much better choice than any name I previously saw floated, and a much better choice than I expected Trump to make. Without prejudging what will surely be a probing confirmation process, I think Wray is qualified to be Director of the FBI.”Wray called the nomination “a great honor” in a statement. “I look forward to serving the American people with integrity as the leader of what I know firsthand to be an extraordinary group of men and women who have dedicated their careers to protecting this country,” he said. He co-signed a letter of support for then-deputy attorney general nominee Sally Yates. Trump fired Yates after she refused to defend his Muslim immigration ban. Yates has also said she raised concerns that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn was “compromised” by the Russians, but that the White House ignored her warnings.Wray’s name came up in a 2008 Justice Department Inspector General report on allegations of politicized hiring in the Attorney General’s Honors Program and Summer Law Intern Program. The hiring process, the report concluded, was “fundamentally changed” to give political appointees more input. Data showed that applicants with Democratic or liberal affiliations were “deselected at a significantly higher rate” than candidates with conservative or neutral affiliations. Wray told the IG that politics and ideology only came up as part of an effort to make the programs more inclusive.From the report:He said there was a perception that in past administrations the career employees doing the screening may have weeded out candidates because the selecting officials were not ‘comfortable with their political persuasion.’ He said the political persuasion he was referring to pertained to candidates who had been in the military or law enforcement, ‘whether you call that conservative or not.’The president fired former FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading an investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, last month. Andrew McCabe, who started with the FBI in 1996 and served as deputy director under Comey, was named the acting director at the time. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller took over the bureau’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia after Comey was fired. Comey is set to testify in front of the Senate on Thursday and is expected to be probed about the White House’s handling of the investigation.Wray was reportedly among the Justice Department officials who threatened to resign after Alberto Gonzales and Andrew Card, then working at the White House, tried to force a bedridden Attorney General John Ashcroft to sign off on a warrantless domestic surveillance effort in 2004. Comey was serving as acting attorney general at the time, and refused to sign off on the program over concerns about its legality. Comey’s story of his confrontation with the White House officials at Ashcroft’s hospital bedside was some of the most compelling congressional testimony in modern history. Or it was, at least ― that could change when Comey testifies this week.This article has been updated with comments from Trump and Wray."

We had been talking about someone we knew who had just revealed that she was seeing a psychiatrist.Little did he know, I had just started going on my own. I had been experiencing extensive amounts of stress and felt like I wasn’t coping with it well. I was anxious all the time about everything: my friendships, the progression of this relationship, my success at work, being away from my family in a big city.I stayed silent and used the moment to take a sip of wine instead.Unsurprisingly, things didn’t work out with the therapy shamer. However, his words had a ripple effect. I found myself experiencing a sense of shame the moment I stepped into my therapist’s lobby. I took my date’s general (and inaccurate) remark about therapy and internalized it.I’m not alone: Research shows that mental health stigma ― both self-inflicted and perpetuated by others ― often prevents people from seeking help when they’re experiencing problems. As a mental health writer, I’ve reported on this fact time and time again. Suddenly, I found myself in a personal situation that gave that stat some validity.But, thanks to the very thing that was being stigmatized, I was able to work through my feelings. The truth is, there’s no reason to buy into the false perceptions surrounding therapy. It’s a process that helps you manage psychological factors that influence your overall well-being.I now refuse to settle for anyone who makes me feel ashamed for doing something that helps me become healthier and happier. And I encourage anyone else to do the same.According to Chloe Carmichael, a clinical psychologist based in New York City, that mentality will pay off in the long run for both you and your relationship; having a supportive partner can enhance the therapy process and make you feel closer to that person as a result.“It shows they are in favor of your growth, they respect the choices you make for what’s best for yourself and they’re not trying to isolate you,” she told HuffPost.Significant others who are truly understanding about therapy tend to be curious ― not to be confused with nosy ― about what you discuss. They also might be willing to help you practice what you’ve learned in your sessions (i.e. working through arguments in a specific way or encouraging certain exercises for stress). But, most importantly, they have an encouraging attitude.The benefits of therapy speak for themselves: The process can help you manage mental health issues or simply work through an acute problem that’s causing stress. Research shows it can beneficially rewire the brain, help with better emotional regulation and lead you to develop more productive and positive habits. Going to therapy helps you discover ways to become your most authentic self.“It shows that you’re willing and able to reflect on your approach to life and try new skills,” Carmichael said. “Rather than being ashamed, people should be proud of their willingness to invest this way.”All in all, therapy is a radical choice of self love and care. It’s a health decision, just like going to the doctor for a broken bone or keeping up with a regular exercise routine. It’s not the activity of “crazy people.”You deserve to be with someone who understands that."
20,IMPACT,Defunding Planned Parenthood: Catastrophic,"Annie Lu, ContributorProfessional procrastinator, cotton candy enthusiast, and ambi...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/defunding-planned-parenthood-catastrophic_us_593846afe4b014ae8c69dd24,"I stood in line for Congresswoman Anna Eshoo’s town hall meeting on Saturday, April 22, waiting to discuss with her about",2017-06-07,<p>Protesters take on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593848932200001a00c6cd10.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I stood in line for Congresswoman Anna Eshoo’s town hall meeting on Saturday, April 22, waiting to discuss with her about co-sponsoring bills for gender equality in the House and express my gratitude for her support of Planned Parenthood. But as I was standing in line, something interesting happened. An old man came up to me, an avid, young women’s rights activist, and passionately vociferated, “You people always say women need to be liberated. Liberated from what? Liberated so they can hurt people? Liberated so they can kill innocent babies? I absolutely hate Planned Parenthood and I think you need to understand what you’re supporting.”At that moment, I realized the widespread misconceptions about Planned Parenthood. When we think of the organization, we often think of the pro-choice or anti-abortion controversy raging around America.This program is partially paid for through a federal grant program known as Title X, and this clause is a cause of controversy because many argue that the federal government should not be giving money to a program that performs abortions. However, Planned Parenthood does so much more. Planned Parenthood is about providing accessible reproductive health care to women. It’s about giving birth control and screenings for breast, ovarian, and cervical cancer to women who cannot afford it. In fact, in 2015 alone, health centers through Title X provided over 800,000 pap tests for cervical cancer, 1 million breast cancer exams, and 6 million STI tests. It provides sexual education to 1.5 million young Americans every year and prenatal care to over 17,000 women. Abortions, to be clear, only make up less than 3% of Planned Parenthood services.In January 2017, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan stated that he was for defunding the vital agency because, “We don't want to commit taxpayer funding for abortion, and Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider.”Not only is this statement unfounded, it blatantly reveals the ignorance of Washington politicians. To be clear, Federal money does not fund abortion services. Planned Parenthood is consisted of Title X and Medicaid; Title X does not allow federal funding to go toward abortions, and the 1977 Hyde Amendment dictated that Medicaid funds by government spending can only be allocated for abortions in cases of rape, incest, or if the mother’s life is in danger. Yes, 3% of Planned Parenthood services are abortions, but defunding Planned Parenthood will only take funding away from its other, vital services. So what does defunding Planned Parenthood actually mean? It means punishing low-income women, women living in rural areas, and women of color by taking away their access to reproductive healthcare. It means punishing the 1 out of every 5 women in America who rely on Planned Parenthood for accessible, preventative birth control and STD treatment. It would mean a skyrocket in teen pregnancies, as taking away many teens’ access to birth control and sexual education would mean a rise of unwanted pregnancies. Abstinence is proven to be an ineffective solution; there will inevitably be unwanted teenage pregnancies, and so there must be available resources for these teens to seek help. Planned Parenthood’s primary funding source is the government (40% of its funds come from the government), and uses all the taxpayer money it receives to protect the lives for women. This effect is starkingly evident in Texas. Five years ago, Texas drastically cut its funding for Planned Parenthood from $138 million to $38 million, and it led to devastating results that hurt women. It’s motivation for cutting funds was the same as that of Washington politicians: Texas wanted to appease anti-abortion groups. However, in a study from the Houston Chronicle, pregnancy-related deaths nearly doubled and 54% of patients in the state stopped receiving care. According to the Washington Post, 1 in 4 clinics in Texas closed, and two-thirds of those clinics were not even part of Planned Parenthood. Organizations that still remained open were unable to offer contraceptives and IUDs for patients. In counties with no clinics, there was a 36% reduction in access to IUDs and 31% reduction to access to injectable contraceptives. Many women who relied on Planned Parenthood found difficulty going to a new health care provider, as many other clinics simply did not have the resources to absorb the number of patients who originally relied on PP. If this devastating consequence already happened in Texas, do we want it to happen throughout all of America?Planned Parenthood isn’t a partisan political issue. It isn’t about supporting or opposing abortion. It’s about reproductive rights for women. It’s about human rights, and Washington needs to understand what it’s talking about when its threatening to defund Planned Parenthood.Regardless if you are pro-life or pro-choice, if you are pro-human rights, get involved. Write to your Representatives and Senators to lobby and urge them to support the continued funding of Planned Parenthood. Call Republican representatives who oppose the agency and educate them that defunding the organization means taking away healthcare for millions of women. Join marches and rallies. Use the hashtag #IStandWithPP on social media. Sign the petition against defunding on www.istandwithpp.org. Washington politicians, are you really using the defunding of Planned Parenthood, which saves millions of American women’s lives, to further the agenda of your party? Are you really willing to be against human rights for women? If so, you’ve hit a new low."

Toward the end of her long life, she held an auspicious, if lonely, place in human history. She is believed to have been the last person on Earth who was born in the 19th century: November 29, 1899.Barring planetary catastrophe, it will be some time before the last person who was born in the 20th century is gone.RELATED: A Day With the Oldest Woman to Ever Live If someone born in 1999 lives to be 117, like Morano did, that person may live to see the year 2117. Or perhaps even the 2120s, if that person reaches 122 years old: That’s still the record for longevity, held by Jeanne Calment, who was born in 1875 and died in 1997.We can’t say for sure who holds the distinction of having been the last 18th-century baby on Earth, because there’s no way to know for sure. Even when birth records were accurate, they didn’t always survive. And lots of people make embellishments about their age in either direction. We do know, however, that one of the oldest people around in the early 1900s was Margaret Ann Neve, who was born near France in 1792, three months before the execution of Marie Antoinette. George Washington was the president of the United States at the time.Neve died a month before her 111th birthday, in the springtime of 1903. By then, she’d achieved some degree of fame. She told reporters she distinctly remembered the “troubled times” of Napoleon Bonaparte’s leadership. During her honeymoon, she and her husband visited the field of Waterloo, where the famous battle had been waged just years before. There, according to newspaper accounts, she found a belt buckle from an Imperial Guard soldier.RELATED: Words of Wisdom From the World’s Oldest Man“She is sweet faced, gentle, and fair, looking like a handsome old lady of 70,” one newspaper reporter wrote in 1903. “Brave old girls! Very aged women need no longer look like hideous mummies.”Neve counted Queen Victoria of England among her friends, according to The New York Times account of Neve’s death. “Mrs. Neve never misses sending on her Majesty’s birthday a telegram of congratulation to Queen Victoria.” Victoria, in turn, had a portrait of Neve displayed in the royal summer home.Although 19th-century longevity researchers insisted there were records of people who lived to be 189 years old, and even 207 years old, our modern understanding of the human lifespan tells us that it’s still unusual to make it past 100 — let alone to 117 or 122.RELATED: Warren Buffet Wants to be the Oldest Man AliveThat hasn’t stopped people from dreaming up ways to live longer — and who can blame us? — or plotting how to escape death entirely. But until we’re able to upload our consciousness into machines or otherwise achieve immoraltity, humans are left swapping secrets on how to live longer. Centenarians always seem to have their tricks: fresh air, kindness, city strolls, sushi, cheese, sherry, pigs’ ears, or in Emma Morano’s case, raw eggs. Margaret Ann Neve had her own secret.“Mrs. Neve could note but one habit as an aid to her sustained vitality,” the Times wrote shortly after her death in 1903. “That of early rising, which the modern alienists [psychiatrists] look upon as a frequent source of insanity.”This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: When Your Child Is a Psychopath, My Family’s Slave"

I never knew I had such boundless depths of irritation in my soul. I never knew that I could care about another human being so much that my own welfare would come second. And I never knew how much my life would deviate from the path I planned out for it, how “go-with-the-flow” would become my mantra, and patience was something I’d have to practice.I knew who I was. I thought that personality set somewhere around late adolescence. Set like jello—a certain amount of give and wobble—but I thought the basic shape was there. But adolescence was only early-onset personality. The passage from childless, inherently selfish being, into mother, has been the far greater upheaval. Perhaps the moment that the blue line appears on the stick, things start to change. But by the time baby arrives, identity is suddenly thrown into disarray—features of your personality that you thought were fixed are actually just passing quirks.Firstly there’s the sheer physical challenge of being a mother, beyond the birth and the breastfeeding and the stuff you expect. I remember suddenly being able to pull myself out of a swimming pool in one movement—hey, mummy muscles! Who knew constantly lifting a baby would be like a gym workout? But in contrast, there was the shock of my first post-baby ski trip. Turns out snowboarding requires abs, and I didn’t have them anymore.I never knew that motherhood would make you think so much about your own mother. Would suddenly help you to see her as a young woman, someone who rocked an infant in her arms, breathed in the new baby smell, and dreamed of what you might grow to be. Make you wonder if this is what she hoped for you.I never knew how grateful I would be for my own mother and father, both as doting grandparents in the here and now, and in a retrospective montage of memories of all things they’d done for me that I hadn’t understood or known how to appreciate at the time. When I sat and cried on the sofa, squalling baby on my lap, cracked nipples out, it was my mother who sat next to me and told me I could do it, told me experiences she’d never told me before, about pregnancy, breastfeeding, motherhood, all of the times she’d sat and cried together with baby. She made me believe that it really would be easier after those first few weeks. When she flew back to Australia, me with a six-week-old in full colicky phase, I was struck with the sensation that I was mummy now, whether I knew how to do it or not.I never knew that being adventurous was just a phase. When I river-rafted down African rapids, snowboarded on the white flanks of a Japanese volcano, and paid good money to have someone fly me over Victoria Falls in a microlite, my eyes tightly shut the entire time, I didn’t know that I would one day wince at tall playground slides. That I would be afraid of sharp corners, terrified of cold germs, fevers and rashes, and go into strange, breathless panic attacks the first few times my schoolboy rode the subway alone.I never knew I would melt, from someone who icily disliked children into someone who makes faces at babies on the subway. Me, the same person who once bet a girl at school $100 that I’d never have children (hey Narelle, if you’re reading, tell me where to send the check)! These days I look for opportunities to hold other people’s babies, and have to remind myself that I really, really don’t want another one.I had no idea how fiercely I would love my children, and definitely no idea that love coexists with absolute irritation and frustration with them. No idea how much I would nag, disliking that scolding tone in my voice, even while I did it. I had no idea how hard it would be to give up swearing—how much I would blush when my four-year-old innocently asked “How long till this fuckin’ train gets here?” I had no idea how hard it would be to give your children age-appropriate advice, trying to save them from every hurt you ever suffered and every mistake you ever made.Thank goodness that our personalities are a work in progress, even in our thirties. That’s the thing about growing older, you get to keep changing. None of it’s fixed. And I’m feeling around the edge of all the other identities I’ll have to take on, as I continue to age. I’m going to be that woman with wrinkles. That woman whose kids move out. Maybe I’ll be someone who isn’t too tired to read in the evening, someone who has time to rediscover old hobbies, maybe learn to draw. Probably I’ll be that woman who complains that her kids don’t call often enough, to make up for all those times I’ve told them that they never stop talking. And eventually, maybe I’ll get to be a grandmother, and have the perfect excuse to hold my children’s babies, and feel that unexpected sweep of nostalgia, love and motherhood.Previously published as ‘Everything I Never Knew About Motherhood’ in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.com.For more great Wild Word essays see:Please Don’t Call Me A “Mother” by Annie Mark-WestfallWhy Autistic Children Are the Opposite of Snowflakes by Jami IngledueIs Trump Toying With The Presidency? by Maria BehanThe Love Lessons I’ve Learned as a Stepfather by James Prenatt"

While our political leaders should reflect the demographics of our country, unfortunately only 19% of Congress are women and a paltry 7.1% are women of color, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. The gap persists across our country: women of color hold only 5.9% of all state legislative seats. That’s why The New American Leaders Project (NALP), a nonpartisan organization, is training first- and second-generation immigrants to run for office—from positions on school boards and city councils to state legislatures.Stephanie Chang, a NALP alumna and Michigan native, was a youth mentor, community organizer, and an activist in the Asian American and environmental movements. Despite years of working to improve her community, serving in public office and championing legislation that would create lasting change didn’t seem like an obvious next step. In 2011, Stephanie took NALP’s candidate training on how to run for office. But even when her state representative, Rashida Tlaib, invited her to run as her successor for District 6, Stephanie was reluctant. She is not alone. When women of color don’t see people who look like us in office, we have a hard time envisioning ourselves there. In fact, political parties often discourage women of color who consider throwing their hat in the ring.But with the training under her belt and encouragement from another woman leader, Stephanie took the leap and, in 2014, won 49% of the vote in a crowded Democratic primary. Today, she’s serving her second term as the only Asian American woman in the Michigan state legislature.Stephanie is exceptional, but is not an exception. The New American Leaders Project has been training women of color to run for office for more than five years. In 2016, Isela Blanc, a Mexican American who was formerly undocumented, was elected to the Arizona state legislature, and Marisol Alcantara became the only Latina in New York’s State Senate.These women are just the tip of the iceberg. Fifty-four percent of our immigrant trainees are women, and 98 percent of them identify as women of color. And every one of our female candidates who ran for state legislature in 2016 won.But we’ve got a long way to go. That’s why, on June 9-10 in New York City, NALP will train over 100 women of color at “Ready to Rise,” our largest candidate training ever. Of these women, 30% are Asian American, 26% Latina, and 21% Black. Helping immigrant women run for office sends a powerful message: When women of color have a seat at the table, they can change the menu so it’s more inclusive and intersectional. And their voices can change the conversation to push back against the scapegoating of immigrants, vilification of Muslims, and dismissal of the issues affecting people of color. That’s never been more important than it is today."

The DCCC also has sent three field organizers to the district to increase Democratic turnout, particularly among black voters.The DCCC, House Democrats’ election fundraising arm, has stuck to a strategy of placing big bets only on seats where polling shows it can win, despite criticism from some progressive activists for not backing special election candidates earlier and more aggressively.In a statement announcing the cash infusion, DCCC spokesman Cole Leiter emphasized that Democrats were looking beyond Parnell’s race to long-term party-building efforts in the region.“This investment will help turn out – and provide key lessons on – crucial voters for South Carolina’s Fifth Congressional District and the 2018 midterms more broadly,” Leiter said. “We’re proud to make this investment in organizing staff, African-American radio, mail, digital, and other targeted voter outreach in the final weeks of this campaign, and support a candidate like Archie Parnell who will stand up and fight for the smart, responsible kind of leadership this community needs.”On Saturday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, DNC Associate Chairman Jaime Harrison and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten canvassed for Parnell to kick off the DNC’s “Resistance Summer” grassroots organizing initiative. Parnell, 66, a tax attorney, faces real estate developer and former Republican state Rep. Ralph Norman, 63, on June 20.The national Democratic Party clearly has higher hopes for Georgia’s 6th District, where voters head to the polls on the same day. The DCCC has poured more than $5 million into the campaign of Democrat Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old filmmaker, who faces Republican Karen Handel in the largely affluent, increasingly diverse suburban Atlanta district. Ossoff leads Handel by 1 percentage point, according to a recent poll.By contrast, Parnell trails his GOP opponent by 10 percentage points, according to a poll conducted by Anzalone Liszt Grove Research on behalf of Parnell’s campaign. That’s an improvement over a 16-point deficit in March, according to the same poll.Parnell, who previously held a top post at investment giant Goldman Sachs, is running a campaign focused on bread-and-butter issues that highlights ― and at times, makes light of ― his mild demeanor and expertise in the tax code.He has attacked Norman for backing an increase in the Social Security retirement age, which Parnell opposes. He also opposes the Republican health care legislation, and favors safe importation of prescription drugs.Parnell nonetheless faces a steep climb in a rural district that elected President Donald Trump by 17 percentage points in November, according to official data collected by Daily Kos and shared with HuffPost. Mulvaney defeated his Democratic challenger by more than 20 points."

Parents had until June 1 to make the necessary legal changes.Names “with a strong religious flavor, such as Jihad” or those with “connotations of holy war or of splittism [Xinjiang independence]” are no longer allowed, a local police station employee told Radio Free Asia.China is home to some 23 million Muslims, less than 2 percent of the overall population. Many Chinese Muslims face daily Islamophobia in the officially atheist country.“In the beginning, people didn’t understand me. They made me go for psychological counseling,” said Ye Qingfang, a Chinese Muslim woman interviewed by BBC, of her experience converting to Islam. “They asked if I was manipulated by evil groups or had any connection with them.”Several recent attacks ― including a 2014 terrorist attack in a Kunming train station by a knife-wielding group that killed 31 people and injured 141― resulted in a surge of anti-Muslim sentiment. The government has blamed the Uyghur population for extremist attacks. Xinjiang has witnessed sporadic bouts of violence, but activists argue most incidents are a result of local grievances and not international terrorist activity, as Chinese officials have claimed. Uyghur-rights groups also say the government has cracked down on the ethnic community’s religious and cultural activities.In May, authorities in the Xinjiang region began confiscating all Qurans published before 2012 due to perceived “extremist content.” Officials have also banned “abnormal” beards and face veils as part of ongoing “anti-extremism” measures."

Uber board member Arianna Huffington, the former editor-in-chief of HuffPost, is helping oversee Holder’s probe. That investigation has concluded, but has yet to be publicly addressed.In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler detailed her experiences at the company in a revealing blog post, describing what she says was a nightmarish, sexist work environment.Fowler wrote that her superior propositioned her for sex. When she reported the incident to Uber HR, Fowler says her claims were dismissed and she was instructed to either find another team to work for or accept negative performance reviews in the future.The post prompted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to call for an internal investigation.On Monday, Uber human resources chief Liane Hornsey told USA Today the greatest sources of internal dissatisfaction at the company are pay and pride, not sexual harassment.“[Fowler’s] blog shocked me,” Hornsey said. “But, what did surprise me, was when I did the listening sessions, this didn’t come up as an issue. It wasn’t one of our big themes. Other things came up that are in that area, that our values are masculine and a little aggressive, but the harassment issue, I just didn’t find that at all.”Fowler criticized Hornsey’s findings on Twitter as “more of the same old gaslighting from Uber HR.” The former Uber engineer also used Tuesday’s firings to cast doubt on the company’s ability to scrutinize itself.Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5936ed4c2200002d00c6c94f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lindsey Stirling has accomplished quite a bit in her relatively short time in the music industry. The former “America’s Got Talent” contestant has already released three albums, written a book and most recently released a tour documentary. But there’s still a lot on her bucket list, including one thing she’ll get to check off very soon. The electronic violinist is the midst of working on a Christmas album, with plans to release it before the end of the year. She’s been watching some holiday movies, including “Home Alone,” to get into the spirit. And once she enters the studio, Stirling plans to decorate it with Christmas decorations. She plans to record mostly holiday classics and has started dreaming up singers and musicians she’d love to work with on the album. “You only get a month to listen to your favorite Christmas songs … But I’m probably going to do at least two original songs,” she told HuffPost at Build Series. Also in the works is a holiday tour. Stirling’s booking agent has already plotted some tour dates for later this year. In addition to a Christmas album, Stirling has dreams of setting up shop in Sin City at some point in her career.“Honestly, at the very top of my bucket list is to have a Vegas show someday. I’d love that … Then I could be a good mom and I could have my kids and school and not have to steal them to take them on the road all the time,” she said.That said, touring is one of Stirling’s favorite aspects of being a performer. She calls it a “second home” ― between her “tour family” and her fans.Stirling’s love for the road and performing comes through in her new YouTube Red documentary, which documents Stirling’s worldwide tour behind her third studio album, “Brave Enough.” In it, you see her experience the ups and downs of life, including dealing with the loss of her keyboardist Jason Gaviati and learning that her father, who died earlier this year, has Stage 4 cancer. But through it all, there’s a sense of hope, passion and positivity. That’s due in part, she says, to her fans.“My fans have been there for me in a very real way,” Stirling said. “And some days, you see in the documentary that I get really bad news about [my] dad’s health. I’ll literally be there crying in the dressing room and I have to get ready for a meet-and-greet. And my hope as an artist is that I can uplift people and that they can come to my show and escape whatever they’re going through, whatever their bad day is ... By being there and seeing people’s smiles, I’m there trying to be there for them, but they end up lifting me quite a bit and giving me the strength to go and do a show.”For more from our interview with Stirling, check out the entire Build Series video below.

32,POLITICS,Trump Administration Could Permit Oil Companies To ‘Assault' Marine Life,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-seismic-testing-oil-drilling_us_59358f20e4b0099e7fae0045,Experts say seismic testing to find drill sites could harm thousands of animals and affect coastal communities.,2017-06-06,Scientists fear seismic blasting could drive North Atlantic right whales into extinction.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5935ed4f1d00002900cc1518.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Trump administration took a major step forward Monday in its pledge to expand offshore oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic Ocean by greenlighting a process that could wreak havoc on marine life and coastal communities, scientists say.The National Marine Fisheries Service drafted five Incidental Harassment Authorizations, which would let five drilling companies “injure or disturb” fish and marine mammals as the companies search for oil and gas deposits off the East Coast for a one-year period.Seismic surveying involves mapping fossil fuel reserves deep beneath the ocean’s surface by firing extremely loud bursts of compressed air through the water. The blasts can travel hundreds of miles and occur every 10 to 12 seconds for weeks or even months.“Seismic testing is the precursor to drilling,” Michael Jasny, the director of the National Resources Defense Council’s Marine Mammal Protection Project, told reporters during a press call Monday. “But seismic [testing] alone is a serious assault on our coast and oceans.” Marine biologists and environmental advocacy groups warn the dynamite-like noise could threaten vulnerable marine ecosystems and wildlife, especially the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, of which only about 500 remain.Dr. Doug Nowacek, a marine scientist at Duke University, said mother-calf pairs of these whales use very quiet vocalizations to maintain contact and affect nursing behavior.“We are quite concerned that further increases in anthropogenic noise from seismic surveys or other things could disrupt this vital behavior and separate calves ... from their mothers,” Nowacek said in his call.In 2015, 75 marine scientists, including Nowacek, warned that seismic surveying off the East Coast would likely have “significant, long-lasting and widespread impacts” on the survival of fish and marine mammal populations in the area.But scientists say animals aren’t the only populations at risk from seismic blasting. The process can substantially reduce catch rates for fish, according to Nowacek, harming the multibillion-dollar commercial and recreational fishing industries.“The fact is that seismic blasting and the drilling that follows represent a serious threat to the coast and oceans and the communities that depend on them,” Jasny said. “It makes no sense to risk these jobs-intensive industries, our beaches, our marine environment and our clean energy future for the sake of big oil profits.”The approval follows President Donald Trump’s executive order in April to expand offshore energy drilling by rolling back the Obama administration’s rejection of the permits in January, part of an attempt to ban oil and gas drilling off the East Coast for at least five years.Authorization of the permits will face a 30-day public comment period. If approved, Jasny predicts, the five companies could begin seismic surveying as early as this fall.The fisheries service is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which falls under Secretary Wilbur Ross’ Commerce Department.If you’d like to comment on the permits, you can do so here."
33,POLITICS,Donald Trump May Find Time To Live-Tweet James Comey's Testimony,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-tweet-comey_us_5936f8aae4b013c4816bc658,This could get interesting.,2017-06-06,"Just on Tuesday morning, Trump re-tweeted two clips from ""Fox and Friends.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5937042519000047003e4d07.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump may live-tweet fired FBI Director James Comey’s highly anticipated Senate testimony on Thursday, pursuing a habit that frequently causes trouble for his administration.Trump will weigh in “if he feels the need to respond” to anything Comey says, The Washington Post’s Robert Costa reported on Tuesday.“I was just talking to some White House officials this morning and their view is that the president himself wants to be the messenger, his own warrior, his own lawyer, his own spokesman,” Costa said on MSNBC. “The president is expected to be tweeting on Thursday in response to Comey, not to stay quiet during the testimony, because he himself wants to be the one driving the process.”When asked if Trump would be watching the hearing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who frequently defends his boss’ unhinged ramblings, demurred.“It’s going to be a very busy day, as all of his days are,” Spicer said during the daily White House press briefing.Trump will give a speech at a conservative conference in Washington on Thursday at 11:30 a.m. ― during Comey’s hearing. But it would be unsurprising for him to tune in to Comey’s testimony before or after the speech with unfiltered commentary on Twitter.The president regularly watches cable news shows, and often cites them in his early-morning Twitter rants. He seems to follow Trump-friendly “Fox and Friends” closely, often tweeting arguments made on the program almost verbatim and re-tweeting from the show’s Twitter account.The White House has had difficulty defending Trump’s Twitter activity. At times, his aides claim the tweets are “official statements” that allow the president to be “an effective messenger for his agenda.” But they also distance themselves by dismissing the meanderings as just “social media.” Spicer on Tuesday said the tweets “are considered official statements by the president of the United States.” A day earlier, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Twitter gives Trump a “communications tool that isn’t filtered through media bias.” In the same sentence, she claimed that “the media obsesses over every period, dot.”White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday criticized the media for “this obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little what he does as president.” Trump’s regularly uses Twitter to lash out at lawmakers, the courts, the media and diplomatic allies, among others.Sometimes, his tweets land him in legal and political trouble. His rants this week promoting his executive order banning travel and immigration from six majority-Muslim countries could hurt him in the ongoing legal proceedings against the order, as several courts have already used his statements as evidence to halt the ban. If Trump does end up tweeting during Comey’s testimony on Thursday, creating more trouble for his administration, expect Spicer to offer this defense: The “tweet speaks for itself.” "

In a new op-ed, the dystopian author says she’s also keen on tackling a devastating problem that much of the world is barely talking about: plastic waste.Atwood writes in her piece, published in The Guardian on Saturday, that she considers plastics the “modern equivalent of a universal religion.” “We worship them, whether we admit it or not,” she explains. “Their centre is whatever you happen to be doing, their circumference is everywhere; they’re as essential to our modern lives as the air we breathe, and they’re killing us. They must be stopped.”In Atwood’s lifetime, the world went from barely using any plastic to being unable to live without it. Plastic is cheap, and can be found in pretty much everything we use ― from clothing to diapers to shopping bags. We just as readily discard these products without thinking twice, which leads to the dumping of billions of pounds of plastic waste in oceans. While the scope of the issue ― and its effect on living beings ― is difficult to calculate, environmentalists are gravely concerned.If we don’t change our consumption habits, by 2050 there will be more plastics in the ocean than fish by weight, according to a report from the from the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.Animals are mistaking plastic for food, and are getting seriously injured – or dying – after becoming entangled in discarded trash. Human health risks associated with plastics may be enormous. Scientists haven’t settled on exactly how these substances affect humans, but numerous studies suggest that chemicals in plastics may be linked to birth defects, diabetes, cancer and infertility. Microfibers ― which shed from synthetic clothing ― make their way from washing machines, to natural bodies of water and into the tissues of marine life. How this will affect fish, and the people who consume them, is still unknown.Microplastic particles are affecting marine algae, which is the “basic building block of oceanic life,” Atwood adds. Marine algae are responsible for making about 70 percent of the oxygen we breathe. Destroying them could mean killing ourselves.Atwood outlines a three-point plan to address the issue, calling for reforms that advocacy groups and environmentalists have long promoted.She wants organic and biodegradable replacements for plastic products. That’s a critical one, considering how long it takes for plastic items to decompose. A plastic bag, for example, often used for one shopping trip and then immediately thrown out, takes 10 to 20 years to decompose.Atwood wants the industry to devise methods to collect plastics before they reach the oceans and filter plastics out of seawater. Such robust systems exist in developed nations like the U.S., but not as much in developing nations. Finally, plastic products need to be broken down into their basic parts. This is crucial, especially considering how much plastic packaging can’t be recycled. They’re often made from multiple layers of materials, and the recyclable components can’t be separated out. A number of activists and environmental groups are already working on some of the action items Atwood raised.Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke, who made his fortune in offshore drilling, is donating most of his wealth to cleaning up the oceans. In 2020, in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund Norway, he’ll be launching a massive yacht, which will collect 5 tons of plastic a day. The researchers on board will work to identify plastic alternatives and develop ways to keep plastics from entering the ocean.These are the types of reforms that give Atwood hope.“We may yet save ourselves from being plasticised to death,” she writes."

Trump’s brazen comments Tuesday were the latest in a series of diplomatic moves that have antagonized foreign governments and thrown into question some of the U.S.’ longest and strongest alliances.“Fundamentally, Trump in the last 4½ months has demonstrated that he doesn’t understand or doesn’t care how America has engaged the world for the last 70 years,” former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder told HuffPost.Trump’s attack on Qatar came just a day after the president embroiled himself in a diplomatic spat with Britain by lashing out at London Mayor Sadiq Khan in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on the city. While leaders from around the world rushed to express their condolences and support, Trump instead repeatedly slammed Khan for urging Londoners to remain calm. Trump also used the terrorist attack to argue for the need of his court-halted executive order to temporarily bar citizens of six Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the U.S.Trump’s rhetoric forced British Prime Minister Theresa May, who has faced repeated criticism for being too tolerant of the U.S. leader, to come to Khan’s defense. Other British politicians also publicly supported the London mayor, who has argued that the British government should cancel Trump’s upcoming state visit to the U.K.Although Trump and Khan’s public animosity was one of the most visible examples of the president conflicting with traditional friends, behind-the-scenes reports about Trump’s recent visit to Europe highlight just how many allies have found themselves at odds with the U.S. president. According to meeting notes seen by German news outlet Der Spiegel, leaders from G7 countries, including France, Germany and Canada, all privately implored Trump during the meetings in Europe to recognize how instrumental the Paris climate accord was to international cooperation. Trump remained unmoved, resulting in an exasperated French President Emmanuel Macron declaring, “Now China leads.” During that same visit, Trump baffled NATO allies by refusing to reaffirm his commitment to Article 5 of the alliance ― which stipulates that member states have to come to the aid of allies under attack (Article 5 has been invoked only once ― by the U.S.). Trump also publicly chastised other member states for what he sees as their failure to contribute sufficient amounts of their gross domestic product (GDP) to the defense alliance. Trump’s refusal to reaffirm Article 5 and monomaniacal focus on GDP contributions highlight that he has the potential to undermine decades-long cooperation that has been vital to U.S. and European interests, according to Daalder.“We have built up through our global engagement a set of institutions that have been built on trust, fundamentally on trust, where allies had trust in the United States to do the right thing when it really came down to it,” Daalder said.“That trust is broken, and it’s broken because of the kinds of things he has done and not done, said and not said.”There had been hints of how Trump was willing to create conflict with U.S. allies early on in his term. Just weeks after being sworn in, the president picked a fight with Australia Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto during what were supposed to be cursory post-inauguration phone calls. Many hoped that Trump wouldn’t make the same mistakes with a foreign policy team in place. However, five months into his terms it appears that the president is willing to disregard the advice of the experts surrounding him, including national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.In the case of this week’s diplomatic flare-up in the Middle East, Mattis and Tillerson had both expressed hope the tension between Qatar and the United Arab Emirates would be resolved soon. According to Politico, Trump’s national security team was also blindsided by his belligerent NATO speech. Trump’s volatility when it comes to international alliances and agreements has already had far-reaching implications.In the past weeks, the leaders of some of America’s most powerful traditional allies have signaled they perceive a fundamental change in the United States’ role in the world and are willing to change their policies accordingly. “[Trump] seems to be fine being alone, and it may have benefits in the short term. But in the long term it’s going to cost us,” Daalder said. “In acting as if you can’t trust anybody else in the world, no one will trust the United States.”Hours before Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, European leaders put out a joint statement with China to reaffirm their commitment to its goals. “Now is the time to further strengthen these ties to keep the wheels turning for ambitious global climate action,” said Miguel Arias Cañete, the European Union’s commissioner on climate action and energy. In a speech days after Trump’s NATO address, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also told supporters that Europe must become more self-reliant as the U.S. policy shifts. “The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I’ve experienced that in the last few days,” Merkel said, hinting at her experiences at the NATO summit. “We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands.”Canada’s foreign affairs minister echoed that assessment Tuesday, vowing her country will make a “substantial investment” in its own military as the U.S. gives up its international leadership role “The fact that our friend and ally has come to question the very worth of its mantle of global leadership puts in sharper focus for the rest of us to set our own clear and sovereign course,” Chrystia Freeland told the House of Commons on Tuesday. “To say this is not controversial: It is a fact”As countries consider what their options may be in the face of shifting U.S. priorities, there is also the possibility that some nations will seek to exploit the rifts in international relations to benefit themselves.

38,ARTS & CULTURE,A 'Harry Potter' Superfan And A NASA Engineer Are Creating A Real 'Leaky Cauldron',Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harry-potter-magical-cauldron-pub-london_us_5935b538e4b0cfcda916bb74,Here's one Kickstarter that Rowling fans won't want to skip out on.,2017-06-06,"A ""magic"" pub like this ""Harry Potter"" favorite may be coming to England.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5936fdfe2200002d00c6c994.png?ops=crop_148_0_1088_720%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A pub seemingly operating on pure magic may be coming soon to some tucked-away spot on a London street ― but only if enough muggles pay attention to its founder’s bid for funding.Self-proclaimed book nerd Matthew Cortland, with help from NASA engineer friend Travis Davis, aims to create an enchanted atmosphere at The Cauldron Wizarding Pub & Inn dotted with floating candles. Pint glasses will fill mysteriously from the bottom. Lights and taps will go on and off with a flick of a wand. Pictures won’t stay still in their frames.The project almost shares a name with The Leaky Cauldron, the pub on Charing Cross Road that appears to non-wizarding folk as a dusty old shop. Due to licensing issues, it will need to avoid explicitly using the name “Harry Potter” or other direct references to the series. The $500,000 fundraiser, however, goes live on Kickstarter beginning June 26, the day Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was published in 1997.The “inn” portion of The Cauldron Wizarding Pub & Inn will also be contingent on the final amount raised. As it should be, creating a pub is the founder’s Priority No. 1. Cortland told HuffPost in an email that he’ll draw inspiration from an array of magical worlds brought to life in novels by J.K. Rowling, J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, using smart home technology to make it happen. Magnets, for example, can explain the candles. (We’re still iffy, though, on what explains magnets.) He also plans to host a series of hackathon events to “refine” the pub’s technology ― and also to figure out what, exactly, to serve.A house beer dubbed Cauldron Ale will be sourced from a local brewer, Cortland said, and fans are also free to make other serving suggestions through a wiki page. Butterbeer, unfortunately, is likely off-limits due to licensing. As a former teacher, Cortland said he aims to open up The Cauldron to school groups in order to encourage an interest in S.T.E.M. subjects ― and foster an appreciation for literature. In perhaps the best homage to the pub’s source material, the place will also be lined with books, with visitors encouraged to bring a copy of their own favorite childhood story. Cortland has partnered with the Harry Potter Alliance’s “Accio Books” campaign to donate those books to schools.The New Jersey native, who now lives in Dublin, noted that London is the perfect place for the fantastical project since so many beloved works in the genre pull aesthetically from the city. The pub itself will be modeled after one of his real-life favorites ― John Kavanagh in Dublin, the pub alongside Glasnevin Cemetery known locally as “Gravediggers.”“It’s been around since 1833 and is a traditional old-man pub with scrubbed wooden floors, sturdy tables, a cozy atmosphere and excellent Guinness,” Cortland wrote, noting that The Cauldron, in London, would also draw from traditional British pubs.“We just want The Cauldron to be a place of community for the extended fandom, and we will host book signings, book readings, meet-ups, pub trivia nights, fundraisers and movie nights,” he wrote. “Basically we want to be a place of meeting and happiness, and as one of the world’s great cities, London is perfect.”For more information, head to The Cauldron’s website.From June 1 to 30, HuffPost is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the very first “Harry Potter” book by reminiscing about all things Hogwarts. Accio childhood memories."

40,STYLE,An American Beauty Brand Just Released A Line Of Nail Polish For Muslim Women,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/muslim-girl-orly-halal-nail-polish_us_593594afe4b0099e7fae0e1c,ORLY's #HalalPaint claims to be water permeable and prayer-friendly.,2017-06-06,ORLY claims the nail polishes in this collection are water permeable.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5936f3a419000036003e4cb7.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Beauty and fashion brands are increasingly looking for ways to cater to Muslim clientele ― a move that makes sense, since globally, Islam is the fasting growing major religion in the world. As part of that trend, the Los Angeles-based nail polish company ORLY has teamed up with MuslimGirl.com, a lifestyle website for Muslim women, to release a limited-edition collection of six nail polishes. #HalalPaint, which debuted during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, features nail polishes that are made from 100 percent halal ingredients. The Arabic word “halal” simply means permissible, and is used to denote items that fit within various religious requirements.In the case of nail polish, this means that the ORLY polishes are permeable to water and air. This is important because of a ritual washing, called wudhu, that Muslims perform before prayers.As part of the ritual, Muslims are instructed to wash their hands and arms, up to the elbow. Water must reach all parts of the hands. Some Muslim women forego wearing nail polish because they are concerned it may interfere with this requirement, since it may act as a barrier and prevent water from reaching their nails. For those who have this concern, “halal” nail polish is a potential solution.#HalalPaint’s “breathable” technology reportedly makes it possible for both oxygen and water to pass through the layer of paint on a molecular level. ORLY also claims the formula results in longer wear and less chipping, and eliminates the need for basecoats or topcoats. It’s also infused with nutrients like argan oil and vitamin C.ORLY certainly isn’t the first company to produce halal nail polish. Other brands, such as Poland-based Inglot Cosmetics and the Canadian company Tuesday in Love, have also created nail polishes they claim are water permeable. Islamic scholars have had varied responses to halal nail polishes ― from those who are cautiously optimistic about the trend, to those who are concerned that these polishes may invalidate the ritual washing before prayer. To be absolutely certain they’re not doing so, some Muslim women choose to only wear nail polish during their periods, when they are not required to pray. Others wear water permeable nail polish during prayer, and think of the trend as an interesting new way to adhere to their faith.#HalalPaint claims it is certified halal by the Islamic Society of The Washington Area.MuslimGirl.com’s chief of staff Azmia Magane said she feels the collection is important because it highlights an American beauty brand’s desire to cater to Muslim women.“This line is important because there are so many girls and young women who aren’t represented in mainstream beauty. They either don’t fit that definition or see things about them that are designed without them, instead of for them and by them,” MuslimGirl.com chief of staff Azmia Magane said in a press release. “This is our way of bridging that gap.”#HalalPaint’s polishes were given names that would be instantly recognizable to American Muslim women ― including titles that cheekily play with common Muslim names, like “What the Fatima?”, “Ig-Noor the Haters,” and “The Perfect Amani-cure.”“Many of us are the girls who could never find our names on a keychain, so we wanted to make sure we provided that experience through this collection,” MuslimGirl.com founder Amani Al-Khatahtbeh said in the release.The collection of six nail polishes is selling for $49 (plus shipping and taxes) at www.halalpaint.com."
41,POLITICS,Betsy DeVos: It Is Not The Education Department's Job To Protect LGBTQ Students,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/betsy-devos-lgbtq-students_us_5936c878e4b013c4816b4ebc,The education secretary faced intense questioning in a Senate hearing about whether she would stand up for the civil rights of students.,2017-06-06,"Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos prepares to testify before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education on Tuesday morning.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5936c95819000036003e4bcc.jpeg?cache=oVoPa2mS0y&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Tuesday that her agency would not give federal funds to private schools that defy federal antidiscrimination laws. However, she suggested it is not the Department of Education’s job to prevent discrimination against students in cases in which federal antidiscrimination laws are murky, such as with LGBTQ students.DeVos took part in a contentious hearing before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education on Tuesday morning. There, Democrats and Republicans hammered the secretary on the administration’s proposed budget, which would cut billions of dollars in funding for public education while increasing money to support school choice programs. The budget directs some of this funding toward helping students attend private and religious schools. While under questioning from Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), DeVos wouldn’t definitively say whether private schools receiving federal funds would be punished for religious discrimination or discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer students. She maintained that these schools would be required to follow federal antidiscrimination laws, but said the Department of Education would not be issuing any directives beyond that. “On areas where the law is unsettled, this department is not going to be issuing decrees. That is a matter for Congress and the courts to settle,” DeVos said, when pressed by Merkley.“I think you just said where it’s unsettled, such discrimination will continue to be allowed under your program. If that’s incorrect, please correct it for the record,” Merkley replied, then went on to ask about religious discrimination.DeVos gave an unspecific answer again: “Schools that receive federal funds will follow federal law, period.” In response, Merkley said DeVos had dodged the question. “I think that’s very important for the public to know, that today, the secretary of education, before this committee, refused to affirm that she would put forward a program that would ban discrimination based on LGBTQ status of students or would ban discrimination based on religion,” he said.“Discrimination in any form is wrong. I don’t support discrimination in any form,” DeVos replied.Students with disabilities receive protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other federal rules protect students against racial and gender discrimination in schools, Education Week reports. In the past, some schools participating in state-level voucher programs have used public money to bar LGBTQ students or turn away students with special needs. Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) also pressed DeVos on these issues Tuesday. The secretary repeated a familiar refrain: “Any school that accepts federal funds, will follow federal laws, period, without discrimination.”Several weeks ago, DeVos faced a similar line of questioning while appearing before a House Appropriations subcommittee. In that exchange, Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) asked DeVos if her department would intervene in cases where federally funded private schools try to ban LGBTQ students. In response, DeVos said that states should have the flexibility to determine rules of admission for private school choice programs.“The bottom line is we believe that parents are the best equipped to make choices for their children’s schooling and education decisions,” DeVos said at the time. “States and local communities are best equipped to make these decisions and framework.”DeVos’ responses also received some praise in Tuesday’s Senate hearing. Subcommittee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told DeVos that it is not her job “to decide what the federal law says, if it’s murky. ... That’s the job of either the courts or the Congress, not the Department of Education. I think that’s what I hear you repeatedly saying and I agree with that.”DeVos has faced widespread opposition from civil rights groups and groups advocating for LGBTQ students. On Monday, a small group of prominent civil rights leaders spoke out against DeVos in anticipation of the budget hearing.“Secretary DeVos’ withdrawal of lifesaving guidance supporting transgender students has already been repudiated by the courts. Her recent statements that she would let private schools openly discriminate with federal dollars are unacceptable,” Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a statement Monday.

42,POLITICS,Turkey Lobbying Texas Legislature To Go After Gulen-Connected Schools,"OpenSecrets Blog, ContributorPublished by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turkey-lobbying-texas-legislature-to-go-after-gulen_us_5937013ce4b04331b6694a19,"by Ashley Balcerzak There isn’t much Turkey wouldn’t do to go after Fethullah Gulen, the controversial cleric Turkish leader",2017-06-06,<p>Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames cleric Fethullah Gulen for a failed coup attempt in 2016.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5937016d2200001500c6c99d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"by Ashley BalcerzakThere isn’t much Turkey wouldn’t do to go after Fethullah Gulen, the controversial cleric Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames for a failed coup in 2016.Last fall, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Turkish officials reportedly considered going beyond trying to convince the U.S. to extradite Gulen, who lives in exile in Pennsylvania: They discussed “a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away,” James Woolsey, a Flynn Intel Group board member and former CIA director, told the Wall Street Journal.But the plot gets as granular as agents lobbying Texas legislators to pass bills forcing charter schools in the state to be more transparent, according to a Justice Department filing from the end of May.Why Texas? That’s where Harmony Public Schools is headquartered, a charter school system that Turkey alleges is a cog in a vast network tied to the controversial cleric Fethullah Gulen. Harmony has denied the claim, but a number of individuals associated with the schools are followers of Gulen. And they’re quite active in politics: A CRP analysis found that 20 Harmony employees or vendors donated more than $350,000 at the federal level in the last three elections, $255,000 of which went to liberals. This group gave more than $110,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, $50,000 to former President Obama’s joint fundraising committee and $42,000 to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas). They also contributed to state politicians.Last July, the Turkish government filed a complaint with the Texas Education Agency, alleging Harmony abused public money, used discriminatory hiring practices and favored certain vendors in violation of competitive bidding rules. The agency dismissed the complaint in October, saying it didn’t warrant an investigation.Reports indicate that some Gulen-connected schools, including some in Ohio, are under FBI investigation, though the scope of the investigation is unclear.Amsterdam & Partners, which was hired to file the complaint, subcontracted the legislative angle to Arnold Public Affairs, the firm listed on the Justice Department’s Foreign Agents Registration Act filing. Arnold Public Affairs was hired last April on a $20,000 monthly contract, which dropped to $15,000 in January.According to principal Jim Arnold, his firm is promoting legislation that would require charter school meetings to be streamed and posted online, as well as to disclose additional information about their business transactions in their annual financial reports. The firm met with lawmakers, widely circulated a derogatory media story to them and their staffs and filed cards of support, meaning they publicly endorsed the legislation.“Transparency is good, whether for public schools and charter schools, and there isn’t much transparency in the business that Harmony conducts,” Arnold said. “That was the purpose of these bills. Anything we can do to shed some light on the interconnected network and transactions… Harmony is the largest charter school network in Texas and is connected to Gulen.”Harmony Public Schools did not return multiple calls seeking comment.Neither bill made it to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk. Texas’ legislative session is over, but the firm is working with legislators to try to tack some parts of the bills onto other measures as amendments before June 18, the deadline for the governor to sign or veto a bill.But the association representing 90 percent of Texas charter schools, including Harmony, says reporting requirements are already stringent.“We are subject to the same open meetings act and public information act requirements as public schools,” said Christine Isett, director of communications for the Texas Charter School Association. “All of our information is transparent.” Currently schools with more than 10,000 students are required to post videos of their meetings online seven days after the event takes place, but most schools are much smaller than that.The Turkish government has mentioned Gulen in almost 20 FARA filings in the past two years, according to a CRP analysis. Amsterdam & Partners contacted the press, state legislators and the Texas attorney general about Harmony and Gulen’s alleged role in the attempted coup.Flynn’s firm, Flynn Intel Group, had been working on convincing the U.S. government to extradite Gulen. The firm closed last November. Flynn Intel Group also earned more than $500,000 to create an anti-Gulen documentary, according to The Wall Street Journal. A reporter working on the film said he was told to hide the Flynn firm’s involvement in the project."

In 2016, the world faced the largest humanitarian and refugee crisis since World War II – 4.8 million refugees and 6.6 million IDPs (internally displaced persons) from the conflict in Syria alone. Now, less than one year later, extreme hunger and famine is ravaging Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, and northwest Nigeria as more than 20 million people face the threat of starvation and famine. Drought and other natural conditions have played a role, but for the most part we have mankind rather than Mother Nature to blame. This crisis reflects the humanitarian consequences of violence and fragility. Weak and fragile states not only fuel conflict and instability but also promote a cascade of other security challenges – terrorist safe-havens, international crime, malign influence of regional powers and even health and humanitarian disasters. Fractured authority, ongoing violence and limited capacity not only spawn these crises, they also hinder effective responses by the national governments and the international community. Yet, as these crises escalate the United States and the international community may have little choice but to engage and intervene to prevent further deterioration. Unfortunately, the devastating famine spreading across East Africa may be the next crisis that can no longer be ignored. So if traditional approaches won’t work, or at least can’t work in time, what is to be done?A new report by the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies examines how the United States can work within the constraints of fragile environments to address pressing security threats and objectives and meet urgent security and humanitarian needs. The study defines and characterizes operating environments based on gaps in authority, security and capacity that emanate from state fragility and identifies key tools that allow the U.S. government to operate effectively in these environments when responding to national security crises or challenges.The report focuses on five functional security imperatives – humanitarian emergencies, terrorism and violent extremism, great power aggression, health security crises, and international criminal violence – and illustrates each imperative through regionally or subnational defined operating environments – namely, Syria-Iraq, Libya, eastern Ukraine, West Africa, and Mexico, respectively. Even though each crisis is unique, there are overlapping challenges and recommendations for operating that cut across security imperatives. These commonalities can be used to develop response tools and mechanisms tailored for current or future crises, like the famine spreading through Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria. It’s not clear how long the world can watch and do nothing. This crisis is not just a humanitarian disaster; the implications are far greater. The confluence of violence and fragility combined with the unfolding humanitarian dimension of the crisis is cascading instability throughout the region, weakening already unstable central governments, fueling the fragmentation of authority, and feeding terrorist safe havens. The complex and violent region makes it exceedingly difficult for the United States and its partners to reach vulnerable populations. These states cannot absorb the shock of major events, natural or manmade, without risking a broader systemic collapse. The U.S. has a significant security interest in addressing the rapidly spreading humanitarian crisis to prevent further destabilization, and to supplement ongoing military and development investments in the region.The affected region is characterized by fractured authority, active conflict, and extremely weak economic capacity. National governments in Yemen, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Somalia do not maintain control or authority over their territories. Active conflict permeates the region – civil wars rage in Yemen and South Sudan while Nigeria and Somalia face active insurgencies from Boko Haram and Al-Shabab. Infrastructure and basic services are not available to vulnerable civilian populations, and the ongoing conflicts obstruct access to basic services for much of the populations. The hunger crisis illuminates long-term challenges shaping the international community. The growing scale, complexity, and duration of crises are taxing the international system both at the point of service and the periphery. The frequency and duration of these crises are stretching available human and financial resources at both the national and international levels. Political fragmentation, weak state institutions, and corruption pervade throughout the region leaving areas with fractured or no central authority and limited governmental willingness or ability to provide basic services to populations. Intentional targeting of humanitarian and health workers has occurred in all the countries affected by the food crisis. International laws and norms designed to protect civilians and preserve humanitarian access have collapsed as the severity and frequency of attacks against civilians, health workers, and health facilities have increased. Delivering aid and assistance places workers at extreme risk and limits the number of international actors that are operating in the areas of greatest concern. Despite these significant challenges, there are areas of opportunity, key tools and steps that can be taken to offset or circumvent operational challenges and offer pathways for responding to the crisis. Resources are obviously key but money alone won’t solve the problem. The greatest challenge is delivering and getting resources directly to the problem. There are several pathways for mitigating the broader access challenges.Go local. The U.S. and international humanitarian actors involved in the response must utilize local partners to gain access to communities and provide space for negotiating aid provision. The U.S. and international actors must work with community leaders and authority structures to negotiate agreements for delivery. These types of crises are not going away, and they do directly impact U.S. national security interests. Success depends on adapting and expanding the traditional toolbox.Rebecca Hersman is Director, CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI), and Senior Adviser, CSIS International Security ProgramSarah Minot is Research Associate and Program Manager, CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI)"

She is wearing a grey blazer and is leaning into her microphone.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593713771900001b003e4d4f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Alongside the breaking news that water is wet, the Earth is round and President Trump is a racist, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’ testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee made headlines today when she refused to say that her department would protect LGBT students or other protected minority classes, calling the issue “unsettled law.” Apparently, this stance came as a shock (or at least a subject for outrage) in some progressive corners of the internet, with people voicing emotions ranging from disappointment to disbelief that the Secretary was unwilling to back Title IX.I’m honestly baffled that anyone is caught off guard by this move. It never ceases to amaze me how many news outlets and commentators are consistently and dramatically stunned every time DeVos and her partners in the Trump administration do exactly what they said they would. Nothing about DeVos’ inexperience, ideological commitments, or general disregard for minority populations was exactly a secret. You could read the woman’s Wikipedia biography and know that she was a grossly unqualified, unsympathetic individual. When she showed us who she was, to paraphrase Maya Angelou, I believed her. And it’s time everyone else started believing her too so we can stop being fake outraged and do something about it.Mind you, DeVos’ policy stances aren’t exactly an anomaly. LGBT students haven’t been protected under Title IX all that long - only a few years ago the Department issued a clarification letter incorporating protections for our community into existing legal frameworks. If history is any indication, the legal push and pull in terms of incorporating and accepting these policies will be long and drawn out. Any well intentioned federal policy designed to protect the rights of students to a fair and equal education - school desegregation, anti-sexual violence policies - have all been subject to decades of legal battles that still rage on to this day. DeVos’ stance isn’t the death knell for these policies, just like Arne Duncan’s and John King Jr.’s support for them didn’t guarantee their sustained existence.Another key component of this issue is the disconnect and lack of communication between interest groups and advocacy organizations whose work should be dovetailing on these issues. The Human Rights Campaign has focused its attention mostly on K-12 schools, fighting for protections for LGBT students in those environments, while anti-rape organizations like Know Your IX and End Rape on Campus have primarily concentrated solely on colleges and universities, the latter often sticking solely to Title IX’s isolated role in adjudicating sexual violations.As Attorney General Sessions and Secretary DeVos have heightened their attack on these policies, the gap between these two groups of organizations has increased. The Human Rights Campaign has moved increasingly towards a respectability politics of elite, apolitical gay and bisexual celebrities and politicians and away from policies designed to increase welfare, end homelessness, or treat the HIV epidemic, most profoundly seen in minority communities. Anti-rape organizations have entrenched their work more deeply in the college sphere, and have often spent more of their time trying to distance themselves from any and all forms of punishment for perpetrators - arguing that issuing punishment for the minuscule number of perpetrators who are convicted of their crimes threatens to tip the criminal justice system further in the direction of racially-motivated mandatory minimum sentencing, like the ones created exclusively for low level drug offenses and not for rape - rather than addressing the root issues of the epidemic (see here and here).The result is two separate constituencies, both of which purport to represent myself and many others, diverging on solutions and rectifications rather than converging. As DeVos and her supporters begin to clamp down with an iron fist on specific, targeted populations, the groups that are supposed to be standing up to them are instead distracted, pooling resources and time into figuring out the opposition’s strategy - not realizing it’s already been spelled out in black and white.It’s clear that Betsy DeVos is not going to stand up for LGBT students, or any others who are protected by Title IX. But right now, it’s not clear that the groups who have literally made it their business to do so are going to either, at least not quickly enough to make much of a difference. In some sense, DeVos is right - it’s not the Department of Education’s job to do the right thing. It’s our job. Enough waiting for the power brokers to get their act together. We need to get on the phone, get on our emails, and start taking the solution into our own hands."

In many countries with IMF-supported programs public spending on education grew significantly faster than the economy of the country (photo: Xinhua/Sipa USA/Newscom)</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5936b5e71d00001a00cc1695.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"IMF-supported programs are designed to help economies get back on their feet, but what about their impact on social spending?Our latest research shows that health and education spending have typically been protected in low-income country programs. In fact, an analysis of more than 25 years of data (1988–2014) suggests that public health spending, as a share of GDP, has on average remained unchanged, while public education spending has increased by 0.32 percentage points.The findings underscore the IMF’s strong commitment to protect health and education spending and the most vulnerable during challenging economic reforms. Indeed, in many countries with IMF-supported programs—from Tanzania, to Honduras, to the Kyrgyz Republic—per capita public spending on health and education has significantly outpaced the growth of per capita income.Safeguarding social spending is critical because women, young people, seniors, and the poor often lack the political leverage to promote their economic well-being. By protecting the health and skills of vulnerable groups, growth will be stronger, more durable, and more inclusive.Last year, we extended zero interest rates on all IMF concessional lending to help low-income countries deal with future shocks and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. But cheaper financing alone is not enough to ensure more durable and inclusive growth.The success of low-income country programs increasingly depends on two key factors—(i) minimum levels of government spending on health, education, and social safety nets; and (ii) specific reform measures to protect vulnerable groups.Our data indicate that minimum financing levels were included in virtually all low-income country programs, and that more than two-thirds of these program targets were met. In other IMF-supported programs, measures were taken to strengthen social safety nets. In Honduras, for example, the government used an extended cash transfer to cushion the impact of its fiscal adjustment (2014).More broadly, IMF-supported programs have helped boost social spending by unlocking additional donor financing and by encouraging tax reforms that create stronger and more reliable sources of government revenue.We also provide hands-on technical assistance in this area, helping more than 130 countries per year to generate higher public revenue that can be used for fresh investment in hospitals, schools, and poverty reduction.I am glad to say that the Fund’s work has made a difference in low-income countries in recent years, which has been acknowledged across our membership. But we also recognize that we need to work on improvements in several areas:First, we need to define program targets more explicitly, building on our recent experiences. In Kenya, for example, targets included the cost of anti-retroviral treatments, spending on primary and secondary public education, and cash transfers to vulnerable children and seniors. By providing these specific goals, Kenya’s 2011 program became more targeted and effective. We want to do more of this.The final step, of course, is to combine these “three D’s” with more agility. For example, the IMF moved swiftly to provide the Ebola-affected countries with $380 million in financial assistance — “cash in the bank” to help impacted countries fight this devastating disease.As the African proverb goes: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”I recognize that there is more work to be done to achieve greater inclusiveness and economic fairness. Working closely with our partners and member countries, we will build on the progress made so far."

Ten people were killed, including the attackers, and dozens more were injured. It was the third terror attack the U.K. has seen this year.“London stands in defiance against this cowardly attack on our city, our people, our values and our way of life,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan said at the gathering. Khan and other U.K. officials began the ceremony by laying floral tributes next to City Hall. “As a proud and patriotic British Muslim, I say this: You do not commit these disgusting acts in my name,” Khan said. “Your perverse ideology has nothing to do with the true values of Islam and you will never succeed in dividing our society.”His speech was broken up by bouts of resounding applause, but concluded with a minute of silence. After the ceremony ended, attendants began to march quietly toward the City Hall flagpoles, where they offered flowers, signs and other tributes. For people like Jacqueline Best, a British woman in her 50s, Khan’s speech exemplified that diversity makes London stronger.“We are a collaborative, we are a people, regardless of our faith, our religion,” she said. “Terrorism won’t defeat us and it’s because as a nation, as much as people talk about racism, and ‘Muslims against the rest of us,’ [Khan] made it clear that that’s not the case here. We’re not standing for it, we’re not buying it. We know what faith really means.”Several Muslim advocacy groups attended the rally to, as Khurram Maqsood put it, “spread the real message of Islam ... peace.”“Extremism has absolutely nothing to do with Islam,” Maqsood, 39, said. “We just want to show that with our presence here and with our model.”In another corner of the vigil, the mood was considerably livelier. Singers from local choir Citizens of the World led a small congregation through two of Britain’s most beloved songs: John Lennon’s “Imagine” and Oasis’ “Don’t Look Back In Anger.” “Music manages to say things that we can’t encapsulate with words, so we’re really glad we could come down here this evening and do this,” said the group’s director, Becky Dell.Metropolitan Police identified two of the three suspects Monday.

The second suspect, 30-year-old Rachid Redouane, claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan. Redouane also went by the name Rachid Elkhdar. The third suspect was identified on Tuesday as Youssef Zaghba, a 22-year-old Moroccan-Italian man.The three attackers plowed a van into a crowd on London Bridge and stabbed several people at the nearby Borough Market on Saturday night, killing seven people and injuring dozens, including an on-duty British Transport Police officer. Police officers killed all three suspects at the scene. It’s still not clear which authorities knew what information about the suspects. Metropolitan Police said neither Redouane nor Zaghba had been known to police or MI5. Yet authorities reportedly stopped Zaghba in the Bologna, Italy, airport last March while he was attempting to travel to Syria via Turkey, several news outlets reported Tuesday. They found propaganda from the so-called Islamic State militant group on his phone, they said, but he wasn’t arrested. The Italian government then reportedly notified the British and Moroccan governments.Butt, meanwhile, was no stranger to British authorities. Police said on Monday that he was on MI5’s radar and had been investigated, but that there had been no intelligence suggesting an imminent attack.Butt had also gained public attention. He was featured in “The Jihadis Next Door,” a Channel 4 documentary that aired in January 2016. The film, made over the course of two years, shows him praying with an Islamist group called al-Muhajiroun in front of an Islamic State flag in London’s Regent’s Park.He appears in the film alongside Mohammed Shamsuddin, one of the ringleaders of the group. Shamsuddin proudly proclaimed in the film that the jihadi flag may one day fly over 10 Downing Street, the British prime minister’s residence. He is believed to have fled to Syria in 2014 and appears to have appeared in one of ISIS’ execution videos.All three men lived in East London, in the same area where authorities on Sunday arrested 12 people in connection with the attack. Police said Monday that everyone they had arrested had been released without charges; they arrested an additional person in the same area early Tuesday.Butt’s radical ideology had raised concern among his neighbors. One woman in the area had informed local police that she was worried Butt was trying to radicalize her children, the BBC reported. A man had called the terrorism hotline. Neighbors had also told the broadcaster that one of the attackers was married with two children and had lived in the town of Barking for about three years. “We spoke about a particular attack that happened and like most radicals he had a justification for anything ― everything and anything,” the neighbor said. “And that day I realized that I need to contact the authorities.” Representatives of mosque that Butt occasionally visited said in a statement that they did not know the suspect well.“Many hundreds of people pray at the Jabir Bin Zayid each week, the person that we now know to be Khurram Butt would infrequently attend this mosque, we did not know him well, his name was not known to us, it has been brought to our attention that some years ago after interrupting a Friday sermon he was asked to leave the mosque,” representatives of the Jabir Bin Zayid Islamic Centre in Barking said on their website. Butt “worked for London Underground for just under six months as a trainee customer services assistant, leaving in October last year,” a Transport for London spokesman told HuffPost on Tuesday. He had also worked for a company that manages KFC restaurants, Sky News reported. Reports emerged on Sunday that one of the attackers had carried an Irish identity card. According to BBC and Sky News sources, the card was found on Redouane’s body. Irish state broadcaster RTE reported that authorities believed the assailant carrying the card had lived in Dublin with his British wife for a while but was was of Moroccan origin. “There are a small number of people in Ireland who are being monitored and observed in respect of radicalization and matters relevant to that. In this case ― these facts are being checked ― my understanding is that this individual was not a member of this small group,” Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said in an interview with RTE on Monday. Saturday’s incidents marked the third terror incident in just three months in the U.K. In March, Khalid Masood plowed a rented car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before fatally stabbing a police officer. Six people, including Masood, died in that attack. Last month, a suicide bomber killed nearly two dozen people at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester. Metropolitan Police said Monday that they currently have 500 ongoing terrorism investigations, involving 3,000 suspects of interest. “A small number of the highest priority investigations involve current attack planning, and these investigations command a significant proportion of our resource,” the police added. But there’s no excuse for anyone slipping through the cracks, U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Tuesday.“How on earth could we have let this guy or possibly more through the net?” he said in a Sky News interview. “What happened? How can he possibly be on a Channel 4 program and then committing atrocities like this, and that is a question that will need to be answered by MI5, by the police as the investigation goes on.”This is a developing story and has been updated throughout.

How can he possibly be on a Channel 4 program and then committing atrocities like this, and that is a question that will need to be answered by MI5, by the police as the investigation goes on.”This is a developing story and has been updated throughout.

Girls, boys, whatever. I’m like, ‘Is there anything you want to tell me? Anything to do with your sexuality?’ You know, I don’t give a fuck about that, you are what you are. There’s nothing that’s out of bounds.”Gallagher’s comments are especially refreshing considering he found himself at the center of a controversy over a homophobic tweet in June 2016.Just days after the horrific massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida that left 49 people dead (almost all of them queer people of color), the singer tweeted, “Russian hooligans skintight shorts bumbags batty boy muscles ha ha I’d be more worried bout getting me arse pinched. LG.,” in reference to the European 2016 football tournament. As Spin noted at the time, a “Batty boy” is “a homophobic slur originating from the Caribbean.” Gallagher eventually apologized for the tweet after he faced an outpouring of outrage on Twitter.Gallagher, who’s set to release his first solo album, “As You Were,” later this year and who turned up at Sunday’s One Love Manchester benefit concert, also had some unflinchingly honest advice for his kids regarding drugs.“Well, when it comes to drugs, I haven’t got a leg to stand on, but I’d prefer it if they didn’t do anything,” he told The Guardian. “Weed’s all right, but even that’s fucking stupid. I say, ‘Who are you buying it off? Don’t be buying it off idiots. And don’t be smoking all different shit, like that spice stuff.’”Spoken like a true rock star, Liam."

The “Chained to the Rhythm” singer sang a few of her most iconic songs while wearing a white mini-dress over a turtleneck printed with photos of the victims.Days before the event, which also featured Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber and Oasis’ Liam Gallagher, among others, Perry wrote she was “humbled to be a part” of the event. It ultimately raised over $3 million for the British Red Cross. She also delivered a heartfelt message to the roughly 50,000 attendees, thanked Grande for her strength and encouraged everyone to operate from a place of love, even when that feels impossible. “It’s not easy to always choose love, is it?” she said to a crowd of screaming fans. “Especially in moments like these, right? It can be the most difficult thing to do. But love conquers fear and love conquers hate. And this love that you choose will give you strength, and it’s our greatest power.”Our greatest power, indeed.

She’s got to come to America. It’s time.” The current “Wonder Woman” film is set in WWI-era Europe, so it will be interesting to see what baddies Diana of Themyscira will battle on this side of the Atlantic.There’s no confirmation of a follow-up to “Wonder Woman” on Warner Bros.’ end, but the critical acclaim and early earnings from the original probably make it a safe bet. Naturally, there’s also no director attached to the project yet, but Jenkins would happily take the job.“I realized that ‘Wonder Woman 2’ is its own great movie,” she told EW. “I made ‘Wonder Woman.’ Now I want to make ‘Wonder Woman 2.’ It’s a beautiful story to tell, an important time to tell it and with people that I love.”We’re ready when you are, Patty.“Wonder Woman” is now playing nationwide."

58,POLITICS,Terrorists Want People Afraid. Trump's Alarmist Tweets Spark More Fear.,Sam Stein and Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-terrorism-response_us_5935aae7e4b013c4816a16f5,The president's response to the London attack leaves terrorism experts perplexed and worried.,2017-06-05,British police respond to terrorist attack on the London Bridge.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5935af081d00004600cc13fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― On Dec. 19, 2016, after a failed asylum-seeker inspired by the Islamic State drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 and injuring 56 others, former President Barack Obama offered condolences and condemnations. Through a spokesman, he sent “thoughts and prayers” to the German people. The next day, he called German Chancellor Angela Merkel and pledged counterterrorism and law enforcement assistance. After that, publicly, he largely moved on.On Saturday, five and a half months later, another ISIS-inspired attack took place, this time in London, when a van drove into pedestrians on London Bridge and the perpetrators then jumped out and stabbed people at nearby restaurants. Seven people were killed and 48 injured.In the aftermath, President Donald Trump offered a wholly different approach than his predecessor. He accused London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan of downplaying the threat, using an out-of-context snippet of Khan’s remarks. In a series of four tweets, he used the London tragedy to tout his executive order banning travel from some predominantly Muslim countries, which is pending Supreme Court review after several courts ruled it’s likely unconstitutional. He made an unclear point about the absence of a gun debate after an attack in which the perpetrators used knives and a truck. And he insisted that people should be alarmed.That Trump responded this way wasn’t a surprise. After the attack in Germany, he had declared that “Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad.” And while German police were still piecing together clues about the attack, he called for “these terrorists” to “be eradicated from the face of the earth.”What troubled counterterrorism experts is that Trump’s approach as president hasn’t evolved. The patented alarmist response to terrorism attacks that he deployed in the election may have had political benefits to his campaign. But these experts view them as largely counterproductive to the goal of limiting the effectiveness of terrorist attacks. “Terrorism only works if people are terrified,” said Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent. “And it seems like Trump’s comments, above all, seek to terrify.”There is no full consensus on the proper response to a terrorist attack. Obama himself was stoic in the face of terror attacks and reportedly reminded his staff that more Americans die from falling in a bathtub than from terrorists. That approach, though rooted in facts, risked breeding a sense of complacency and appeared insensitive to the American populace’s fear, some of his advisers worried.But Trump has over-corrected, experts say. Richard Clarke, who served as the top counterterrorism official in the George W. Bush administration, said that the Trump administration’s responses to incidents like those in London give off the distinct impression that they are “anti-Islam.” And that, Clarke added, “may mean some American Muslims may be reluctant to talk to federal officials, including the FBI. Were that to happen, it could mean that important tips would not be given to counter/terrorist authorities.”By heightening fears and cracking down on civil liberties, Trump also runs the risk of damaging the pool of information that law enforcement receives from prospective informants. A “see something, say something” approach only works if a steady stream containing some credible information is being relayed, Watts noted. If you’re “constantly fomenting conspiracies,” you frighten the public into “overreporting,” he added. Trump hasn’t shown an interest in or understanding of this nuance. Instead, he often seems eager to rush to judgment, labeling unfolding events as terrorism before law enforcement officers have the chance to identify the perpetrator. Speaking from the Rose Garden last week, Trump said he wanted to address the “terrorist attack in Manila.” Police in the Philippines said the attack was a robbery at a casino carried out by a gambling addict and did not appear to have been orchestrated by a terrorist group. ISIS later claimed responsibility for the attack, but evidence has not yet emerged tying the group to the rampage, which left 37 dead. What worries experts the most, however, is that Trump’s approach gives terrorists the type of media attention they can use. Counterterrorism experts interviewed for this piece noted that ISIS leaders often pay close attention to domestic U.S. news. And Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama on national security matters, said that his former boss explicitly sought to draw attention away from terrorist incidents for this reason.“What annoyed Obama is that the stated objective of terrorism is to terrorize a population and get them to change their ways,” said Vietor. “Sometimes we play to their benefit. Trump seems to relish that. He seems to think it proves him right.” Ironically, experts say world leaders should more closely emulate the reaction of London’s mayor that Trump criticized. Khan condemned the terrorist attackers, praised police and emergency responders for helping to minimize casualties, and urged Londoners to go about their normal activities while remaining calm and vigilant. When Khan told citizens there was “no reason to be alarmed” by increased police presence throughout the city, he wasn’t downplaying the threat as Trump alleged. He was letting the frightened public know what to expect so they didn’t draw incorrect conclusions. After a terror attack, world leaders should be objective, to the point, and focus on letting the public know when they are safe and when they are in danger, Watts said. “[Trump] does the opposite ― he creates confusion, he blurs lines, he makes people more fearful when they don’t necessarily need to be.” "

But the location of a March 23 API board of directors meeting, where Zinke was a guest speaker, is raising eyebrows. As a recently published log of the interior secretary’s scheduled meetings shows, the speech was held at Trump International Hotel in Washington, which has been at the center of conflict-of-interest concerns. The half-hour talk was listed on Zinke’s schedule as: “Address API Board of Directors Meeting.” Of all Zinke’s meetings with energy industry representatives, the API event was the only one held at a location that financially benefits President Donald Trump, the nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington noted in a post Monday.Trump’s D.C. hotel, which occupies the historic Old Post Office under a 60-year lease with the federal government, has been attacked as an obvious conflict of interest for the president. The hotel has drawn scores of foreign dignitaries and lobbyists since Trump’s election.Details about the March 23 meeting, including who was present and what Zinke discussed, are not provided in the Interior Department’s calendar entry. While it’s possible Zinke addressed the board via phone or video call, the listing appears to indicate he attended in person.Neither the Interior Department nor API responded to HuffPost’s request for comment Monday. Zinke, like Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, has emerged as an oil-loving administration ally of the fossil fuel industry. He said in April that Trump’s executive order aimed at opening now-protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to oil and gas development would “cement our nation’s position as a global energy leader.” Zinke, who’s tasked with managing some 500 million acres of federal land, has also compared oil drilling to hunting and fishing, and has suggested natural areas can actually benefit from the extraction of oil, gas and minerals. “We can responsibly develop our energy resources and return the land to equal or better quality than it was before extraction,” he wrote in a May op-ed for the conservative Washington Times. Zinke, a former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL, was confirmed March 1 as interior secretary. API President and CEO Jack Gerard said after Zinke’s nomination in December that Zinke “knows the great potential that our federal lands hold when it comes to developing our nation’s energy resources.”Gerard told The Washington Post last month that Zinke “has been open to constructive dialogue and has shown a willingness to work with all stakeholders.”Four days after Zinke’s appearance at API’s board meeting, Trump signed an executive order to roll back Obama-era policies meant to curb global climate change, namely the Clean Power Plan, which limited greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Zinke praised the order in a statement, saying Trump “took bold and decisive action to end the War on Coal and put us on track for American energy independence.”The order was among a number of Trump actions celebrated by API. API spent $2.7 million lobbying in the first quarter of 2017. Those efforts targeted the Interior Department on a number of issues, including offshore drilling and national monument designations. "

He forgave them. Mercy and forgiveness are hard teachings, but they are clear ones.”‘It’s Racist. It’s Wrong. And It Could Lead To Violence’Heidi Beirich, head of the Intelligence Project at Southern Poverty Law Center, called Higgins’ comments “outrageous” and “the height of irresponsibility.”“He’s treating every single Muslim as though they’re a terrorist. This kind of talk opens wide the possibility for hate crimes. It’s racist. It’s wrong. And it could lead to violence.”‘This Is Not A Battle Between Christians And Muslims’Catherine Orsborn, campaign director for Shoulder To Shoulder, said Higgins’ declaration “demonstrates an alarming misunderstanding of the issue” and “betrays American values.”“For politicians to try to turn us against one another is counter-productive and dangerous,” she said.“This is not a battle between Christians and Muslims, or between ‘Christendom’ and ‘Islamic horror,’"" Orsborn said in an email to HuffPost. ""All humans who value dignity and equality should and do stand against horrific acts of violence like this one, just like all humans who value dignity and equality should stand against acts of violence coming from white supremacists or anti-Muslim extremists (like the recent horrific incident in Portland).”‘Jesus, Himself, Would Never Have Condoned Such A Statement.’Rev. Dr. Katharine R. Henderson, president of Auburn Seminary, accused Higgins’ rhetoric of exhibiting the same kind of extremism that people of all faiths should be fighting against.“No one who calls himself a Christian can utter the words that Rep. Clay Higgins wrote about Muslims,” Henderson said. “As a Christian minister, I denounce his words in the strongest terms. Jesus, Himself, would never have condoned such a statement.”“What we need from our leaders ― political, religious, and otherwise ― is maturity and forbearance, not hateful rhetoric that stokes fear, hatred, and violence,” she added.Andrew David, a spokesman for Higgins, provided a statement to HuffPost from the congressman that did not clarify how Higgins thinks people should identify radicalized Islamic suspects in order to kill them. Higgins’ statement read:"

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-travel-ban_us_5935a9d6e4b0099e7fae3a66,"His administration has been arguing it's not a “travel ban,” merely a pause – but Trump is proudly calling it a “TRAVEL BAN.”",2017-06-05,"President Donald Trump Monday morning criticized opponents of his executive order banning travel from from six majority Muslim nations, as well as his own Department of Justice and the judiciary.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5935aab919000036003e48ce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Government lawyers trying to defend President Donald Trump’s travel ban in court might be excused if they decide they are stuck with the world’s worst client.With the case now before the U.S. Supreme Court, Trump early Monday let loose a string of statements on Twitter, criticizing opponents of his executive order banning travel from six majority-Muslim nations, his own Department of Justice, and the judiciary generally for being “political.”Federal appeals courts have struck down the ban, ruling that statements from Trump and other administration officials showed that the order unconstitutionally targeted Muslims. Trump’s latest tirade adds to that body of remarks.“To the extent that the government has taken a position ... and that position is at odds with what the president has said, it presents a challenge that the Department of Justice will have to deal with,” said Alberto Gonzales, who served as President George W. Bush’s attorney general a decade ago.George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr, a former Justice Department prosecutor who has appeared before the Supreme Court, said the tweets make it harder for Trump’s lawyers now to argue ― as other White House officials have tried ― that the “travel ban” wasn’t really a “travel ban.”“A big question in the case is what the president intends,” Kerr said. “It’s directly undercutting what his lawyers are trying to say.”Lawyers working to keep the travel ban off the books seemed to agree. The ACLU posted a tweet Monday afternoon: “Yes, we may incorporate @realDonaldTrump’s tweets about the ban into our Supreme Court argument.”Trump started sharing his thoughts on the matter at 6:25 a.m.“People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!” Trump wrote in the first of four tweets over 20 minutes. “The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version! In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!”Trump continued tweeting Monday night and into Tuesday morning. He sent “That’s right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won’t help us protect our people!” at 9:20 p.m. And Tuesday morning added: “The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media. They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out.”Perhaps the most surprising critic of Trump’s statements was George Conway, husband of top White House aide Kellyanne Conway and who, until last week, was considering a top-level job with the Department of Justice civil division.“These tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won’t help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad,” Conway wrote, referring to acronyms for the Office of Solicitor General and the Supreme Court of the United States.A while later, as buzz spread from his original tweet – including the obvious copying of the Trumpism “Sad” – Conway posted four more threaded tweets: “Just to be clear, and in response to inquiries, I still VERY, VERY STRONGLY support POTUS, his Admin, policies, the executive order and of course, my wonderful wife. Which is why I said what I said this morning. Every sensible lawyer in WHCO [White House Counsel’s Office] and every political appointee at DOJ wd agree with me (as some have already told me). The pt cannot be stressed enough that tweets on legal matters seriously undermine Admin agenda and POTUS―and those who support him, as I do, need to reinforce that pt and not be shy about it.”White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders argued during Monday’s daily press briefing that Trump’s word choice really did not matter.“The president isn’t concerned with what you call it. He’s concerned with national security and protecting people in this country,” Sanders said. “He isn’t concerned with being politically correct. He’s concerned with protecting the American people.”The Justice Department last week requested that the Supreme Court take up the case. The justices have not yet announced whether they will do so.This article has been updated to include Trump tweets from Monday night and Tuesday morning."
62,ARTS & CULTURE,Margaret Atwood Speaks Out Against Anti-Abortion Legislation In The U.S.,Maddie Crum,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/margaret-atwood-on-women-and-children_us_59357651e4b0ca5db291d0c8,"At BookCon 2017, she talked about the dangers of regulating women’s bodies.",2017-06-05,Demonstrators dressed as characters from Margaret Atwood's novel <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> hold signs during the March For Truth protest in New York on June 3.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59357b442000003c00be083d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since her classic 1985 novel The Handmaid’s Tale was adapted into a TV series for Hulu, Margaret Atwood has used the story as a jumping-off point for discussion around current events. In a recent call for more public library funding, Atwood reminded fans there are no libraries in Gilead, her fictional authoritarian regime. (“It’s no coincidence,” she added.) Atwood noted that a free press was not protected in Gilead, either, in a letter distributed by PEN America earlier this year regarding censorship and free expression.Most recently, the author brought up Gilead at New York City’s BookCon 2017 this past weekend, likening recent abortion legislation in Texas to “a form of slavery.”Atwood spoke on a panel alongside “The Handmaid’s Tale” showrunner Bruce Miller, discussing the historical precedents for Gilead and the intersection of their art and activism.“I’m not a real activist,” Atwood explained, because activists get paid for their work, and she, on the other hand, doesn’t “have a job.” Her perch as an artist, she continued, makes it possible for her to say the things that others want to say, but feel unable to. For this reason, she said, she would never survive a fascist society because artists are usually targeted first.“So, you are not yet living in a fascist society,” Atwood told BookCon crowds. “Whoopee.”When the panel opened up to audience questions, Atwood was asked to put her speculative fiction abilities to use to predict what’s in store for the United States. “I’m not a clairvoyant,” Atwood said. Instead, she said she looks at what’s happened in the past ― and what’s happening in the present ― when creating future, fictional worlds. “I was born in 1939,” she said. “What was going on in 1939?” Atwood continued to explain that she’s read a great deal about fascism, and is an avid reader of prisoners’ diaries. In fact, when asked what further reading she would recommend to fans of her book, she suggested The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: a History of Nazi Germany by William L. Shirer. So, The Handmaid’s Tale arose from her imagining what fascism would look like in America. “It wouldn’t be atheistic,” she said. While she didn’t feel qualified to comment on America’s possible future, she did provide a lengthy, impassioned comment on the current state of affairs ― regarding a question about abortion legislation in Texas. “I’m [...] waiting for a lawsuit that says if you force me to have children I cannot afford, you should pay for the process,” she said. “It is really a form of slavery to force women to have children that they cannot afford and then to say that they have to raise them.”Atwood also addressed the ways in which the Hulu adaptation of her book takes seriously the issue of climate change. Pollution and other environmental concerns catalyze the establishment of Gilead in the book, but in the show, the changing climate is more central to the plot. The update to the show, Atwood said, was made to reflect what’s currently happening in the world. The author cited the example of everyday plastics affecting male fertility. “But you’re not allowed to say that,” she noted.Fans of The Handmaid’s Tale ― both the book and the TV show ― will know that her comments fit with the world Atwood wrote about. In her fictional Gilead, women bear the burden of society’s fertility issues, while male infertility is either ignored or dealt with in secrecy. That Atwood ensured her story was drawn from events and trends already existing in real life makes her vision of a possible future that much more frightening.Editor’s note: The author of this article moderated the BookCon panel featuring Margaret Atwood and Bruce Miller."

About a quarter aren’t sure.Intense opposition outweighs intense support ― 39 percent of the public strongly disapproves of Trump’s decision, with just 19 percent strongly in favor.Support for withdrawal from the accord has increased modestly since a May survey taken before the announcement, when just 17 percent of Americans favored leaving and 61 percent were opposed.While some of that change may be due to the variation in wording between the questions, it also demonstrates the power of polarization. Before the White House had taken an official stance on the issue, 31 percent of Trump voters favored staying in the agreement. Now, with polling on the agreement also partially a referendum on the president’s performance, views are more strongly split along political lines. Just 11 percent of Trump voters ― in contrast with 88 percent of voters who backed Hillary Clinton ― now say they disapprove of the decision to withdraw. The U.S. is due to exit the Paris Agreement on Nov. 4, 2020, one day after the next presidential election. Environmental groups are hoping that Trump’s decision to remove the U.S. from the pact will elevate the importance of environmental issues in the upcoming 2018 and 2020 campaigns.If the issue does rise in prominence, it could work against the GOP. Forty perent of Americans say they trust the Democratic Party more than the GOP to handle climate issues versus 26 percent who trust the Republican Party more, with another third unsure. Six in 10 Americans say they’re at least somewhat concerned about climate change, though just a third are very concerned.But environmental issues have rarely been deciding factors at the ballot box ― and, as Trump voters’ shift in opinion demonstrates, partisanship may be more likely to drive Americans’ views about environmental issues than the other way around.The people most likely to care deeply are also unlikely to be swing voters. Rather, the highest levels of concern are largely on the left. Seventy percent of Clinton voters say they’re very concerned about climate change, a view shared by only 8 percent of Trump voters and barely over a quarter of those who didn’t vote or supported a third party.Asked to pick their top two issues from a list, just 16 percent of the public overall chose the environment, ranking it behind immigration (20 percent), the economy (37 percent) and their top concern, health care (43 percent).Young Americans, however, are more likely to place a priority on environmental issues. Among adults under age 30, the environment is viewed as the second most important issue, behind only health care. Nearly half of young Americans who lean toward or support the Democratic Party call the environment a top issue.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted June 1-2 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

The Oscar winner graced the red carpet in a form-fitting dress and posed for pictures while holding what some assumed was a baby bump. Except Berry isn’t pregnant, her representative confirmed with HuffPost, and the rumors are completely untrue. The “X-Men” actress seemingly responded to the speculation on Monday with an Instagram post poking fun at the pregnancy rumors. Apparently, Berry isn’t with child, but has just been — *gasp* — eating full meals. “Can a girl have some steak and fries??” she captioned a glam close up with eye roll and wink emojis. The 50-year-old actress is already a mom to two children, Maceo and Nahla, from past relationships with ex-husband Olivier Martinez and ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry. But just because Berry isn’t expecting another child doesn’t mean her focus on her children has changed. “Right now, being mom is my most important job and I now know that everything I do, everything I say and everything I offer them is really important,” she revealed in February. “I say lots of things, but I think what’s more important is that my children watch what I do. I’m more mindful of how I live my life and what they see me do.”"

A coalition of climate activists and poverty activists walked through five counties and ended in Philadelphia to demand increases in solar power and the jobs it provides. The event, called Power Local Green Jobs, was the brainchild of Earth Quaker Action Team (EQUAT ) and Philadelphians Organized to Witness Empower and Rebuild (POWER), a group consisting of more than 40 congregations around the city and led by Reverend Greg Holston, an African American pastor who is intent on making the connection between economic and environmental justice. “Every single day, folks tell me about struggling to support their families. They need jobs, not programs. It’s time to build a green city that works for all,” ― Rev. Greg HolstonRev. Holston was joined in the march by Bishop Dwayne Royster of Living Water United Church of Christ, another Black faith leader from Philadelphia whose congregation is deeply rooted within the traditions of the African-American Church.Pastors like Holston and Royster view environmental justice as a spiritual and justice issue, and are among a growing number of faith leaders of color who are taking leadership roles within the environmental movement.Bill McKibben, a White environmental justice advocate and founder of the climate-focused grassroots organization 350.org, was marching in Philadelphia alongside Rev. Holston and Bishop Royster. He is happy to see that leadership is changing to include more people of color.“The first in line for the power and jobs would be frontline communities. That’s who was leading the way at the big climate march in Washington D.C. on April 29. I hope this change continues,” McKibben said.This change is happening in part because of increasing recognition that communities of color are often most adversely affected in cases of environmental injustice. When Melissa Mays of Flint, Michigan, had had enough of the foul-smelling brown water flowing from her tap, one of the groups she turned to was Concerned Pastors for Social Justice, a network of religious leaders from more than 30 predominantly African-American churches in Flint and surrounding communities.Formed more than a half-century ago to safeguard the lives of the underserved in the city, the network fought hard alongside the residents of Flint, who are over 60 percent African American or Hispanic, during water crisis that has been engulfing the city since 2014.Last year, Concerned Pastors became one of the plaintiffs to file a lawsuit against the state and city officials requiring them to comply with Safe Drinking Water Act.Just two months ago, plaintiffs and the state of Michigan agreed to settle the lawsuit for almost $100 million, and to replace miles of lead pipelines. Pastor Allen Overton of Concerned Pastors says they hope the settlement “helps heal the damage.”In an effort to fight for environmental justice, the new breed of religious activists of color are putting together guidelines and taking concrete steps toward a better, broader, and more inclusive environmental movement in their racially diverse communities.Alaura Carter, the Climate Justice Associate at Sojourners and a member of the committee that organized the People's Climate March in Washington D.C. in April, thinks that environment, like any other national issue, has a racial component.""People of color in the United States are exposed to 38 percent more asthma-producing nitrogen dioxide than are White people.. [and] are twice as likely as Whites to live without potable water or modern sanitation."" -- Alaura Carter, Climate Justice Associate at SojournersBy focusing on people and their daily lived experiences instead of theological ideas around faith and the environment, faith leaders of color are able to avoid the vagaries of what Carter calls the “big green” blanket movements, which ""sometimes overlook the people on the ground or do not represent them accurately,"" Carter added.Reverend Leo Woodberry is the pastor of Kingdom Living Temple, an independent African-American church in Florence, South Carolina, a place hit by extreme weather such as the flooding in 2015 and Hurricane Matthew last year.In March, Rev. Woodberry helped organize a free climate change event for his community. Speakers and groups from across the northeast and southeast came to train the citizens of Florence in the devastating impacts of climate change.“Training people on what we need to do, whether we are in the middle of a heat wave and you have citizens who don’t have adequate cooling or cold weather where people don’t have adequate heating, is how we can address those problems and concerns,” said Rev. Woodberry.Also one of the organizers of People's Climate March, he often talks about ""environomics"", referring to the intersection point ""... where the economy and environment meet and allows corporate polluters to come into communities and dump toxins because it’s profitable for them.”""Environomics is ... where the economy and environment meet and allows corporate polluters to come into communities and dump toxins because it’s profitable for them."" -- Rev. Leo Woodberry, Kingdom Living Temple, S.C.Reverend Dr. Neddy Astudillo is a leading Latina eco-theologian with the faith-based environmental advocacy group GreenFaith, and has recently attended National GreenLatinos summit in Monterrey, California. She emphasizes the connection between faith and ecology, including the need to live in healthy communities.""When environmentalists and people of faith begin to work together and question the present social-environmental crisis, we clearly see how we can not achieve social justice without environmental justice and vice versa. All the players need to be at the table to seek solutions, or those that aren't 'will be on the menu',"" Rev. Astudillo said.Some environmental justice leaders seek inspiration from the holy books.Ibrahim Abdul-Matin is the Director of Community Affairs in Environmental Protection Department, overseeing 8.5 million people who drink or use New York City water every day. As a Muslim African American and author of the book Green Deen: What Islam Teaches About Protecting the Planet -- ""deen"" means ""religion"" in Arabic -- he believes that like all prophetic traditions, Islam also has at its very core an ecological imperative. In his advocacy for environmental justice for the underprivileged and the vulnerable communities, Abdul-Matin says he draws on the notion of ""adl"" (""justice""), one of the names of God in Islam:""'Adl' is rooted in the notion of balance...When there's too much extraction from the earth, when people are working really hard but not making enough to live decently, when a small group of people have more than most people... then things are unbalanced and you have injustice,"" he said.Ilgin Beygo Yorulmaz is a reporter for Auburn Voices ― a media platform by Auburn Seminary for the multi-faith movement for social justice.

Yesterday, “One Love Manchester” was held at the English city’s Old Trafford Cricket Ground as a benefit for the British Red Cross; the star-studded gig focused less on soliciting donations than celebrating the lives of those who were killed in last month’s horrible terror attack.In front of a crowd of 50,000, Gen-X stalwarts Coldplay, Take That, Black Eyed Peas, and Pharrell Williams sang alongside millennials to show us that current pop songs can bear the weight of our turbulent times as handily as tunes of the past have done. The baton of global responsibility passed from one generation to the next in a meaningful display of talent, resilience and symbolism as Justin Bieber played “Love Yourself” on guitar while assuring the crowd that “God is in the midst” of both tragedy and triumph; Katy Perry empowered the audience to “Roar” with her powerful alto; and Niall Horan (of One Direction fame) submitted his acoustic “This Town” as the anthem of the moment.But it was 23-year-old Grande, the bravest of them all, who led teenagers and their parents in multigenerational stadium sing-alongs – including the former Nickelodeon star’s own “One Last Time” (which hit #1 on the UK iTunes chart last week) and Harold Arlen’s 1939 Wizard of Oz classic, “Over the Rainbow.” Coldplay’s “Fix You,” Crowded House’s “Don’t Dream It’s Over” (sung by Grande and Miley Cyrus), and Oasis’s “Live Forever” (performed by Liam Gallagher) served as guide posts for the event; Grande, in a truly 21st century moment of gravitas, dedicated danceable numbers (”Side to Side,” “Love Me Harder”) to Olivia Campbell, the 15-year-old who captured the world’s hopes when her mother appeared on TV during the hours after the May 22 attack with a tearful plea for info before discovering the teen had been identified as one of the fatalities.At last night’s concert, pre-recorded messages of support from rock’s elder statesmen, including Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, and U2, beamed on the video screens during the show. Yet, 22-year-old Halsey’s statement made the most impact: “It doesn’t matter about faith, race, class or life experience, when a bunch of people get together and they can all relate to one thing – their love for music – something beautiful happens,” the singer proclaimed.If the three-hour “One Love Manchester” concert demonstrated anything, it’s how deeply the internet generation believes in the broadest concept of love. While adults in 2017 argue about building walls, banning travelers, jeopardizing international relations, denying science, and peddling fake news, many Western kids born after the 1990s have spent most of their young lives schooled on virtues of equality, collaboration, exploration, acceptance, and kindness – principles often extolled in song lyrics and posted to social media by artists like Ariana Grande and her peers.In this blurry zone between online interaction and the real experiences of live performances (like the ones we saw at One Love Manchester), a new generation of music stars and fans is emerging. This new generation has grown up with the entire planet in the palms of their hands, but they don’t have it easy: They must – and will – live up to the tasks of bringing differing cultures together, giving marginalized people a seat at the table, brokering peace instead of arms deals, ridding bullies from classrooms, pulpits and podiums, eradicating terrorism in all its forms, and quelling hate with indefatigable optimism. For the teens of today, the notion of “one love” in a global world is not an optional ideology – it’s the only life they know. And music will likely continue to be an important part of how they approach problem-solving in their increasingly complex reality.Charity concerts might be associated with Baby Boomers, Generation X and Millennials, but “One Love Manchester” begs us not to count out the so-called Generation Z just yet. Terror and hate are their burdens, but love is their freedom. Ariana Grande fans deserve more than an end-of-the-alphabet letter to define them. Today, why not let the Z’s start a new beginning as the “Generation of Love”? Watch out world, Gen Love is on its way."

The day after he fired FBI Director James Comey in hopes of taking the pressure off the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with the Kremlin during the 2016 election, Trump received Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in the Oval Office. Now, as Comey prepares to testify before Congress about Trump’s request that the FBI halt the investigation of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s ties to Russia, the president is preparing to announce a Cuba policy that would clear the way for Moscow to re-establish itself as Cuba’s principal foreign patron.According to press reports, Trump is on the verge of reversing key elements of Barack Obama’s policy of engagement with Cuba, even though his own government’s review concluded it is producing positive results across a range of issues, including security. If the United States reverts to a policy of hostility, U.S. adversaries will once again reap the rewards, and Russia will be first in line—just like it was in 1960. The end of the Cold War severed Cuba’s partnership with the Soviet Union, but Vladimir Putin has been restoring Russia’s global influence by repairing relations with traditional allies. Russia’s resurgence in the Caribbean dates to Putin’s 2000 trip to Havana, followed by Raúl Castro’s 2009 visit to Moscow—the first since the end of the Cold War. In July 2014, Putin visited the island again and agreed to forgive 90% of Cuba’s $32 billion in Soviet-era debt. By the time Raúl Castro returned to Moscow in 2015, Russia had signed agreements to invest in infrastructure development and oil exploration, and agreed to lend Cuba 1.2 billion Euros to develop thermal energy. When Venezuela failed to meet its promised oil shipments to Cuba, Russia stepped in to cover the shortfall. The linkages extend beyond commerce. Both sides refer to their revived relationship as a “strategic partnership” with diplomatic and military components. Russia is refurbishing and replacing Cuba’s aging Soviet-era armaments. Russian naval vessels visit Cuban ports, the most prominent being the ostentatious arrival of a large Russian surveillance vessel in January 2015, the day before U.S. and Cuban diplomats began talks on normalizing diplomatic relations. Russia reportedly wants to establish a military base on the island.At the Pentagon, the intrusion of extra-hemispheric powers in Latin America has been a serious concern since 2010 when the U.S. Southern Command’s annual Posture Statement first identified Russia, China, and Iran as challenging U.S. interests. Every year since, SouthCom has warned that Washington needs to increase its engagement with the region to counter the influence of outsiders. Just this past April, Admiral Kurt W. Kidd presented the 2017 Posture Statement to Congress, declaring, “For Russia, China, and Iran, Latin America is not an afterthought. These global actors view the Latin American economic, political, and security arena as an opportunity to achieve their respective long-term objectives and advance interests that may be incompatible with ours.”For some policymakers, this geostrategic challenge mandates support for engagement with Cuba, giving Havana less incentive to expand its economic relationships with Russia and China into politico-military ones. K. T. McFarland, who served briefly as Trump’s deputy national security advisor, succinctly summarized the argument for engaging Cuba before she joined the administration: “It would be foreign policy malpractice if we stood aside while our adversaries develop strong bilateral and economic -- and possibly military relations.”A few months after Donald Trump’s inauguration, 16 retired senior military officers, including a former commander of SouthCom, sent National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster an open letter urging the administration to maintain engagement with Cuba on national security grounds, citing successful cooperation on counter-terrorism, border control, drug interdiction, environmental protection, and emergency preparedness. “If we fail to engage economically and politically,” they warned, “it is certain that China, Russia, and other entities whose interests are contrary to the United States’ will rush into the vacuum.”So why would President Trump reverse a policy that his own government judges to be largely successful, and that enjoys broad support with the general public, business community, and national security establishment—especially when that reversal would give adversaries like Russia, China, and Iran a new foothold in the hemisphere? According to the White House, the answer is human rights: “As the President has said, the current Cuba policy is a bad deal,” spokesman Michael Short claimed. “It does not do enough to support human rights in Cuba.”The invocation of human rights is clearly an excuse rather than the real reason. The administration has shown no interest whatsoever in human rights in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, or the Philippines. On the contrary, the president has gone out of his way to praise and encourage leaders whose human rights records are far worse than Cuba’s. Moreover, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said explicitly that “America First” means human rights will take a back seat to U.S. national security and economic interests.The real reason for changing Cuba policy is raw, naked politics. Cuban American Representative Mario Díaz-Balart (R-Fla.), one of the most vocal critics of Obama’s policy, reportedly extracted a commitment from the White House to be tough on Cuba as the price for his vote to repeal Obamacare.

The day after he fired FBI Director James Comey in hopes of taking the pressure off the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with the Kremlin during the 2016 election, Trump received Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in the Oval Office. Now, as Comey prepares to testify before Congress about Trump’s request that the FBI halt the investigation of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s ties to Russia, the president is preparing to announce a Cuba policy that would clear the way for Moscow to re-establish itself as Cuba’s principal foreign patron.According to press reports, Trump is on the verge of reversing key elements of Barack Obama’s policy of engagement with Cuba, even though his own government’s review concluded it is producing positive results across a range of issues, including security. If the United States reverts to a policy of hostility, U.S. adversaries will once again reap the rewards, and Russia will be first in line—just like it was in 1960. The end of the Cold War severed Cuba’s partnership with the Soviet Union, but Vladimir Putin has been restoring Russia’s global influence by repairing relations with traditional allies. Russia’s resurgence in the Caribbean dates to Putin’s 2000 trip to Havana, followed by Raúl Castro’s 2009 visit to Moscow—the first since the end of the Cold War. In July 2014, Putin visited the island again and agreed to forgive 90% of Cuba’s $32 billion in Soviet-era debt. By the time Raúl Castro returned to Moscow in 2015, Russia had signed agreements to invest in infrastructure development and oil exploration, and agreed to lend Cuba 1.2 billion Euros to develop thermal energy. When Venezuela failed to meet its promised oil shipments to Cuba, Russia stepped in to cover the shortfall. The linkages extend beyond commerce. Both sides refer to their revived relationship as a “strategic partnership” with diplomatic and military components. Russia is refurbishing and replacing Cuba’s aging Soviet-era armaments. Russian naval vessels visit Cuban ports, the most prominent being the ostentatious arrival of a large Russian surveillance vessel in January 2015, the day before U.S. and Cuban diplomats began talks on normalizing diplomatic relations. Russia reportedly wants to establish a military base on the island.At the Pentagon, the intrusion of extra-hemispheric powers in Latin America has been a serious concern since 2010 when the U.S. Southern Command’s annual Posture Statement first identified Russia, China, and Iran as challenging U.S. interests.

It contains more soldiers (2.8 million, not counting reserves) and armaments (nearly 6,000 tanks, 31,000 artillery pieces, and 1,134 combat aircraft) than any other place on the planet. The armies of North and South Korea face each other across the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, and Seoul, South Korea’s capital, is a mere 35 miles away as the artillery shell flies. More than 25 million people inhabit that city’s greater metropolitan area, home to about half of South Korea’s population. Unsurprisingly, untold numbers of North Korean missiles and artillery pieces are trained on that city. Once the guns started firing, thousands of its denizens would undoubtedly die within hours. Of course, North Koreans, too, would be caught in an almost instant maelstrom of death.And the war wouldn’t be a bilateral affair. South Korea hosts 28,500 American troops. In addition, there are some 200,000 American civilians in the country, most of them in Seoul. Many in both categories could be killed by North Korean attacks and the United States would, in turn, hit multiple targets in that country. Pyongyang might retaliate by firing missiles at Japan, where 39,000 American troops are stationed, concentrating on the network of American bases and command centers there, especially the U.S. Services Headquarters at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo.And that’s without even considering the possible use of nuclear weapons. If anything, Mattis’s description is an understatement. And don’t assume that the danger of a Korean conflagration has passed now that President Trump has become trapped in the latest set of political scandals to plague his administration. Quite the opposite: a clash between North Korea and the United States might have become more probable precisely because the president is politically besieged.Trump wouldn’t be the first leader, confronted with trouble at home, to trigger a crisis abroad and then appeal for unity and paint critics as unpatriotic. Keep in mind, after all, that this is the man who has already warned of “a major, major war” with North Korea.Trump vs. KimSo far the coercive tactics Trump has used to compel North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program and cease testing ballistic missiles have included sanctions and asset freezes, military threats, and shows of force ― both serious, as in the recent Key Resolve and Operation Max Thunder joint military exercises with South Korea, and farcical, as with a supposedly northward-bound naval “armada” that actually sailed in the opposite direction. Such moves all involve the same presidential bet: that economic and military pressure can bend Pyongyang to his will. Other American presidents have, of course, taken the same approach and failed for decades now, which seems to matter little to Trump, even though he presents himself as a break-the-mold maverick ready to negotiate unprecedented deals with foreign leaders.By now, this much ought to be clear, even to Trump: North Korea hasn’t been cowed into compliance by Washington’s warnings and military muscle flexing. In 2003, after multilateral diplomatic efforts to denuclearize North Korea ran aground, Pyongyang ditched the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and two years later declared that it possessed nuclear weapons. In October 2006, it detonated its first nuclear device, a one-kiloton bomb. Four other tests in May 2009, February 2013, January 2016, and September 2016, ranging in explosive yield from four to 10 kilotons, followed. Three of them occurred after the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, came to power in April 2012. A similar pattern holds for ballistic missiles, which North Korea has been testing since 1993. The numbers have risen steadily under Kim Jong-un, from four tests in 2012 to 25 in 2016.Clearly, the North’s leaders reject the proposition that American approval is required for them to build nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles. Like his father, Kim Jong-il, and his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the founder of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (or DPRK, North Korea’s official name), Kim Jong-un is an ardent nationalist who regularly responds to threats by upping the ante. Trump’s national security adviser, General H.R. McMaster, characterized Kim as “unpredictable.” In reality, the Korean leader, like his father and grandfather before him, has been remarkably consistent: he has steadfastly refused to stop testing either nuclear weapons or their possible delivery systems, let alone “denuclearize” the Korean peninsula, as McMaster demanded. Indeed, from Pyongyang’s perspective, Trump may be the unpredictable one. On one day, amid press reports that the Pentagon was considering a preventive strike using means ranging from Tomahawk cruise missiles to cyber attacks, the president declared ominously that North Korea “is a problem, a problem that will be taken care of.” He followed up by warning Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom he was then hosting at his Mar-a-Lago estate, that if China wouldn’t rein in Kim, the United States would act alone. Not so long after, Trump suddenly praised Kim, calling him a “pretty smart cookie,” presumably impressed that the North Korean leader wasn’t even 30 years old when he succeeded his father. On yet another day, the president announced that he would be “honored” to meet Kim under the right circumstances and would do so “absolutely.” The roller-coaster ride otherwise known as the presidency of Donald Trump has many people perplexed. Trump’s boosters believe that the president’s unpredictability gives him leverage against adversaries. But in the event of a military crisis on the Korean peninsula, Trump’s pendulum-like behavior could lead North Korea’s leaders to conclude that they had best prepare for the worst ― and so strike first. That prospect makes the Kim-Trump combination not just dangerous but quite possibly deadly. Old Claims, New PossibilitiesStanding in the way of a fresh policy toward North Korea are a set of assumptions beloved within the Washington Beltway and by the foreign policy establishment beyond it ― and rarely challenged in the mainstream media.Perhaps the most common of them is that diplomacy and conciliation toward North Korea won’t work because its leaders only respond to pressure. So pervasive and deeply rooted is this view that it makes fresh thinking about Pyongyang next to impossible.Given the failure of both sanctions and saber-rattling, however, a new approach would have to involve diplomacy (in case you’ve forgotten that word) and serious negotiations with the North. Here’s one possible way to go that might, in fact, make a difference.North Korea would agree, in principle, to dismantle its nuclear weapons installations, rejoin the NPT, and allow comprehensive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify its compliance. Concurrently, the United States would pledge not to attack North Korea or topple its regime and to move toward normalization of political relations. Major steps taken by North Korea on the path to denuclearization would be matched by cuts in American military forces in South Korea. Once Pyongyang delivered completely, the United States would remove all its forces and fully lift economic sanctions on the North. The United States, South Korea, China, Japan, and Russia would undertake to fund and, for some of its future energy needs, build new Light-Water Reactors (LWRs), which reduce the risk of bomb-grade plutonium production. These would be subject to regular inspections and electronic surveillance by the IAEA and all spent fuel would be transported out of North Korea. The dismantling of the North’s nuclear facilities, verified by intermittent inspections and continuous electronic monitoring, would ― as in the nuclear deal with Iran ― prevent the production of weapons-grade plutonium (PU-239) or uranium (UR-235)Once these steps were completed, both Koreas would begin to pull back their troops massed along the Demilitarized Zone and so create an even wider region free of weapons and troops between the two countries. They would agree not to reintroduce troops and armaments into the vacated areas and to allow monitoring by international observers. Over perhaps a 10-year span the two states would commit to additional military pullbacks plus reductions in the number of weapons each possessed, focusing on retiring those most suited to offensive warfare.If Trump is indeed prepared to meet with Kim, it should be to do a deal along these lines, not to deliver in person the sort of ultimatums that the North has rejected for years.The Diplomacy-Won’t-Work TropeTypically, proposals like these are dismissed on the grounds that they combine the worst of all worlds: the appeasement of a despotic regime and reckless naïveté. Let’s start with the appeasement charge, the gist of which seems to be that Pyongyang’s cruelties bar diplomatic engagement with it. This claim amounts to sanctimonious puffery and historical amnesia. The United States has, in various forms, supported a vast array of despotic regimes, including Greece during the brutal “regime of the colonels” (1967-74); Indonesia under Suharto (who presided over the slaughter of half a million people in 1965-1966); and Iraq under Saddam Hussein during the 1980s, when his government was gassing Kurds and razing their villages. And of course in South Korea, there was the U.S.-backed government of President Syngman Rhee (1948-1960), whose security forces killed more than 100,000 people, 30,000 to 60,000 in the infamous 1948 Cheju Massacre alone, as part of an effort to decimate any left-wing opposition in the country.North Korea’s state, while undeniably repressive, has persisted for more than 60 years and must be part of any plan to reduce the risk of war on the peninsula. Attempting “regime change,” à la Iraq in 2003 or Libya in 2011, would certainly prove disastrous. In comparison, the upheaval and death that followed the ousters of Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi would seem minor and the bloody reverberations of such an event would extend far beyond the peninsula. Counting on China, Pyongyang’s principal benefactor, or Russia to squeeze North Korea so that it undertakes far-reaching reforms amounts to wishful thinking. Neither country wants to trigger instability there for fear that the country might collapse, creating mayhem on its borders and releasing a floodtide of refugees that they would have to deal with. In addition, China views the North as a buffer with South Korea, an American ally and a forward base for U.S. military power. From Beijing’s vantage point, if changes in North Korea careened out of control, the eventual result could be a unified Korean state allied with Washington. For the Chinese, the status quo on the peninsula, while anything but ideal, beats such a roll of the dice. Beijing has been willing to impose sanctions on Pyongyang and sees it as mercurial and reckless, but it is not about to strangle it economically.As for the charge of naïveté when it comes to a proposal to begin the partial demilitarization of the peninsula, that’s part and parcel of prevailing Washington orthodoxy, a deep conviction that North Korea will never surrender its nuclear weapons as part of a grand bargain. In fact, progress toward just such a denuclearization was made during Bill Clinton’s presidency, when the sticks were briefly put aside and the carrots brought out. In October 1994, negotiations led to what was called the Agreed Framework.Its details are complicated, so brace yourself for a barebones summary: North Korea agreed to shut down its reactor at Yongbyon, place the plant’s spent fuel in sealed containers for shipment out of the country, stop construction on two larger reactors (at Yongbyon and Taechon), remain a party to the NPT, and permit the IAEA to inspect its nuclear sites to verify the agreement’s implementation. In exchange, the United States, Japan, and South Korea undertook, through a consortium, to build two light-water reactors (LWRs) suitable for generating electricity but not for producing weapons-grade plutonium and to provide Pyongyang with 500,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil pending the completion of the reactors. Eventually, the Agreed Framework fell apart, a development for which all the parties share blame. North Korea’s ongoing missile tests, while not banned by the deal, bolstered the accord’s critics in Washington. It also faced resistance in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, which in 1994 were, for the first time in four decades, in Republican hands, while the Clinton administration proved inept in defending the agreement. Having stopped producing plutonium at Yongbyon, North Korea complained about the delay in building the LWRs. (Work on the first reactor didn’t start until August 2002.) The South Korean government, stuck with partially funding those plants, was unenthusiastic, too.The Bush administration arrived in office in 2001 ready to shred the Agreed Framework. Soon enough, however, it sought to resurrect a version of that deal during the “Six-Party Talks,” which began in 2003 and included both Koreas, the United States, Russia, China, and Japan. Here again, the details are labyrinthine, but the basic formula that emerged did indeed resemble the Agreed Framework: North Korea was to receive both those LWRs and economic aid in exchange for freezing and then dismantling its nuclear program. The North Koreans even allowed American and other technical experts to observe it shutting down the Yongbyon reactor. It also provided reams ― 18,000 pages to be exact ― of documentation on its nuclear program. Most importantly, having frozen plutonium production in 1994, it continued to do so until 2003.For its part, the Bush administration removed North Korea from the State Department’s list of countries accused of sponsoring terrorism and exempted it from the Trading with the Enemy Act. There were also threats, theatrics, and setbacks aplenty. In the end, the Six-Party Talks failed for reasons similar to those that killed the Agreed Framework: quarrels over the nature and scope of verification procedures, North Korea’s missile tests and confirmation of reports that it had embarked on efforts to build uranium-based nuclear weapons, and U.N. sanctions. President George W. Bush, of course, included that country, along with Iran and Iraq, in what he infamously termed the “axis of evil,” which he called a “grave and growing danger” in his January 2002 State of the Union address. His administration also listed North Korea in the 2002 Nuclear Posture Review as one of the states that might become the target of a preventive strike.The lessons to be drawn from this grim record are not that North Korea will not negotiate, let alone that it won’t ever agree to freeze, or even terminate, its nuclear program. Instead, the history of these failed deals should be looked to for ideas on better ways to reach a consensus-based solution. This much remains clear: the more Pyongyang suspects that Washington’s real goal is regime change, the less likely it will be to relinquish its nuclear weapons for fear of suffering the fate of Muammar Gaddafi, who shut down his nuclear program only to be toppled in what began as a U.S. and NATO humanitarian intervention to protect civilians but morphed quickly into a campaign to take him out.North Korea and the Legacy of WarThe notion that North Korea couldn’t possibly fear an American attack and that its claims to the contrary amount to paranoia reflects a stunning ignorance of history. Between 1950 and 1953, North Korea experienced firsthand the devastation the American military machine was capable of inflicting. As Charles Armstrong, a historian of Korea, has written, in those years “American planes dropped 635,000 tons of bombs on Korea ― that is, essentially North Korea ― including 32,557 tons of napalm, compared to 503,000 tons of bombs dropped in the entire Pacific theater of World War II.” Armstrong estimates that 12%-15% of the North Korean population might have died, “a figure close to or surpassing the proportion of Soviet citizens killed in World War II.” As happened during the Anglo-American terror bombing of Germany and Japan, the distinction between civilians and soldiers, so central to International Humanitarian Law and Just War Theory, was defenestrated. Many Americans know about the bombing of Dresden, Berlin, Hamburg, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki and the deliberate targeting of civilians in an attempt to break their morale. But few know what happened to North Korea in the early 1950s. In his haunting book, On the Natural History of Destruction, W.G. Sebald writes that Germans did not discuss the wartime bombings because Nazi crimes made them hesitant to cast moral judgments on other states, no matter what they had done to Germany. There has been no such repression of memory or reticence by the state or the citizenry of North Korea. As a result, the usual dismissals of Pyongyang’s apprehension about what the United States might do to a denuclearized country are both callous and foolish. Successful negotiations would mean taking its security concerns seriously, not rejecting them as paranoid demands, especially given that American military power remains so close, that Washington has threatened to attack the North more than once, and that the American president only recently boasted to the president of the Philippines (in a conversation leaked online) of the two U.S. nuclear submarines that were evidently somewhere off the North Korean coast at that moment.Cutting the Umbilical CordA grand bargain that combines aid and political normalization in return for denuclearization and the pullback and reduction of troops on the Korean peninsula could be made even more attractive to Pyongyang if it included a phased withdrawal of the 28,500 American troops in South Korea. The standard claim ― that this would leave South Korea defenseless ― is ludicrous.South Korea has twice the population of the North: 50.6 million to 25.2 million, and they are better educated, far better fed, and much healthier. Just look at the data on life expectancy, infant mortality, and the amount and quality of calories consumed. The South, then, has far more and better human capital.The gap in economic power is gargantuan. South Korea, an industrial and technological powerhouse, has a $1.5 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), the world’s 12th largest. Valued at $30 billion, North Korea’s ranks 115th internationally, barely ahead of Senegal’s. In other words, South Korea’s economy is about 50 times larger than the North’s, and its per capita GDP ($37,900) exceeds North Korea’s ($1,800 ― and so comparable to South Sudan’s) by a factor of 21. It doesn’t matter whether you’re talking about investments in education and technology or living standards, South Korea inhabits a different universe than the North.Confronted with such economic comparisons your garden variety Washington military wonk might quip, “Fine, but GDP doesn’t fight.” Fair enough, strictly speaking. So let’s ignore the multiple ways in which wealth shapes military power and consider the military data alone. The results may surprise you.According to the most recent State Department estimate, South Korea spends more than seven times what North Korea does on its armed forces. And given the South’s technological prowess and purchases of American arms, it has a far more modern military than the North, which still uses Soviet and Chinese armor and aircraft developed during the 1950s and 1960s. Then there’s the relative burden of military spending. South Korea allocates 2.6% of its GDP to its armed forces, North Korea, 23.3%. In other words, South Korea can easily increase military spending without undue hardship. Not so North Korea.Remember this the next time you hear that the North has many more troops, tanks, artillery, and submarines. Remember as well that the numerical balance is about even or substantially favors the South in other armaments, such as combat aircraft, frigates, and destroyers. In other words, in a future settlement that includes a stage-by-stage U.S. military withdrawal, South Korea will hardly be left defenseless.Averting Apocalypse?Since the end of the Korean War, crises on the peninsula have come and gone. Some have been dangerous indeed. In the run-up to the 1994 Agreed Framework, for example, Defense Secretary William Perry proposed military options that included increasing the number of American troops in South Korea and readying long-range bombers and aircraft carrier battle groups to strike the Yongbyon reactor.Still, the current crisis has no equal. Sitting in the White House is a president whose narcissism knows no bounds, whose ignorance of the world is staggering, who talks blithely about war and nuclear weapons, and who is besieged by political scandals. Meanwhile, North Korea’s ruler, like his predecessors, refuses to be cowed by American shows of force and continues to test ballistic missiles ― three in May alone.A deal resembling the one sketched above may never be reached and, given past history, it won’t be arrived at easily. Yet threats and displays of military power by the United States haven’t worked. Ever. If President Trump acts on the assumption that he and “his” generals can make them work and that North Korea will become reasonable only when faced with the certainty of war, there could be a conflagration on the Korean peninsula the likes of which would be almost unimaginable.Rajan Menon, a TomDispatch regular, is the Anne and Bernard Spitzer Professor of International Relations at the Powell School, City College of New York, and Senior Research Fellow at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies.

There is no underlying hatred of elephants, rhinos, pangolins or any other wild animal. There is, instead, an underlying goal of making money through illegal means.Many of us in the conservation world were thrown off track early on by focusing on the product rather than the network that moves that product. We talked, for example, about stopping elephant poaching, rhino poaching and the illegal trade in birds, but focusing on any one animal blinded us to the reality that there are sophisticated criminal networks orchestrating the widespread killing of wildlife across the globe. The network that moves ivory from Africa is the same network that can move illegal charcoal, cigarettes, stolen pharmaceuticals and sex slaves. It takes large sums of money and a vast communications network. The truth is that if these criminals were not moving ivory, they would simply turn to moving another product, such as arms or drugs.We were slow to turn away from the narrative that poaching is largely driven by poor communities trying to survive. Instead, we know that poor communities are also the victims of criminal gangs that kidnap, torture and hold individuals and communities hostage in their pursuit of illicit gain. Poor villagers are not the masterminds who can deliver illegal wildlife from Africa to Asia. They are, however, a potential partner in creating safe spaces for wildlife and for themselves. In order to create that safe space we, at IFAW, refocused our efforts on creating a network of individuals and organizations that disrupt and destroy criminal networks. Above IFAW’s Chief of Staff, Lt Col Faye Cuevas, explains the tenBoma program. There is much attention given to the use of technology in the effort to provide wildlife security. Technology in and of itself will not lead to the destruction of criminal networks. The realization that technology can help us map the criminal networks that are wreaking destruction, literally plundering the planet, is what is new to the fight to protect wildlife. IFAW’s tenBoma project, launched in Kenya, brings together technology and communities to map wildlife crime so that patterns of criminal behavior emerge and can, therefore, be disrupted. Our goal is to increase the amount of information shared, analyze that information and turn it into actionable intelligence. In other words, we want to stop the criminals before they kill, not just chase them down once they have killed.Above: Nick Hanauer, IFAW’s tenBoma program manager, discusses the role of technology in the fight to protect wildlife. Looking across the landscape, we know that there is so much information out there that can help us stop the killing of incredible creatures around the world. We must convince the people who hold that information to share it. In truth, that is the greatest challenge in creating life-saving intelligence.The news is good. More and more conservation organizations are coming together to form a network to defeat criminal networks and tenBoma is a testament to the effort. The map is filling with dots that expose these criminal networks and our aim is to connect all those dots globally so that we create safe spaces for animals and the people that protect them.To learn more about IFAW and its tenBoma program, please visit: www.ifaw.org/tenBoma."

Human rights groups claim to have documented widespread labor abuses by Yue Yuen, including the company docking workers’ already modest pay for mistakes and running factories where machines sometimes severed workers’ hands and fingers, according to an NJ Advance Media report.“Murphy’s record at Goldman Sachs undercuts what he says on the campaign trail to working families, and it shows that he should not be trusted when he promises to disavow money in politics,” Johnson campaign manager Jocelyn Steinberg said in a Friday statement. “Voters in New Jersey don’t need any more political gimmicks ― they deserve an explanation from Phil Murphy about his time at Goldman Sachs before they head to the polls on June 6.”Murphy’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost, but provided a statement to NJ Advance Media.“These investments were made by a committee at Goldman Sachs’ main office in New York with which Phil had no involvement, well before Phil relocated from Germany to Hong Kong to run Goldman Sachs’ office in Asia,” Murphy spokeswoman Julie Roginsky said in a statement. “Suggesting that Phil is accountable for the decisions of others is irresponsibly deceitful and holds him to an unreasonable standard.”Johnson, 56, a senior Treasury Department official in the Bill Clinton administration, has spent the last several years practicing civil rights law, fighting for greater police accountability. If elected, he would be the Garden State’s first African-American governor. Johnson has nonetheless had a hard time establishing himself as the race’s true progressive, notwithstanding Murphy’s history at the controversial Goldman Sachs and the wave of anti-elite populism sweeping both major parties.Murphy, 59, an ambassador to Germany during the Barack Obama administration, has poured more than $20 million of his own money into his bid, securing the endorsements of major labor unions and former Vice President Joe Biden. He has silenced would-be criticism with an unabashedly liberal platform of support for the $15 minimum wage, marijuana legalization and the creation of a public bank.Polling is sparse in the race, but in a May poll conducted by Stockton University, Murphy had a lead of 24 percentage points over Johnson. Other candidates trailing Johnson include Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who chaired Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign in the state, and state Sen. Ray Lesniak. (Sanders has not endorsed in the race, but his son Levi is backing Murphy.)Candidates from both parties compete in primaries this Tuesday, and the general election will be on Nov. 7. Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno is favored to become the Republican nominee for governor.The race has thus far received little of the attention lavished on the gubernatorial race taking place in Virginia this November or the special congressional elections that will occur in the meantime. But New Jersey presents a prime opportunity for Democrats to flip a governorship and add to a very limited tally of states where they control all branches of state government. Outgoing Republican Gov. Chris Christie has plummeted in popularity, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton beat President Donald Trump by 14 percentage points in the state, making it ripe territory for a Democratic pickup."

This launch brings the aerospace company one step closer to making flights to space more affordable with reused rockets and capsules.A Falcon 9 rocket launched the recycled Dragon capsule at 5:07 p.m. local time Saturday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Shortly after the first-stage booster launched the Dragon into orbit, it fell away from the capsule, flipped around, fired its engines and landed safely at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, according to Florida Today.As ABC News pointed out, used rockets are now returned for a vertical touchdown as part of SpaceX’s efforts to lower the cost of flights. The booster launched Saturday likely will be used again.The Dragon made its first trip to space in 2014, delivering food and supplies to the ISS, according to science news site Phys.org. It was refurbished after landing in the Pacific Ocean intact.Saturday’s refurbished capsule will deliver 6,000 pounds of supplies to the ISS, including mice and flies to be used for research, a roll-up solar panel, food and a neutron star detector, according to NBC News. The flight had been delayed twice due to thunderstorms.“It’s a pre-flown Dragon, and that is a pretty big deal too,” Hans Koenigsmann, SpaceX’s vice president of flight reliability, told Florida Today. “That lines up well with our quest to reuse [vehicles] and reusability, and overall in the long-term lowering the cost of access to space.”The reused Dragon is expected to reach the orbiting lab on Monday. It will be the first returning craft since NASA’s now-retired shuttles.SpaceX celebrated another breakthrough about two months ago when it launched the first recycled orbital rocket, a Falcon 9, from the Kennedy Space Center and successfully landed it on an ocean platform named Of Course I Still Love You.CLARIFICATION: The headline and article have been updated to indicate, as originally reported further down in the piece, that this is SpaceX’s first recycled ship, not the first recycled ships ever used for space travel."

Polls had shown Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leading in the trio of states, and all of them had been won by Democrats in the six presidential elections before last year’s vote.Warner in March told reporters that more than 1,000 paid Internet “trolls” working out of Russia sought to influence the 2016 election in Trump’s favor by disseminating unflattering and, at times, untrue information about Clinton.Clinton in an interview last week also suggested that the Russians could not have known how to “weaponize” the emails they stole from the Democratic National Committee and from her campaign chairman, John Podesta, unless they had been helped “by Americans and guided by people who had polling and data information.”Warner and the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, North Carolina’s Richard Burr, have been examining the question of Russian meddling for months. Last month they issued subpoenas asking Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to turn over documents related to his contacts with Russia. Flynn has refused to comply with that order.Flynn was fired less than a month into the job after reports surfaced that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his discussions with Russians, potentially making him a blackmail target.Trump has vehemently denied that his campaign colluded with the Russian intelligence agencies last year and has called the entire probe “fake news” generated by Democrats to explain how they lost an election they thought they would win.He told the Russian foreign minister and the Russian ambassador to the United States that he had fired FBI Director James Comey last month to take “great pressure” off of himself regarding the agency’s investigation into Flynn’s contact with Russian officials, according to a published report.Comey is scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8 about Trump’s request that he drop the probe, which the then-FBI director refused.U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia worked to hurt Clinton and help Trump during the 2016 election, in part by stealing documents and emails from the Democratic Party and from Clinton’s campaign chairman and then releasing embarrassing ones on a near daily basis in the final weeks of the campaign through WikiLeaks.Trump praised WikiLeaks for doing this in almost every campaign appearance in October, and for months claimed that it was impossible to know who had stolen the emails.That Russian meddling, and possible collusion with the Trump campaign, remains under investigation by the FBI and committees in both the House and Senate. After Trump fired Comey, Trump’s Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller, who headed the FBI from 2001-2013, as special counsel to run the Russia investigation."

It’s always changing. I’ve indicated the same,” he said. “What the president did on Thursday was put America first, and say to the United States and say to the world that we’re going to remain engaged.

Wallace pointed out that the United States already has twice as many people working in the solar energy sector than those working in the coal mining industry.“Aren’t you focusing on the wrong thing?” Wallace asked. “Aren’t you and the president focusing on protecting the horse-and-buggy business just as cars come online?”Pruitt answered that the U.S. needs all forms of energy. “We should not penalize sectors of our economy,” he said, attacking former President Barack Obama’s environmental policies. “The past administration declared a war on coal.”Energy experts, though, agree that coal’s biggest problem is the expansion of natural gas drilling through hydraulic fracturing, which has led to much lower prices for that fuel, which produces much less carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced than does coal.Ironically, Pruitt cited the increased use of natural gas as another reason for leaving the Paris Agreement: that it wasn’t necessary because the U.S. was already reducing carbon dioxide emissions.Chris Wallace’s next guest was former Vice President Al Gore, whose 2006 documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” helped make climate change a more prominent issue. Gore met with Trump during the transition and urged him to stay in the agreement.“It makes no sense to me. I think it was a reckless decision, an indefensible decision,” he said, adding that it was no longer necessary to trust the scientific near-unanimous consensus that human-generated carbon dioxide is largely responsible for climate change. “Every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelations. People are noticing this.”"
