The old, blind, warty and hairless had all showed up to do their worst. But only one of them could emerge victorious, claiming the title of World’s Ugliest Dog.Martha, a 125-pound Neapolitan mastiff, was the “gassy” and droopy-eyed contestant who ended up clinching the top honor. She impressed the judges with her sweet nature, lumbering gait and dangly jowls that spread like melted butter on the stage whenever she’d plop down for a nap during the competition (which was often). According to The New York Times, Martha snoozed and snored when the judges named her the winner. “Do you know you just won the World’s Ugliest Dog Contest?” judge Kerry Sanders of NBC News asked of the sleepy pooch, per AP.“I’d gloat, but I need a nap,” Shirley Zindler, Martha’s handler, responded on her behalf.After Martha’s win was announced, the 3-year-old pooch quickly amassed a fan base on social media, some of whom weren’t too pleased with the “ugly” in her title.But organizers of the annual contest say it isn’t at all about mocking the participants. Instead, it’s about celebrating the unique beauty of all dogs ―including those that may not be considered Westminster-worthy.“We’re proud to celebrate all dogs and pets by showing that no matter their imperfections, they are adoptable, lovable and a great addition to any family,” Erin Post, CEO of the Sonoma-Marin Fair, told NPR. For almost 30 years, the World’s Ugliest Dog contest has been a crowd favorite at the fair. Many of the competitors this year were adopted. In Martha’s case, her previous owner had tried to sell her on Craigslist when Zindler, founder of the Dogwood Animal Rescue Project, intervened. Martha had been almost “blind from neglect,” according to the Times. Several surgeries later, Martha has regained some of her sight. She now lives on a sprawling property in Penngrove, California, with a new adopted family. Scroll down to see more pictures of Martha and her “ugly” competitors, each of them beloved and beautiful in their own way. Also remember to adopt and not shop if you’re thinking of welcoming a new animal into your home. You can visit Petfinder and Adopt-A-Pet, or your local SPCA or rescue shelter."
1,ENTERTAINMENT,Friend Of Late ‘Toy Story’ Writer Reveals What May Be Andy’s Heartbreaking Backstory,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/toy-story-theory-andys-dad-true_us_594f2296e4b0da2c731bf6af,"A Pixar writer called it ""fake news,"" but Mike Mozart stands by his story.",2017-06-25,"Once you read the alleged backstory for Andy's dad, you'll never see the film the same again.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594f3d8c1500001f0090001f.png?cache=4i3gNmmEEZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two days after the friend of a late “Toy Story” writer revealed a previously untold and devastating story about Andy’s dad, a Pixar writer lashed out on Twitter calling it “utterly” false.Let’s back up. This week, Jonathan Carlin of Super Carlin Brothers published his YouTube video interview with Mike Mozart, a toy designer who was friends with Joe Ranft, the Pixar head writer who co-wrote “Toy Story.” According to Carlin’s interview, which went viral this week, Mozart said Ranft had revealed to him over lunch why the dad of main character Andy was suspiciously absent from the film. Mozart told HuffPost he had met Ranft through his work in toy design. Their conversation about Andy’s backstory took place over a decade ago, he said, before Ranft died in 2005.The video of Mozart and Carlin eventually caught the attention of Andrew Stanton, who was on the writing staff with Ranft for the first two “Toy Story” films. Stanton on Saturday rebutted Mozart’s claim that Ranft had a secret backstory by tweeting a link to a news article about Mozart’s interview and calling it, “Complete and utter fake news.” He included the hashtag #Iwasthere.However, Stanton’s tweet did not specify what was fake about the interview and representatives for Stanton and Pixar did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for clarification. Ranft’s story, as Mozart recalled to Carlin, goes like this: Andy’s father is also named Andy. He was the original owner of the Woody doll. As a kid, Andy Sr. was poor, bullied and a huge fan of the TV show “Woody’s Roundup.” He was also the only kid in the world who had Woody, which he received after writing a letter to a cereal company, because the doll was the sole prototype of a marketing gimmick that had been cut short after Woody’s TV show was canceled. (This theory would explain why Woody was considered so rare in the sequel.)Then, Andy Sr. contracted polio and nearly all of his toys ― except for Woody, Slinky and Mr. Potato Head ― were burned as a result. He eventually recovered from the disease, grew up, got married and had a son whom he named after himself. Later in life, Andy Sr. was diagnosed with a fatal case of post-polio syndrome. On his deathbed, Andy Sr. asked his son to retrieve a chest from the attic. By the time Andy Jr. returned with the chest, his father had already died.Andy Jr. opened the chest with a key left to him by his father after the funeral. Inside was Mr. Potato Head, Slinky and, of course, Woody.Despite Stanton’s denial, Mozart stands by the retelling of his conversation with Ranft.“It’s not a theory,” Mozart told HuffPost. “The story was told to me by Joe Ranft about 12 to 14 years ago over lunch.” Mozart said Ranft was so animated and passionate when detailing Andy’s dad’s life that he believed the Pixar writer had created the storyline, at least in his head, for a good deal of time.When asked if he was upset by Stanton’s tweet, Mozart said no, adding that Stanton “never said [Ranft’s story for Andy’s dad] was a lie.”And while Ranft is unfortunately unable to back up Mozart’s claim, one thing is certain: That backstory for Andy is truly heartbreaking.Watch Carlin’s full video with Mozart below."

On June 24, however, he’ll go all out with a no-holds-barred show at New York’s Feinstein’s/54 Below featuring songs made famous by the aforementioned divas, as well as Bernadette Peters and Barbra Streisand. (Catch a sneak peek of Sikes performing a tune from the musical “Gypsy” above.) “Usually my goal is to keep the songbook alive and celebrate the ladies,” Sikes told HuffPost. “But this time, the goal is to get people in a happy, happy mood to go out dancing afterward... what celebrates Pride more than a bunch of diva songs?” What began as a “one-night-only stunt” in 2014 has taken Sikes across the country, and even internationally, since then. Most recently, he celebrated what would have been Garland’s 95th birthday with a performance in London ― a particularly fitting tribute, as the “Wizard of Oz” star capped off her unparalleled career with a string of shows in England’s capital. Of course, Sikes is aware that his Pride weekend show comes at a time when many LGBTQ people are still reeling from the election of President Donald Trump, who ran on an explicitly anti-queer platform. The performer, who has not shied away from politics on social media, won’t mention Trump during his performance, but rather “have some fun” while reminding people that the LGBTQ community is “mighty and not going away.” “I talked a little bit about Trump in my last show,” he said. “But frankly, at this point, I’m so sick of hearing about him and talking about him, I probably won’t bring it up at all this time. Let’s forget the asshole for a moment!” For now, Sikes couldn’t be happier to be honoring Pride with a brand-new show. “I think Pride is about family and community and a celebration of our unique culture. We have a lot of that to celebrate right now ― including our lady icons ― and we have a lot to be grateful for, including marriage equality,” he said. “But we can’t take any of it for granted.” Seth Sikes performs at New York’s Feinstein’s/54 Below June 24.

Among them are 22.5 million refugees who have crossed an international border searching for safety.It’s difficult to know for sure how many of these refugees personally identify as Muslims.

Authorities reduced the number of missing after 15 people were confirmed as safe, the Xinmo village propaganda department said on its microblog.It was not clear if the 15 had been rescued or had simply been away at the time of the disaster.The rescue involved more than 3,000 people despite the danger of more landslides, Xinhua reported.Geological experts said the chances of anyone surviving under the rubble were slim, Xinhua reported.“We weren’t able to pull anyone out alive,” said Wu Youheng, who lives in a neighboring village and rushed to help on Saturday.“We pulled out two people but they were already dead. I think it’s too late, they’re unlikely to find anyone else alive.”The area is prone to landslides but the scale of Saturday’s slide was unprecedented, Wu added.Wu’s wife, Zhang Xiaohong, said they often sleep in other villages for fear of landslides but could not afford to move to a safer part of Mao county.County residents are primarily poor farmers of the Qiang ethnic minority and the area is the target of a poverty alleviation project, government officials said.Much of those efforts focuses on attracting tourists to nearby scenic spots and an ancient village. Xinhua reported that all 142 tourists in the area had been evacuated from the area.The names of the missing were posted on government websites.Wang Yong, a member of China’s State Council, or cabinet, dispatched to the disaster site, urged an all-out search-and-rescue effort and measures to prevent further disasters by monitoring geological activity, Xinhua reported.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in offering his condolences, said in a statement that the United Nations is prepared to offer any support.Sichuan province is prone to earthquakes, including an 8.0 magnitude tremor in central Sichuan’s Wenchuan county in 2008 that killed nearly 70,000 people.(Additional reporting by Reuters television, Jake Spring in BEIJING and Michelle Nichols in NEW YORK; Writing by Jake Spring; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore, Robert Birsel and David Goodman)"
6,WORLD NEWS,Protecting Egypt And Its Coptic Christians,"James Zogby, ContributorPresident, Arab American Institute; Author, ""Arab Voices""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protecting-egypt-and-its-coptic-christians_us_594d8804e4b0f078efd98196,"In many ways, the future of Egypt will be shaped by how the government and the majority of Egyptians treat the country’s",2017-06-24,"A general view is seen as Egyptians gather by a Coptic church that was bombed in Tanta, Egypt, April 9, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594e726d1500004b1f8fff7c.jpeg?ops=crop_0_0_6720_4055%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In many ways, the future of Egypt will be shaped by how the government and the majority of Egyptians treat the country’s minority Christian community. Will Egypt be an open, tolerant, and creative society? Or will it be closed and intolerant, looking backward? This is choice that Egyptians must make.A few months back I accepted an invitation to speak at a mid-June conference organized by Coptic Solidarity, a U.S. organization. I did so because I was eager to address the challenges facing Egypt, in general, and its Coptic community, in particular. A few days before the event, however, I received the final list of the conference speakers and the topics to be discussed. After reviewing the list, I felt obliged to cancel. What follows is what I had hoped to discuss at the event and why I found it necessary to inform the organizers I would not participate.While I am not by profession an “Egypt scholar,” I have visited the country dozens of times, conducted extensive polling of Egyptian public opinion, and, on several occasions, lectured at the Al-Ahram Center for Political & Strategic Studies. Like any person of Arab descent, I love Egypt and its people, and appreciate the enormous contributions Egyptians have made to Arab culture and world civilization. I will never forget the expression Jesse Jackson often used to describe Egypt. He called it “an essential hinge on which hangs the future stability of three continents—Europe, Asia, and Africa.”What concerns me today is that the hinge is rusted and in danger of fracturing. Six years of turmoil following the upheavals of the “Arab Spring” have taken a toll on Egyptian society. The ossification and corruption of the Mubarak government gave way to an elected Muslim Brotherhood government, the policies of which created an existential crisis for many Egyptians. As they saw their vision of an open, pluralistic, creative Egypt giving way to a closed, less tolerant system, they rebelled. The result was a military takeover that gave way to an elected government that has become increasingly repressive, only serving to deepen societal divisions.All of this has been clear from our polling. Six years ago, Egyptians told us that their top concerns were jobs, education, health care, and an end to corruption and nepotism. During the brief tenure of the Muslim Brotherhood’s rule, a decisive majority told us that they disapproved of that party’s efforts to transform Egypt. They wanted change, but decisively favored national dialogue and reconciliation as the way forward. Today, three-quarters of Egyptians say their country is moving in the wrong direction and have little confidence that the future will be better. More ominous, our polling also shows demonstrably less tolerance and acceptance for people of other faiths.All of this unrest, uncertainty, and discontent has had repercussions for Egyptian society. Some supporters of the deposed Brotherhood have struck out at Christians — accusing them of complicity in the military action.One can hardly fault the Coptic leadership. They were and are in a bind. The intolerant policies of the Brotherhood most certainly put them at risk. And while the significant gestures of the new government have indicated respect for Christians and offered them signs of protection, mass repression and failure to improve the quality of life have only served to fuel greater discontent, exacerbating sectarian tensions.Feeding off this discontent, violent extremist groups have committed repeated heinous acts of terror against Christians in an effort to further aggravate the already deplorable situation. And so, we find the country today locked in a vicious cycle of repression and violence.Friends of Egypt are also caught in a bind. Those who understand Egypt’s important role have attempted to buttress the state by providing substantial investment to develop its struggling economy. But they cannot, by themselves, force the government to make the right decisions and change direction.This was the dilemma I had hoped to discuss at the Coptic Solidarity event and then, just a few days before the conference, I received the final program and list of speakers. I was troubled to find that the session at which I was to appear had changed. I was prepared to address issues facing the Coptic community in Egypt and how we might act to support policies that both protect them now, while helping to move Egypt toward becoming a more open and tolerant society that respects the rights of all its citizens. Instead I discovered that the title for my session had been changed to — “The Indigenous Culture of Violence and Impunity” — implying that there was something endemic in Egyptian or Muslim culture that was at fault.While I knew and respected some of the event’s invited speakers, I was deeply concerned with others, some of whom represent groups that are on the Southern Poverty Law Center list of hate groups in America. These are individuals and organizations that have made a career out of spreading hurtful anti-Arab and anti-Muslim propaganda. They do not work to promote positive change in Egypt and to help build a more open society that will protect the rights of all. Instead, they are more focused on waging a war on Muslims and Islam, in general.Association with individuals and groups that fan the flames of hatred and division does not help protect vulnerable Christians in the Middle East. It may even put them at risk. I, therefore, felt compelled to withdraw from the event.Follow @jjz1600 for more."

To the Ambassador’s left sat Ambassador Ahmed’s friend, Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, and Rabbi Batya Steinlauf. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594ea47b1500004d1f8fffb7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Political commentator Bill Maher, his voice dripping with the vitriol which he reserves for Islam, made the claim last week when interviewing Breitbart Editor Alex Marlow on his HBO program, Real Time with Bill Maher, that interfaith dialogue and tolerance of other religions is not possible in the Muslim world. He particularly singled out Pakistan, going so far as to say, “I don’t think the idea that ‘Oh, you know what, there are many ways to God, they’re all valid, let’s agree to disagree’ -- I don’t think that’s a thing you find in Pakistan a lot.”I found it ironic then that on June 20, a mere four days after Maher’s program aired, Ambassador Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, the former Foreign Secretary of Pakistan and one of the nation’s senior most diplomats, hosted an interfaith Iftar at the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, DC, welcoming some of Washington’s most prominent interfaith leaders. As an embassy abroad is considered to be the terrain of the nation it represents, we were on Pakistani territory. The 250 prominent Muslim and non-Muslims in attendance—ambassadors, senior State Department officials, journalists, and community and religious leaders—filled the hall to capacity. Distinguished speakers representing the major faiths addressed the gathering and emphasized the need to build bridges between religions. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the former Catholic Archbishop of Washington and an active player in global peace and humanitarian initiatives, traveling often on behalf of Catholic Relief Services around the globe, gave a remarkable speech emphasizing the closeness of Islam and Christianity. In particular, he noted how both faiths love and revere the Virgin Mary. Cardinal McCarrick also said he was thrilled to announce that the Holy Father, Pope Francis, is preparing to visit Pakistan soon, saying how His Holiness is particularly excited about his visit. Cardinal McCarrick believes His Holiness will fall in love with Pakistan. Representing Hinduism was Nanik Lahori, a member of the Boards of Directors of both the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington, DC and the United Hindu and Jain Temples Association. He discussed how Allah and Brahma, the names of God in Islam and Hinduism, represent the same reality, and how as such, it is of the utmost importance that we as Muslims and Hindus treat each other as part of a common humanity. Dr. Rajwant Singh, the Founder and Chairman of the Sikh Council on Religion and Education and the former president of the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington, as well as a prolific interfaith leader on the national stage on behalf of the Sikh community, spoke about how close Islam is to Sikhism and how the sacred scripture of the Sikhs is replete with sayings and verses of Baba Farid, the great Sufi saint. Dr. Singh, drawing parallels between Islam and Sikhism and noting how peace, love, and humility lie at the heart of both traditions, also quoted several verses of Baba Farid, a Sufi saint, and Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion who is known for such quotes as, “Even Kings and emperors with heaps of wealth and vast dominion cannot compare with an ant filled with the love of God.”Also speaking were Rabbi Batya Steinlauf, a Conservative rabbi who serves both as the Director of Social Justice and Intergroup Relations at the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington and as Vice President of the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington, who gave the Jewish perspective, and Jo Reed, a Director at Soka Gakkai International-USA, representing the Buddhist faith. Both cited their respective sacred scriptures.I was honored to once again be requested to speak on behalf of Islam as part of the Iftar. I opened my remarks by discussing how the Bismillah cites the two greatest names of God, Rahman and Rahim, or the Compassionate and Merciful, out of the 99 beautiful names in the holy Quran. It is repeated all day throughout the world by millions of Muslims.I also shared with the audience several insightful verses from the Quran which I believe are not cited often enough, particularly in these times of great turmoil around the globe. I first read aloud, ""And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variations in your languages and your colours: verily in that are Signs for those who know"" (30:22). Next, I read to the audience, ""O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other))"" (49:13). I concluded this portion of my remarks with the verse, ""Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things"" (2:256).I additionally discussed the importance of ilm, or knowledge, which is the second most-used word in the Quran and went on to conclude with my favorite saying of the Prophet (PBUH): “The ink of the scholar is more sacred than the blood of the martyr.” Following the remarks of myself and the other speakers, Ambassador Chaudhry spoke about the importance of religious tolerance in our diverse and conflicted world today and about countering the ongoing threat and inherent closed-mindedness of terrorism. He also emphasized that Islam is a religion of peace - a sentiment often forgotten in the West. To underline his points, the Ambassador quoted the famous speech of Mr M.A.Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, delivered before the Constituent Assembly in 1947: “You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed -- that has nothing to do with the business of the State.” (For more on Mr. Jinnah, please see my documentary, Mr. Jinnah: The Making of Pakistan, linked below) The Ambassador also quoted the Farewell Sermon of the holy Prophet (PBUH): “O people! Indeed, your Lord is one and your father is one. Indeed, there is no superiority of an Arab over a non-Arab, nor of a non-Arab over an Arab, nor of a white over a black, nor a black over a white, except by taqwa (piety).” When I mentioned to Ambassador Chaudhry the irony of Bill Maher’s remarks in the context of the interfaith conviviality around us as we broke our fast, the Ambassador smiled broadly. Perhaps he was thinking that Bill Maher should have joined us for this year’s interfaith Iftar and seen for himself how Pakistan and other Muslim countries, in spite of the serious challenges they face, such as terrorism, can be great centers of bridge building and dialogue between faiths.

Sheila Jackson Lee to the Embassy of Pakistan’s interfaith Iftar. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594ea4b015000029008fffb9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Political commentator Bill Maher, his voice dripping with the vitriol which he reserves for Islam, made the claim last week when interviewing Breitbart Editor Alex Marlow on his HBO program, Real Time with Bill Maher, that interfaith dialogue and tolerance of other religions is not possible in the Muslim world. He particularly singled out Pakistan, going so far as to say, “I don’t think the idea that ‘Oh, you know what, there are many ways to God, they’re all valid, let’s agree to disagree’ -- I don’t think that’s a thing you find in Pakistan a lot.”I found it ironic then that on June 20, a mere four days after Maher’s program aired, Ambassador Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, the former Foreign Secretary of Pakistan and one of the nation’s senior most diplomats, hosted an interfaith Iftar at the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, DC, welcoming some of Washington’s most prominent interfaith leaders. As an embassy abroad is considered to be the terrain of the nation it represents, we were on Pakistani territory. The 250 prominent Muslim and non-Muslims in attendance—ambassadors, senior State Department officials, journalists, and community and religious leaders—filled the hall to capacity. Distinguished speakers representing the major faiths addressed the gathering and emphasized the need to build bridges between religions. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the former Catholic Archbishop of Washington and an active player in global peace and humanitarian initiatives, traveling often on behalf of Catholic Relief Services around the globe, gave a remarkable speech emphasizing the closeness of Islam and Christianity. In particular, he noted how both faiths love and revere the Virgin Mary. Cardinal McCarrick also said he was thrilled to announce that the Holy Father, Pope Francis, is preparing to visit Pakistan soon, saying how His Holiness is particularly excited about his visit. Cardinal McCarrick believes His Holiness will fall in love with Pakistan. Representing Hinduism was Nanik Lahori, a member of the Boards of Directors of both the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington, DC and the United Hindu and Jain Temples Association. He discussed how Allah and Brahma, the names of God in Islam and Hinduism, represent the same reality, and how as such, it is of the utmost importance that we as Muslims and Hindus treat each other as part of a common humanity. Dr. Rajwant Singh, the Founder and Chairman of the Sikh Council on Religion and Education and the former president of the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington, as well as a prolific interfaith leader on the national stage on behalf of the Sikh community, spoke about how close Islam is to Sikhism and how the sacred scripture of the Sikhs is replete with sayings and verses of Baba Farid, the great Sufi saint. Dr. Singh, drawing parallels between Islam and Sikhism and noting how peace, love, and humility lie at the heart of both traditions, also quoted several verses of Baba Farid, a Sufi saint, and Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion who is known for such quotes as, “Even Kings and emperors with heaps of wealth and vast dominion cannot compare with an ant filled with the love of God.”Also speaking were Rabbi Batya Steinlauf, a Conservative rabbi who serves both as the Director of Social Justice and Intergroup Relations at the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington and as Vice President of the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington, who gave the Jewish perspective, and Jo Reed, a Director at Soka Gakkai International-USA, representing the Buddhist faith. Both cited their respective sacred scriptures.I was honored to once again be requested to speak on behalf of Islam as part of the Iftar. I opened my remarks by discussing how the Bismillah cites the two greatest names of God, Rahman and Rahim, or the Compassionate and Merciful, out of the 99 beautiful names in the holy Quran. It is repeated all day throughout the world by millions of Muslims.I also shared with the audience several insightful verses from the Quran which I believe are not cited often enough, particularly in these times of great turmoil around the globe. I first read aloud, ""And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variations in your languages and your colours: verily in that are Signs for those who know"" (30:22). Next, I read to the audience, ""O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other))"" (49:13). I concluded this portion of my remarks with the verse, ""Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things"" (2:256).I additionally discussed the importance of ilm, or knowledge, which is the second most-used word in the Quran and went on to conclude with my favorite saying of the Prophet (PBUH): “The ink of the scholar is more sacred than the blood of the martyr.” Following the remarks of myself and the other speakers, Ambassador Chaudhry spoke about the importance of religious tolerance in our diverse and conflicted world today and about countering the ongoing threat and inherent closed-mindedness of terrorism.

9,POLITICS,They Only See Us As Problems,"Madeleine Burnside, ContributorEditor, The Sanity Papers",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/they-only-see-us-as-problems_us_594ecf95e4b0326c0a8d08f4,A friend of mine expressed his despair over the current state of our political climate in an email this week: “There seems,2017-06-24,"<p>Rally to protect Medicare and Medicaid, Bakersfield, CA, January 2017</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594ed23a1700002a001029e6.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A friend of mine expressed his despair over the current state of our political climate in an email this week:“There seems to be a critical mass … of so many disparate yet complementary elements working against the good, it feels overwhelming.”So Trump has reneged on the promise that his health care plan would be more cost-effective and protect a larger share of Americans than the ACA. I never believed him to begin with. Although I knew Obamacare could stand improvement, I also understood that its structure was designed to work by being amendable over time. Now, an $800 billion dollar tax cut for the rich, funded by an even bigger drawdown from Medicaid, seems like just another form of everyday corruption that we’re getting used to under the current administration.But I care about the actual effect of the Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act—the numbers of people who will be hurt. This bill rips health care away from over 24 million people, a conservative estimate at best, and one that fails to account for its broader economic and social impact. Our population this year is around 326,500,000, so perhaps this seems like a smallish number, but that’s not the right way to measure it. Medicaid and CHIP (the Children’s Health Insurance Program) serve roughly 74 million people, about 68 million adults and over 5 million children. These cuts would directly affect more than a third of them, many of whom could be forced to endure curable illnesses, unmanaged disabilities, chronic diseases, or preventable deaths. And the damage to our clinical infrastructure and local economies—regional hospitals, nursing homes, visiting care programs, providers, community businesses, and average wage earners—has the potential to bring widespread dislocation.Yes, I have written to my senators ― Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio ― but I already know how they’re each going to vote. There’s no moving Rubio, because he’s aligned to the collective political liability created by Republicans’ seven-year drumbeat of repeal-and-replace. They see this as “their day” and to hell with the country or the basic welfare of its people. And we continue resisting: For a great story on how some disabled activists have been fighting back this week, take a look at Rachel Maddow’s broadcast of June 22.In the middle of writing this, there was a power failure and my Internet access died. I called my provider and nothing they could do remotely worked. A technician arrived the next morning and quickly sorted things out, plus he was able to explain it and tell me what to look for. We are both immigrants, and we got to talking about politics. He voted but did not campaign. I admitted the same. In his strong Caribbean accent he told me he felt responsibility for Trump being in power and that I should too. We agreed we wouldn’t let that happen again—he’s going to involve all his friends, family, and neighbors in the 2018 midterms. Intelligent and curious, he has taken himself far beyond the prospects of his high-school education. He is equipped not only with facts and figures but with an analysis of his own.“The thing about the Republicans,” he told me, “is that they don’t see us as people, they see us as problems.”This blog was previously published on sanitypapers.com, June 24, 2017."

If you have children, then your trip will be nothing like your romantic trip to the all inclusive resort where you had two massages per day and stayed hydrated on coconuts and Heineken. Rather than fruity drinks and tropical oils, you can expect sour milk in a sippy cup and an ammonia backpack that makes your eyes water when you open it to find that water balloon diaper you stuffed there ten hours ago in the museum. Forget the romantic dinners and the walks along the beach. You will enjoy left over yogurt puffs scrounged from the seat of the stroller and an endless loop of the Dora the Explorer theme song playing in your head as you try to fall asleep for a momentary reprieve from vacation hell. Why would anyone travel with young kids?! Over the last nine years, my wife and I have travelled with our young children to thirty-nine countries. Okay, maybe it’s forty-something. I’m not really counting anymore. We did not take a year off from work for a worldwide sojourn and we are not the hardcore backpacking types. I am a lawyer and my wife is a speech language pathologist. I am employed full time and we have a house, a collection of various kid’s toys, and an oak kitchen table that we bought at an unfinished wood store with the money from our wedding and stained ourselves. In short, we are regular people. We are not experts, but we have learned a few things along the way about traveling with young kids. Here are six tips that will help you have the best summer vacation ever. 1. Plan Less.Family travel is a different animal from single travel or couple’s travel. It is almost an entirely different species. Don’t compare them in your mind and don’t expect your family trip to even resemble your single trip. It is like the difference between chocolate ice cream and pâté. They are both great, but if you are expecting one and get the other, you are in for a nasty surprise. It’s the same with family travel. It’s great! It’s rewarding, life changing, and bonding for your family. But it will not be like your summer spent backpacking in Europe. The biggest lesson I have learned over our many adventures is that a trip is better when I put less into the itinerary. We are slow and cumbersome. We tire easily. We have a limited capacity. In Kyoto, Japan, I had a litany of sights we were going to see with our five and two year old. Instead, we ended up walking along the river under the cherry blossoms. My wife was pregnant with baby number three and suffering serious morning sickness. Nearly everything we ate made her nauseous and the kids just weren’t that interested in sushi and octopus or historic temples. We didn’t make it to any of the sights I had planned. We did, however, find an ancient playground along the river with a slide and a few swings. The kids loved it. I wrestled with my inner voice that said we should be seeing all the “must see sights.” I finally silenced that voice and just enjoyed the magic of the moment, listening to my kids squeal with delight underneath a canopy of perfect pink blossoms. In Sri Lanka, Sigiriya Rock and Dambulla Cave Temple were enough for one day. We were hot and exhausted after just two items on our expansive itinerary. We passed on the remaining things we had planned for the day and went back to swim in the pool. It’s okay to say no. It’s okay to miss sights in order to gain a shared experience with your kids. In Ireland we saw some amazing things. We drove around the Dingle Peninsula, explored Galway and Dublin, and climbed on the Giant’s Causeway outside of Belfast. However, the kids’ favorite activity was a picnic of sandwiches, cheese, and lunch meat that we ate on the grass outside of a gas station. Plan less and slow down! 2. Raise Your Expectations.Even though we plan less, we expect a lot of the kids. Travel is a chance for them to gain competencies and abilities they will need in life. Travel is a stretching experience that requires kids to step out of their comfort zones and helps them grow. Travel will give them a chance to be uncomfortable, eat food they may not like, do things they may not enjoy, and carry their own weight, literally and figuratively. For starters, the act of traveling by car or by plane is often tedious and boring. They may be tired and uncomfortable. That is no excuse to have a bad attitude or a tantrum. When we fly to the United States to visit family, the door-to-door trip from our house in the Middle East to our destination in the United States usually lasts at least twenty-four hours. We still expect the kids to behave. These marathon flights have helped the kids become more resilient. They have learned that no matter how tired they are, no matter how hungry or uncomfortable they might feel, there is no excuse for a tantrum. And that’s an important lesson, really. We all hope for the best for our children, but no matter how well we plan, there is no way to protect them from the pains of life. The only thing we can do is help them develop the resilience to deal with whatever comes their way. That starts with higher expectations. Plan an itinerary that is fun for everyone. I find it is best to mix things up with big city time as well as time in nature. Mix historical sights with down-time at a park. Just because you are travelling with young children, doesn’t mean that the trip has to be kid-centric. In Belgium, we walked through First World War trenches. In Normandy, we contemplated Omaha Beach and the American Cemetery. In Hiroshima, we explored the Peace Memorial Museum and learned about the devastation of the atomic bomb. It is an intense place and at one point our five year old started crying. It gave us a chance to talk about war and violence and what we can do in our lives to live at peace with others. I want my children to understand, as Henri Nouwen said, that “[i]n the face of the oppressed I recognize my own face, and in the hands of the oppressor I recognize my own hands.” At Petra in Jordan, we hiked over thirteen miles with three young kids. It was a stretch for our four-year-old, and by the end of the day we were all exhausted, but everyone made it. The kids ended the day with a sense of accomplishment. In Vienna, we attended a Bach and Mozart choral Christmas concert at St. Stephen’s Cathedral with a three-year-old and a six-week-old. Before we went inside, we talked to the three-year-old about our expectations and what was appropriate inside the cathedral. She made it through the entire concert without a peep. Similarly, the kids were excited to see the Prado Museum in Madrid and chatted with the docents. Our travel experiences have led me to one inescapable conclusion – children will rise or sink to whatever expectations you establish. Raise your expectations to give your kids the best trip possible. 3. Practice a Spirit of Active Travel Now.You don’t have to go around the world to travel. You don’t even have to leave your town. For me travel is questioning. It is asking the who, what, when, where, why, and how of everything around me. It is learning the stories of those who have gone before and realizing that they were not that different from me. It is questioning the things in my life of which I am certain and daring to ask, “what am I missing? What am I failing to see? How might I be wrong? How does life look different from another perspective?” No matter your location or income you can travel today by actively looking at the world around you. This is something we practice with our kids every day. We look at bugs outside. We walk around the neighborhood collecting rocks. We talk about the plants that are blooming. We go into our local town in the Middle East and practice haggling. In South Florida, we explored local state parks. Most of our “travel” is done in our neighborhood. That means that when we go on a trip, we don’t really stray from our usual routine. We do the same exploring as always just in a new location. Take your kids to the grocery store. Look at the produce. Practice picking out the perfect avocado. Talk about where avocados grow and try growing one of your own. This is what active travel looks like. It requires something of the traveler but it also rewards the active traveler with riches never found by passive tourists.4. Take Advantage of Having Mini-Ambassadors with You.Traveling with a child is like bringing along a mini-ambassador who will open up doors of cultural interaction that you would never have otherwise. When you travel with young children you draw a lot of attention. In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, we attended the annual Janadriyah festival. In the evening we sat on the ground to eat a traditional Arab meal of rice and roasted lamb slow cooked over hot coals in a hole in the ground. Relaxing on the ground, I practiced eating with my fingers in the traditional style. Before we could stop her, our toddler waddled over to a group of completely covered women and dove into one woman’s lap. Burning with embarrassment, I ran to grab my daughter. The women laughed and fed our daughter sweets while they took pictures of her on their phones.Trick-or-treating through Bangkok with two little kids, I met people I would have never met on my own. In Istanbul, a concerned Turkish mother was certain my baby would catch a deadly cold because she was wearing sandals. The mother insisted on giving me socks for the baby. In Spain, our youngest of three flirted with the flight attendants. In Lebanon and Jordan we had more conversations than I can recall about children and how they are God’s ultimate gift. You cannot be low profile with young children. Go with it and take advantage of all the new friends you will meet on your next trip because of your kids. 5. Pack Less.My favorite travel writer, Rick Steves, https://www.ricksteves.com says there are travelers who pack light and travelers who wish they had. The same is true of travel with kids. On one of our first multi-country trips with a baby, we went to Norway, Denmark, and England. I still remember changing trains at Victoria Station on the London Underground with two giant suitcases in each hand and a huge baby cot. As I struggled up the steps of the station, an elderly woman pleaded with me to let her carry one of the suitcases. When you have so much luggage that old women feel pity for you and want to carry your stuff, you are doing something wrong! I vowed then and there to do better the next time. Last summer we took all three kids on a ten-day road trip around Iceland. We fit everything for five people into two duffle bags. Believe me, you will be happier with less. 6. Stop Comparing.When I first started travelling with the kids I kept a list of all the places we had been and shared it with everyone. I was determined that our daughter would make it to twenty-four countries in twenty-four months. We accomplished the goal and do you know what happened? Nothing! No one cared. I came to understand that the checklists and maps with pins in them to show all the visited cities mattered only to me. No one else was paying attention. When you travel this summer, you are taking the trip for you, not for anyone else. Make a conscious effort to let go of thoughts and concerns of whether or not this trip is good enough and comparisons to someone else’s trip. Release any spirit of competitiveness or keeping up with others. You are not in competition. You are on the trip to build experiences and a deeper relationship with your family. Who cares what anyone else thinks!"

Relaxing on the ground, I practiced eating with my fingers in the traditional style. Before we could stop her, our toddler waddled over to a group of completely covered women and dove into one woman’s lap. Burning with embarrassment, I ran to grab my daughter. The women laughed and fed our daughter sweets while they took pictures of her on their phones.Trick-or-treating through Bangkok with two little kids, I met people I would have never met on my own. In Istanbul, a concerned Turkish mother was certain my baby would catch a deadly cold because she was wearing sandals. The mother insisted on giving me socks for the baby. In Spain, our youngest of three flirted with the flight attendants. In Lebanon and Jordan we had more conversations than I can recall about children and how they are God’s ultimate gift. You cannot be low profile with young children. Go with it and take advantage of all the new friends you will meet on your next trip because of your kids. 5. Pack Less.My favorite travel writer, Rick Steves, https://www.ricksteves.com says there are travelers who pack light and travelers who wish they had. The same is true of travel with kids. On one of our first multi-country trips with a baby, we went to Norway, Denmark, and England. I still remember changing trains at Victoria Station on the London Underground with two giant suitcases in each hand and a huge baby cot. As I struggled up the steps of the station, an elderly woman pleaded with me to let her carry one of the suitcases. When you have so much luggage that old women feel pity for you and want to carry your stuff, you are doing something wrong! I vowed then and there to do better the next time. Last summer we took all three kids on a ten-day road trip around Iceland. We fit everything for five people into two duffle bags. Believe me, you will be happier with less. 6. Stop Comparing.When I first started travelling with the kids I kept a list of all the places we had been and shared it with everyone. I was determined that our daughter would make it to twenty-four countries in twenty-four months. We accomplished the goal and do you know what happened? Nothing! No one cared. I came to understand that the checklists and maps with pins in them to show all the visited cities mattered only to me. No one else was paying attention. When you travel this summer, you are taking the trip for you, not for anyone else. Make a conscious effort to let go of thoughts and concerns of whether or not this trip is good enough and comparisons to someone else’s trip. Release any spirit of competitiveness or keeping up with others. You are not in competition. You are on the trip to build experiences and a deeper relationship with your family. Who cares what anyone else thinks!"

If you have children, then your trip will be nothing like your romantic trip to the all inclusive resort where you had two massages per day and stayed hydrated on coconuts and Heineken. Rather than fruity drinks and tropical oils, you can expect sour milk in a sippy cup and an ammonia backpack that makes your eyes water when you open it to find that water balloon diaper you stuffed there ten hours ago in the museum. Forget the romantic dinners and the walks along the beach. You will enjoy left over yogurt puffs scrounged from the seat of the stroller and an endless loop of the Dora the Explorer theme song playing in your head as you try to fall asleep for a momentary reprieve from vacation hell. Why would anyone travel with young kids?! Over the last nine years, my wife and I have travelled with our young children to thirty-nine countries. Okay, maybe it’s forty-something. I’m not really counting anymore. We did not take a year off from work for a worldwide sojourn and we are not the hardcore backpacking types. I am a lawyer and my wife is a speech language pathologist. I am employed full time and we have a house, a collection of various kid’s toys, and an oak kitchen table that we bought at an unfinished wood store with the money from our wedding and stained ourselves. In short, we are regular people. We are not experts, but we have learned a few things along the way about traveling with young kids. Here are six tips that will help you have the best summer vacation ever. 1. Plan Less.Family travel is a different animal from single travel or couple’s travel. It is almost an entirely different species. Don’t compare them in your mind and don’t expect your family trip to even resemble your single trip. It is like the difference between chocolate ice cream and pâté. They are both great, but if you are expecting one and get the other, you are in for a nasty surprise. It’s the same with family travel. It’s great! It’s rewarding, life changing, and bonding for your family. But it will not be like your summer spent backpacking in Europe. The biggest lesson I have learned over our many adventures is that a trip is better when I put less into the itinerary. We are slow and cumbersome. We tire easily. We have a limited capacity. In Kyoto, Japan, I had a litany of sights we were going to see with our five and two year old. Instead, we ended up walking along the river under the cherry blossoms. My wife was pregnant with baby number three and suffering serious morning sickness. Nearly everything we ate made her nauseous and the kids just weren’t that interested in sushi and octopus or historic temples. We didn’t make it to any of the sights I had planned. We did, however, find an ancient playground along the river with a slide and a few swings. The kids loved it. I wrestled with my inner voice that said we should be seeing all the “must see sights.” I finally silenced that voice and just enjoyed the magic of the moment, listening to my kids squeal with delight underneath a canopy of perfect pink blossoms. In Sri Lanka, Sigiriya Rock and Dambulla Cave Temple were enough for one day. We were hot and exhausted after just two items on our expansive itinerary. We passed on the remaining things we had planned for the day and went back to swim in the pool. It’s okay to say no. It’s okay to miss sights in order to gain a shared experience with your kids. In Ireland we saw some amazing things. We drove around the Dingle Peninsula, explored Galway and Dublin, and climbed on the Giant’s Causeway outside of Belfast. However, the kids’ favorite activity was a picnic of sandwiches, cheese, and lunch meat that we ate on the grass outside of a gas station. Plan less and slow down! 2. Raise Your Expectations.Even though we plan less, we expect a lot of the kids. Travel is a chance for them to gain competencies and abilities they will need in life. Travel is a stretching experience that requires kids to step out of their comfort zones and helps them grow. Travel will give them a chance to be uncomfortable, eat food they may not like, do things they may not enjoy, and carry their own weight, literally and figuratively. For starters, the act of traveling by car or by plane is often tedious and boring. They may be tired and uncomfortable. That is no excuse to have a bad attitude or a tantrum. When we fly to the United States to visit family, the door-to-door trip from our house in the Middle East to our destination in the United States usually lasts at least twenty-four hours. We still expect the kids to behave. These marathon flights have helped the kids become more resilient. They have learned that no matter how tired they are, no matter how hungry or uncomfortable they might feel, there is no excuse for a tantrum. And that’s an important lesson, really. We all hope for the best for our children, but no matter how well we plan, there is no way to protect them from the pains of life. The only thing we can do is help them develop the resilience to deal with whatever comes their way. That starts with higher expectations. Plan an itinerary that is fun for everyone. I find it is best to mix things up with big city time as well as time in nature. Mix historical sights with down-time at a park. Just because you are travelling with young children, doesn’t mean that the trip has to be kid-centric. In Belgium, we walked through First World War trenches. In Normandy, we contemplated Omaha Beach and the American Cemetery. In Hiroshima, we explored the Peace Memorial Museum and learned about the devastation of the atomic bomb. It is an intense place and at one point our five year old started crying. It gave us a chance to talk about war and violence and what we can do in our lives to live at peace with others. I want my children to understand, as Henri Nouwen said, that “[i]n the face of the oppressed I recognize my own face, and in the hands of the oppressor I recognize my own hands.” At Petra in Jordan, we hiked over thirteen miles with three young kids. It was a stretch for our four-year-old, and by the end of the day we were all exhausted, but everyone made it. The kids ended the day with a sense of accomplishment. In Vienna, we attended a Bach and Mozart choral Christmas concert at St. Stephen’s Cathedral with a three-year-old and a six-week-old. Before we went inside, we talked to the three-year-old about our expectations and what was appropriate inside the cathedral. She made it through the entire concert without a peep. Similarly, the kids were excited to see the Prado Museum in Madrid and chatted with the docents. Our travel experiences have led me to one inescapable conclusion – children will rise or sink to whatever expectations you establish. Raise your expectations to give your kids the best trip possible. 3. Practice a Spirit of Active Travel Now.You don’t have to go around the world to travel. You don’t even have to leave your town. For me travel is questioning. It is asking the who, what, when, where, why, and how of everything around me. It is learning the stories of those who have gone before and realizing that they were not that different from me. It is questioning the things in my life of which I am certain and daring to ask, “what am I missing? What am I failing to see? How might I be wrong? How does life look different from another perspective?” No matter your location or income you can travel today by actively looking at the world around you. This is something we practice with our kids every day. We look at bugs outside. We walk around the neighborhood collecting rocks. We talk about the plants that are blooming. We go into our local town in the Middle East and practice haggling. In South Florida, we explored local state parks. Most of our “travel” is done in our neighborhood. That means that when we go on a trip, we don’t really stray from our usual routine. We do the same exploring as always just in a new location. Take your kids to the grocery store. Look at the produce. Practice picking out the perfect avocado. Talk about where avocados grow and try growing one of your own. This is what active travel looks like. It requires something of the traveler but it also rewards the active traveler with riches never found by passive tourists.4. Take Advantage of Having Mini-Ambassadors with You.Traveling with a child is like bringing along a mini-ambassador who will open up doors of cultural interaction that you would never have otherwise. When you travel with young children you draw a lot of attention. In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, we attended the annual Janadriyah festival. In the evening we sat on the ground to eat a traditional Arab meal of rice and roasted lamb slow cooked over hot coals in a hole in the ground. Relaxing on the ground, I practiced eating with my fingers in the traditional style. Before we could stop her, our toddler waddled over to a group of completely covered women and dove into one woman’s lap. Burning with embarrassment, I ran to grab my daughter. The women laughed and fed our daughter sweets while they took pictures of her on their phones.Trick-or-treating through Bangkok with two little kids, I met people I would have never met on my own.

13,BUSINESS,How Successful People Stay Productive And In Control,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-successful-people-stay-productive-and-in-control_us_594c1b73e4b07cdb1933c0d0,"When they slip up, they simply forgive themselves and move on.",2017-06-24,<p>The hallmark of emotional intelligence is self-control a skill that unleashes massive productivity by keeping you focused and on track. Dr. Travis Bradberry shows you how to increase yours.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594c1b8015000025008ffba3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TalentSmart has tested more than a million people and found that the upper echelons of top performance are filled with people who are high in emotional intelligence (90 percent of top performers, to be exact). The hallmark of emotional intelligence is self-control—a skill that unleashes massive productivity by keeping you focused and on track.Unfortunately, self-control is a difficult skill to rely on. Self-control is so fleeting for most people that when Martin Seligman and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania surveyed two million people and asked them to rank order their strengths in 24 different skills, self-control ended up in the very bottom slot.And when your self-control leaves something to be desired, so does your productivity.When it comes to self-control, it is so easy to focus on your failures that your successes tend to pale in comparison. And why shouldn’t they? Self-control is an effort that’s intended to help achieve a goal. Failing to control yourself is just that—a failure. If you’re trying to avoid digging into that bag of chips after dinner because you want to lose a few pounds and you succeed Monday and Tuesday nights only to succumb to temptation on Wednesday by eating four servings’ worth of the empty calories, your failure outweighs your success. You’ve taken two steps forward and four steps back.Since self-control is something we could all use a little help with, I went back to the data to uncover the kinds of things that emotionally intelligent people do to keep themselves productive and in control. They consciously apply these twelve behaviors because they know they work. Some are obvious, others counter-intuitive, but all will help you minimize those pesky failures to boost your productivity.1. They Forgive ThemselvesA vicious cycle of failing to control oneself followed by feeling intense self-hatred and disgust is common in attempts at self-control. These emotions typically lead to over-indulging in the offending behavior. When you slip up, it is critical that you forgive yourself and move on. Don’t ignore how the mistake makes you feel; just don’t wallow in it. Instead, shift your attention to what you’re going to do to improve yourself in the future.Failure can erode your self-confidence and make it hard to believe you’ll achieve a better outcome in the future. Most of the time, failure results from taking risks and trying to achieve something that isn’t easy. Emotionally intelligent people know that success lies in their ability to rise in the face of failure, and they can’t do this when they’re living in the past. Anything worth achieving is going to require you to take some risks, and you can’t allow failure to stop you from believing in your ability to succeed. When you live in the past, that is exactly what happens, and your past becomes your present, preventing you from moving forward.2. They Don’t Say Yes Unless They Really Want To Research conducted at the University of California Berkeley shows that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression, all of which erode self-control. Saying no is indeed a major self-control challenge for many people. “No” is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it’s time to say no, emotionally intelligent people avoid phrases like “I don’t think I can” or “I’m not certain.” Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them. Just remind yourself that saying no is an act of self-control now that will increase your future self-control by preventing the negative effects of over commitment.3. They Don’t Seek PerfectionEmotionally intelligent people won’t set perfection as their target because they know it doesn’t exist. Human beings, by our very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you’re always left with a nagging sense of failure that makes you want to give up or reduce your effort. You end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish and what you should have done differently instead of moving forward excited about what you’ve achieved and what you will accomplish in the future.4. They Focus On Solutions Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems that you’re facing, you create and prolong negative emotions which hinder self-control. When you focus on the actions you’ll take to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and improves performance. Emotionally intelligent people won’t dwell on problems because they know they’re most effective when they focus on solutions.5. They Avoid Asking “What If?” “What if?” statements throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry, which are detrimental to self-control. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you’ll spend taking action and staying productive (staying productive also happens to calm you down and keep you focused). Productive people know that asking “what if? will only take them to a place they don’t want—or need—to go. Of course, scenario planning is a necessary and effective strategic planning technique. The key distinction here is to recognize the difference between worry and strategic thinking.6. They Stay PositivePositive thoughts help you exercise self-control by focusing your brain’s attention onto the rewards you will receive for your effort. You have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your attention. When things are going well, and your mood is good, self-control is relatively easy. When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, self-control is a challenge. In these moments, think about your day and identify one positive thing that happened, or will happen, no matter how small. If you can’t think of something from the current day, reflect on the past and look to the future. The point here is that you must have something positive that you’re ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative, so that you don’t lose focus.7. They EatFile this one in the counter-intuitive category, especially if you’re having trouble controlling your eating. Your brain burns heavily into your stores of glucose when attempting to exert self-control. If your blood sugar is low, you are far more likely to succumb to destructive impulses. Sugary foods spike your sugar levels quickly and leave you drained and vulnerable to impulsive behavior shortly thereafter. Eating something that provides a slow burn for your body, such as whole grain rice or meat, will give you a longer window of self-control. So, if you’re having trouble keeping yourself out of the company candy bin when you’re hungry, make sure you eat something else if you want to have a fighting chance.8. They SleepI’ve beaten this one to death over the years and can’t say enough about the importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and maintaining your focus and self-control. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day’s memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present, which are a major productivity killer. Being busy often makes you feel as if you must sacrifice sleep to stay productive, but sleep deprivation diminishes your productivity so much throughout the day that you’re better off sleeping.When you’re tired, your brain’s ability to absorb glucose is greatly diminished. This makes it difficult to control the impulses that derail your focus. What’s more, without enough sleep you are more likely to crave sugary snacks to compensate for low glucose levels. So, if you’re trying to exert self-control over your eating, getting a good night’s sleep—every night—is one of the best moves you can make.9. They ExerciseGetting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a neurotransmitter that makes your brain feel soothed and keeps you in control of your impulses. If you’re having trouble resisting the impulse to walk over to the office next door to let somebody have it, just keep on walking. You should have the impulse under control by the time you get back.10. They MeditateMeditation actually trains your brain to become a self-control machine. Even simple techniques like mindfulness, which involves taking as little as five minutes a day to focus on nothing more than your breathing and your senses, improves your self-awareness and your brain’s ability to resist destructive impulses. Buddhist monks appear calm and in control for a reason. Give it a try.11. They Ride the WaveDesire and distraction have the tendency to ebb and flow like the tide. When the impulse you need to control is strong, waiting out this wave of desire is usually enough to keep yourself in control. When you feel as if you must give in, the rule of thumb here is to wait at least 10 minutes before succumbing to temptation. You’ll often find that the great wave of desire is now little more than a ripple that you have the power to step right over.12. They Squash Negative Self-TalkA big final step in exercising self-control involves stopping negative self-talk in its tracks. The more you ruminate on negative thoughts, the more power you give them. Most of our negative thoughts are just that—thoughts, not facts. When you find yourself believing the negative and pessimistic things your inner voice says, it’s time to stop and write them down. Literally stop what you’re doing and write down what you’re thinking. Once you’ve taken a moment to slow down the negative momentum of your thoughts, you will be more rational and clear-headed in evaluating their veracity.You can bet that your statements aren’t true any time you use words like “never,” “worst,” “ever,” etc. If your statements still look like facts once they’re on paper, take them to a friend or colleague you trust and see if he or she agrees with you. Then the truth will surely come out. When it feels like something always or never happens, this is just your brain’s natural threat tendency inflating the perceived frequency or severity of an event. Identifying and labeling your thoughts as thoughts by separating them from the facts will help you escape the cycle of negativity and move toward a positive new outlook.Putting These Strategies to WorkThe important thing to remember is you have to give these strategies the opportunity to work. This means recognizing the moments where you are struggling with self-control and, rather than giving in to impulse, taking a look at these strategies and giving them a go before you give in.Want to learn more from me?

She asked my aunt and uncle to bring my cousin’s mortarboard cap, and the family came over and played “Pomp and Circumstance” at Grandma and Grandpa’s house.“It kind of took me by surprise,” Grandpa told me later. “[Your mother] said, ‘I have something for you,’ and someone gave me the cap and I opened the package and saw my diploma and said, ‘Oh my god!’Seventy-five years ago, Grandpa lost his chance to walk onstage in his cap and gown with the rest of his class. On May 13, 1942, he, his mother and his little sister Yuka were rounded up with other Japanese-Americans in Hood River, Oregon, and put on trains to what was then called an “assembly center” in Pinedale, California ― a hastily converted detention facility where thousands of Japanese-Americans were temporarily imprisoned before being sent to more permanent prison camps around the country.Grandpa was 17 then, and a typical American teenager. The military instructed everyone to bring only what they could carry, so he packed a baseball mitt and baseball hat. He remembers thinking it was “kind of stupid” that everyone at the station was formally dressed.Grandpa’s senior class was scheduled to graduate the following month, but by then, he and all the other young Japanese-Americans in the Hood River Valley, along with their families, had become prisoners of their own government.Not that he was bothered much at the time. For years, Grandpa would joke about the “freedom” he had behind barbed wire, first at Pinedale and then at a “relocation center” in Tule Lake, California. No longer forced to work all summer on the family farm, he could smoke, play poker and chase girls.The FBI had already taken his father away, shortly after the Pearl Harbor bombing in 1941. (Grandpa’s father, Masuo Yasui, wouldn’t be released until 1946, and was never actually charged with a crime.) Grandpa’s older brother Min was forced to endure months of solitary confinement for deliberately breaking a discriminatory wartime curfew. But for Grandpa, the injustice of his family’s ordeal didn’t really register until years later.“I was so dumb in those days. I wasn’t worldly,” Grandpa said. “I also said, ‘Well, I’m in camp, OK.’ I never thought about my civil liberties being denied me and all that. Most people my age never thought about it.”He eventually settled into a job as a hospital orderly, where he remembers tending to a white boy with terrible burns. With no big cities nearby, the prison camp at Tule Lake was the closest option for medical care in an emergency. The young man yelled that he didn’t want to be treated by “Jap” doctors. Ultimately, he succumbed to his injuries and died.The boy’s death made an impression on my grandfather, and he told us all the story years later. Once he left Tule Lake, he went on to graduate from the University of Denver and then Hahnemann Medical School and Hospital in Philadelphia. He married my grandmother, Miki, and became a surgeon.“The only graduation I ever participated in was my medical school graduation,” Grandpa told me. “I got my cap and gown, and Miki saw me and she blew a gasket, because a bunch of us doctors didn’t even have the sense to get our gowns pressed.” He has one graduation photo from that day, taken by an itinerant street photographer. “We’re all dressed alike and we look real crummy,” he said.In the years and decades that followed World War II, America’s consensus that people like my grandfather had been imprisoned “for their own protection” or “for the good of the country” began to erode. (But that sentiment lives on, as evidenced by the 2016 presidential campaign and its aftermath.)Grandpa’s sister Michi triumphantly returned to the University of Oregon in 1984 to accept her college diploma ― decades after she was barred from her own graduation ceremony because of the military curfew imposed on Japanese-Americans. She was in her 60s at the time.In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act, acknowledging that the imprisonment of 120,000 Japanese-Americans was based on “race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.”And in November 2015, Grandpa and his sister Yuka met President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at the White House. There, among Hollywood stars, trailblazing scientists and sports icons, Obama awarded their brother Min a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom for challenging the U.S. government’s wartime policies all the way to the Supreme Court.Grandpa shook the president’s hand and got a hug from the first lady. He said it was one of the proudest moments of his life.Compared to that, maybe it wasn’t such a big deal when Grandpa got a message from Hood River Valley High School this year, offering him a chance to come back for an official graduation ceremony. He declined, because at 92, he wanted to stay home with Grandma and take it easy.I asked Grandpa about the invitation and whether he thought it meant his hometown had taken a step forward. He chalked it up to his brother Min being recognized as an “exemplary citizen.”“I think Hood River’s very late in doing this,” he said, “because many colleges have done this earlier, and cities like Seattle and Los Angeles recognized their mistakes after 30 or 40 years. And it took Hood River 75 years.”“But that’s great,” he added. “Better late than never, while some of us are still alive to tell the tale.”Listen to Homer tell the more of the Yasui family’s story on the podcast “Hear in the Gorge,” produced by Sarah Fox."

17,POLITICS,Police Searches Plummet In States That Legalize Weed,Andy Campbell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-searches-plummet-in-states-that-legalize-weed_us_594e8d7ae4b02734df2aa9d5,"Of course, legalization may not help you if you're black or Hispanic.",2017-06-24,A drug-sniffing police dog investigates the inside of a car.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594e9be6290000cc0f3b0fb3.jpeg?cache=sTNSgADzpq&ops=crop_12_0_2086_1313%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Marijuana is often used as a tool by police officers to search your car.In many cases, the mere odor of weed serves as probable cause to pull you over and rifle through your belongings. States that have decriminalized it are still grappling with the legality of using marijuana for warrantless searches.In the case of Philando Castile, who was shot to death by a Minnesota police officer during a traffic stop last year, we saw the devastating effects the smell of marijuana can have on an officer’s perception of motorists. Though marijuana is decriminalized to some degree in the state, St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez would later tell investigators that he thought he was in danger because he smelled weed:“As he was pulling out his hand I thought I was gonna die, and I thought if he has the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl, and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke ... then what care does he give about me?”It may come as no surprise, then, that states that have legalized marijuana are seeing a dramatic decline in warrantless searches.NBC News did a deep dive into reports by the Stanford Open Policing Project, which collected data on 60 million traffic stops and searches by highway patrol officers in 22 states.In Washington state and Colorado, NBC News found that searches were cut by more than 50 percent within months of legalization. Washington state saw a 50 percent reduction within three months, while Colorado saw a more gradual reduction, but searches still dropped by more than 50 percent within a year.Legalization can lead not only to fewer warrantless searches, but an increase in the public’s trust of officers, the site found.That said, full legalization may not have helped Castile. The report found that ethnic minorities are still stopped and searched disproportionately to white drivers in states where weed is legal.Marijuana prohibition has always been racist. HuffPost’s Nick Wing reported in 2014:According to a 2013 study by the American Civil Liberties Union, blacks across the nation were nearly four times more likely than whites to be arrested on charges of marijuana possession in 2010, despite data that suggested they use the drug at about the same rate. In some states, blacks were up to six times more likely to be arrested. This disparity isn’t new, and plays into broader arrest data: A study published in the journal Crime & Delinquency this month found that by the age of 23, nearly 50 percent of black males have been arrested, compared to 44 percent of Hispanic males and 38 percent of white males.Data collected by the Stanford Open Policing Project implies that not much has changed today."

The algorithm for the world’s largest search engine is definitely not doing the right thing ― especially when it comes to the first page of results, where most users stop their searches. Basic searches for words like “Muslim” and “Islam” return reasonable results with links to reputable sites. But more specific terms, like “sharia,” “jihad” or “taqiyya” ― often co-opted by white supremacists ― return links to Islamophobic sites filled with misinformation. The same thing happens with the autofill function. If a user types in “does islam,” the first suggestion that pops up to complete the query is “does islam permit terrorism.” Another egregious example occurs when a user inputs “do muslim.” The autofill results include “do muslim women need saving.”There are endless possibilities for misinformation, and the consequences are disturbing.“Ninety percent of people don’t make it past the first page,” Heidi Beirich, a project director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, told HuffPost. “It’s miseducating millions, if not billions of people on many subjects.”Indeed, there is a distinct correlation between anti-Muslim searches and anti-Muslim hate crimes, according to researchers. The result? At the extreme end of the spectrum, white supremacists commit heinous acts of violence, like in Portland, Oregon and Tulsa, Oklahoma. But more commonly and perhaps more nefariously, such searches normalize a culture of fear, leading to the harassment of hijab-wearing teenagers and 7-Eleven store clerks. But Omar Suleiman, a Muslim American imam from Dallas and founder of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, has a plan to take on Google.Suleiman and his team have been publishing reports on controversial topics in Islam ― like jihad ― in the hopes of influencing the search algorithm. His goal is to flood the search results with accurate information on Islam.Suleiman, 30, realized a few years ago that there was a dire need for factual information during the rise of the self-described Islamic State, when he noticed how right-wing groups were equating ISIS’s language with the beliefs of the world’s entire Muslim population.One of Suleiman’s most popular reports is on the Islamic idea of taqiyya, a term Islamophobes and white supremacists have appropriated and exploited to accuse Muslims of lying to non-Muslims for a sinister objective like taking over the world. Suleiman explains in the report that taqiyya is actually a centuries-old concept that permits a Muslim to conceal his or her faith when under the threat of persecution. What was once more commonly applied by the minority Shia sect of Islam in the face of persecution, taqiyya is rarely, if ever, applicable to modern-day American Muslims, regardless of sect.Because it is an Arabic word, Islamophobes use the word “taqiyya” solely to instill fear, Suleiman told HuffPost. It’s a foreign-sounding word from a religion that’s perceived as foreign, and it sends “chills down the spines of well-meaning but woefully misinformed patriotic Americans wary of those turban-wearing bearded foreigners, right? What could possibly go wrong?” Suleiman wrote in the report. The Yaqeen Institute has also published reports on honor killings, stoning and jihad, all topics Islamophobes constantly twist to degrade Islam and Muslims. But taking on the internet is not easy, and may not even be possible. Suleiman’s report on taqiyya doesn’t come up until the second page of Google search. The first link that appears on the first page, an article from meforum.org, may appear legitimate, but the Middle East Forum is actually an Islamophobic “think tank” and website that “promotes American interests in the Middle East and protects Western values from Middle Eastern threats.” TheReligionOfPeace.com and Billionbibles.org are other anti-Muslim websites whose articles appear on the first page.The Southern Poverty Law Center has documented a similar ― and arguably worse ― problem when users search for the term “sharia.”Factual content about Islam “in basic searches often gets choked off by anti-Muslim propaganda,” writes Alex Amend, digital media director at the Southern Poverty Law Center. However, there is precedent for Google to make a change. The company removed the “are Jews evil” autofill suggestion late last year, and apologized for mistakenly tagging African-Americans as “gorillas” in the search feature of the Google photos app.“We’re appalled and genuinely sorry that this happened,” a company spokeswoman said at the time. “There is still clearly a lot of work to do with automatic image labeling, and we’re looking at how we can prevent these types of mistakes from happening in the future.”Earlier this year, YouTube, which is owned by Google, announced a new set of policies that target offensive content that doesn’t necessarily violate the company’s guidelines. The policy includes burying the videos and not attaching them to any advertising. Videos that promote the subjugation of religions or races without outright inciting violence, such as by targeting Islam, would be covered by this policy.Google announced in a blog post in April, that they were going to “surface more high-quality content from the web,” and offer users the opportunity to report inappropriate content. But with tens of thousands of pages “coming online every minute of every day,” the post read, clearly they are facing an uphill battle. “Google’s algorithm is seriously flawed and it’s a scary thing, because millions of people around the world are using it,” she said. “It’s a fundamental problem with how search works.”Beirich points to the case of white supremacist Dylann Roof, who went “from being someone who was not raised in a racist home to someone so steeped in white supremacist propaganda that he murdered nine African-Americans during a Bible study.”“We are teaching [people] reasons to hate black people, Jews, Muslims and [other] minorities,” Beirich said.The SPLC has brought its concerns to Google, but says it has yet to see substantial action.A Google spokeswoman told HuffPost she had “nothing to add” when asked about the harmful search results. Despite the odds stacked against Suleiman, he is hopeful. He is also aware that Yaqeen has nothing close to the $57 million network fueling Islamophobia, both online and offline, in the United States.“The prize of Islamophobes is the hearts and minds of people,” Suleiman said. “What we need to continue to do is to discredit these people and their agendas.”America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.

22,POLITICS,Kentucky's Hedge Funder Governor Keeps State Money In Secretive Hedge Funds,Ben Walsh and Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matt-bevin-kentucky-pensions_us_594bf56ce4b0a3a837be3d56,"Under Matt Bevin, the state has continued to funnel money into alternative investments at public employees' expense.",2017-06-24,Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) campaigned on making sweeping changes to the state's ailing pension system. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594bf6831700001f001024d4.jpeg?cache=hik9Gpo3kk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kentucky’s public pension system is a long-running, worst-in-the-nation disaster. Even as state workers chip in their fair share, the system suffers from years of chronic underfunding by the state. Seeking higher returns, the program, formally known as Kentucky Retirement Systems, has turned to “alternative investments” such as private equity and hedge funds. But those funds also carry far more risk than traditional investments in stocks and bonds ― and much higher fees. The year before the state’s Republican governor, Matt Bevin, was elected, the pension system had 25 percent more alternative investments than its peers, 27 percent higher costs and 15 percent lower long-term returns, according to a report prepared for the pension board. As a part-owner of a hedge fund himself, Bevin said in 2015 that he didn’t have a problem with the pension system’s heavy reliance on alternative investments like hedge funds. But he campaigned on promises to improve the system and shore it up for the future.He hasn’t. Despite the Republican Party being in total control of Kentucky state government for the first time in nearly a century, the actual policy changes Bevin has implemented or overseen have mainly ended up supporting the system’s ruinous status quo. And some legislators are raising concerns that state officials ― potentially including Bevin himself ― could benefit financially from the system.Maintaining Kentucky’s status quo requires that oversight be finely balanced between people who are deeply invested in the current system and people who have very little idea of what’s going on. Since taking office in December 2015, Bevin has picked a former hedge fund director, a current hedge fund owner and a dermatologist to serve on the board that watches over the pension system. In February 2017, he signed bipartisan legislation that shielded the board from disclosing how much it paid some investment managers and prevented it from opening its contract process to competitive bidding.Under Bevin’s watch, the pension fund has continued to rely on alternative investments. It makes no sense, some state lawmakers argue, to overpay for risky financial products that rarely outperform the market. The retirements of as many as 350,000 public employees ― including social and mental health workers, university staff and others ― are at stake.Experts, including legendary investor Warren Buffett, agree. Buffett has long advocated against alternative investments, saying it’s better to focus on simpler options that deliver better returns. “I’ve talked to huge pension funds, and I’ve taken them through the math, and when I leave, they go out and hire a bunch of consultants and pay them a lot of money,” Buffett said last year. “It’s just unbelievable.”The potential for corruption is also much greater when funds invest in these types of assets over “plain vanilla stocks and bonds,” said Lynn Stout, a professor of corporate and business law at Cornell University.But Kentucky continues to transfer tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to hedge fund managers. And the state’s front-line public servants are still wondering if the pension money will be there when they need it.By the time Bevin took office, Kentucky’s public pension system was among the worst-funded in the nation, according to a 2016 study from S&P Global Ratings. The pensions overseen by Kentucky Retirement Systems had just 37 percent of the money required to pay current and future retirees. The largest of the three funds ― Kentucky Employees Retirement System, which covers virtually all state employees except teachers, legislators, judges and state police ― had only enough money to cover 17 percent of its obligations. Bevin’s first budget, released in January 2016, proposed a larger-than-required monetary commitment to pensions. The legislature eventually passed a budget that put $1.2 billion toward the troubled system.The governor’s effort to remake the system really got rolling in April that year, when he fired Thomas Elliott, the chairman of the Kentucky Retirement Systems board of trustees and a former banker. Elliott had been reappointed to a four-year term in 2015 by the previous governor. His firing was meant to give Kentucky “a fresh start and more transparency,” Bevin’s spokeswoman said at the time. Elliott didn’t go quietly ― he chaired the board’s April meeting despite Bevin’s order removing him. The governor picked a dermatologist to replace Elliott, but that individual never assumed the seat, withdrawing in May after the state attorney general said he lacked the requisite investment experience and that Elliott’s firing had been improper. Bevin showed up at the board’s May meeting with state troopers to physically bar Elliott from acting as chair.Throughout the turmoil, Kentucky Retirement Systems didn’t just continue to invest in hedge funds ― it intensified its commitment. In May 2016, the board dumped $300 million more into four new hedge funds and increased its investment in another hedge fund, created for Kentucky by KKR Prisma, that itself invests in hedge funds.The following month, Bevin, whose spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article, announced that he would reorganize the entire board of trustees. By executive order, he expanded the board from 13 to 17 members and named economist John Farris as its chairman. The new structure allowed Bevin to appoint seven board members right away. In response, Elliott and another trustee sued Bevin. That lawsuit is ongoing, and Elliott remains a non-voting member of the board thanks to a court order.Bevin’s appointments included two hedge fund managers. One was Neil Ramsey, the owner of Louisville, Kentucky-based hedge fund RQSI Holdings.Ramsey, along with his wife, contributed $4,000 to Bevin’s gubernatorial campaign and $15,000 to his inaugural committee, state records show. He also appears to own two other investment companies, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings: d.Quant Special Opportunities Fund, which late last year acquired a majority stake in another company called ZAIS Group Holdings.Neither of those firms is listed on the most recent version of Ramsey’s financial disclosure form, a copy of which HuffPost obtained through an open records request. Ramsey did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The other new board member was William Cook, a former director and senior portfolio manager at KKR Prisma, the company that created the fund of funds for Kentucky Retirement Systems. Cook, who retired from KKR Prisma in 2015, said he would recuse himself from any investment decisions involving his former company.This past November, as both Democratic and Republican members of the state legislature called on the pension board to divest from hedge funds, the board abruptly changed course and proposed to cut those investments in half. It would divest from 12 hedge funds altogether, and its investment in the KKR Prisma fund would return to the prior lower level. That decision was finalized in December 2016, but it’s not clear how much headway the pension board has made on the promise.Overall, big institutional investors like pension funds hold a declining, albeit still large, share of hedge funds’ assets. Some pension systems, such as those in California and New York City, have said they will divest entirely from hedge funds. New York City is just getting started, while California’s investment is down 80 percent since 2014.Kentucky’s progress is less impressive. As of March 2015, the state’s pension program had 10.6 percent of its $16 billion worth of assets in hedge funds. As of March 2017, that number was 8.4 percent, a large portion of which is still in the KKR Prisma fund.After the pension board’s drama, the Kentucky state legislature took up a measure, known as Senate Bill 2, that had been a priority for reform-minded Republicans and Democrats for more than two years. Its primary aim was to increase transparency around and reduce the costs of the pension investments.Past versions of the bill, sponsored by state Sen. Joe Bowen (R), included two significant provisions that would have required Kentucky Retirement Systems to disclose the fees it paid to all investment managers ― including managers of the hedge funds within the KKR Prisma fund ― and would have opened up the process of selecting the firms that oversee the pension program’s investments to a competitive bidding process. Currently, state pension officials hire whomever they want to oversee pension assets, and pay whatever fees they think are fair. The provision requiring disclosure of all management fees was particularly important, given that the KKR Prisma fund is one of the system’s largest hedge fund investments. Generally, funds of hedge funds are used by individual investors who cannot put money directly into hedge funds. Even for those people, funds of funds are rarely a good deal, because they come with an extra layer of fees that goes to the fund-of-funds manager, on top of the fees paid to the underlying hedge funds.This structure makes even less sense for an investor, like Kentucky Retirement Systems, that can and does put money directly into hedge funds. Kentucky may have gravitated to the fund of funds because KKR Prisma offered a part-time pension employee as part of the deal. Yet that seems to suggest that the pension program didn’t have the in-house expertise or staffing levels needed to invest in hedge funds, let alone a fund of hedge funds.Measures to require full fee disclosure and competitive bidding were noticeably absent from this year’s version of SB 2, and an amendment to reinsert them was defeated on the House floor. Instead, the latest bill mandated more granular disclosure of fees (but didn’t cover fees paid to underlying funds), strengthened the requirement that pension board members have investment experience (a provision that likely would have precluded Bevin from appointing a dermatologist), and cemented Bevin’s reworking of the board’s structure. These changes were supported by both parties and passed unanimously in February.How the two stronger provisions disappeared from the bill “is a mystery,” said state Rep. Jim Wayne (D), who has for years fought for pension reforms, including the divestment of hedge fund investments.Kentucky Retirement Systems, as it had in the past, opposed full fee transparency and competitive bidding on the grounds that those requirements would make the pension funds less competitive, as investment managers would be less likely to do business with them if their books had to be open.The overall legislation was “a compromise that I worked out with KRS,” Bowen told HuffPost. He suggested that it will still reduce costs and increase transparency because it requires the board to develop best practices for managing assets and picking contractors, and then get those guidelines approved by the state government’s Finance and Administration Cabinet.Some Kentucky lawmakers wondered whether Bevin had been involved in the watering down of SB 2, even as they stressed there were no clear links. Given his history in the investment field and the new makeup of the board, “it would not surprise me if he had a hand in that process,” Wayne said.Bowen said that while he’d discussed parts of the legislation with the governor’s office, he’d heard “nothing contrary” from Bevin about the two provisions that were cut.Regardless, the removal of those provisions, pension experts said, will be a boon to the Wall Street firms and investment managers that are charged with managing Kentucky’s investments. In 2015 alone, the state paid more than $100 million in investment fees related to its pensions.“The last minute gutting of SB 2 of competitive bidding and weakening of fiduciary standards I believe was worth in the $10′s of millions for the hedge fund & private equity industries,” Christopher Tobe, a former member of the pension board, said in an email. Tobe wrote Kentucky Fried Pensions, a 2013 book that explores the system’s “culture of cover-up and corruption.”Kentucky is paying those exorbitant fees even as its hedge fund investments cost it even more money. The KKR Prisma fund had a negative 8 percent return in 2016, helping Kentucky Retirement Systems finish the year with a 0.5 percent loss overall. The stock market, the Lexington Herald-Leader noted, rose an average of 15 percent over the same period. A spokesperson for KKR declined to comment after she was sent detailed questions about the company’s role in Kentucky’s pension system.Before SB 2 passed, state Rep. James Kay, who has spearheaded Democratic pension reform efforts, introduced an amendment that would have restored the provision requiring the disclosure of fees paid to all investment managers. He doesn’t buy the pension board’s argument against it.“If they don’t want to do business with us because they don’t want to be transparent, that should be the first sign of trouble,” Kay told HuffPost. “Secret deals don’t help anybody. We’re taking their assumption that we’re getting a good deal, but it’s a secret. And the performance in the market proves that it has been a bad deal for Kentucky.”Lawmakers have also raised the possibility that Kentucky’s elected and appointed officials ― including Bevin, state legislators and members of the pension board ― could benefit financially from the continued opacity of the hedge fund investments.If the KKR Prisma fund’s undisclosed investments include any of the hedge funds that officials own or operate, that would be problematic, Kay said on Kentucky’s public television network earlier this month.Because there’s no transparency, the Kentucky pension system could be investing in hedge funds owned or operated by general assembly members, people on the pension system’s board or even the governor himself, Kay said. “There could be people that could actually vote to enrich themselves on our current retirement board.”There is no proof that Bevin or any of his associates or appointees are benefiting in such a manner. But the idea that they could isn’t just a hypothetical: Heavy reliance on opaque hedge funds and funds of funds has greased the wheels in the past for pay-to-play scandals in major state pension funds, including California’s and New York’s, said Edward Siedle, a former SEC attorney who now forensically investigates public pension systems.“It’s a way of creating, potentially, a political daisy chain,” Siedle told HuffPost.How would that work? In Seidle’s version, the manager of a fund of hedge funds could suggest that the managers of the underlying funds contribute to an elected official’s campaign, causes or business associates. That supportive effort might help the fund-of-funds manager get hired by a public pension system connected to the elected official. Once hired, the fund-of-funds manager could then direct business back to those other managers.“Everybody’s happy,” Seidle said. “Because of the lack of transparency, it’s hard to tell. But ... the potential for personal profit is enormous.”Questions about Bevin’s pension moves have intensified in recent months, as one of his appointments began to draw scrutiny thanks to a mansion in a posh Louisville suburb.In March, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported that Bevin appeared to be living in a restored mansion in Anchorage, one of Kentucky’s wealthiest cities. The home had recently been sold by Anchorage LLC to another entity called Anchorage Place LLC. The owners of Anchorage Place LLC aren’t listed on public documents, but Bevin admitted in May that he owns the entity.Anchorage LLC, meanwhile, is owned by Neil Ramsey, the hedge fund manager Bevin had appointed to the pension board eight months prior. And it appeared the mansion had been sold at a discounted price.Last year, the Courier-Journal reported, the Jefferson County property valuation administrator assessed the mansion and the 19-acre property on which it sat at nearly $3 million. The sale to Anchorage Place LLC included the mansion and 10 of those acres ― property that was altogether worth $2.57 million, according to the Courier-Journal. The sale price, however, was just $1.6 million ― a reduction of $970,000. The house wasn’t Ramsey’s only financial connection to Bevin. In May, the Courier-Journal reported that Ramsey had also invested $300,000 in Neuronetrix, a Louisville-based medical device company with ties to Bevin. That investment occurred in February ― at the same time the legislature was considering SB 2 and right as Bevin began living in the Anchorage house. The governor owns at least 5 percent of Neuronetrix and sits on its board of directors, according to the paper.The Neuronetrix investment qualified Ramsey for a significant tax break. Selling the mansion at a potential loss did too.During the two months after the mansion’s sale, Bevin “largely ignored” questions about it, according to the Courier-Journal. He told the Herald-Leader that where he lived was not a matter of public interest.The governor called Courier-Journal reporter Tom Loftus, who led the paper’s mansion coverage, “Peeping Tom” and dismissed reporters who questioned his purchase of the house as “cicadas.” The state’s two largest newspapers, he said, “don’t actually seem to care about Kentucky.”Ramsey has maintained that he sold the house at fair market value. Bevin similarly batted down questions about the price during a late-May news conference in which he finally admitted he had bought the mansion. “It is arguably not even worth what was paid for it,” he said, “let alone what it’s being assessed at.” Bevin has even appealed the assessment.But his non-answers have not put the issue to rest. The governor is facing two separate ethics complaints around his acquisition of the mansion. Attorney General Andy Beshear (D), the son of Bevin’s predecessor and a potential gubernatorial candidate in 2019, has asked the state’s Executive Branch Ethics Commission if his office is the appropriate venue to investigate the sale and whether Bevin and Ramsey violated state ethics laws by personally benefiting from it.“This is one of the worst cases of personal enrichment by a governor,” Beshear said in May. “News reports suggest he is personally enriching himself and his friends, getting a Louisville mansion at half the price from a state contractor, donor and political appointee. ... Because the governor refuses to be direct and honest, someone must investigate.”Bevin continues to dismiss his critics. In that May news conference, he tied the mansion and Ramsey’s involvement back to the pension crisis that he says he is still trying to fix.“People that are making the decisions to actually fix the pension system,” Bevin told reporters, “are the very same people that you’re trying to destroy.”(Disclosure: Travis Waldron interned on the summer of 2009 for the Senate primary campaign of Jack Conway, who ran as the Democratic candidate for governor in 2015 against Bevin.)"

Even as state workers chip in their fair share, the system suffers from years of chronic underfunding by the state. Seeking higher returns, the program, formally known as Kentucky Retirement Systems, has turned to “alternative investments” such as private equity and hedge funds. But those funds also carry far more risk than traditional investments in stocks and bonds ― and much higher fees. The year before the state’s Republican governor, Matt Bevin, was elected, the pension system had 25 percent more alternative investments than its peers, 27 percent higher costs and 15 percent lower long-term returns, according to a report prepared for the pension board. As a part-owner of a hedge fund himself, Bevin said in 2015 that he didn’t have a problem with the pension system’s heavy reliance on alternative investments like hedge funds. But he campaigned on promises to improve the system and shore it up for the future.He hasn’t. Despite the Republican Party being in total control of Kentucky state government for the first time in nearly a century, the actual policy changes Bevin has implemented or overseen have mainly ended up supporting the system’s ruinous status quo. And some legislators are raising concerns that state officials ― potentially including Bevin himself ― could benefit financially from the system.Maintaining Kentucky’s status quo requires that oversight be finely balanced between people who are deeply invested in the current system and people who have very little idea of what’s going on. Since taking office in December 2015, Bevin has picked a former hedge fund director, a current hedge fund owner and a dermatologist to serve on the board that watches over the pension system. In February 2017, he signed bipartisan legislation that shielded the board from disclosing how much it paid some investment managers and prevented it from opening its contract process to competitive bidding.Under Bevin’s watch, the pension fund has continued to rely on alternative investments.

Kay has pushed for reforming the state's pension system.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594d69d415000020008ffe71.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kentucky’s public pension system is a long-running, worst-in-the-nation disaster. Even as state workers chip in their fair share, the system suffers from years of chronic underfunding by the state. Seeking higher returns, the program, formally known as Kentucky Retirement Systems, has turned to “alternative investments” such as private equity and hedge funds. But those funds also carry far more risk than traditional investments in stocks and bonds ― and much higher fees. The year before the state’s Republican governor, Matt Bevin, was elected, the pension system had 25 percent more alternative investments than its peers, 27 percent higher costs and 15 percent lower long-term returns, according to a report prepared for the pension board. As a part-owner of a hedge fund himself, Bevin said in 2015 that he didn’t have a problem with the pension system’s heavy reliance on alternative investments like hedge funds. But he campaigned on promises to improve the system and shore it up for the future.He hasn’t. Despite the Republican Party being in total control of Kentucky state government for the first time in nearly a century, the actual policy changes Bevin has implemented or overseen have mainly ended up supporting the system’s ruinous status quo. And some legislators are raising concerns that state officials ― potentially including Bevin himself ― could benefit financially from the system.Maintaining Kentucky’s status quo requires that oversight be finely balanced between people who are deeply invested in the current system and people who have very little idea of what’s going on. Since taking office in December 2015, Bevin has picked a former hedge fund director, a current hedge fund owner and a dermatologist to serve on the board that watches over the pension system. In February 2017, he signed bipartisan legislation that shielded the board from disclosing how much it paid some investment managers and prevented it from opening its contract process to competitive bidding.Under Bevin’s watch, the pension fund has continued to rely on alternative investments. It makes no sense, some state lawmakers argue, to overpay for risky financial products that rarely outperform the market. The retirements of as many as 350,000 public employees ― including social and mental health workers, university staff and others ― are at stake.Experts, including legendary investor Warren Buffett, agree. Buffett has long advocated against alternative investments, saying it’s better to focus on simpler options that deliver better returns. “I’ve talked to huge pension funds, and I’ve taken them through the math, and when I leave, they go out and hire a bunch of consultants and pay them a lot of money,” Buffett said last year. “It’s just unbelievable.”The potential for corruption is also much greater when funds invest in these types of assets over “plain vanilla stocks and bonds,” said Lynn Stout, a professor of corporate and business law at Cornell University.But Kentucky continues to transfer tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to hedge fund managers. And the state’s front-line public servants are still wondering if the pension money will be there when they need it.By the time Bevin took office, Kentucky’s public pension system was among the worst-funded in the nation, according to a 2016 study from S&P Global Ratings. The pensions overseen by Kentucky Retirement Systems had just 37 percent of the money required to pay current and future retirees. The largest of the three funds ― Kentucky Employees Retirement System, which covers virtually all state employees except teachers, legislators, judges and state police ― had only enough money to cover 17 percent of its obligations. Bevin’s first budget, released in January 2016, proposed a larger-than-required monetary commitment to pensions. The legislature eventually passed a budget that put $1.2 billion toward the troubled system.The governor’s effort to remake the system really got rolling in April that year, when he fired Thomas Elliott, the chairman of the Kentucky Retirement Systems board of trustees and a former banker. Elliott had been reappointed to a four-year term in 2015 by the previous governor. His firing was meant to give Kentucky “a fresh start and more transparency,” Bevin’s spokeswoman said at the time. Elliott didn’t go quietly ― he chaired the board’s April meeting despite Bevin’s order removing him. The governor picked a dermatologist to replace Elliott, but that individual never assumed the seat, withdrawing in May after the state attorney general said he lacked the requisite investment experience and that Elliott’s firing had been improper. Bevin showed up at the board’s May meeting with state troopers to physically bar Elliott from acting as chair.Throughout the turmoil, Kentucky Retirement Systems didn’t just continue to invest in hedge funds ― it intensified its commitment. In May 2016, the board dumped $300 million more into four new hedge funds and increased its investment in another hedge fund, created for Kentucky by KKR Prisma, that itself invests in hedge funds.The following month, Bevin, whose spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article, announced that he would reorganize the entire board of trustees. By executive order, he expanded the board from 13 to 17 members and named economist John Farris as its chairman. The new structure allowed Bevin to appoint seven board members right away. In response, Elliott and another trustee sued Bevin. That lawsuit is ongoing, and Elliott remains a non-voting member of the board thanks to a court order.Bevin’s appointments included two hedge fund managers. One was Neil Ramsey, the owner of Louisville, Kentucky-based hedge fund RQSI Holdings.Ramsey, along with his wife, contributed $4,000 to Bevin’s gubernatorial campaign and $15,000 to his inaugural committee, state records show. He also appears to own two other investment companies, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings: d.Quant Special Opportunities Fund, which late last year acquired a majority stake in another company called ZAIS Group Holdings.Neither of those firms is listed on the most recent version of Ramsey’s financial disclosure form, a copy of which HuffPost obtained through an open records request. Ramsey did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The other new board member was William Cook, a former director and senior portfolio manager at KKR Prisma, the company that created the fund of funds for Kentucky Retirement Systems. Cook, who retired from KKR Prisma in 2015, said he would recuse himself from any investment decisions involving his former company.This past November, as both Democratic and Republican members of the state legislature called on the pension board to divest from hedge funds, the board abruptly changed course and proposed to cut those investments in half. It would divest from 12 hedge funds altogether, and its investment in the KKR Prisma fund would return to the prior lower level. That decision was finalized in December 2016, but it’s not clear how much headway the pension board has made on the promise.Overall, big institutional investors like pension funds hold a declining, albeit still large, share of hedge funds’ assets. Some pension systems, such as those in California and New York City, have said they will divest entirely from hedge funds. New York City is just getting started, while California’s investment is down 80 percent since 2014.Kentucky’s progress is less impressive. As of March 2015, the state’s pension program had 10.6 percent of its $16 billion worth of assets in hedge funds. As of March 2017, that number was 8.4 percent, a large portion of which is still in the KKR Prisma fund.After the pension board’s drama, the Kentucky state legislature took up a measure, known as Senate Bill 2, that had been a priority for reform-minded Republicans and Democrats for more than two years. Its primary aim was to increase transparency around and reduce the costs of the pension investments.Past versions of the bill, sponsored by state Sen. Joe Bowen (R), included two significant provisions that would have required Kentucky Retirement Systems to disclose the fees it paid to all investment managers ― including managers of the hedge funds within the KKR Prisma fund ― and would have opened up the process of selecting the firms that oversee the pension program’s investments to a competitive bidding process. Currently, state pension officials hire whomever they want to oversee pension assets, and pay whatever fees they think are fair. The provision requiring disclosure of all management fees was particularly important, given that the KKR Prisma fund is one of the system’s largest hedge fund investments. Generally, funds of hedge funds are used by individual investors who cannot put money directly into hedge funds. Even for those people, funds of funds are rarely a good deal, because they come with an extra layer of fees that goes to the fund-of-funds manager, on top of the fees paid to the underlying hedge funds.This structure makes even less sense for an investor, like Kentucky Retirement Systems, that can and does put money directly into hedge funds. Kentucky may have gravitated to the fund of funds because KKR Prisma offered a part-time pension employee as part of the deal. Yet that seems to suggest that the pension program didn’t have the in-house expertise or staffing levels needed to invest in hedge funds, let alone a fund of hedge funds.Measures to require full fee disclosure and competitive bidding were noticeably absent from this year’s version of SB 2, and an amendment to reinsert them was defeated on the House floor. Instead, the latest bill mandated more granular disclosure of fees (but didn’t cover fees paid to underlying funds), strengthened the requirement that pension board members have investment experience (a provision that likely would have precluded Bevin from appointing a dermatologist), and cemented Bevin’s reworking of the board’s structure. These changes were supported by both parties and passed unanimously in February.How the two stronger provisions disappeared from the bill “is a mystery,” said state Rep. Jim Wayne (D), who has for years fought for pension reforms, including the divestment of hedge fund investments.Kentucky Retirement Systems, as it had in the past, opposed full fee transparency and competitive bidding on the grounds that those requirements would make the pension funds less competitive, as investment managers would be less likely to do business with them if their books had to be open.The overall legislation was “a compromise that I worked out with KRS,” Bowen told HuffPost. He suggested that it will still reduce costs and increase transparency because it requires the board to develop best practices for managing assets and picking contractors, and then get those guidelines approved by the state government’s Finance and Administration Cabinet.Some Kentucky lawmakers wondered whether Bevin had been involved in the watering down of SB 2, even as they stressed there were no clear links. Given his history in the investment field and the new makeup of the board, “it would not surprise me if he had a hand in that process,” Wayne said.Bowen said that while he’d discussed parts of the legislation with the governor’s office, he’d heard “nothing contrary” from Bevin about the two provisions that were cut.Regardless, the removal of those provisions, pension experts said, will be a boon to the Wall Street firms and investment managers that are charged with managing Kentucky’s investments. In 2015 alone, the state paid more than $100 million in investment fees related to its pensions.“The last minute gutting of SB 2 of competitive bidding and weakening of fiduciary standards I believe was worth in the $10′s of millions for the hedge fund & private equity industries,” Christopher Tobe, a former member of the pension board, said in an email. Tobe wrote Kentucky Fried Pensions, a 2013 book that explores the system’s “culture of cover-up and corruption.”Kentucky is paying those exorbitant fees even as its hedge fund investments cost it even more money. The KKR Prisma fund had a negative 8 percent return in 2016, helping Kentucky Retirement Systems finish the year with a 0.5 percent loss overall. The stock market, the Lexington Herald-Leader noted, rose an average of 15 percent over the same period. A spokesperson for KKR declined to comment after she was sent detailed questions about the company’s role in Kentucky’s pension system.Before SB 2 passed, state Rep. James Kay, who has spearheaded Democratic pension reform efforts, introduced an amendment that would have restored the provision requiring the disclosure of fees paid to all investment managers. He doesn’t buy the pension board’s argument against it.“If they don’t want to do business with us because they don’t want to be transparent, that should be the first sign of trouble,” Kay told HuffPost. “Secret deals don’t help anybody. We’re taking their assumption that we’re getting a good deal, but it’s a secret. And the performance in the market proves that it has been a bad deal for Kentucky.”Lawmakers have also raised the possibility that Kentucky’s elected and appointed officials ― including Bevin, state legislators and members of the pension board ― could benefit financially from the continued opacity of the hedge fund investments.If the KKR Prisma fund’s undisclosed investments include any of the hedge funds that officials own or operate, that would be problematic, Kay said on Kentucky’s public television network earlier this month.Because there’s no transparency, the Kentucky pension system could be investing in hedge funds owned or operated by general assembly members, people on the pension system’s board or even the governor himself, Kay said. “There could be people that could actually vote to enrich themselves on our current retirement board.”There is no proof that Bevin or any of his associates or appointees are benefiting in such a manner. But the idea that they could isn’t just a hypothetical: Heavy reliance on opaque hedge funds and funds of funds has greased the wheels in the past for pay-to-play scandals in major state pension funds, including California’s and New York’s, said Edward Siedle, a former SEC attorney who now forensically investigates public pension systems.“It’s a way of creating, potentially, a political daisy chain,” Siedle told HuffPost.How would that work? In Seidle’s version, the manager of a fund of hedge funds could suggest that the managers of the underlying funds contribute to an elected official’s campaign, causes or business associates. That supportive effort might help the fund-of-funds manager get hired by a public pension system connected to the elected official. Once hired, the fund-of-funds manager could then direct business back to those other managers.“Everybody’s happy,” Seidle said. “Because of the lack of transparency, it’s hard to tell. But ... the potential for personal profit is enormous.”Questions about Bevin’s pension moves have intensified in recent months, as one of his appointments began to draw scrutiny thanks to a mansion in a posh Louisville suburb.In March, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported that Bevin appeared to be living in a restored mansion in Anchorage, one of Kentucky’s wealthiest cities. The home had recently been sold by Anchorage LLC to another entity called Anchorage Place LLC. The owners of Anchorage Place LLC aren’t listed on public documents, but Bevin admitted in May that he owns the entity.Anchorage LLC, meanwhile, is owned by Neil Ramsey, the hedge fund manager Bevin had appointed to the pension board eight months prior. And it appeared the mansion had been sold at a discounted price.Last year, the Courier-Journal reported, the Jefferson County property valuation administrator assessed the mansion and the 19-acre property on which it sat at nearly $3 million. The sale to Anchorage Place LLC included the mansion and 10 of those acres ― property that was altogether worth $2.57 million, according to the Courier-Journal. The sale price, however, was just $1.6 million ― a reduction of $970,000. The house wasn’t Ramsey’s only financial connection to Bevin. In May, the Courier-Journal reported that Ramsey had also invested $300,000 in Neuronetrix, a Louisville-based medical device company with ties to Bevin. That investment occurred in February ― at the same time the legislature was considering SB 2 and right as Bevin began living in the Anchorage house. The governor owns at least 5 percent of Neuronetrix and sits on its board of directors, according to the paper.The Neuronetrix investment qualified Ramsey for a significant tax break. Selling the mansion at a potential loss did too.During the two months after the mansion’s sale, Bevin “largely ignored” questions about it, according to the Courier-Journal. He told the Herald-Leader that where he lived was not a matter of public interest.The governor called Courier-Journal reporter Tom Loftus, who led the paper’s mansion coverage, “Peeping Tom” and dismissed reporters who questioned his purchase of the house as “cicadas.” The state’s two largest newspapers, he said, “don’t actually seem to care about Kentucky.”Ramsey has maintained that he sold the house at fair market value. Bevin similarly batted down questions about the price during a late-May news conference in which he finally admitted he had bought the mansion. “It is arguably not even worth what was paid for it,” he said, “let alone what it’s being assessed at.” Bevin has even appealed the assessment.But his non-answers have not put the issue to rest. The governor is facing two separate ethics complaints around his acquisition of the mansion. Attorney General Andy Beshear (D), the son of Bevin’s predecessor and a potential gubernatorial candidate in 2019, has asked the state’s Executive Branch Ethics Commission if his office is the appropriate venue to investigate the sale and whether Bevin and Ramsey violated state ethics laws by personally benefiting from it.“This is one of the worst cases of personal enrichment by a governor,” Beshear said in May. “News reports suggest he is personally enriching himself and his friends, getting a Louisville mansion at half the price from a state contractor, donor and political appointee. ... Because the governor refuses to be direct and honest, someone must investigate.”Bevin continues to dismiss his critics. In that May news conference, he tied the mansion and Ramsey’s involvement back to the pension crisis that he says he is still trying to fix.“People that are making the decisions to actually fix the pension system,” Bevin told reporters, “are the very same people that you’re trying to destroy.”(Disclosure: Travis Waldron interned on the summer of 2009 for the Senate primary campaign of Jack Conway, who ran as the Democratic candidate for governor in 2015 against Bevin.)"
25,ENTERTAINMENT,The Lost Generation: From 'The Joy Luck Club' To 'Crazy Rich Asians',"Nancy Wang Yuen, Guest WriterGuest Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-lost-generation-from-the-joy-luck-club-to-crazy_us_594e771ee4b0f078efd981f9,An entire generation in the US missed out on seeing Asian American families represented in film and television.,2017-06-24,<p>Michelle Yeoh and Constance Wu star in Crazy Rich Asians.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594ea2cc15000027008fffaf.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was in high school when ″The Joy Luck Club” (1993) came out in the movie theater. Wayne Wang’s film—based on Amy Tan’s novel—was monumental for me. Though I saw plenty of Asian shows as a kid in Taiwan, I had never seen a Hollywood film featuring Asian American families before. For the first time, I saw myself in these women on screen. I completely related to Waverly (played by Tamlyn Tomita) grappling with her mother’s high expectations. I still tear up at the scene when Waverly says to her mom (played by Tsai Chin), “You don’t know the power you have over me. One word from you, one look...because nothing I do can ever, ever please you.”Fast forward to 2017. “Crazy Rich Asians,” directed by Jon M. Chu, completed filming this week. Based on the best-selling book by Kevin Kwan, the film has an all-Asian international cast featuring actors Constance Wu and Michelle Yeoh.It took 23 years for a major Hollywood studio to greenlight another film featuring Asian families led by Asian women, despite “The Joy Luck Club” being a moderate box office success ($10.5 million budget/$32.9 million domestic box office). What’s really striking is that the same thing happened on network television. Twenty years separated Asian American family sitcoms “All-American Girl” (1994) and “Fresh off the Boat” (2015 to now)—both with strong female leads. Independent films like “Saving Face” (2004) and “Advantageous” (2015) along with foreign films like “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” (2000) featured East Asian mothers and daughters, and one studio film, “The Namesake” (2006), featured an Indian-American family—but such films were still far and few between for U.S. audiences.As a result, an entire generation in the United States missed out on seeing Asian American families represented in film and television. This is significant since families are central to belonging and community. The exclusion of Asian American families from popular culture dehumanizes and marginalizes them as outsiders. Consequently, even though Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial group in the United States and the fastest growing voting block, they continue to be whitewashed in Hollywood films. Furthermore, my current research on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) in television reveals that despite increased representation, AAPIs are missing from 70 percent of all shows. With the recent cancellation of “Dr. Ken,” ABC’s “Fresh Off the Boat” and Disney’s “Andi Mack” are the only remaining Asian American family-sitcoms on television.Asian Americans have taken to social media to protest their underrepresentation, using hashtags like #WhiteWashedOut, #StarringJohnCho and #StarringConstance Wu. Given that Constance Wu is now the star of “Crazy Rich Asians,” there is hope. Everyone must support this film and clamor for more Asian American representations to prevent future lost generations."

But the event is still relatively unknown, even within the LGBTQ community.The UpStairs Lounge, a second-floor bar in New Orleans’ French Quarter, featured a pianist and drag shows, and was enjoyed by a diverse crowd.Ronnie Rosenthal was 21 years old when he survived the fire.“Everybody knew everybody,” Rosenthal told HuffPost via Skype. “The crowd that was at the UpStairs Lounge, they were all friends. Everyone was there to have a beer, some dancing, a good time.”But the UpStairs wasn’t just a space for the New Orleans gay community to come together and socialize. It was also a place of worship. The Metropolitan Community Church was the first church in the U.S. to cater to LGBTQ congregations. Earlier that day, an MCC pastor, the Rev. Bill Larson, led a Sunday service at the lounge, followed by the weekly beer bust.As the evening was drawing to a close, survivors later reported smelling gasoline, though they didn’t think much of it at the time. Just before 8 p.m., the doorbell rang, usually a sign a taxi had arrived on the street below. The bell kept ringing, though no one had called for a cab. When the door was opened to investigate, a fireball burst into the room and the inferno quickly spread.“The ceiling tiles caught fire, the wallpaper caught fire, it just took over,” remembers Rosenthal, who was seated by the bar at the time. Bartender Buddy Rasmussen was able to lead Rosenthal and about 15 others to safety through a back door that led to the roof, then down to the street.It’s still not clear how, but the door through which the group escaped became locked, trapping the rest of the patrons. A few managed to squeeze through the burglar bars that blocked the windows. Larson became stuck in one window, burning to death in full view of the people below who were powerless to help.Now safely at street level, Rosenthal watched the tragedy unfold.“Several people were right there at the bottom of the stairway, at the entrance to the lounge, laying down bleeding and burned. It was rough,” he said. “It was very difficult to see. I had blood on my shirt from helping somebody. It was terrible. It was the worst thing I ever experienced in my life.”Later that night, Rosenthal and his friends were taken to the city morgue to identify some of the bodies. Some of those who were identified went unclaimed by families who were too ashamed to collect the remains of their gay sons and brothers. “They just let their kids go,” Rosenthal said. “It was the most horrific thing. To me, that was the worst part of it all. The parents would just not show up. They wouldn’t do their part.” Three victims were never identified, and were laid to rest in paupers’ graves.What happened in the aftermath of the fire makes clear the pervading homophobia at the time. In a TV news report the following day, survivors refused to show their faces on camera. Some were sacked when their employers found out they’d been injured in the fire. One victim, who later died of his injuries, learned on his deathbed that he’d lost his teaching job. A local radio show joked about victims’ ashes being kept in a fruit jar.New Orleans previously had declared days of mourning following similar tragedies, but City Hall didn’t acknowledge the fire. A local church was inundated with complaints after holding a small memorial service. The fire made national headlines but disappeared from the news within a few days.The most likely suspect in the arson was Roger “Dale” Nunez, who was thrown out of the bar earlier in the evening and was seen purchasing lighter fluid at a nearby drugstore just before the fire. He was questioned by police but never charged. A hustler with a history of mental health problems, Nunez allegedly confessed to a friend that he started the blaze, before killing himself a year later. It was a challenge for Rosenthal, now 65, to move on from what he’d experienced. “It took a good five or six years before I would finally walk into a gay bar,” he said. “Before I’d walk into restaurants, I always knew where the fire exits were. I don’t live like that anymore.”“What happened at Pulse, it did bring back some feelings, some anxiety,” Rosenthal added. “But you have to move on. I want people to understand, I don’t live in fear and I’m not gonna let anyone make me live in fear.” Click below to see more pictures of the UpStairs Lounge before the fire.An earlier version of this article was published in June 2017."

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action petition on behalf of the detainees last week to urge the courts to halt the deportations, calling them illegal and saying they would put the Iraqis in “extreme danger.” The ACLU’s petition notes many of those arrested are Chaldean Christians who would face “brutal persecution” in Iraq.While Goldsmith has yet to fully rule on the petition, his temporary stay cited the potential for “loss of life” should the deportations go forward without an “orderly court process.”“Irreparable harm is made out by the significant chance of loss of life and lesser forms of persecution that Petitioners have substantiated,” Goldsmith wrote in his ruling Thursday. “The public interest is also better served by an orderly court process that assures that Petitioners’ invocation of federal court relief is considered before the removal process continues.” Most of the detainees have prior criminal convictions, but had been allowed to stay in the country because Iraq had refused to issue travel documents for them to return. Aside from those in Michigan, 85 others have been arrested around the country in recent weeks and eight have already been deported, Reuters reports.Iraq reversed its longstanding policy on the travel documents earlier this year as part of negotiations with the White House to remove the country from President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban that targeted the residents of six Muslim-majority countries. The country was initially included in the ban’s first iteration.The ACLU on Thursday applauded Goldsmith’s decision, saying the move “may very well have saved numerous people from abuse and possible death.” Christians can face severe religious persecution in the Middle East, and both the Obama and Trump administrations have declared the treatment of the group a “genocide.” As HuffPost’s Akbar Shahid Ahmed notes, many Iraqi Christians in Michigan voted for Trump in the recent election, and community members have said they were startled the arrests went ahead despite the president’s campaign promises to protect Christian refugees.Authorities with Immigration and Customs Enforcement have defended the arrests despite the outcry. In a statement to the Detroit Free Press last week, Rebecca Adducci, the field office director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Detroit, said the proposed deportations addressed “the very real public safety threat represented” by those detained.“The vast majority of those arrested in the Detroit metropolitan area have very serious felony convictions, multiple felony convictions in many cases,” Adducci said.Goldsmith will now decide whether he has jurisdiction to decide if the Iraqis will be deported. ICE has argued district court does not have that power and the detainees can appeal any deportation decisions to immigration court."

He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for trying to steal an item bearing a propaganda slogan from his hotel, North Korea state media said.He was brought back to the United States last week with brain damage, in what doctors described as state of “unresponsive wakefulness”, and died on Monday.U.S. doctors who had traveled to the North last week to evacuate him had recognized that the North had “provided him with medical treatment and brought him back alive whose heart was nearly stopped,” the unnamed ministry spokesman said.“Although Warmbier was a criminal who committed a hostile act against the DPRK, we accepted the repeated requests of the present U.S. administration and, in consideration of his bad health, sent him back home on humanitarian grounds,” the spokesman said.DPRK is short for the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.The exact cause of Warmbier’s death remains unclear. Officials at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he was treated after his return from the North, declined to provide details, and his family asked the Hamilton County Coroner on Tuesday not to perform an autopsy."

The album, which also features songs made famous by Annie Lennox, Kings of Leon and Madonna, is quintessential Scott, whose mix of diva-esque belting and raunchy jokes have garnered her a loyal gay following.She emerged on the New York cabaret scene after years of trying out for Broadway musicals like “Hairspray” proved fruitless. Seeking an opportunity to perform outside of an audition room, she teamed up with co-writer Adam Hetrick of Playbill and music director Jesse Kissel to create a one-woman show she felt would find humor in “things I’ve experienced that I think a lot of people deal with, whether it’s drinking too much or putting my foot in my mouth.” Five years after her first cabaret evening, Scott finds herself in what appears to be a bit of a creative blitz. In addition to her new album, the Texas native, 37, is gearing up to hit the road this summer with a series of concerts that will include her first-ever performances in England. First up, however, is “Making America Gay Again,” her much-anticipated Pride weekend show at New York’s Joe’s Pub at the Public Theater.Watch Scott perform a Miley Cyrus/Judy Garland mashup below, then scroll down to keep reading. “I’d say that this is the gayest show, though some people would argue that every show I do is gay,” Scott said. Her set, she explained, will be an “ultimate gay playlist” of tunes by Donna Summer, Beyoncé and more that will follow a “musical journey through my bad decisions, my life choices that I can laugh at, and the people in my life — especially gay men — who enable me.”It’s fitting that Scott, who cites Bette Midler and Margaret Cho as influences and has been billed as a “[Judy] Garland for the Grindr era,” would dedicate her Saturday performance to “celebrating — and making fun of — the gay men in my life.”But “Making America Gay Again” won’t just be 90 minutes of pure levity. While performing on a gay cruise through the Caribbean in February, Scott spoke with men who had lived in the closet for much of their adult lives. The experience, she said, helped refresh her perspective on the LGBTQ community’s ongoing struggles, and gave her Pride performance a new focus.“You really take for granted the way New York allows everyone to live however they want,” she said. “I wouldn’t have a career if it weren’t for gay men. So this year in particular, I want to be able to celebrate everyone’s bravery and struggle, and put a spotlight on what is right.”Tori Scott performs “Making America Gay Again” at Joe’s Pub at the Public Theater in New York June 24.

30,POLITICS,Mayors Could Shift Nearly 42 Percent Of U.S. Electricity To Renewables By 2035,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mayors-renewable-100_us_594be6cae4b0a3a837be0251,"The U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is prompting more than 1,400 mayors to make their own pledges.",2017-06-23,The Sierra Club outlined three potential scenarios for cities helping to reach the goals set by the Paris Agreement. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594be7ff170000200010248b.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The country’s largest coalition of cities plans to vote this weekend on a pledge to make 100 percent renewable power a top policy priority over the next decade.The resolution by the U.S. Conference of Mayors ― who represent a 148 million people and 41.8 percent of the country’s electricity use ― would be the broadest rejection of President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. If each of the federation’s 1,481 cities actually converted to zero-emissions electricity by 2035, U.S. emissions of planet-warming gases would fall by 619 million metric tons, according to a Sierra Club analysis shared exclusively with HuffPost. That’s equal to the total combined carbon footprint of the five worst states emitting greenhouse gases: Texas, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Florida and Ohio.“The more cities that not only pledge to move to 100 percent renewable energy but pass that into a local law or ordinance and begin to work on that transition,” Jodie Van Horn, director of the Sierra Club’s “Ready for 100” campaign, told HuffPost by phone Wednesday from the mayors’ conference in Miami, “the closer we can get to meeting the Paris goals through city-level action.” The Paris Agreement, a pact signed by every nation except Syria and Nicaragua, set broad, non-binding targets for countries to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause the planet to warm and alter the climate. The U.S., historically the world’s biggest emitter, agreed to scale back pollution by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Trump announced plans to pull out of the deal this month after shredding virtually every policy meant to meet those goals. An alliance of more than 1,200 cities, counties, businesses and state leaders, led by billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, formed soon after, announcing plans to meet the Paris Agreement targets anyway. The group, called We Are Still In, includes some smaller municipalities than the U.S. Conference of Mayors, whose members have populations of at least 30,000.The Sierra Club analysis, based on data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the U.S. Energy Information Administration, considered two additional scenarios. If the 34 cities who already have plans in place to transition to 100 percent clean energy achieve their goal, the U.S. emission from electricity would fall by 19.1 million metric tons. The number increases to 34.5 million metric tons, equal to 3.4 percent of U.S. electricity consumption, if an additional 84 cities whose mayors pledged to completely switch to renewables but have yet to pass a formal policy also meet their target. Of the 100 who committed to that promise, 16 already approved policies to convert their electricity supply to solar or wind.Getting the entire U.S. Conference of Mayors to adopt solar and wind power remains the ideal, if lofty, goal, Van Horn said. “This is the good, better, best scenario,” she said, referring to the three situations outlined in the report.The analysis comes just days after new research sparked fresh debate over the feasibility of converting to 100 percent renewable energy. The study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, warned that the costs of shifting the U.S. electricity grid to renewables by 2050, as Democratic senators proposed in April, could prompt a political backlash. “If we push down the avenue of 100 percent renewables, it will become very obvious very quickly that it is neither cheap nor effective,” Christopher Clack, the study’s lead author, told InsideClimate News. “We worry that it could be used by our opponents to diminish the role of renewable energy on the grid. We worry if we oversell them, it will lead to disappointment and backlash.”Rather, Clack proposed policymakers should aim for a number closer to 80 percent renewable energy.That public discussion of clean energy has progressed at all to the percentage of renewable energy, rather than its merits compared to fossil fuels, struck Van Horn has a victory in itself. “We think the academic debate is healthy,” she said. “A few years ago, we wouldn’t have been having a debate.”CLARIFICATION: This post was updated to include the official resolution’s deadline of 2035.

Spiritually, it’s believed to be a time when God blesses and forgives. The holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, is observed with prayers, food, gifts, and community bonding.But this year, as Muslims await the beginning of Eid on Sunday or Monday, some are also full of anxiety about safety. Mosques hold special prayers and other activities during the final days of Ramadan, and attendance at worship centers swells, making mosque leaders especially concerned about security.Against a backdrop of increased anti-Muslim hate crimes and rhetoric, sometimes simply going to a mosque to pray can be an act of courage. American mosques have been targets for vandalism and other criminal acts for more than a decade. Many have responded by installing elaborate security systems with cameras and alarms in their worship spaces, and training members to watch for suspicious behavior. But over the past year, there’s been a dramatic uptick in anti-Muslim hate crime and rhetoric. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy organization, recorded a 57-percent rise in anti-Muslim bias incidents in 2016 from the year before. This included acts of vandalism and arson against mosques. Since Ramadan began on May 26, CAIR has recorded eight possible attacks on mosques. Zainab Arain, coordinator of CAIR’s department to monitor and combat Islamophobia, told HuffPost that the frequency of the anti-mosque incidents during Ramadan seemed comparable with the rest of the year. But recent incidents ― including an attack on a mosque in north London and the baseball-bat killing of Muslim teenager Nabra Hassanen in Virginia ― have made some community leaders especially apprehensive about the coming days. On Monday, CAIR called on Muslim communities to take extra security measures for the end o Ramadan and for Eid ― including requesting extra police patrols and hiring private security officers authorized to carry firearms. “Because of the recent spike in hate incidents ― particularly those targeting American Muslim women and girls ― and because Islamic religious institutions have been targeted recently in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, we urge local communities to implement increased security measures during end-of-Ramadan activities and through the Eid ul-Fitr holiday that follows,” Nihad Awad, CAIR’s national executive director, said in a statement.The Noor Islamic Cultural Center is a large complex in Dublin, Ohio, that serves a diverse community of Muslims in the central part of the state. Imran Malik, the center’s outreach director and president, told HuffPost the center began receiving threatening phone calls and hate mail about three years ago.Mosque leaders have worked hard since then to put safety measures into place, upgrading cameras and alarms, and hiring private armed and unarmed security guards during big events. Security concerns become even more important during the last few days of Ramadan, when Malik estimated as many as 3,000 people attend services at the mosque daily. During the holy month, security costs reach $600 per night, he said. But during the last 10 nights of the month, costs soar to about $1,000 per night, he said. Malik said the center spends up to $70,000 per year on security. The added cost has “taken a significant toll on our finances,” Malik said. But mosque leaders want to make sure everyone coming to the center feels safe.“Luckily, so far we haven’t run into any issues,” Malik said. “But we don’t want to stay at ease and then have something bad happen. We always want to be proactive.”Mosque leaders in other parts of the country also prioritize security during Ramadan. Imam Talib M. Shareef, of The Nation’s Mosque, Masjid Muhammad, in Washington, D.C., said he’s asked local police to be at the mosque during Eid, in addition to a volunteer community-based security team. Kalim Ahmed, a board member at the Islamic Society of Western Maryland, told HuffPost the attacks in Virginia and London have “escalated” Muslims’ fears about safety, both individually and when they come together. Ahmed said his mosque has installed security cameras, an alarm system, and a large metal entrance gate. Leaders have asked law enforcement to patrol the area, and have recruited community volunteers to stay on the lookout for suspicious activity. Saleh M. Sbenaty, a spokesman for the Islamic Center Of Murfreesboro in Tennessee, said the 35-year-old religious congregation began having security troubles after purchasing land for a permanent mosque. Sbenaty said the mosque, which was completed in 2012, has already installed a video system and door-entry security. During Ramadan, leaders usually take extra security measures, including limiting points of entry, hiring a private security guard, and giving volunteers the task of being vigilant during services. Sbenaty said that tragic events like the Virginia slaying and the attack on the London mosque put his community “on edge, especially because we live on the outskirt of a small city in Middle Tennessee.“Our center has endured seven years of harassments, bomb threats, arson, threats and so on and so forth,” Sbenaty said. The Islamic Center of Nashville has taken efforts this year to maintain its close relationship with local law enforcement. Rashed Fakhruddin, the center’s president, told HuffPost that new police cadets visited the center earlier this Ramadan during a bus tour to learn about the city’s diversity. The center has requested extra patrols during this year’s Ramadan and Eid, Fakhruddin said.Despite the security concerns of American Muslims, President Donald Trump hasn’t addressed the issue. Some Muslim leaders hope the president speaks against attacks on American mosques in the same way that he condemned a string of phone threats against Jewish community centers nationwide earlier this year. (A suspect was charged with making those threats.)Malik, the leader from Ohio, said that he believes America’s elected leaders are responsible for safeguarding the rights and safety of Muslim Americans and other minorities.“The Muslim community overall, throughout the nation, would appreciate such a [condemnation] from the president,” Malik said. It would be a sign that “the president is concerned about the security of not only one ethnicity, but everyone who has chosen America as their home.”But others, like Sbenaty, believe such talk wouldn’t be enough. What American Muslims need are actions that will correct Islamophobic rhetoric and stop alienating religious minorities, he said.“Words will not be adequate, enough damage has been already done,” Sbenaty said."

On June 23, 2016, Brits stunned the world when they voted in a Brexit referendum to become the first European Union member in history to withdraw from the bloc. Just 51.9 percent favored leaving, creating a divide that remains largely unchanged ― despite months of political hysteria and fallout.Global stock markets tumbled and the British pound plunged to a three-decade low as news of the results broke. The next day, a defeated David Cameron announced his resignation as prime minister, barely a year after winning his unlikely re-election for a second term.Former Home Secretary Theresa May replaced Cameron in July after all her opponents withdrew from the sudden race. The new leader ― who initially opposed Brexit but quickly found herself leading the departure ― promised not to call a snap vote ahead of Britain’s general election scheduled for 2020. Then, in April, she did call the short-notice snap vote for June 8 ― Brits’ third major plebiscite in little more than two years.Polls predicted an easy victory for May’s Conservative Party, which was poised to benefit from the political gamble by expanding its parliamentary majority ahead of critical Brexit dealings with the EU. Instead, the Tories lost 13 seats in yet another shocking turn of events, leaving the United Kingdom with a hung parliament and weakened negotiating stance.Desperate to retain her party’s power, May scrambled to join forces with an unlikely ally: Northern Ireland’s tiny, ultra-religious Democratic Unionist Party. Together, the two parties hold 328 seats in Parliament ― just above the 326 needed to ensure a majority. DUP members will serve as a lifeline for May’s government, but they have a history of controversial, draconian policies and could leverage their own conditions for loyalty. The prime minister is also grappling to address a string of tragic attacks on British soil in recent months. She assumed office shortly after a far-right extremist murdered opposition Labour Party lawmaker Jo Cox, a vocal Brexit opponent, on June 16, 2016.In March, British terrorist Khalid Masood drove a vehicle through a crowd of pedestrians on London’s Westminster Bridge before stabbing an unarmed officer, resulting in five deaths. In May, a suicide bomber killed 22 people at a concert in Manchester. In June, a group of men plowed a van into a crowd of people on London Bridge before stabbing others in the area, killing eight. On Monday, a driver struck and killed a Muslim worshiper at a mosque in London’s Finsbury Park.May responded by vowing to roll back human rights protections if they “get in the way” of tackling terrorism.She is also trying to work out a favorable divorce deal ahead of Britain’s impending departure through talks with EU leaders, which began this week, as calls for her resignation grow louder. Nearly two-thirds of Conservative party members hoped she would step down, according to a survey released shortly after their “humiliating victory.”But polling data collected by U.K.-based research firm YouGov reveals that the past year’s political setbacks and turbulence seem to have had little effect on public opinion surrounding Brexit. The country has remained “split down the middle” with minimal fluctuation as to whether withdrawing from the EU was the right or wrong choice, YouGov founding director Joe Twyman told HuffPost.The numbers’ consistency, he speculates, is due to the fact that “very little has changed.”“Brexit has been confirmed and negotiations have started, but little has actually happened,” he said. “We’re still in the European Union, we’re still subject to the European Union’s laws and regulations, and will be for at least another year and a half. For the average person on the street, it has had zero impact on them so far.”Britain has just under two years to prepare and complete its divorce dealings before it must officially forgo its EU membership. Much remains unknown as the country wades toward unprecedented territory, but the uncertainty and potentially looming consequences are not yet having a direct or major effect on most people’s lives, Twyman explained.“There’s been a lot of discussion of [voting] regret ― and yes, everyone can point to someone they know, a friend of a friend, who has changed their mind following the referendum ― but actually that’s taken place in tiny numbers,” he added. “The overall story remains the same.”Although nearly half the nation voted against Brexit last June and still believes it was the wrong decision, 70 percent of Brits now feel the separation must be enacted in light of the referendum results, according to YouGov’s latest data.Public confidence in May’s abilities to secure a Brexit deal that is good for Britain, on the other hand, has fallen considerably since the snap election, from 48 percent in March to just 37 percent last week. However, the majority of Brits still approve of the negotiating targets she established earlier this year.The prime minister’s favorability rating plummeted from +10 in April to -34 in mid-June. Her electoral rival, opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, has risen from -42 in April to zero, meaning that just as many people now view him favorably as those who view him unfavorably.But even May’s disastrous election bid and frenzied alliance with the DUP hasn’t had much of an effect on public support for or against Brexit, Twyman noted.“Most people just aren’t paying attention,” he said. “The minutiae of the EU negotiations are an obsession for the Conservative Party and of interest to people in the Westminster bubble, but for the broad public, they just don’t care.”The U.K.’s many terrorist attacks, some of which were carried out by foreign nationals, have also done little to sway Brits’ Brexit views, Twyman said. For those who are against immigration, which was a key factor for voters in the referendum, terrorist attacks reinforce their support for tighter border controls, he explained. “If you’re for immigration, you see this as not relevant.”Public perception is likely to change eventually, because the circumstances are bound to change eventually ― the real question is about timing, Twyman concluded. “Depending on how the negotiations go and depending on what compromises need to take place, it’s inevitable that it will change at some stage. We just don’t know when,” he said. “There’s been posturing and there’s been positioning, but actually things have pretty much stayed the same, and so as a result the views have stayed the same.”"

36,POLITICS,San Francisco's Transit Agency Promises No Immigration Raids,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bart-immigration_us_594c49b3e4b0da2c731a876a,"BART joins two other transit systems pledging that public transit is safe for all riders, regardless of immigration status.",2017-06-23,"A Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) train enters the platform area at the Rockridge station in Oakland, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594c59c329000020003b0c06.jpeg?cache=XP48JgRTXO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bay Area Rapid Transit, which operates mass transit in the San Francisco area, reassured riders Thursday that it won’t conduct immigration raids on board its vehicles or target people seeking a job with the agency. The transit agency’s board passed a resolution that prohibits the use of its funds or resources to enforce federal immigration law. The measure, called the Safe Transit Policy, bans employees from seeking riders’ immigration status, limits the cooperation of employees with federal authorities in conducting immigration checks and arrests, and prevents BART from asking job applicants about their immigration status.BART joins transit agencies in Chicago and in Portland, Oregon, in reassuring riders that employees won’t enforce immigration laws or lead raids. The BART resolution was first introduced by board member Nick Josefowitz. It was co-sponsored by Lateefah Simon, who campaigned for the position in November on a platform that safe access to transportation is an issue of social and economic justice. Encountering Immigrations Customs Enforcement can take a physical and emotional toll on people’s health, Alameda Public Defender Raha Jorjani argued in support of the resolution during a hearing Thursday at BART’s Oakland headquarters. “We’re talking about the health, well-being and civility of families,” Jorjani said. “In the Bay Area, specifically, our office has noticed a distinct rise in the presence and enforcement of ICE operations. There are few spaces left that are safe, and a space that is as important as BART simply must be one of them.”Those concerns aren’t completely unfounded. In February, rumors spread online that ICE had set up checkpoints throughout the East Bay, including one outside a BART station, though authorities later said those claims were false.Similar online rumors swirled in Chicago and the greater Portland, Oregon, area earlier this year, and authorities reacted by reassuring riders that transit employees would not enforce immigration laws. “We do not participate in or support this type of activity,” the Chicago Transit Authority said in a statement in February. “It’s important to us that everyone, no matter who they are, how they identify, or where they’re from feel comfortable and confident riding transit in Chicago: You are welcome here.”Oregon’s TriMet transit agency announced a no-raid policy the same month.“We do not support targeting any of our riders or any members of our community. Period,” TriMet said in a statement. “We deeply regret that these fast-spreading rumors have caused concerns about TriMet and the safety of our riders.”BART’s resolution reaffirms the region’s leadership on progressive immigration policies in the face of President Donald Trump’s vows to boost deportations and enact hard-line immigration policies.In April, a federal court in San Francisco ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities ― local jurisdictions, including San Francisco, that limit cooperation with federal authorities in immigration law enforcement.

Harper’s son, Pierce Hill Harper, was born in December 2015. Harper told “Good Morning America” host Robin Roberts last week that he left the set of the Tupac biopic “All Eyez On Me” to catch a plane so he could be in the delivery room when Pierce was born. He even cut the umbilical cord.In his interview with Roberts, the actor and philanthropist described the experience of becoming a father as “the biggest role” and “biggest blessing” of his life despite all the difficulties. “Every day you’re making a different set of decisions that you feel impact the future of this wonderful person,” he said. “That’s a challenge. It’s a beautiful challenge, but it’s a challenge.”Harper had always wanted to be a father, but figured he would first get married and later start a family. He told Roberts that when his friend encouraged him to look into adoption in 2015, he said it wasn’t “the way it’s supposed to happen.” Harper quickly proved himself wrong, though.After taking his friend’s advice and getting more information about adoption from an attorney, Harper decided he wasn’t ready. But in November 2015 he received a call from the adoption attorney who explained a pregnant woman was due in three weeks and interested in having her child adopted. That’s when Harper had to decide whether he wanted to become a single father or continue to wait. The actor told People that choosing to adopt Pierce then was “the greatest decision” he’s made in his life.Harper also told People his family and his girlfriend have been incredibly supportive of him and Pierce. The 18-month-old loves music, and his dad plays classical songs for him often.Harper admitted to People that he was “so scared” about becoming a single father, but now after a year-and-a-half with Pierce, he sees the impact his son has had on his life. “Looking back now, all the fears I had were ridiculously small compared to the joy of having him in my life and having the opportunity to be a father,” he said.H/T PeopleThe HuffPost Parents newsletter, So You Want To Raise A Feminist, offers the latest stories and news in progressive parenting.

On June 20, two Seattle police officers shot and killed Charleena Lyles, a 30-year-old pregnant mother of three. The following day, the former Milwaukee police officer who shot and killed 23-year-old Sylville Smith in 2016 was found not guilty of reckless murder. On June 23, a second mistrial was declared for a former University of Cincinnati police officer charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter for fatally shooting 47-year-old Sam DuBose.

It seemed like there was barely time to process one of these events, to come to terms with the anger and the fear and the grief, before the next wave hit.That, too, felt familiar.Last summer, there was another head-spinning few days when two police officers shot and killed Alton Sterling, 37, in Louisiana. One day later and a thousand miles to the north, Castile was killed. In both cases, there was graphic video.Footage shows Sterling being body-slammed by one officer and pinned to the ground before he is shot in the chest. Toward the end of the video, you can see Sterling lying on his back with his arms splayed out and his chest covered in blood.The next day, Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, streamed video of the aftermath of Castile’s shooting on Facebook Live. The stream shows an agonized Castile with his head back and his eyes open, motionless and drenched in blood. The shootings of DuBose, Lyles and Smith ― the latter two of whom were mentally ill, according to their families ― are equally disturbing. On dashcam audio of the moments leading up to Lyles’ death, you can hear officers shouting “Get back! Get back!” One officer tells the other to “tase her,” but the second officer does not have a Taser on him. The officers order Lyles to “get back” several more times before shots ring out and a child is heard crying in the background. Smith, who was armed, fled within seconds of being pulled over by officers in Milwaukee. He dashed into a yard with a chain-link fence, which he threw his gun over as an officer fired.

This is one reason why a list of victims from every high-profile police killing ― Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice, Rekia Boyd, Dontre Hamilton, John Crawford, and on and on and on ― runs through the minds of black people each time a new one happens.After a while, the names blur together. “Black grief belongs to the world, and is regulated by the same forces that caused such deep pain in the first place,” Mychal Denzel Smith wrote this week at The New Republic. “Black families become advocates, activists, and spokespeople, historians, journalists, and policy experts, while also being the gatekeepers of the legacy and humanity of those they’ve lost,” he continued. “And they must somehow do all of this while comforting a society that both produced the conditions for these tragic deaths and still refuses to acknowledge its role in them.” Another video from the Castile shooting shows Reynolds throwing her head back and screaming.

Women ― and plenty of men ― aren’t having this.The 79-year-old comic just recently avoided a verdict in a criminal sexual assault trial because the jury couldn’t agree on his guilt. Now spokesman Andrew Wyatt says Cosby’s considering doing a series of town halls on sexual assault, aimed at “young people,” starting this summer.Cosby’s lectures apparently would be about how to avoid getting charged with assault.The absurdity and horror did not go unnoticed.“It’s like O.J. searching for his ex-wife’s killer,” Nancy Erika Smith, the lawyer who represented former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson in her sexual harassment case against the network’s then-Chairman Roger Ailes, told HuffPost. “He convinces some jurors that he wasn’t guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (a high standard) so now he thinks we’re all stupid. He’s beyond disgusting.”Yes, it’s mostly men who still control the levers of power in the United States ― they dominate the entertainment realm in which Cosby was able to maneuver for decades and they make up the overwhelming majority of business leaders and politicians. But their vice-grip on power is truly weakening. Just this week, the CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick, was forced to step down from his perch because a woman spoke up. Former Uber engineer Susan Fowler’s February blog post exposing the ride-sharing company’s culture of sexual harassment set in motion Kalanick’s demise. Earlier this year, Bill O’Reilly lost his post at Fox News, after women opened up about how he mistreated them. His boss, Ailes, was ousted last year after Carlson and multiple other women came forward with their stories.In these cases, brave women spoke up and we believed them. Powerful men were held to account.“We’ve seen over the last few years more women stand up and fight back against rape culture and sexual assault,” Karin Roland, chief campaigns officer at the nonprofit women’s advocacy group UltraViolet, told HuffPost.“When women do stand up and fight back and are successful, misogynists feel their power slipping away,” she said.When that happens, the men get scared and they fight harder, she added. That could help explain how Trump got elected. What’s more terrifying to a misogynist than an inexperienced egomaniac in the White House? A woman president.The backlash and fear of women’s power also could be part of the reason Cosby and his camp are trying to get away with this tour idea.Many of us found it incredibly disheartening that a jury let Cosby off the hook last week, failing to reach a verdict in a sexual assault case brought by Andrea Constand.But Cosby’s hardly home free. The prosecutor in the case said he’ll bring the comedian to trial again. His reputation as America’s dad is destroyed. And he’s already admitted to drugging Constand (and other women) and then having sexual relations with them. (He argues it was all consensual.)This wouldn’t even be Cosby’s first controversial lecture tour. He’s been widely criticized for a series of talks given to African Americans, in which he blamed them for harassment and discrimination. The tour could also be an attempt by Cosby’s legal team to sway public opinion, influencing the minds of a future jury by attempting to portray himself as the hapless victim of a smear campaign.“Mr. Cosby’s so-called workshops appear to be a transparent and slick effort to attempt to influence the jury pool from which jurors will be selected for his second criminal trial,” Gloria Allred said in a statement Thursday. “Mr. Cosby should understand, however, that this is not about optics,” added Allred, who represents many of the women who accuse Cosby of assaulting them ― some have active civil suits against Cosby making their way through the courts ― and who was in the courtroom for this most recent trial.The optics are, of course, terrible.“What the hell,” Carlson tweeted, after learning about the tour.It’s not even clear that Cosby really means to go through with it. In a statement to HuffPost, his spokesman Wyatt tried to clarify the plan, but didn’t really. Instead he just said that thousands of organizations had asked Cosby to speak about the judicial system ― and the comedian would do so for free. What is clear: If Cosby tries to actually do this, women are ready. Roland’s UltraViolet ― which was instrumental in organizing protests around O’Reilly ― said it intends to protest any kind of Cosby event.“Cosby’s ‘how to get away with rape’ tour is a disgusting display of rape culture,” Roland said. If he goes through with it, she added: “He should certainly expect women all over the country to hold him accountable.”"
42,POLITICS,The Trash Incinerator Industry Is Trying To Tank A Massive Renewable-Energy Effort,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trash-incinerator-renewable-energy_us_594d7fede4b05c37bb767c15,A tiny trade group threatens to kneecap the biggest attempt yet to get cities to reject President Trump's Paris accord withdrawal.,2017-06-23,"Trucks sit parked outside the municipal waste-to-energy incinerator facility in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594d8181290000cc0f3b0e89.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Advocates for the trash-incineration industry are trying to sink an effort to get nearly 1,500 cities behind 100 percent renewable energy, according to an email obtained by HuffPost. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, the largest nonpartisan coalition of city executives in the country, is set to vote Monday on a proposal to make converting to zero-emissions energy a top priority, laying out a policy framework for making the shift. If approved, the resolution would be the broadest rejection yet of President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate deal to reduce planet-warming emissions. But first, the motion must clear the organization’s energy committee.On Friday, the Energy Recovery Council ― a trade group representing companies that operate most of the country’s 77 power plants that burn solid waste ― asked its members to send letters to the committee’s 13 members and urge them to block the motion because it doesn’t include burning garbage as a source of renewable energy. The email, sent by association President Ted Michaels to the roughly two dozen cities with trash-incineration plants, included a prewritten letter. It’s unclear if the companies in the trade group were also encouraged to join the campaign. “ERC is sending a letter to the USCM Energy Committee expressing opposition to the proposed resolution,” Michaels wrote in the email. “It would be extremely helpful if ERC Municipal Members would also communicate opposition to the proposed policy by emailing the Energy Committee. I have attached a short letter for you to use.”Michaels did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Electricity from trash incineration makes up only a tiny fraction of the U.S. output. In 2015, waste-to-energy plants produced roughly 14 billion kilowatt-hours burning about 29 million tons of garbage, according to data from the Energy Information Association. By contrast, renewable energy from sources such as hydropower, wind and solar made up nearly 15 percent of the 4.08 trillion kilowatt-hours generated last year. At the same time, incinerators do help reduce the waste pileup. In 2014, incinerators diverted 13 percent of the nation’s 258 million tons of solid waste from landfills. Still, incinerators are by far the most expensive source of electricity, with a projected capital cost of $8,232 per kilowatt for new waste incinerator facilities, according to the EIA’s 2010 annual energy outlook report. In 2011, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, became the largest U.S. city to declare bankruptcy amid the skyrocketing cost of operating an aging incineration facility.Detroit taxpayers have spent over $1.2 billion on debt payments from the construction and upgrading of the world’s largest trash incinerator, according to the nonprofit Zero Waste Detroit.  As a result, residents have had to pay high trash disposal fees of over $150 per ton. The city could have saved over $55 million in just one year if it had never built the incinerator. Last year, amid mounting odor violations, an environmental group sued the plant. Waste-to-energy plants have a huge environmental impact. In 2004, New York state denied incinerator facilities entry to the state’s renewable energy standard because mercury-emission measurements from such facilities four years earlier were on average six times higher than coal, according to a 2011 article in Scientific American.This article has been updated to reflect that the initial metric of kilowatt hours provided by EIA in reference to new capital costs should have been kilowatts."

In season two’s second episode, which aired on Wednesday, one of the main characters, Ralph Angel, is at a restaurant with his son, Blue, and Blue’s mother, Darla. During the episode, titled “To Usward,” there’s a moment in which Blue shows his doll named Kenya to the waiter, who encourages the boy to get a Transformer. This doesn’t sit well with Ralph, who defends his son’s choice to play with dolls.“We’re going to get two ice cream sundaes, all the toppings y’all got ― one for my son and one for his doll. You got me?” Ralph Angel tells the waiter. “Queen Sugar” creator Ava DuVernay spoke about her decision to have Blue play with a doll in an interview with the Los Angeles Times from September. DuVernay, the first woman of color to direct a $100 million film, explained that her goal of the OWN show is to reflect “all parts of our identity as black people.” She added she also wanted to challenge certain ideas of masculinity.“I want to start to interrogate the ways in which we embrace our identity, and that’s happening with all the characters. Everyone is upside down with who they are and what it means to be someone else,” she told the Los Angeles Times. “It felt like there was a good opportunity with Blue to do the same, particularly around issues of identity as it relates to the ways in which we conform to certain notions of masculinity in the black community.”In the interview, DuVernay mentioned she didn’t want Blue and his doll to be a “flag-waving” part of the first season, but she and the rest of her writers are ready to explore the topic more as Blue gets older and as more people start to notice his devotion to his toy. “This is a commitment from me and the writers to really explore this storyline in a long-term way,” she said.The HuffPost Parents newsletter, So You Want To Raise A Feminist, offers the latest stories and news in progressive parenting.

He discarded his tribe’s long-held rule of succession and appointed his 30-year old favorite son, Prince Mohammad, to the position of Deputy Crown Prince, and the effective day-to-day ruler of the realm ahead of numerous more senior princes in the line of succession. Then, two days ago, he elevated this favorite son to the position of Crown Prince, a promotion that in retrospect would appear to have been his intention all along and we predict the King’s early abdication in favor of his son to better assure his succession.Why has King Salman’s decision doomed the House of Saud?Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia, had 36 known surviving sons to reach adulthood from numerous wives; seven full brothers, the Sudairi (their mother’s family name) brothers, have been the most powerful. To maintain family unity, Abdul-Aziz secured the promise of his sons to follow the simple rule of age for succession among his sons (leaving aside the issue of succession to the next generation). Many of his sons had reputedly feared the monopolization of power by the Sudairi brothers but they realized that their father’s directive was in the long-term interest of family rule. While there have been family frictions, it seemed that succession and power sharing would survive. While King Salman’s decision to elevate his young son is effectively a soft coup to make his direct descendants the rulers of the realm, it threatens the House of Saud because of (i) the elevation of his direct descendants over more than 10,000 other princes, and (ii) the character, judgment and qualification of the son he has chosen to succeed him.One does not have to be a psychiatrist to recognize a simple facet of human nature. No family member relishes being pushed aside by a patriarch, especially if the favored family member is much younger, less educated and inexperienced and has manipulated an aging patriarch to promote his elevation. Now if there were a few family members, then we could see how they might be co-opted or neutralized, but here there are more than 10,000 male relatives in the House of Saud! You don’t have to be a devotee of Shakespeare to expect one or more of the 10,000 to try to right the wrong. There will undoubtedly be a struggle to depose Mohammad bin Salman now or in the future. The House of Saud will be rendered asunder. King Salman may try to prevent this by his early abdication, but even this move is unlikely to restore harmony to the House of Saud.As important in all this is Price Mohammad’s character, judgment and actions since his father became king. He embarked on a program of much needed economic reforms. An integral part of this plan was a reduction of the lavish subsidies afforded to the Saudi public that had been a part and parcel of the Al-Saud pact with the citizenry—stay out of politics and we will provide for you. But with low oil prices and the gloomy outlook for the future, something had to be done. So Prince Mohammad decreed that Saudis would receive lower benefits. This might have been acceptable if everyone was asked to make an equitable sacrifice. But this was not so. Prince Mohammad had a 258-foot yacht, Pegasus, which was valued at about $125 million. In 2016, while holidaying in France, he saw a 440-foot yacht, Serene, that he just had to have! Reportedly, that same day, he dispatched his man to buy this yacht from its Russian owner for a whopping $550 million! What judgment! He tells the people to do with less while he buys a bigger yacht; and most important, all this with money that comes from oil revenues in the national treasury, oil that in Islam belongs to all the people of this and future generations. This is not a future ruler but a spoiled child in a toy store.This ambitious young man, enjoying Trump’s military backing and full of hubris, has adopted policies that could embroil Saudi Arabia in conflicts for years to come. Over the last two years, he has expanded the conflict in Yemen with troops and indiscriminate bombing of civilians. Although he has garnered the support of the Trump Administration in this war effort, this is a surrogate war with Iran that seems to be going nowhere. But one thing is for sure; the killing of thousands of Yemeni civilians is getting Saudi Arabia thousands of potential enemies. He has placed an embargo on Qatar that threatens the future of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC, a regional security arrangement). This arrangement (in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution) among five sheikdoms and Saudi Arabia is being torn asunder. After the ultimatum today to Qatar, demanding its total subservience and the payment of an unspecified sum of cash, the possibility of a military confrontation with Turkey (that has a base in Qatar), Iran (with a treaty with Qatar) and Iraq looms large. Prince Mohammad’s obsession with Iran will only increase conflict in the Persian Gulf and endanger the future of Al-Saud rule. His verbal barrage against Iran, accusing it of terrorist acts and plans to dominate the Islamic World while he proclaims Saudi Arabia’s selfless guardianship of Islam rings hollow and exposes Saudi Arabia to closer scrutiny. In recent years, the Al-Sauds have demolished most of the historical sites of Islam in Mecca and have replaced them with structures and highways where homes of Prophet Mohammad’s companions and sacred buildings once stood. During Hajj, all Muslims are presumed to be equal, but in recent years inequalities are increasingly on display. Al-Sauds have built palaces overlooking the Kaaba; and rich pilgrims can enjoy luxurious living in $3,000-a-night rooms that overlook the Kaaba while poor Muslims get by with minimal accommodations. When pilgrims become so unequal—where equality is to be supreme—Muslims know all that they need know to confirm the illegitimate rule of the Al-Sauds. For the more than 10,000 Al-Saud princes the issues are two. First, there has been a coup that has upended the tribal pact that was the rule of succession. Second, Prince Mohammad’s behavior and actions endanger Al-Saud rule and with it all the benefits that they now enjoy. There is only one solution—undo what has been done! "

So far in 2017, retailers have set a record pace for bankruptcies and store closings. Household names are faring no better than small shops: J.C. Penney said it would shutter 138 locations in July; Macy’s expects 68 locations to close this year; and Sears Holdings will turn off the lights at over 170 Kmart and Sears stores. Since January, 50,000 retail jobs have been cut.Credit ratings agency Moody’s added to an already-grim outlook when, earlier this month, its list of U.S. retailers at risk of bankruptcy rose to 22. That’s higher than the 19 at-risk retailers singled out during the financial crisis.Amid this gloomy picture, retailers are lobbying more than ever. Lobbying expenditures rose by 31 percent in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the same period last year. So far in 2017, retailers have spent $16.4 million lobbying Congress. They spent $45.8 million last year.Retailers are pushing for “anything that puts money in the consumer’s pocket,” says Howard Davidowitz, an independent retail consultant. That means tax cuts are a top priority.It’s little surprise that lobbying spiked as Republican leadership in the House has called for a border adjustment tax. To encourage domestic production, the controversial tax arrangement would tax exporters at a lower rate than importers by allowing companies to deduct the cost of American-made goods from taxable revenue. Retailers, whose products are mostly imported, would be hard hit under the proposal. They argue that consumers would ultimately bear the cost of such a tax—to the tune of $1,700 each year—through higher prices.Retailers jumped into action to oppose the bill. CEOs of Target, Best Buy, and J.C. Penney, among others, met with President Trump in February. Retailers joined oil refiners and automakers to launch Americans for Affordable Products, an advocacy group that has aired ads criticizing the tax proposal. (Companies that primarily export, like Boeing and Dow Chemical, formed their own group—the American Made Coalition—in opposition.)Testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee, Target CEO Brian Cornell estimated that Target’s tax rate would increase by 40 percent with a border tax. He added that Target’s customers—“middle-class working families whose budgets are already stretched”—would bear the brunt through price hikes. Cornell got a sympathetic response from Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.), who once worked for Target and now represents the company’s home district. Paulsen said he could not support border adjustment in its current form. Behind the scenes, Target has spent $1.3 million lobbying just this year—jumping from number ten to number four in lobbying outlays among retailers since 2016, when it spent $1.7 million.Those efforts have kept border adjustment at bay. In an interview with CNBC last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin criticized the scheme for creating an uneven playing field with “different impacts on different companies.” In private he has signaled to lawmakers that the tax proposal does not have White House backing.But retailers will not rest easy until they’ve killed off talk of border adjustment for good. That hasn’t happened yet: Border adjustment is tied to corporate tax reform, a centerpiece of the Republican agenda. (Authors of the Republican tax blueprint claim that border adjustment will raise $1 trillion in tax revenue over a decade, which will be necessary to offset revenue losses from their goal of a significantly lower headline corporate tax rate.) On Tuesday Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) made clear that he plans to push ahead with a tax overhaul in 2017. Earlier this month, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said he wants to see border adjustment phased in over five years.Another lobbying issue for retailers is a digital sales tax. Here retailers are divided: On one side are remote sellers that have no obligation under federal law to collect and remit tax on Internet sales. On the other side are big-box retailers and Amazon, which do charge sales tax. In April, senators reintroduced a bill known as the Marketplace Fairness Act to address the discrepancy. (It passed the Senate in 2013 but never made it to the House.) The National Retail Federation, a trade group that has spent $2.3 million lobbying this year, backs the bill.A digital sales tax seems low on the list of lawmaker priorities. Mired in debates over healthcare and corporate tax reform, “Congress has bigger fish to fry,” says Richard Pomp, a law professor at the University of Connecticut.Part of the retail lobbying frenzy this year is due simply to the fact that there’s a new administration, adds Davidowitz, the consultant. “There’s a tremendous amount of change being talked about. It would be understandable that you want to get the word in as quickly as you can to the new people.”"

For him, America lived up to its promise as a land of opportunity, hope and freedom.Tragically, just a few decades later, the doors of our nation would be shut to many Jews desperately fleeing the Third Reich, including the 937 Jewish passengers of the MS St. Louis, who arrived in the harbor of Havana, Cuba 78 years ago this month. These men, women and children also sought safe passage to our country and a new life in a nation of immigrants.But rather than being welcomed and protected, all but a few of the refugees on board this ship were turned away and sent back to Europe, where roughly a quarter of them were murdered in the Holocaust.The passengers of the MS St. Louis were turned away in part because of a toxic, xenophobic ‘America First’ ideology that pervaded mainstream American life at the time. This anti-immigrant, anti-refugee mentality was accompanied by widespread antisemitism, exemplified by the best-known advocate of the ‘America First’ doctrine, Charles Lindbergh.Today, in the era of President Trump, the story of the MS St. Louis has an especially frightening resonance, especially amid his continued attempts to implement a dangerous, discriminatory ‘Muslim ban.’ Thanks to Trump’s bigoted and violent rhetoric, his appointment of dangerous radicals like Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka to key administration posts, and his implementation of policies that reflect this regressive worldview, the ‘America First’ mindset is making a comeback, accompanied by escalated anti-immigrant hysteria, anti-Muslim bigotry, anti-black racism, and the same antisemitism that helped energize the movement in the 1930s. Amid Trump’s political rise, we’ve seen the growth of a white nationalist ‘alt-right’ movement that promotes antisemitism and engages in violent harassment of Jews both online and in the real world. Jewish cemeteries have been defaced, and swastikas have covered college campuses. Jewish activists and journalists have also been targeted with horrifying abuse online and, in some cases, are facing threats to their safety and that of their families.According to the latest reports, there has a been a staggering 86 percent increase in antisemitic incidents between last year and this year. We’ve seen similar escalations in violence against Muslims, immigrants and other marginalized groups, most recently the horrific murders in Portland and at the University of Maryland.This white nationalism is driving our society to retreat into senseless hatred and ignore the fundamental values—liberty, equality, respect for human dignity—that form our national creed and highest aspirations.If we want to rise above ‘America First’ and actually live up to our core values, we need to actively oppose the mindset and creeping acceptance of societal norms that allow Trump’s angry vision and the white nationalism that fuels it to persist.We’ve already seen this happening in important and inspiring ways across the country. From the Women’s March, to the airport protests against Trump’s Muslim ban, to constituents demanding accountability from their members of Congress at town halls, millions of Americans nationwide are standing up and resisting the politics of hatred, fear and division. It’s no surprise that Jewish Americans, mindful of what authoritarian, bigoted leaders have meant for our people throughout history, have been deeply involved in each of these forms of opposition. Across the country, groups of Jewish Americans are organizing in their communities to fight back and to support elected officials and political candidates who do the same. Jewish Americans have been building coalitions with other religious groups to rebuild burnt mosques targeted by arsonists, repair vandalized Jewish cemeteries, and support communities being harassed and threatened by white nationalists.The passengers of the MS St. Louis were turned away because the toxic mindset of fear, xenophobia and the ‘America First’ ideology won out over our better communal impulses. Today, as President Trump parrots similar language and values – dog whistles to white nationalists – we must not despair. We must remember that we are capable of overcoming this toxic mindset if we work together.To succeed, we need to continue the fight against Trump’s radical agenda. From vicious crackdowns on immigrants, to devastating proposed cuts to the social safety net and key government programs, to racially biased and vindictive criminal justice policies, the Trump administration is attacking progress and threatening our country’s well-being at every turn.We need to speak out loudly and make sure that our elected officials understand that the American people have seen this before and oppose these dangerous policies. We must also work to wrest back political power from the extremists who now wield it by electing candidates who will advance a unifying, progressive agenda. In doing so, we will honor the memory of the passengers of the MS St. Louis and reject the legacy of hatred, fear and antisemitism that their tragedy represents.‘America First’ failed us before, and if we don’t reject it now, it will surely fail us again.Stosh Cotler is the CEO of Bend the Arc Jewish Action, an organization that brings progressive Jews together to advocate and organize for a more just and equal society."

49,POLITICS,Republican Sen. Dean Heller Says He Can't Support GOP Health Care Bill 'In This Form',Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dean-heller-health-care_us_594d6429e4b0da2c731b73fd,He cited cuts to Medicaid in his opposition.,2017-06-23,"Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) speaks during a news conference on June 27, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594d6476290000bc0f3b0e16.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) on Friday offered a harsh assessment of Senate Republicans’ health care bill and vowed to withhold his support for it unless it is altered significantly. Speaking at a joint press conference with Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) in Las Vegas, Heller said the Senate bill must protect states, like his, that expanded Medicaid and preserve gains in coverage that resulted from the Affordable Care Act.“In this form, I will not support it,” Heller said. “It’s going to be very difficult to get me to a yes. They have a lot of work to do.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has a narrow path to the 50 votes he needs to pass the health care bill, and plans to move swiftly for a vote that could come before the end of next week.McConnell already faces dissatisfaction from more conservative Republicans, including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who say the bill doesn’t undo enough of the Affordable Care Act. Other GOP senators, like Maine’s Susan Collins, have expressed misgivings about the legislation’s Medicaid cuts and effects on coverage.But no “moderate” Republican senator to date has levied such strong criticisms of the health care proposal ― or as clear a threat to oppose it ― as Heller has.Heller’s actions may increase pressure on other Republicans senators from states that used money from the Affordable Care Act to adopt the Medicaid expansion, including Rob Portman of Ohio, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Twenty GOP senators from 14 states represent nearly 17 million Medicaid expansion enrollees.“This bill would mean a loss of coverage for millions of Americans and many Nevadans,” Heller said. “I’m telling you right now, I cannot support a piece of legislation that takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans.”The New York Times and Politico report that pro-Donald Trump group America First Policies is already preparing to take out ads against Heller, who is up for re-election in 2018.The Affordable Care Act provides generous funding to states that opened up their Medicaid programs to poor adults earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $16,040 for a single person. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia accepted that funding to expand their Medicaid population. More than 10 million people have gained coverage because of this aspect of the law, which is the primary reason that the national uninsured rate has reached a historic low.The Republican health care bills would reverse that. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the House-passed version of the bill would result in 23 million fewer Americans having health coverage over the coming decade. The CBO’s analysis of the Senate bill won’t be available until early next week, but the findings likely will be similar because both measures reduce federal spending on health care programs by nearly $1 trillion, chiefly through massive cutbacks to Medicaid that go beyond repealing the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of the program.Heller informed Senate Republican leaders and Vice President Mike Pence of his objections to the Senate bill before the press conference. He articulated other problems with the legislation, in addition to criticizing the rollback of the Medicaid expansion and the further cuts to that program ― which is jointly managed and financed by the federal government and the states. “There isn’t anything in this piece of legislation that lowers premiums,” Heller said, describing any claim to the contrary as a “lie.” Heller also said he believes the legislation doesn’t take care of people with pre-existing conditions and criticized provisions that would allow states to unravel Affordable Care Act rules requiring insurance to cover a minimum set of health benefits.Sandoval was the first Republican governor to announce his support for the Medicaid expansion after the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could opt out of it. The Nevada governor also has been a public critic of the House and Senate Republican health care bills.“This current bill as written is something that needs to change,” Sandoval said.“We’re talking about people that make $16,000 a year, and is it really realistic for them to be able to afford that type of coverage?” he said. “These are folks that are worth fighting for.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said 14 GOP senators from 20 states represent nearly 17 million Medicaid expansion enrollees. It is actually 20 GOP senators from 14 states. Politics hurt too much?

51,POLITICS,Beware Of The Environmental Trump Trap,"Les Leopold, ContributorExecutive Director, The Labor Institute",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beware-of-the-environmental-trump-trap_us_594be83be4b092ed90588c53,"Environmental activists and unionized workers should be allies against Trumpism, but they're being pitted against one another.",2017-06-23,"Union workers picket outside of the Marathon Petroleum Corp. Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, Texas, U.S., on Monday, Feb. 2, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594d1690170000200010271a.jpeg?ops=crop_0_84_4000_2468%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As Trump slashes and burns his way through environmental regulations, including the Paris Accord, he continues to bet that political polarization will work in his favor. Not only are his anti-scientific, anti-environmentalist positions firing up some within his base, but those positions are driving a deep wedge within organized labor. And unbeknownst to many environmental activists, they are being counted on to help drive that wedge even deeper.Trump already has in his pocket most of the construction trades union leaders whose members are likely to benefit from infrastructure projects – whether fossil fuel pipelines or new airports or... paving over the Atlantic. His ballyhooed support of coal extraction has considerable support from miners and many utility workers as well.But the real coup will come if Trump can tear apart alliances between the more progressive unions and the environmental community. Trump hopes to neutralize the larger Democratic-leaning unions, including those representing oil refinery workers and other industrial workers. That includes the United Steelworkers, a union that has supported environmental policies like the federal Clean Air Act and California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, and has a long history of fighting against the oil industry – not just over wages and benefits but also over health, safety and the environment.To get from here to there, Trump is hoping that environmental activists will play their part ― that they will become so frustrated by his Neanderthal policies, that activists will stage more and more protests at fossil fuel-related facilities, demanding that they be shut down in order to halt global climate crisis.Oil refineries present a target-rich arena for protest. On the West Coast they are near progressive enclaves and big media markets in California and Washington. Yet many who live in fence line communities would like the refineries gone, fearing for their own health and safety. Most importantly, they are gigantic symbols of the oil plutocracy that has profiteered at the expense of people all over the world.But from Trump’s point of view, nothing could be finer than for thousands of environmentalists to clash at the plant gates with highly paid refinery workers. Such demonstrations, even if peaceful and respectful, set a dangerous trap for environmental progress. Here’s why:1. Demonstrations at oil refineries will drive those workers into the arms of their employers and towards Trump.For the past 40 years unionized oil workers have struggled against the oil industry to protect their health, safety and job security. The work is dangerous: At least 58 people have died at refineries since March 23, 2005, reports the Texas Tribune in partnership with the Houston Chronicle . In 2015, more than 5,200 unionized refinery workers went on strike, a rare event in an era of dwindling union power.But when jobs are directly threatened by calls for shutdowns, we should expect both the employers and employees to circle the wagons.2. It’s not clear that shutting down U.S. oil refineries will reduce overall carbon emissions.There are 253 million cars and trucks on the road in America today and the average vehicle age is 11.4 years, reports the LA Times. While the number of plug-in electric cars are increasing, the total number is only about 570,000 as of 2016. By 2030, some projections show that half of all cars will be electric. The other half will still need refined oil. In addition, for the foreseeable future, refined oil products will be needed for a wide variety of chemical processes not related to gasoline. Therefore, it is not credible to argue that demand for refined oil products will vanish if refineries in the U.S. are shutdown.The fuel for those gasoline driven cars and production processes will have to come from somewhere. The question is from where? A related question is this: what will be the total carbon footprint of refined oil if it comes from far away – e.g. India or South Korea ― and if the refining processes in those areas are less clean than in the U.S.?Such questions require careful research, since different kinds of oil from different places around the world give off different amounts of greenhouse gases during refining; and since long-distance transport by ship, rail or truck emit additional and significant carbon pollution.Furthermore, in large part because of the struggles waged by U.S. refinery workers, the health, safety and environmental controls at U.S refineries are among the highest in the world. The same could not be said about refineries in India or South Korea, for example.3. Attacking the livelihoods of oil refinery workers weakens the alliances needed for reduction of greenhouse gases and the transition to a clean energy economy.But aren’t there plenty of labor organizations that already support strong action on climate change? If so, why should we care about these highly paid fossil fuel workers?The answer relates to how we amass sufficient political power to curb greenhouse gasses. Nearly all of the labor groups that currently support strong action on climate change don’t have jobs at risk. They are health care workers, service workers and others who would not see their livelihoods threatened by job loss due the reduction of fossil fuel emissions.But if oil workers are in alliance with the environmental community, an important political message can be sent. It could show that the workers most impacted by the transition also want a cleaner and more stable environment for themselves, their families and their communities. Such an alliance would bring more resources, organizational muscle and troops to the environmental struggle and it would have the potential to put a dent in the power of the oil executives to rally their employees against environmental protections.4. Talking about Just Transition and the New Green Economy is not good enough. But isn’t this job fear foolish? Doesn’t the new green economy now dwarf the old fossil fuel industries?Yes, it’s true that solar and wind are rapidly growing. But it’s very, very hard to make the case to an existing fossil fuel or manufacturing worker that he or she is going to get these new jobs, or that pay and benefits will be anything close to comparable.In the U.S. there is no just transition program that guarantees the incomes of those who lose their jobs due to needed environmental protections. Given four decades of attacks on organized labor, very few of the new green jobs are unionized or pay anything close to the fossil fuel/high energy jobs.Creating a just transition program is an important and noble aspiration. But if such a program is to be actually “just,” it will require enormous changes in how our economy functions: i.e. how people get the new jobs and how incomes and benefits follow people during the transition. And it will require an enormously powerful political movement both to halt the climate crisis and protect worker rights.The late Tony Mazzocchi, a leader of unionized oil workers and other industrial workers in the U.S., invented the concept of just transition. He understood there would be an enormous clash between the needs of the planet and the needs of working people to maintain their hard fought wages and benefits. He predicted decades ago that right wing demagogues would emerge to seize on these fears unless a real transition program came into being.The key concept of just transition as he envisioned it is “making workers whole.” This means that dislocated workers in environmentally sensitive industries would receive full pay and benefits as they transitioned to other jobs. Mazzocchi argued that, at the very least, these dislocated workers should receive four years full pay and benefits, plus free tuition to college or a trade school of their choice, modeled after the GI Bill of Rights following WWII.As Brian Kohler from the Geneva-based IndustriALL Global Union writes:If society wants certain workers to support giving up what they are doing today, then they have a right to choose what they will be doing tomorrow. And it had better sound good to them, or the resistance to change will be insurmountable.If that’s what environmentalists mean by just transition, then there is an opening for a productive dialogue. But that opening will only exist if environmentalists first do the math on how we meet continuing demand for gas to fuel our real driving needs, and on whether domestic, highly-regulated production of oil produces less carbon than alternative sources out of state or overseas.How do we win the struggle to contain the Climate Crisis? It’s hard to make the case that we’re winning much of anything right now. Congress and the White House are now ruled by anti-labor, climate change deniers. We have an environmental lunatic as president. Perhaps it’s time to review our organizing strategies.Because both labor rights and environmental progress are in grave danger, we should explore whether an alliance between oil workers and environmentalists is possible and productive.One way to proceed is bring fossil fuel workers together with environmentalists in educational workshops ― a safe space where together, they can explore these complex issues and opportunities. The United Steelworkers, the Communications Workers of America and the Sierra Club are doing just that in California. In fact, 24 of them are about to be trained to pair up as workshop leaders to run programs together for their respective organizations.To see teams of unionized workers and environmental activists run workshops on jobs, the economy and climate change might send a powerful message that a new movement can be built. And maybe, just maybe, they can help us all avoid the destructive Trump trap.(This train-the-trainer project is supported by the Labor Institute’s RunawayInequality.org Educational Network which is collaborating with progressive advocates and partners to spread information around the country on how Wall Street and its CEO allies are strip-mining our economy, and what we can do about it. For a report on the pilot labor-environment workshop held in March 2017, see here.)[This article originally appeared in Alternet.org]Les Leopold, the director of the Labor Institute, is currently working with unions and community organizations to build the educational infrastructure of a new “reversing runaway inequality” movement.

52,POLITICS,Protester: Mitch McConnell Thinks Disabled Americans Are 'Better Off Dead',Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mcconnell-health-care-bill-protest-disabled-arrested_us_594c1d09e4b05c37bb75385d,Police arrested 43 people with disabilities at McConnell's office yesterday. Here are some of their stories.,2017-06-23,Protester Stephanie Woodward took this photo of a banner protesters hung in the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594d61e515000020008ffe4b.jpeg?ops=crop_0_346_1459_1113%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The blood on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s hands may be metaphorical, but the blood spilled on the marble floor outside his office on Thursday morning was very, very real.The small, bright red spots, mopped up soon after they were spilled, belonged to Bruce Darling, an organizer at the national disability rights organization ADAPT.Yesterday, U.S. Capitol Police arrested Darling and 42 other people from ADAPT who staged a “die-in” at McConnell’s office to raise awareness of the health care bill a small group of Republicans drafted in secret.Among other things, the bill would drastically cut Medicaid funding, a fundamental program essential to many of the protesters’ lives.Darling told HuffPost he wasn’t seriously injured. He didn’t even realize he was bleeding until after he’d been handcuffed in the police wagon and “noticed a splotch of blood on the wall.”“I want [Mitch McConnell] to understand that when the freedom and liberty of Americans is under attack, they fight back,” Darling said. “It’s appalling that the very government put in place to protect our liberty and freedom is attacking it today.”“To steal liberty and life, simply because they want to give a tax cut to the wealthy is abhorrent to me,” he added. “The framers of the Constitution would be appalled by their behavior.”Many of the protesters removed themselves from their wheelchairs and lay down on the floor. Capitol Police said this justified the arrests and charges of crowding, obstructing or incommoding.It also led to countless unforgettable images of officers arresting protesters, at times dragging them out of wheelchairs.Stephanie Woodward, who can be seen getting hoisted out of her chair in the video above and who is photographed below wearing restraints, was one of the people arrested.“I was born with spina bifida,” Woodward told HuffPost. “In 1988, when I was born, [it] wasn’t so easy for my mom, who is a hairdresser, and my dad, who is an electrician, to get health care and pay for multiple surgeries, wheelchairs, all that stuff.”The 29-year-old resident of Rochester, New York, has gone on to graduate from law school and now has her own private insurance. But “without Medicaid,” she says, “I would not be here.”Asked what she would tell McConnell if she had the chance, she said she’d remind him of America’s founding creed.“Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is not just for non-disabled Americans, it’s for all Americans,” she said. “By cutting Medicaid, he’s basically telling us he thinks disabled Americans are better off dead than being a part of American life.”One of the more striking images to emerge from Thursday’s protest features Laura Halvorson, a 33-year-old native of Dallas who has muscular dystrophy, wheeling out of the hall under the direction of a police officer. “When an officer asked me to come with her, in my heart I wanted to resist completely and refuse to move my chair,” she said, “but since I use a breathing machine that was attached to the back of my wheelchair, it could have been deadly if the machine were unhooked for too long. So, I complied with the officers.”She said that Capitol Police processed protesters in a building that didn’t have an ADA-accessible women’s bathroom, adding insult to injury.Halvorson requires help for activities like bathing and cooking meals, so she’s hoping to be approved for a personal care attendant via a Medicaid Waiver program, which would cost half as much as care in an institutionalized setting and offer a higher quality of life.“Medicaid Waivers are optional services for states to provide, and would likely be the first thing to go, due to the AHCA’s drastic cuts to Medicaid,” Halvorson said. “For me, spending the rest of my days in a nursing home is not an option, due to their high rates of abuse and neglect.” Susan Stahl, a 52-year-old from Rochester, New York, was also among those arrested.“I have cerebral palsy, and I have a back injury,” she told HuffPost, explaining how essential Medicaid is to everything in her life. An aide helps her with daily tasks like showering, cooking and using the toilet. As a result, she’s able to have a job, own a house and live life.Stahl relies on a power wheelchair and crutches, both of which are at risk as the Republican bill seeks to cut Medicaid funds for durable medical equipment.She said she wasn’t surprised politicians called to have her arrested. “It’s an ‘inconvenience’ to them,” she said, “but to me, it’s my life.”“Like every other American, I want to be out in the community. I don’t want to be locked away behind closed doors,” she said. “This is my freedom, this is my liberty.”“Without Medicaid, none of those things would happen. I would be stuck in a nursing home.”For more information on the Senate’s health care bill and its effect on the social safety net, click here."
53,ARTS & CULTURE,Theater Community Receives Death Threats Following 'Julius Caesar' Controversy,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/julius-caesar-death-threats_us_594bbba4e4b0a3a837bd5b87,"Public Theater director's wife, as well as other Shakespeare companies around the country, have been targeted.",2017-06-22,"Priscilla Frank - Arts and Culture Reporter, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bfef7703c000041040ebe03.jpg?ops=100_100,"The Public Theater’s production of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” featuring a Donald Trump-like lead has closed, but the controversy circling the play remains. According to The Associated Press, police are currently investigating threats made to the wife of the play’s artistic director, Oskar Eustis. Eustis’ wife filed a complaint on June 9 about threatening phone messages she received. One caller, the AP reports, said he or she “wanted her to die after saying her husband wants the Republican president to die.”The production, which ran last week as part of the annual free Shakespeare in the Park festival held in Central Park, incensed critics with a Julius Caesar character bearing strong physical similarities to Trump. As a result, some alleged that the play’s iconic scene ― during which Caesar is assassinated ― sanctioned or even encouraged violence against the president of the United States. However, anyone who has actually seen or read the 400-year-old play ― or listened to director Eustis speak on the matter ― knows that it unequivocally denounces political violence of all kinds. Shakespeare’s message strongly warns that democracy can only be upheld through democratic means, casting Caesar’s stabbing as an illegitimate act of misguided patriotism. As Eustis summarized to The New York Times: “This production is horrified at his murder.”Nonetheless, anger surrounding the play has escalated over the past weeks, climaxing when rightwing protesters interrupted a performance last Friday, one storming the stage and another standing up amid the crowd to scream “You are Nazis.”Sadly, Eustis’ wife is not the only individual to be threatened as a result of the theatrical dispute. Other Shakespeare theater companies around the nation, completely unattached to The Public’s production, have been mistakenly targeted. Stephen Burdman, artistic director at New York Classical Theatre, described some of the “hateful emails” the company received. “Every arts organization gets critical correspondence,” he told HuffPost. “But normally, they are very well crafted and certainly not vitriolic or threatening. These were outrageously threatening, lots of ‘you should die’ and lots of expletives. Once they started threatening families I didn’t even want to share them with my wife.” Burdman is not alone in receiving disturbing messages intended for The Public. Last week the Washington Post reached out to Massachusetts’ Shakespeare & Company, which, perhaps due to its domain name Shakespeare.org, was also the target of threats. One read: “F— you, hope you all who did this play about Trump are the first do die when ISIS COMES TO YOU f—– sumbags [sic].”Artists around the world have expressed their support for the play, stressing the importance of free expression and political theater. The Public released a statement last week, declaring it stands by its production:We recognize that our interpretation of the play has provoked heated discussion; audiences, sponsors and supporters have expressed varying viewpoints and opinions. Such discussion is exactly the goal of our civically-engaged theater; this discourse is the basis of a healthy democracy.There is something painfully ironic about unleashing violent threats to protest what is perceived by some as an endorsement for violence. Hopefully now that the production has finished its run, the vicious and often misplaced attacks on members of the theater community and their family will come to an end. "
54,POLITICS,Barely Anyone Thinks The U.S. Is Making Progress In Stopping Gun Violence,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barely-anyone-thinks-the-us-is-making-progress-in-stopping-gun-violence_us_594c41d5e4b05c37bb755e4e,"As new polling shows, the nation remains deeply divided on gun issues.",2017-06-22,"Police put up tape to clear journalists from the outfield area of a baseball field where shots were fired during a congressional baseball practice, wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), in Alexandria, Virginia, on June 14.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594c44fa2900001f003b0bda.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"America’s most recent bout with high-profile gun violence has done little to shake people’s attitudes about guns, which remain both complex and deeply polarized, according to two newly released surveys.Just 12 percent of the public thinks American society has gotten better at preventing gun violence since the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds. Twenty-eight percent believe it’s gotten worse, and half that it hasn’t changed at all.The poll, taken in the wake of last week’s shooting at a congressional GOP baseball practice, finds that while half of the public believes that mass shootings can be stopped, another 28 percent think such events have become a fact of life in America. The remaining 22 percent aren’t sure. Overall, 40 percent say stricter gun control laws would reduce the number of shootings in the United States, while 14 percent think they would increase shootings, and a third that they wouldn’t make much difference. There’s a close divide on whether stricter gun control laws and enforcement would do more to prevent shootings than would allowing more private citizens to carry guns for protection, with 42 percent favoring the former and 39 percent the latter.Despite the backdrop of a high-profile shooting, all those numbers remain little-changed from a December 2016 HuffPost/YouGov survey. In one notable shift, however, Americans have grown less likely to believe there’s a political appetite for stricter gun laws. Last December, respondents said by a 9-point margin, 43 percent to 34 percent, that it was politically possible to pass stricter gun laws. In the latest survey, they said by an equal 9-point margin, 41 percent to 32 percent, that such changes are likely impossible.Views also remain sharply divided along partisan lines. Democrats are 43 points likelier than Republicans to believe stricter gun laws would reduce the number of shootings in the United States, the survey finds, and 52 points likelier to favor such restrictions over allowing more private citizens to carry guns.A new, wide-ranging Pew Research report, also released Thursday, sheds some light on the attitudes underlying Americans’ opinions about firearms. The survey, taken before the most recent shooting ― it was conducted in March and April ― finds that guns remain, for better or worse, deeply ingrained in American life.“Whether for hunting, sport shooting or personal protection, most gun owners count the right to bear arms as central to their freedom,” the report’s authors note. “At the same time, the results of gun-related violence have shaken the nation, and debates over gun policy remain sharply polarized.” Two-thirds of Americans have lived with a gun in their household at some point during their lives, and more than 70 percent have shot one. Nearly three-quarters of gun owners say they can’t see themselves ever giving up gun ownership, and that they consider the right to own guns essential to their own sense of freedom. But a sizable share of the public has also had harmful experiences with firearms. Forty-four percent say they know someone who has been shot, whether accidentally or on purpose, and nearly a quarter say they or someone in their family have been threatened or intimidated by a gun.Black Americans are especially likely to have had troubling experiences: A third say they or a family member have been threatened or intimidated by a gun, and nearly 60 percent that they know someone who was shot.Gun owners and non-owners, the report finds, take diverging views on the extent to which gun violence is even an issue. Nearly 60 percent of people who don’t own guns, but just a third of those who do, consider it a major problem in the country.Beneath the broad ideological differences on guns, there’s significant agreement on a number of specific gun policies. According to Pew, a majority of both gun owners and non-gun-owners support rules preventing the mentally ill from purchasing guns; implementing backgrounds checks for private gun sales and at gun shows; barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists; and creating a federal database to track gun sales.Even among gun owners, opinions are deeply split between Republicans and Democrats. Views on guns weren’t always intractably partisan ― as recently as 2007, Republicans and independents who leaned toward the GOP were evenly split between prioritizing gun rights and gun control, according to previous Pew polls. But starting after former President Barack Obama took office, GOP views swung dramatically toward favoring more unfettered gun rights.Democratic gun-owners are currently more than twice as likely as Republican gun owners to consider gun violence a very big problem in the U.S., according to Pew, and nearly twice as likely to say that access to legal guns contribute to gun violence.

They gathered near a stairwell in the Russell Senate Office Building to run through their talking points. Two of them would share their personal stories of coming to the U.S. Another two would ask the senator, through the staffer they were meeting, to support admitting at least 75,000 refugees next year and to help fund aid for them in the U.S. and abroad. They waited calmly at his office as visitors came and went. After a few minutes, a legislative assistant ushered them into the marble-floored hallway outside, explaining that a meeting room was occupied. They talked for about 25 minutes just outside the office door. The staffer didn’t take notes. Despite it all, they ended up pleased with how the meeting went. Later, in a huddle farther down the hall, they remarked on how the aide seemed knowledgeable about refugee issues and compassionate and interested in what they had to say. One of the refugee agency staffers who accompanied them ran through a questionnaire. How would they rank the Cruz staff member’s reactions? A four out of five, most said. Did she seem receptive to their issues? Yes.Should they cultivate a relationship with the office? Yes. The former refugees had come to Washington for the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service Leadership Academy, where they had spent the last few days training and strategizing on how to help new arrivals and convince politicians that it was right and humane to do the same. It was the fifth year of the program, with 48 former refugees from 17 states participating. This year is different from the last four. Now they are operating in the age of Donald Trump, who wants to cut the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S. and bar them from entry for at least four months. The Texas advocates are facing an anti-refugee wave at the state level that Trump tapped into nationally. Texas took in the second-highest number of refugees of any state in fiscal year 2016, but its Republican leadership has echoed the president’s approach, last year taking the extreme move of dropping out of the resettlement program, making it the largest state to do so. Gov. Greg Abbott has also tried to bar Syrian refugees from the state entirely. And while Republican officials in Texas can’t legally keep refugees out, they’ve done their best to say they are unwelcome. “Our state is not friendly toward refugees and immigrants,” said Justin Nsenga, a former refugee from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and now executive director of Partners for Refugee Empowerment. “[But] we are not a burden to the state of Texas. We are not a liability. We are a contributing community, a contributing population. One voice will not make any difference in Austin unless we are together.” Despite the open hostility that is exhibited by their state ― or perhaps because of it ― refugee advocates feel an intense urgency to change minds. That includes Cruz, who supported measures to bar certain groups of refugees and backed Trump’s travel ban, which is now blocked in the courts. The former refugees knew that having a positive reception from congressional staffers wouldn’t change much, if anything. But they felt that if they met the staff in person, they could work to maintain and grow relationships within the state. After visiting Cruz’s Washington office, Nsenga suggested that they reach out to Cruz’s offices in Texas as soon as possible to request meetings, since they take some time to schedule. They hoped for the same thing at their meeting with a staffer for Sen. John Cornyn, another Texas Republican, set for an hour later. First they walked to the Capitol, where Cornyn has an office, with a quick stop for pictures, and then in line for security ― where a police officer jokingly asked them if, as Texans, they were armed ― and then back to the Senate office buildings, where the meeting had been moved to.At the Cornyn meeting, they were seated in a room and, this time, the staff member took notes. The former refugees didn’t want to get too political, so they didn’t bring up Trump or his executive orders. They also felt they didn’t need to: It was clear they disagreed with the orders when they asked that the U.S. admit more refugees than he wanted.This time they decided to also ask what they could do to win the senator over. They said the Cornyn staffer told them that his office gets a lot of calls expressing concerns about refugee resettlement and hardly any from people who support refugees.“She said, ‘You can help by educating fellow Texans about refugees,’” Emmanuel Sebagabo, a former refugee from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said afterward.It was a tangible bit of information that the former refugees felt could serve them well. They believe many Texans actually do support refugee resettlement, particularly now that it’s under threat. After Trump’s executive order, the number of people who wanted to volunteer to help refugees shot up so much that some groups stopped accepting new volunteers. They had too many to train, plus, the number of refugees coming into Texas had dropped even as relevant portions of the orders were blocked by the courts. About 1,100 refugees resettled in Texas from February to the end of May, down from about 3,000 from last October to the end of January, when Trump took office.“There’s kind of a gap between state leaders and the community itself,” said Basel Mousslly, a former refugee from Syria who now works in Houston as a resettlement supervisor at Refugee Services of Texas.Churches, community groups, Islamic associations and schools have also offered their help to refugees in the wake of the orders. So the former refugees knew they had support in Texas and the country at large. There are people who have shown up at rallies and offered to help newly arrived refugees settle in.But politicians, these groups discovered, don’t necessarily register that. They don’t base their policy positions on whether constituents set up apartments for people resettling in their states, and they haven’t been universally moved by protests against Trump’s executive orders. Politicians care about getting elected and reelected; they care about doing what their constituents call on them (literally and figuratively) to do.It’s a basic principle of advocacy, but it can get lost when activists are focused on more immediate matters, like getting people resettled in a new country. Now up against Trump, Abbott, Cruz, Cornyn and other Republicans, the refugee advocates got a reminder that they can’t forget about the politics. They need to convince more fellow Texans that refugee resettlement is a good thing, but that requires combating messages from politicians who spread fear that refugees can be dangerous. They need to convince those who support refugees to not just offer places to stay, warm meals and social services. They need them to call politicians’ offices and show up at town halls.The former refugees know that making Trump, Cruz or Abbott suddenly support broader refugee resettlement would be a Herculean task, but perhaps they can persuade them to calm down their rhetoric. On Tuesday, they got a chance. Two members of the Trump administration showed up at an event for the academy, even though the president has discussed refugee resettlement almost solely as a potential avenue for terrorists to enter the country and twice attempted to temporarily halt it entirely. The speakers, from the State Department and the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Services, referenced the need to keep communities safe. But they also spoke about refugees as an asset to the U.S. ― the message advocates at the academy hoped to get across.“It’s really good to be here,” Scott Lloyd, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, who was appointed under Trump, told the LIRS academy participants during a breakfast briefing that morning. “I thank you. It’s a chance for me to meet the people who really, really give our program a heart and soul and a human face.” "

ICBMs have a minimum range of about 3,400 miles (5,500 km), but some are designed to travel 6,200 miles (10,000 km) or farther.Trump’s defense secretary, Jim Mattis, said last month that any military solution to the North Korea crisis would be “tragic on an unbelievable scale.”The United States, meanwhile, is ramping up capabilities to defend against the threat from North Korea, staging its first-ever successful test to intercept an incoming ICBM-type missile in May.But a test on June 21 of a new capability being developed by the United States and Japan to defend against shorter-range missiles failed to hit its target, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said on Thursday.It was the second such test of the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor, which is being developed by Raytheon.

Just before adjourning for the summer, the New York state legislature passed a bill late Wednesday that carves out $5 million of the state’s $420 million film tax credit program for diversity hires in writer and director roles.The bill aims to “enhance the diversity of stories and casts” by targeting creators. The plan found broad support among writers, including Tina Fey, the Writers Guild of America and the Directors Guild of America. (HuffPost is unionized under the auspices of the WGA-East.)Focusing on TV shows, generally produced more quickly and in greater number than film projects, maximizes the measure’s impact. And considering so many projects are filmed in New York (City, particularly) that there’s been a sound stage shortage, it seems viewers may start noticing a broader array of stories pretty soon.The bill must still be signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo to take effect.Sponsored by state Sen. Marisol Alcantara and Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, the measure is nearly identical to a bill currently pending in California, Deadline notes. A number of states have introduced tax credit programs to lure jobs and potential tourism dollars, but none include diversity provisions aimed at changing the finished products.Since it will be a first of its kind, the bill’s actual effectiveness remains to be seen. But research supports the idea that behind-the-scenes diversity influences what we see on screen.“As an Afro-Latina immigrant, I knew what it felt like to grow up feeling invisible in American culture,” Alcantara told HuffPost in May. “It was so rare to see a character of color on television, and when you did see one, it felt like they were tokenized, stereotyped or killed off quickly. I think the overall quality of television, the different kinds of stories that can be told, the overall landscape of the art form will benefit greatly from having opportunities for diverse people to tell their stories, which I believe this legislation will provide.”Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."

Kushner has not been identified as a target of the FBI investigation into Russia’s involvement in the 2016 presidential election, but Senate investigators are reportedly negotiating a time to interview him. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) said Kushner’s security clearance should “absolutely” be suspended until the Russia probe is concluded. In their letter this week, the Democrats also requested that the White House release documents related to the security clearance of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned in February for discussing U.S. sanctions against Russia with Kislyak. The letter questioned why Flynn also retained his security clearance even after he was accused of lying about his discussions with the Russian ambassador. “General Flynn was allowed to stay in his position for 18 days after the [then] Acting Attorney General [Sally Yates] warned the White House about General Flynn’s action, but neither the President nor any other White House official has explained why he was allowed to continue holding a security clearance during that period,” the letter states. The White House has yet to comment on the requests. House Democrats cannot force Trump’s administration to revoke Kushner’s security clearance, ABC News notes.As for whether the White House will even respond to the letter, NPR painted a bleak picture on Wednesday. The Trump administration has ignored 260 letters from House Democrats to date, the outlet reported, and has been leaning on a recent Justice Department opinion which states that only committee chairs have the authority to ask federal agencies for information on what they’re doing. This excludes most of Congress, including many Republicans and all Democrats, NPR said. Republican Senator Charles Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, skewered the opinion in a letter to President Trump sent earlier this month. “Oversight brings transparency, and transparency brings accountability,” said Grassley. “And, the opposite is true. Shutting down oversight requests doesn’t drain the swamp, Mr. President. It floods the swamp.” "

Those statements merely expressed surprise at being arrested.”A rookie Capitol Hill Police officer arrested Fairooz, a protester affiliated with the group Code Pink, after she laughed when Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said Sessions had a “clear and well-documented” record of “treating all Americans equally under the law.” (The Senate rejected Sessions’ nomination as a federal judge in the 1980s due to concerns about his record on race.)Justice Department attorneys trying the case insisted that “laughter is enough” to warrant a charge against Fairooz, but jurors who spoke with HuffPost after the verdict said they were focused on Fairooz’s conduct after she was taken into custody.The jury convicted Fairooz on two counts: one for engaging in “disorderly or disruptive conduct” with the intent to disrupt congressional proceedings and another for parading, demonstrating or picketing on the grounds of the Capitol. Neither charge should stand, her lawyer said.“The evidence presented by the government during the trial simply does not support a conviction of Ms. Fairooz to either disorderly or disruptive behavior on Capitol grounds or demonstrating, parading, or picketing in the Capitol,” he wrote. “She asks the court to vacate the jury’s guilty verdicts against her and acquit her on both counts in the information.”Bogash, the attorney, said “there is no evidence” Shelby even heard the laughter, and that it didn’t interrupt the hearing.“Yet on the basis of that burst of three or four laughs USPC Officer Coronado immediately made the decision to initiate the arrest of Ms. Fairooz,” he wrote. “Even if the brief noise was heard by those seated in close proximity to her, there is no evidence that it disturbed them. And even if it did, that is not an arrestable, let alone a chargeable, offense. Briefly bothering someone seated next to you is not interfering with, or disrupting, a session of Congress.”Bogash continued:Ms. Fairooz was not informed why she was being ejected from the hearing room. She appeared confused. She was surrounded by up to four U.S. Capitol Police Officers who start to use forced to remove her from the hearing room, never telling her why they were doing so. At this point Ms. Fairooz questioned the reason for her ejection, asking what is was that she did. It was Ms. Fairooz’s questioning the reasons for the U.S. Capitol Police treatment of her which caused Senator Collins to pause in the delivery of the statement.Fairooz was supposed to be sentenced this week, but the hearing was pushed to July. In an interview with Jezebel after her conviction, Fairooz said the judge “kind of intimated” that their lawyers should file motions to have the judgement vacated."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594c24961700002000102598.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At this point, we’re not surprised when Goop’s health and wellness claims turn out to be shady. But this latest case is out-of-this-world strange. Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle site pulled a claim about “energy-balancing” body stickers after Gizmodo spoke with a NASA expert who pointed out the claim was untrue. Goop initially promoted the pricey Body Vibes stickers ($60 for a 10-pack) by claiming they “rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies” and even treat certain ailments thanks in part to being made with the “same conductive carbon material NASA uses to line space suits so they can monitor an astronaut’s vitals during wear.”But Gizmodo’s Rae Paoletta published a piece Thursday in which a NASA expert pointed out the agency’s spacesuits don’t contain conductive carbon material at all, not to mention he found the supposed science behind the product to be “a load of BS.” Goop subsequently pulled the spacesuit claim, though not the piece promoting the stickers. By Friday, Body Vibes had removed claims of NASA technology from its website too and issued an apology statement. Goop is no stranger to sticky health claims: This year alone, the brand caught fire for plugging needless products like leaf-scented perfume and pricey “anti-mold” shower heads. Then there’s the potentially dangerous health advice, like its suggestions to use vaginal eggs and consider iodine supplements, which can actually harm some healthy people. Through it all, Paltrow stands by her brand. She recently announced she’s taking a break from acting to focus on being a female business leader, a role “that people are not comfortable with,” she said this week at the Cannes Lions Festival. She also joked to Jimmy Kimmel about her site’s wacky recommendations earlier this month, saying, “I don’t know what the fuck we talk about!” After this latest go-round, we definitely don’t either. Meanwhile, Goop is continuing to refine its content, according to a statement sent Thursday to HuffPost: As we have always explained, advice and recommendations included on Goop are not formal endorsements and the opinions expressed by the experts and companies we profile do not necessarily represent the views of Goop. Our content is meant to highlight unique products and offerings, find open-minded alternatives, and encourage conversation. We constantly strive to improve our site for our readers, and are continuing to improve our processes for evaluating the products and companies featured.

It can happen to anyone, which is why it is so important to be in a cool location, drink plenty of water and take a cool bath or shower if you are getting too hot,” Jorden said.The extreme heat, brought on by a high-pressure system parked over the Four Corners region where Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona meet, has boosted temperatures well above normal across much of the Southwest.The bodies of a 57-year-old father and his 21-year-old son from Corpus Christi, Texas, were found earlier this week in the Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico, where they were hiking, media reported.New Mexico State Police told an NBC affiliate in New Mexico that the scorching temperatures, which were over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius), contributed to the deaths of the men.The National Weather Service and local authorities issued heat advisories and warnings, urging residents to stay indoors and to drink plenty of water if they were outdoors. Power grid operators encouraged customers to use electricity sparingly to avoid a shutdown or blackout.The sizzling weather forced the cancellation of more than 20 flights at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and delays at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. Aviation experts say the hotter, thinner air saps power from airline engines.The heat can also create issues for ground crews, where pavement temperatures can reach more than 150 degrees F (66 C), a life-threatening condition if workers are exposed to it too long.Temperatures reached 127 F (52.8 C) in California’s Death Valley at the peak of the heat wave on Tuesday afternoon but cooler weather was expected across the region by the end of the week."

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tapes-comey_us_594c220ce4b02734df293b1b,"Trump conceded he knows of no tapes of his conversations with the then-FBI director, but  stirred up the controversy anyway to raise “the question of doubt.”",2017-06-22,President Donald Trump and Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov meet at the Oval Office on May 10. (Photo by Russia Foreign Minister Press Ofice /Anadolu Agency/Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594c23582900001f003b0b60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The White House on Thursday appeared to concede that President Donald Trump issued a baseless statement about “tapes” of a conversation with his just-fired FBI Director James Comey in order to impugn his credibility.“I think it was more about raising the question of doubt in general,” said deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders, responding to a question about why Trump had sent out a tweet positing the existence of such tapes before conceding Thursday that he was unaware of any recordings.Sanders did not respond to a HuffPost query asking for a clarification of her answer.The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee questioned whether Trump was trying to stop Comey from talking.“If the president’s statement is accurate, it of course raises as many questions as it answers, the most significant being: If the president had no tapes, why did he suggest otherwise?” said California Rep. Adam Schiff. “Did he seek to mislead the public? Was he trying to intimidate or silence James Comey? And if so, did he take other steps to discourage potential witnesses from speaking out?”Sanders’ extraordinary admission came at the very end of a 20-minute off-camera press briefing that began shortly after Trump sent off a pair of tweets that ended 41 days of drama that he himself had created.“With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea … whether there are ‘tapes’ or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings,” Trump wrote Thursday afternoon.On May 12, three days after Trump fired Comey, Trump tweeted: “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!”Based on that tweet, Schiff’s committee demanded that Trump turn over any such tapes and set a Friday deadline.Comey had been leading the FBI investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election with the goal of helping Trump win, and whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russian officials. Trump had asked Comey to drop a related probe into Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his contact with Russians. Comey did not end that investigation, and Trump subsequently fired him.Trump’s press office initially claimed Trump was merely following the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his top deputy to dismiss Comey. But Trump on May 11 told NBC News that he was going to fire Comey regardless of the Justice Department’s recommendation, and added that the Russia investigation played into his thinking. Trump also told Russia’s foreign minister and its U.S. ambassador during their May 10 Oval Office visit that Comey’s probe was putting “great pressure” on him, and that Comey was a “nut job,” according to a New York Times report that the White House has not rebutted.Nearly six months after U.S. intelligence agencies released a report agreeing that Russia had meddled in the presidential election to help candidate Trump win, President Trump continues to call that conclusion a hoax.In a series of four tweets Thursday morning, Trump wrote:“Former Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump & Russia. By the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn’t they stop them? ...Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election). It’s all a big Dem HOAX! ...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn’t? It’s all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!” That view, though, goes against the consensus view of 16 U.S. intelligence agencies. In a report issued on Jan. 6, The Office of National Intelligence wrote:“We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.”One former CIA analyst said Trump’s continued disparagement of the intelligence community showed his priorities.“This is a commander-in-chief who prizes his own ego over the welfare of our country. He said nothing today that he hasn’t said in the past — from the multiple times he’s rejected the intelligence community’s analysis to calling them leakers and even Nazis,” said Ned Price, who was the National Security Council’s spokesman under former President Barack Obama. “The damage between the intelligence community and this president is irreparable. I have no doubt the intelligence community will remain focused on its core missions, even as the president chooses not to take his seriously.”Sanders, during Thursday’s press briefing, pointed out that Trump did concede early in the year “that it probably was Russia” behind the theft of Democratic emails released through WikiLeaks to hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Schiff responded to Trump’s Thursday morning tweets with one of his own: “A better question, Mr. President, is why did you encourage them? ‘Hey Russians, if you’re listening, hack Hillary’s emails.’ Sound familiar?”On July 27, 2016, Trump, during a news conference, invited Russia to hack into computer systems to find the emails Clinton had deleted from her private server: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.” Trump later said he was joking.Ironically, Trump’s original “tapes” tweet may have caused more trouble for him. Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee this month that when he read Trump’s statements, he leaked detailed notes he had taken of his conversations with Trump with the hopes of getting a special counsel to take over the investigation.On May 17, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller to handle the Russia probe, which now includes as a component possible obstruction of justice for Trump’s firing of Comey.Sanders, though, said Trump had no regrets about his “tapes” tweet. “I don’t think so,” she said."

Last Friday morning I was driving down the interstate in Atlanta with my sunroof back, my windows cracked, and Kendrick Lamar’s “Humble” blasting on my radio. It was a beautiful day and I was in full “T.G.I.F.” mode. I was sitting in rush hour traffic (make that hours—I do live in Atlanta afterall), when I noticed a police officer had pulled over a car in the far right lane. So what did I do? Without hesitation, I rolled my passenger window down even more, lowered the volume on my radio, picked up my cell phone and placed my thumb near the record button. I mean, I was ready....ready to record whatever transpired. If something was about to go down, believe me, I was going to capture it! Police brutality? Nah. Not on my watch!A white male officer exited his vehicle and began to walk towards the car. My heart started beating faster as I approached the car that was pulled over. When I got beside the vehicle, I looked over and made eye contact with a young woman. She appeared to be calmly watching the police officer through her driver side mirror. I said to myself, “Aw, h-ll, she’ll be alright”, immediately put my phone down, turned up my music, and rolled up my window—not because the driver seemed unbothered, but because she was white. See, I figured a white female who was pulled over by the police may leave the scene with a warning or perhaps even a ticket, but definitely her life. Had she been black, I’m not so sure of the latter these days. When I think about it, I don’t know what saddens me more, the fact that I felt the need to videotape a routine traffic stop in 2017 or that I rolled up my window when I saw that the driver didn’t have skin like mine. Either way, these are the times in which we are living and anyone who doesn’t think that being Black in America still entails dealing with racial profiling and social injustice is sadly mistaken.So, what does it mean to be Black in America? Now, don’t get me wrong. Despite the many obstacles we are forced to surmount on a regular basis, I am proud to be a Black woman. There isn’t anything I would rather be. Think about it. Who in her right mind would give up all of this magic?! Seriously, people pay good money for this magic and it was bestowed upon me by God. *adjusts crown* Yeah, I think I’ll keep it. However, that doesn’t mean that I don’t get disheartened at times. It doesn’t mean that I don’t wish things were different for Black people in this country. It doesn’t mean that I don’t recognize how far we have come as a people, yet how far we still have to go. It doesn’t mean that I don’t find myself full of rage and despair while watching numerous criminals, yes criminals, be acquitted for murdering innocent black men and women over and over again. To me, being Black in America means shedding countless tears for strangers whose lives have been taken by the very people who are suppposed to protect them. It means worrying that it could happen to me or one of my loved ones one day. It means praying that my 3 older brothers make it back safely every time they leave their homes, even when they are just going down the street to the grocery store. “Be careful!” I hear myself saying to them at times. “Hurry back!” Being black in America means having difficult conversations with my younger cousins, nieces and nephews about police brutality and the society in which we live. I tell them, “Listen, if you’re ever pulled over, keep your hands on the steering wheel.” “Don’t argue with the police officer.” “Don’t make any sudden moves.” It’s mentally and emotionally exhausting at times.This brings me to the season premiere of “Queen Sugar”. Talk about art imitating life.*Spoiler alert*In case you missed it, on last night’s episode of “Queen Sugar,” Micah, Charley’s teenaged son, was pulled over for a D.W.B., “Driving While Black”. Meaning, he was driving an expensive vehicle while being, well, black. Period. The police officer drew his weapon and ordered Micah out of the car. He handcuffed him and took him to jail. To make matters worse, we never did hear the officer state why he pulled Micah over in the first place.The episode was very timely as the police officer who killed Philando Castile was just acquitted last week. When I heard the verdict, I wish I could say I was surprised but I wasn’t. It was a different story with the same ending we hear time after time, and my heart hurts for his loved ones. Therefore, to say that my emotions were raw while watching “Queen Sugar” is an understatement. And based on the social media posts I read, I wasn’t alone. The problem is, the scenario that unfolded on a fictional television show happens way too often in real life in the United States of America, “land of the free” (unless you have too much melanin, that is).So, for me, being Black in America means struggling to understand the how sometimes. How was Dylann Roof, the young white man who took the lives of 9 innocent parishioners in Charleston, South Carolina, apprehended unscathed but Philando Castile was killed in his car after voluntarily announcing to the police officer that he had a gun (which he had a permit to carry)? I don’t know about you, but I doubt a person who intended to shoot a police officer would have announced that he had a weapon, but I digress. Honestly, I may not know the how but I’m pretty sure I know the why. With that being said, all I need to know now is the when. When will it finally stop?"

I am privileged to celebrate it with you.We preside today together over the consummation of one set of proverbially big “ifs:”- IF I make it through; if I pass my exams; if I make it to graduation . You have, you did, and you are- and along with your faculty and parents, friends and family- I am delighted to be here to offer my congratulations. We preside today together over the conception of innumerable contingent “ifs” as well. After all, this is a commencement, not a termination; it is the beginning of things. The many implicit “ifs” – if I go on to more study or not; if I move here, or there; if I take this job, or that job – echo into the uncertainty of the future.As we ponder those reverberations emanating from today’s milestone, we might productively consider the words of the ostensible expert on that very topic, Rudyard Kipling, whose most famous poem is entitled, simply- “IF:” If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you But make allowance for their doubting too, If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: If you can dream--and not make dreams your master, If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools: If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: ""Hold on!"" If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you; If all men count with you, but none too much, If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son! --Rudyard KiplingKipling’s famous poem, and wisdom, have stood the tests of time; but we may concede that time has tested them sorely just the same. For one thing, there is the blatant sexism acceptable in his day, but objectionable in ours. We can have none of this man/boy, father/son exclusivity- even on the cusp of Father’s Day! Were we to write the poem today, we might end with something like:Yours is the earth, all that’s tame and that’s wild-And what’s more, you will merit that treasure, my child.I have another objection to the poem, specifically on our behalf as crusaders for health. Why does health matter? We may tend to forget that health is not a virtue. Health, per se, is not the prize either; health is a currency uniquely applicable to the purchase of the prize. Health matters because…healthy people have better lives; healthy people have more fun.What we feel matters: pain and sadness, or today- joy and pride. Disaster, when it happens, as it inevitably does to us all, is undeniably real. Triumph is as well.Accordingly, I have presumed to write a rebuttal to Kipling’s ‘If.’ Mine, naturally, is entitled- “If, and but:”Triumph and disaster are bothreal; for life and death are setapart by little more than ourcapacity to feel. and Kipling, grownmore old than wise, unlearning todespise or love; mistold the goal, concealed the prize. For triumph and disaster areboth real; all that Ifeel is nervously alive upon the slipperyverge of death. triumphfills, inspires me; disasterdrains me dry; and neither, more, nor less reliably than breath. -DLKTo reiterate: today’s triumph is real, and deserves to be celebrated. How it makes us feel matters.But my job here today is not just to celebrate and congratulate you, pleasant though that might be for us both. My job- the job of a commencement speaker- is to provoke and harangue, goad and attempt to inspire. I have only faint hope of achieving all that, but in accepting this invitation, I pledged my best effort.In service to that mission, then, it is other lines of the poem that seem most to warrant our consideration today. Namely:If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spokenTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools…There’s a lot there to ponder in a post-truth world of alternative facts. There is a lot to that in a world where every opinion mistakes itself for expertise; every voice can access the megaphone of cyberspace; and every assertion can amplify itself in echo chambers populated by those attending carefully only to the opinions they already own, drowning out all else.We presume that Kipling is speaking to us, and thus that THE truth is OUR truth. But if everyone is the person to whom Kipling is speaking- if each of us owns the truth- then who is the knave, who twists the truth? Who is the fool taken in by such willful distortion? Recall the precautionary lyrics, courtesy of The Main Ingredient: everybody plays the fool, some time… Sometimes our view of the truth can be too narrow. Those of us who embrace and espouse holism see just that liability in staunch conventionalists who refute any truths that reside outside the bounds of their comfortable conventions.Sometimes, though, our view of truth can be too broad. Not all that glitters is gold; not every therapeutic modality with intrinsic appeal and vocal proponents- actually works. In the pursuit of truth, we must keep open minds- but not ever so open our brains flop out!We can all too readily believe what isn’t true, and play the fool. In our fervor, we can pass along that misguided conviction, playing the knave- and making fools of others.When you know the truth reliably; defend it. When you don’t know the truth, admit it. When you hear the truth, embrace it. When most uncertain, listen and reflect at greatest length. Respect how readily we all mistake our native preferences for truth.Kipling says if you meet all criteria, the earth is yours. But I say: if you are worthy, you know the world cannot be yours, because it belongs to everyone. And to no one. It was here before us, and will be here after us. It belongs as much to butterflies and bears, penguins and pine trees, lizards and lemurs. We cannot own the earth, and should aspire to no such thing. We should not seek to own the truth, either- we should strive to share it.Sometimes, our view of truth is too proprietary. Many of us try on our own to be that source of truth that rises above the shouts of the knaves, and reorients the gullible fools. But in this age of incessant din and endless echoes of every opinion- no one voice can reliably deliver the signal of truth; no one voice can overmaster the din. Only in our unity is there sufficient strength to try.We should not seek to own fundamental truths about well-being, or anything else for that matter. We should share them. And if sharing them requires us to build new bridges to unexpected places, then we should all be just such engineers.The True Health Initiative is my effort at bridge building- a global coalition, devoted to defending and disseminating the fundamental truths about a sustainable, health-promoting lifestyle. Alternatives to those truths are forever tempting the public because they are provocative, and magical, and sexy. Sadly, they are untrue.When you do find the truth, don’t seek to own it. The truth is only ever distorted in echo chambers. The truth withers and dies in bunkers. The truth is made for bridges, not bunkers. The truth blossoms in the disinfecting rays of daylight. The truth is best shared.That, in turn, brings me to the one truth of my own I presume to share today, reflecting on my own efforts to do good in the world. We all want to be special, and rightly so. You are distinguishing yourselves today, so my comment may seem a bit incongruous- but the truth does not promise to be congruous or convenient; only true. Here it is: I believe the best measure of our worth is not how much better we can be than average, but how much we do to make the average better.What difference does it make if you know that health care should be a right, but society treats it as a privilege? What difference does it make if you know that access to care should be universal, but it remains exclusive? What difference does it make if you know that holistic models of care can be kinder and gentler and highly effective, but the system is unreformed? What difference does it make if you know that climate change is real, and we are complicit in it, but our culture remains committed to doing far too little far too late about it? What difference does it make if you know that multicolored marshmallows are no part of a six-year-old’s complete breakfast, but Madison Avenue doesn’t give a damn?Gertrude Stein famously said: a difference, to be a difference, must make a difference. To make a difference, we must make the mean different. We must raise the average- of awareness, knowledge, and understanding; of empowerment and opportunity; of concern, compassion, and civility.Society does not do the bidding of outliers; it heeds the tolling at the center of the bell curve. Society, and culture, regress to the mean. They are governed by the popular imperatives, not the most erudite. So don’t seek exclusive islands in the tail of the bell curve; you can be different there, but you cannot make a difference there:No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.-John DonneLike John Donne’s church bell, the bell curve tolls for us all. We will rise or fall together.That’s my truth for today. The true measure of our worth is not how much better we can be than average, but how much we can do to make the average better. It’s your time, and it’s your turn to make the mean of us all- better.Graduates of 2017- push your youthful strength up against the reluctant weight of the mean- but do it tomorrow. Put your shoulder to the unyielding line drawn through the middle of the bell curve and lift, tomorrow. Welcome to the revolution, tomorrow; it will be waiting for you.Today, the simple truth is- you’ve made it. That is a triumph. Perhaps a small triumph in the grand sweep of things; but all triumphs are small in the grand sweep of things. It is a triumph, truly, and worthy of celebration. It matters.I am honored to celebrate it with you, and proud to be here to say: Class of 2017- congratulations!-finDavid L.

74,THE WORLDPOST,Trump Substitutes Policymaking For Bomb-throwing With His Job Training Plan,"Mark Muro, ContributorSenior fellow, Metropolitan Policy Program, Brookings",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-job-training_us_5949290be4b0edb84c1597a9,Trump’s initiative to expand industry-recognized apprenticeships is — at least in concept — an incremental but genuine advance.,2017-06-22,"Trump hands a pen to Charles Robel after delivering remarks on ""Apprenticeship and Workforce of Tomorrow"" initiatives at the White House. June 15.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594ac84e1500001f008ff853.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s embrace of apprenticeships as an effective way to train workers for meaningful, middle-skill careers offered a break last week from the Trump administration’s near-total indifference to serious policy development.For once, Trump carried out a relatively normal policy announcement, complete with a relatively cogent speech. Likewise, Trump focused on a topic of both genuine relevance (how to improve job training) and bipartisan appeal (expanding the reach of private-sector apprenticeship programs).What is more, the president managed to get the big things right with his executive order. In noting that a four-year college degree isn’t for everyone, he spoke reasonably about the potential of paid, hands-on workplace experiences that train workers and link them to employers. In addition, Trump rightly underscored the need for industry — rather than the government — to play the largest role in structuring those experiences. While some are criticizing that emphasis, it’s actually the right one.The executive order is welcome not only because it seeks to build on — rather than trash — ApprenticeshipsUSA, a popular grant program that was previously championed by the Obama administration. Equally important, Trump’s move to reorient and grow the program seems to reflect a constructive bid to enhance the effectiveness and reach of the nation’s main apprenticeship program by nudging it into closer alignment with the private sector.Industry influence is not always desirable, to be sure, especially given the Trump administration’s excessive coziness with powerful interest groups in the oil, gas and financial sectors. But in the case of workforce training, a high degree of coordination with industry — ideally on everything from program design to curriculum, certifications and job placement — is now seen by most stakeholders as a crucial dividing line between programs that work and programs that don’t. Such alignment ― and ideally co-development ― of programs with the private sector serves as a strong check on the biggest problem of American workforce training: training divorced from market demand. And so Trump’s moves to encourage the establishment of more “industry-recognized” — as opposed to “government-registered” — apprenticeships are actually the most welcome element of the new executive order, after the doubling of the program’s budget to $200 million. Trump-weary critics are wary of the order’s plan to give more flexibility to “third parties” — including companies, trade associations and unions — to design new apprenticeship programs. However, the order’s flexibility represents a needed reduction of overly rigid regulations, even as it responsibly tasks the secretary of labor to establish a new review process for maintaining the quality of both the existing government-registered and the new industry-certified apprenticeships. As such, the order represents a welcome encouragement to employers to embrace apprenticeships as an effective way to recruit and train workers.Now of course, there are some problems here ― the usual Trump flimflammery. For one thing, last week’s announcement follows Trump’s endorsement of Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff’s “moonshot” challenge to Trump to create 5 million apprenticeships in five years ― but the numbers don’t add up. Specifically, Trump proposes to multiply the nation’s 500,000 registered apprenticeships by a factor of 10 but appears committed to only doubling the program’s $90 million budget. In similar fashion, the new expansion of apprenticeship comes against the backdrop of draconian cuts to the entire workforce development budget. In this regard, the president’s budget proposal for 2018 calls for slashing the Labor Department’s budget to $9.6 billion, a reduction of about 21 percent.And then, in the same vein, there is Trump’s focus on apprenticeships to the exclusion of all else in the workforce development realm. While the creation of 5 million apprenticeships would be a worthy strike against the nation’s alleged “skills gaps,” apprenticeships won’t solve the nation’s other large labor market problems. Apprenticeships won’t by themselves address the “hollowing out” of the middle of the market as technology substitutes for routine-based tasks, for example. Nor will expanding apprenticeships do much to address the problem of skill obsolescence in a changing economy, when many employers may prefer to return to the entry-level market rather than retrain their existing workforce. And neither, for that matter, will apprenticeships help much with addressing the increasing numbers of prime-age workers who choose not to participate in the labor force at all.And yet, with that said, Trump’s initiative to expand apprenticeships by allowing new actors to develop standards for a new crop of industry-recognized apprenticeships to complement the existing ones is — at least in concept — an incremental but genuine advance. For once, a reckless president has brought forth a constructive plan for supporting a beneficial development in the economy. "

Pride Month is a recognition and celebration of the incredible strides that have been made in recognizing the rights of LGBTQ individuals. It is also a reminder that there remains significant work to be done on the path to equal treatment for all. One area in which discrimination still pervades is in the workplace, and, even in a liberal bastion like New York, transgender individuals continue to face some of the more blatant mistreatment.The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, which included 27,715 transgender individuals from the United States and its territories, revealed that “30% of respondents who had a job in the past year reported being fired, denied a promotion, or experiencing some other form of mistreatment related to their gender identity or expression.” Additionally, “77% of respondents who had a job in the past year took steps to avoid mistreatment in the workplace, such as hiding or delaying their gender transition or quitting their job.”Earlier this month, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)—the federal agency charged with enforcing federal employment discrimination law—sued Apple Metro Inc., which operates dozens of Applebee’s Neighborhood Bar & Grill franchises in the New York City area, alleging violations of federal civil rights law.Danielle Feola, a transgender woman, was repeatedly harassed and subjected to derogatory comments about her gender identity while working just two weeks at an Applebee’s in Hawthorne, New York. She was relentlessly teased. Employees called her “he,” “him,” “Daniel,” “Caitlyn” (in reference to Caitlyn Jenner), and “tranny,” among other offensive terms. They made distasteful comments about her genitalia. Despite her complaints, the General Manager refused to take any action, and she was ultimately fired in retaliation for her complaints and because of her gender identity.We filed a complaint with the EEOC, which ultimately chose to litigate the matter. In bringing this case, the EEOC continues its pattern of promoting workplace equality for all gender identities in keeping with its interpretation of federal antidiscrimination law.Since the Civil Rights Movement gained force in the mid-twentieth century, many groups have been granted protection from employment discrimination under federal law. Most notably, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is the federal law that prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. In the years following its enactment, legal protections in this area have expanded. For example, Title VII was amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, granting expectant mothers explicit protection from workplace discrimination.Absent from Title VII are explicit protections from workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or—as in Ms. Feola’s case—gender identity. However, since 2012, the EEOC has pushed to expand the interpretation of Title VII’s prohibition against discrimination on the basis of “sex” to protect LGBTQ individuals. Many courts have also reasoned that discrimination against transgender employees for not conforming to the gender they were assigned at birth inherently takes gender (and therefore sex) into account. While this interpretation is not universally accepted, courts are increasingly agreeing with the EEOC’s rationale. Meanwhile, state and local governments are moving towards providing more explicit protections; for example, under the New York City Human Rights Law, gender discrimination encompasses discrimination on the basis of gender identity, gender expression, and transgender status, and prohibits such discrimination in employment.Ms. Feola’s case against Applebee’s is significant because it may present the influential Southern District of New York, which adjudicates cases that impact about a quarter of the state’s population, with the chance to adopt the EEOC’s interpretation of Title VII as protecting transgender and gender non-conforming individuals from employer discrimination. Unless and until Title VII’s language is modified to explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity, cases such as Ms. Feola’s are of the utmost importance in potentially setting precedent for future cases and expanding the rights of LGBTQ individuals nationwide."
76,QUEER VOICES,Most Americans Don't Think Religious-Based Discrimination Should Be Lawful,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/religiously-based-service-refusals_us_594ab942e4b01cdedeffd16a,The tide is turning in support of more open policies toward the LBGTQ community.,2017-06-21,"A majority of Americans in almost every state, excluding Alaska, oppose allowing small business owners to refuse goods or services to gay and lesbian people.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594aba4f29000020003b07d0.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, the governor of Texas signed into law a bill that allows faith-based adoption groups to deny services “under circumstances that conflict with the provider’s sincerely held religious beliefs.” Critics, including the ACLU of Texas, say the new law could likely be used to discriminate against LGBTQ families in adoptions.A number of Christian groups and outlets applauded the bill. But according to a new report by the Public Religion Research Institute, support for religiously based service refusals is quickly declining.PRRI’s report, based on a survey of roughly 40,000 interviews, found that more than six in ten Americans oppose allowing small business owners in their state to refuse to provide goods and services to gay or lesbian people on religious grounds.That’s roughly the same percentage that opposed such refusals in a similar study PRRI conducted last year. But a breakdown of the results reveals that across religious groups, support for religiously based service refusals is declining.White evangelical Protestants continue to be the faith group most in favor of religiously motivated discrimination, though even among that group support has dropped. In 2015, 56 percent of white evangelicals were in favor of allowing business owners to deny services to gay and lesbian people. In 2016, the number had dropped to 50 percent.No group witnessed a more dramatic shift in opinion than Mormons, 58 percent of whom favored religiously based refusals in 2015. By the following year, just 42 percent were in favor and 52 percent were opposed.“For the first time in a PRRI poll of this size, no major religious group reports majority support for religiously based service refusals of gay and lesbian Americans,” said PRRI CEO Robert P. Jones in a statement.This change appears to be part of a larger shift in the way religious Americans view a number of LGBTQ issues. “Most religious groups today support same-sex marriage,” Jones added. “The religious groups in which majorities oppose same-sex marriage make up less than 20 percent of the public.” Geographically, too, Americans demonstrate increasing support for LGBTQ rights. A majority of Americans in every state except Alaska oppose allowing small business owners to refuse goods and services to gay and lesbian people, according to PRRI. The report also found that a majority of residents in 37 states are in favor of allowing same-sex marriage.Such refusals tend to be more popular among Republicans than Democrats, even though support there is also faltering, PRRI found. The Texas adoption bill was sponsored by a group of 55 senators and representatives ― all of them Republicans.Rumors swirled earlier this year that President Donald Trump was poised to sign an executive order that could allow virtually any federally funded entity with a religious affiliation to refuse service to someone based on religious objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion or transgender identity after a draft order leaked to news outlets. Such a move could have effectively given the government license to discriminate against LGBTQ people.In May, Trump signed an executive order on religious freedom that left out religiously based service refusals and instead focused on granting churches greater involvement in politics.
