And at least for this reason it is necessary to show respect for him, even if you do not agree with some of his positions,” Putin said, before adding this dig: “Inside the country, disrespect is shown for him. This is a regrettable negative component of the U.S. political system.”Putin then demurred about whether he could offer tips to Trump.“I believe that the president of the United States does not need any advice because one has to possess certain talent and go through this trial to be elected, even without having the experience of such big administrative work. He [Trump] has done this,” Putin said. “He won honestly.”That last comment is a matter of some debate and serious investigation since the Trump administration has been hobbled by suspicions from lawmakers and investigators that his campaign colluded with Russia to help defeat Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton, Newsweek noted.Putin denied that Russia interfered with the election and blamed the charges on “an unprecedented anti-Russian campaign.” “After losing the election to Trump, they have put all the blame on Russia and engaged in a frenzied anti-Russian hysteria,” he said, according to the Chicago Tribune.Putin also defended Trump’s unpredictable style of governing, blaming it partially on his adversaries.“His unpredictability is not only based on his nature, another reason for it is the great domestic resistance, as they actually prevent him from implementing any of his electoral initiatives,” Tass reported. “So it is not right to say that unpredictability is in his nature ― it depends on the U.S. political system.”Putin stressed that Russia will work with whoever is in office but refused to consider whether cooperation would have been easier if Clinton had become president.“We don’t know what it would have been like,” he said."

On the printed note were musings resembling a poem. It was titled “Lies The Movies Told Me.”“Rich tycoons are Bullshit,” McNamara wrote. “Even after spending an afternoon with Robin Williams, Donald Trump is still and will always be an asshole.”“People who talk to themselves in voice over are deeper and more sensitive,” she added.McNamara, who died in April 2016, supported Hillary Clinton in last year’s presidential campaign, often retweeting messages that praised of the former Secretary of State and ones that were critical of Trump.When McNamara died, Oswalt was devastated. The comedian often discussed his grief in interviews and on Twitter. He dedicated his 2016 special “Talking for Clapping” to her. Then, in his newest Netflix special “Annihilation,” Oswalt discussed both the pain of loss and the pain of a Trump presidency. The latter, the comedian said, awakened him from a grief-related “hyper-deadness.” “Sometimes I’m worried I am like a water glass that’s been sitting in a freezer and now you’re taking it out and you’re pouring hot water into it,” Oswalt told HuffPost in a recent interview about his new special. “One extreme to the other like that ― it’s very unnerving.”Considering McNamara’s unearthed thoughts on Trump, it’s likely she would’ve been proud that his disgust for Trump has helped distract him from his grief.And now that her note is on the internet for all to see, many of Oswalt’s followers are applauding McNamara’s description of Trump."

There are spoilers below for Netflix’s “Mindhunter.” Four decades ago, FBI special agents John Douglas and Robert Ressler began a bold new research project alongside a Boston crime victim expert named Dr. Ann Burgess.Burgess, now a professor at Boston College’s Connell School of Nursing, thought the agents’ access to crime scenes and incarcerated killers presented a “phenomenal” opportunity for research, she told HuffPost. That research would go on to help define the ways law enforcement officials and civilians alike understand the concept of a serial killer ― and spark a must-binge TV drama show, too.Douglas, Ressler and Burgess pioneered a model for criminal profiling at the FBI in the late 1970s, a process eventually documented in Douglas’ 1995 book Mindhunter ― which spawned the recent Netflix series by the same name. Much of the show relies on snippets from the book, a 375-page tome filled with fascinatingly macabre details from real-life cases: Charles Manson, the Son of Sam, Richard Speck and Ted Bundy among them. In “Mindhunter,” the show’s Douglas figure is called Holden Ford played by actor Jonathan Groff, while the stand-in for the more seasoned Ressler (who died in 2013), is named Bill Tench played by Holt McCallany. Mirroring the achievements of the young “blue-flamer” portrayed in Douglas’ book, Holden kicks off a project to interview serial killers in an attempt to understand how they think. At first greeted by resistance from FBI Academy higher-ups at the Quantico base, the small team manages to secure some hefty funding for their endeavor. Holden and Bill set off collecting interviews on the “deviant behavior” of convicted killers across the country for Dr. Wendy Carr ― a version of Burgess played by Anna Torv ― to analyze. In real life, the team worked together for well over a decade, Burgess told HuffPost, and they eventually published the Crime Classification Manual: A Standard System for Investigating and Classifying Violent Crimes in 1992 using their findings on violent crimes. Although forms of offender profiling existed before their research, Douglas, Ressler and Burgess are often credited as helping to establish the bureau’s distinct behavioral science method of profiling criminals.“What we’d do is take the files and start looking at a pattern,” Burgess said, explaining how different details from the cases they encountered would be filed under categories like victimology, crime scenes and forensics, while some information would be condensed into numerical figures. The agents “gleaned” information from the profiles they created, and found that, for example, crime scenes could be classified as either “organized” or “disorganized.”“And that’s exactly what these agents were able to do. They would go in, look at a scene, and come up with the basic categories,” Burgess recalled. “They would have their whole team there, and sometimes people would disagree, which was great! Because by disagreeing, they could say, ‘Well, I see this.’ Or, ‘I don’t see that. How do you see that?’”“There was a very good exchange back and forth,” she said, on characteristics as specific as a killer’s age.And even though there were very, very few female agents or researchers at the FBI at the time, Burgess felt there was a “mutual sharing of information” among the team members. “Very collegial,” she said, although occasional conflict would arise over how, exactly, the team would gather their data. While Burgess ― and the “Mindhunter” character Carr ― preferred to stick to the agreed-upon questionnaire methodology, the FBI agents preferred their own, more casual style. “They would get more chatty, rather than being step-by-step,” she said, adding that the agents would eventually have to hew closer to the methodology. “Who do you think always won? The academic.”“Mindhunter” takes liberties as it develops characters’ personal lives ― Holden’s girlfriend may be loosely based on the woman Douglas married, Pam, but the steamy sex scenes are certainly left out of the agent’s memoir.Many details of their work, however, appear to be aligned with real-life events portrayed in the book. The agency really trained up-and-coming agents by showing them a videotape of a hostage negotiation that ended with the hostage-taker turning the gun on himself in full view ― a disturbing sequence portrayed in the show’s first episode. Douglas and Ressler really partnered up on “road school,” training local cops around the country, and some of those local cops really came up to them after class with strange cases of their own, asking for advice.The first murderer the pair interviewed was indeed Ed Kemper, and yes, the horrifying description of Kemper’s crimes ― murdering and dismembering young women and eventually his own mother ― is also accurate. Yet the experience of talking to him was, apparently, less horrifying.“I would be less than honest if I didn’t admit that I liked Ed,” Douglas writes. “He was friendly, open, sensitive and had a good sense of humor. As much as you can say such a thing in this setting, I enjoyed being around him. I don’t want him out on the streets, and in his most lucid moments, neither does he. But my personal feelings about him then, which I still hold, do point up an important consideration for anyone dealing with repeat offenders. Many of these guys are quite charming, highly articulate and glib.”Other individual cases on the show derive from Douglas’ experience: He offered advice after reading about an elderly woman killed along with her dogs in his local paper, interviewed women’s shoe fetishist and convicted killer Jerry Brudos, and recalled an elementary school principal from his hometown who was fired for tickling children’s feet. Most of the killers they interviewed were men, and many had problems with women in their lives, which they used as an excuse to commit violence against women.Burgess, who spoke with Douglas, now in his 70s and retired, during the show’s production but wasn’t directly involved with the series, explained that she understood why viewers might be drawn to a show like “Mindhunter,” in an age of renewed fascination with true crime. “Part of it is a fascination, but part of it is a fear. There is so much crime. You don’t want to end up as a victim,” she said. “And that’s something that the agents would emphasize in the field; you would learn something about what had happened in the crime and think, ‘Boy, I’m going to try to not do that, if it ever happened to me.’ So it’s crime prevention as well as it is solving the crime.” "

Since Trump was elected in November, the number of cities and towns that have committed to using only clean power sources has more than doubled, with 46 cities, including Atlanta and San Diego, promising a move in that direction, said Jodie Van Horn, campaign director for the Sierra Club’s Ready for 100 initiative. The campaign, which launched in 2016, is challenging 100 U.S. cities to commit to 100 percent clean energy.“For too long, dirty fuels have jeopardized the health of our communities and put our children’s future at risk,” said Van Horn. “Now cities are not only our best offense, they’re also our best defense against Trump’s destructive policies.”Cities play a key role in reducing carbon emissions, since they account for roughly 75 percent of global C0₂ emissions. It’s becoming easier for cities to clean their air as renewable energy continues to become more affordable. Once extremely costly, wind and solar will become the cheapest sources of electricity globally by 2030, according to research firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance.While cities’ pursuit of 100 percent renewable energy is an “admirable goal,” the feasibility of every city achieving this target depends partly on the city government’s mandates and how they define what “100 percent renewable” means, said Michelle Davis, senior solar analyst at GTM Research.Even the five towns that have already made the transition had different ideas about how to reach this target, Davis said. So one city’s path to 100 percent renewable energy could look very different from another’s. “It’s one of the main areas of criticisms of most of these renewable energy targets and policies ― it is not consistent from state to state and city to city exactly how an entity claims they are meeting certain renewable energy goals,” Davis said.  Another challenge lies in who runs a city’s electric grid, she said. Some grids are run by municipal utilities, which means the city can decide whether it wants to integrate cleaner energy options. However, other cities have grids that are run by a statewide monopoly utility. These cities don’t have jurisdiction to make those decisions.But as clean energy technologies continue to become more affordable and efficient, a 100 percent renewable power target should be within reach for most cities.“Right now the cities that are doing it are ones where ‘the right conditions’ ― already a good energy mix, rich ― are in place, but this doesn’t need to persist,” said Dan Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley. “Cities can all essentially source green energy and use offsets to fill gaps until more clean generation comes online.”"

Spoiler alert: She survived.",2017-10-21,"Madonna and photographer Steven Meisel arrive at a New York party for ""Sex"" on Oct. 15, 1992.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ea4eb6140000590d8c8e8f.jpeg?cache=Isz28HpS6V&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Twenty-five years ago, Madonna put the world in a trance with the release of Sex. Well, she put some of the world in a trance: During its first day in stores, the $50 coffee-table book, which lived up to its carnal title, sold 150,000 copies, and it soon topped The New York Times Best Seller list. Of course, because it was mainstream art promoting libidinous pleasure, a puritanical outcry followed. Many critics, cultural theorists and fans alike found the BDSM-themed photo collection scandalizing, even repulsive. In their eyes, Madonna, who already faced accessions of overexposure following a decade of chart-topping provocations, had crossed the line.Today, Sex is still the most radical career move a pop star has ever made.During Madonna’s imperial phase ― the ephemeral period in an artist’s career when everything turns to commercial gold ― she sang about teenage pregnancy, introduced the famous cone bra, burned Christian crosses, simulated masturbation on an arena tour and made a video so prurient that even the youth-centric MTV refused to air it. That was child’s play.The publication of Sex ― on Oct. 21, 1992, one day after its companion album “Erotica” arrived to mixed reviews ― marked the moment Madonna’s priorities graduated from making you dance to making you horny. Michael Jackson had been grabbing his crotch for years, and Prince wore an assless pantsuit to the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards, but women were only allowed to push so many buttons. The competing female pop stars of the 1980s couched their sexuality in other aesthetics: punk camp (Cyndi Lauper), androgyny (Annie Lennox), anthems about respect (Janet Jackson), love-hungry wholesomeness (Whitney Houston). For Madonna, however, there was a continuum between “Like a Virgin,” the 1984 single that sparked her first brush with controversy, and “Erotica,” a concept album about fornication, conceived in the shadow of the conservative Reagan era and the ongoing AIDS crisis. Sex was an audacious thesis statement, calculated enough to piss people off but seemly enough to maintain artistic integrity. No one today would dare emulate it. Even though desire has grown queerer in the intervening years, the think-piece economy would have a field day with the pornographic imagery, brazen bisexuality and postfeminist authorship sandwiched between the book’s aluminum covers.One of the first photographs, captured in glossy black and white, shows Madonna seated on a stool, wearing bondage gear, breasts exposed. She sucks on one of her fingers while seemingly inserting another into her vagina. Several pages later, a man appears to be eating her out. The rest of the book includes threesomes, men kissing men, women fondling women, dog collars, whips, knives ― everything but graphic intercourse. Throughout, she writes about the pleasure and pain of sex, sometimes scripting letters to a fictional lover named Johnny.For Sex and “Erotica,” Madonna assumed an alter ego, Mistress Dita. As evidenced with “Material Girl” and “Vogue,” Madonna always idolized Old Hollywood movie stars, and now she’d turned an entire chapter of her career into character-based performance art. Hers was hardly pop’s first alter ego (David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardrust being the primo example), but none that have followed (Janet Jackson’s varying personas on “Damita Jo,” Beyoncé’s Sasha Fierce, Mariah Carey’s Mimi) are as daring or innovative as Madonna’s. Madonna described the book’s contents as “fantasy,” but certain naysayers felt Sex was somehow coercing them to adopt her expressions of passion. “Of course, some of us actually like the opposite sex,” a female New York Times critic wrote in a review, encapsulating the paradox inherent in the backlash Madonna experienced. ”[S]ome of us believe it is possible to have great sex without whips, third parties or domestic pets. [...] Maybe Sex can be a warning about what happens when pop icons become bloated, one way or another.” Even the reinvention-oriented pop stars who most resemble Madonna ― Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Rihanna ― have never made political statements as blatant as Sex, if they’ve made political statements at all. Gaga is a prominent LGBTQ ally, as Madonna was long before such advocacy was commonplace in the entertainment industry, but her music has always centered on dance-floor invitations and commentary about the nature of fame. As Rolling Stone suggested earlier this week, “Erotica” and Sex operated more in the vein of Beyoncé’s “Lemonade,” also inspired by sociopolitical strife. “Lemonade” was accompanied by a cinematic visual album; “Erotica” was accompanied by a cinematic book co-starring Isabella Rossellini, Naomi Campbell, Udo Kier, Big Daddy Kane, Vanilla Ice and gay porn actor Joey Stefano. (Fashion fixture Steven Meisel took the photos, and Harper’s Bazaar creative director Fabien Baron served as the art director.)Sex and “Erotica” were a one-two punch that could have extinguished Madonna’s career. It’s not every day that pop singers hitchhike in the nude and live to tell the tale. “This is not a love song,” she announced at the start of the track “Bye Bye Baby,” a sentiment echoed in the passage that opens Sex: “This book is about sex. Sex is not love. Love is not sex.” Such notions, especially in 1992, ran counter to everything a female celebrity was supposed to be: alluring but not dominating, confident but not powerful, prey but not predator. Madonna, forever popular culture’s savviest self-marketer, was in full control of the way she displayed her body.After the hoopla subsided and Sex went out of print, Madonna continued to reinvent herself, most significantly as a spiritually enlightened earth-mother, on 1998′s “Ray of Light,” her best album to date. Controversy remained part of her job description. By that point, she’d received so much flak from the media and general public that she could anger without much collateral damage; it’s hard to achieve something more daring than Sex.Madonna is now routinely mocked for remaining sexual as she nears senior-citizen status. It’s her checkmate. In the end, that pioneering pluck ― crystallized during her “Erotica” stage ― will define her legacy. As Cher, Diana Ross, Céline Dion and Elton John become nostalgia acts, Madonna maintains the same boundary-pushing persona that, circa 1992, nearly tipped her over the cultural edge. That year, when asked whether she feared being overexposed, she said, brilliantly, “Only at the gynecologist’s.” Hit Backspace for a regular dose of pop culture nostalgia. "

A U.S. patrol team on a routine train-and-advise mission in Niger on Oct. 4 was ambushed by about 50 militants affiliated with the so-called Islamic State in the Greater Sahara. The attack killed four U.S. soldiers and at least one member of the Nigerien armed forces. Two Americans were injured.More than two weeks later, military investigators still lack accurate information, Defense Secretary James Mattis said Thursday.What we do know is that the handful of soldiers was meeting with locals in a village on Niger’s border with Mali, not expecting to come under fire.“It was not meant to be an engagement with the enemy,” the Pentagon’s Africa Command spokesman, Col. Mark Cheadle, said. Because the risk of threat wasn’t high, he added, the soldiers had no support from aircraft.It’s still unclear how militants managed to mount a surprise attack on the U.S.-led forces. The details of militants’ identities and what happened during the firefight are also murky. The security of the troops also has been called into question. Patrol members apparently were only armed with rifles, and were driving in unarmored vehicles.“They met an overwhelming force,” a counterterrorism official told ABC News of the U.S.-led patrol. “They were outgunned and outmatched. The enemy had relative superiority in numbers and fully enveloped and outflanked the team. I think they got cut in half with suppressive fire.” Sgt. La David Johnson was missing for up to 36 hours after the attack, leading to a search-and-rescue operation, the details of which have yet to come to light. A U.S. contractor evacuated U.S. and Nigerien troops following the gunfight, the U.S. Africa Command said, although it’s still unclear when that rescue happened and whether it involved an airlift. There also were reports that French helicopters rescued the ambushed troops from 275 miles away. The recovery of Johnson’s body suggested other soldiers in his team made a “tactical withdrawal” under fire, leaving Johnson as the person behind. “If they had stayed, everyone would have died,” the official told ABC.Mattis contradicted this on Thursday, saying “the U.S. military does not leave its troops behind.” U.S., French and Nigerien forces “never left the battlefield” until Johnson was found, added Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie, the joint staff director.The group behind the attack is part of the puzzle. Islamic State in the Greater Sahara was created in 2015 and was officially recognized as an ISIS splinter group the following year. Its leader, Adnan Abu Walid, has belonged to various other local terror organizations, including al Qaeda’s affiliate in West Africa. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.Some members of Congress were incensed that the administration hasn’t released more information. They began to receive reports only this week, after Trump falsely claimed that previous presidents didn’t call the families of fallen service members.“We did not know about Niger until it came out in the paper,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) told reporters on Thursday. “We need to have a process of communications, which I’ve had with other administrations, of exchanging information and knowledge.”McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he wants answers from the Defense Department, and his demands “may require a subpoena.”Trump this week invoked chief of staff Gen. John Kelly’s son, Marines 2nd Lt. Robert Kelly, as he claimed former President Barack Obama and other previous presidents didn’t call the families of fallen troops.Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) then came forward to recount a conversation she overheard this week between Trump and the pregnant widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, one of the four soldiers killed in Niger. Trump reportedly told the woman that her husband “must’ve known what he signed up for” and referred to him repeatedly as “your guy.”Trump claimed Wilson fabricated the story, but Johnson’s mother confirmed Wilson’s account. The Sahel region has become a hotbed of extremism, and American special forces teams are operating in remote areas across the region, an official said. Army Green Berets have gone to the Mali-Niger border 29 times in the last six months.

Then, last week, she became homeless herself.Sanders, her husband and 11-year-old son lost their home in the fires that roared through the Wine Country. Like many of the students she serves, she and her family are now living “doubled up” with another family because they lack a home of their own.“Sometimes we can only relate to what we’ve experienced ourselves,” she said. “But for us, this is all temporary. It will resolve. For so many families who were renters or already living on the margins, it’s not going to resolve. At least not any time soon.”Sanders returned to work Monday at the Sonoma County Office of Education, where she is the coordinator for homeless education and foster youth, and is now busy helping the thousands of Sonoma County families suddenly left homeless by the fires — all while trying to secure housing for her own family.She’s not alone. Teachers, administrators and parents — many of whom either lost their own homes or are hosting families who did — are working to prepare for the gradual re-opening of schools in fire-ravaged areas of Sonoma, Napa and Mendocino counties. Some schools began welcoming back students on Monday, but others closer to the fire zones will remain closed at least through next week.And some will never re-open, because they burned to the ground.California is already grappling with a growing number of students left homeless by the soaring cost of housing. Since 2014, the number of homeless students in California has jumped 20 percent, to just over 202,000. As the cost of living continues to climb, those numbers are expected to grow. While 85 percent of those children are living with their families “doubled up” in homes with other families, thousands are living in cars, motels, shelters or on the street.In the North Bay, families who were already struggling will have an especially difficult time finding housing if they were displaced by the fires, said Sanders, the Sonoma County office of Education’s homeless coordinator.Renters, those who lack insurance and low-income families might be forced to leave the area entirely — Sonoma County already had a residential vacancy rate of less than 2 percent, and average home prices close to $600,000. Schools throughout the North and East Bay closed during the fires, either because of a direct fire threat or due to heavy smoke. In Sonoma County more than 71,600 students saw their schools close, with some schools — such as Santa Rosa City Schools — not due to re-open for another week, at least.Under the McKinney-Vento federal law, districts are required to survey students every fall about their housing conditions and ensure homeless children receive a high-quality education. As California is increasingly ravaged by fires and other natural disasters, the number of homeless children is expected to increase — putting districts in new territory.Untangling the complex logistics of school enrollment, transportation, free lunches and clean-up has been a monumental task, said Sonoma County Superintendent Steven Herrington.“We have schools that were destroyed. We have schools that are still standing but the neighborhood around them is flattened. We have kids that are in Sacramento, staying with grandparents. We’re trying to figure out transportation in a very spread-out county,” Herrington said.“We don’t know who’s going to show up when schools re-open,” he said, noting that he’s overseen other districts through floods, earthquakes and other disasters. “But it’s important we try to create as much stability for the children as possible. After home, schools are a second home-base for kids.”But there are legal protections for children who find themselves without stable housing. The federal McKinney-Vento law allows homeless students to stay in their original school no matter where the family is living, and enroll in a new school without having to provide proof of residence. It also requires school districts to provide transportation to school, which in a mostly rural county like Sonoma could mean school busses detouring miles to pick up children temporarily living out of town.School enrollment itself will also be a challenge, Herrington said. Considering the scale of the destruction in Sonoma County, school enrollment is expected to be wildly uneven in some areas. Some schools might see fewer students because so many families lost their homes, while others might see far more students than expected. After the 2015 fires in Lake County, school staff said two years passed before school enrollment stabilized, Herrington said.To prepare, school staff in Sonoma County are surveying shelters and communicating with parents via email and social media to see where students are likely to return. District staff are also making arrangements for students whose schools were damaged or destroyed, procuring portables at nearby schools or adopting “a.m. - p.m.” schedules to accommodate ballooning student populations.Students’ mental health needs are also a priority, Herrington said. Counselors will be available at all school sites, and teachers and other staff have been trained on how to tend to students feeling traumatized. Most elementary schools will spend the first two days putting academics aside and focusing on art projects and social activities, allowing students to share their stories and reconnect with friends. Schools in Cotati and Petaluma had therapy dogs for the kids to play with. At Mark West Elementary, students will make banners and write notes thanking first responders. Classrooms everywhere will have designated “cozy spaces” where students can sit quietly for a while, if they feel like it.Returning to school will be a relief for Lesley Van Dordrecht, who’s taught 2nd grade at Mark West Elementary for 24 years. Van Dordrecht and her husband lost their home in the fire and she’s been overwhelmed dealing with insurance paperwork, replacing lost items and the trauma of losing their home of 29 years.“There’s been so much support and love and hope. But I’m missing my kids,” she said, noting that her school will have been closed three weeks when it re-opens Oct. 30. “Routine is so important. Getting back to work, staying busy — it’s a gift.”The early morning of Oct. 8, she and her husband were listening to the 60-mph winds knock around their patio furniture when a friend called and said, “You should get out, there’s a big fire,” Van Dordrecht said.She grabbed her purse, a laptop computer and a few documents. Her husband, a musician, grabbed his favorite guitar. They left in two cars for a cousin’s house in Forestville. “Five minutes later our house exploded,” she said.The fire laid waste to everything, she said, except the St. Francis statue in the backyard.“Some people said we should move the statue because someone might steal it,” she said. “But I kind of like it there.”Hidden Valley Satellite elementary, a pre-K-through-2nd-grade school in Santa Rosa, was destroyed entirely. An estimated 50 percent of the children there lost their homes, said Kelly Kane, co-president of the Parent Faculty Organization.When school reopens, Hidden Valley Satellite’s students will go to the main Hidden Valley campus a mile away. By juggling classroom space, school staff hope to keep the Satellite children in their same class groups with the same teachers, if possible.“A lot of these kids have lost their homes and their school. It’s already so difficult,” Kane said.Kane, her husband, two kids and two dogs evacuated their home at 1 a.m., Oct. 9 when a neighbor banged on their door. Kane was awake anyway, listening to “wind like I’ve never heard before.” A few minutes later a sheriff’s deputy also banged on their door ordering them to evacuate.Kane went to wake up her kids, ages 6 and 8. Her son started crying. “I told him, ‘Just pack up a few things, buddy, it’ll be OK,’ ” Kane said. “Then I started to panic.”Her husband went next door to wake an 85-year-old neighbor who’s deaf. The door was locked so he broke a window to get inside and wake her. She made it out safely, and Kane and her husband met later at a nearby veteran’s center.“You could see the fires burning down the hill and then there was this glow. The kids thought that meant the fire was out. I thought, no — that glow is from the valley. The fire’s moved into the valley, where we live,” she said. “It was terrifying.”The Kanes’ home was spared as the winds shifted and firefighters moved in. But homes just a block away were destroyed, and the school community has been devastated, she said. Some families are staying in hotels, others are with friends or family far away, and with school closed parents are struggling with day-care for their kids while returning to work.Local churches and camps have opened to provide free child-care during the day, and families have formed informal childcare collectives while parents work, she said. A few teachers have emailed reading and math assignments for students to keep up academically after missing so much school. Kane’s kids are staying with family in Redding.“The kids can’t wait to get back to school because they’ll get to see their friends, get back to a routine. Basically, be kids again,” said Kane. “That’s something they all desperately need.”Sanders and her family also evacuated their home the early morning of Oct. 9. “It was pretty clear we had to go when a wall of flames” barreled through the neighborhood, she said.Rushed and panicking, she wasn’t sure what to pack. So she grabbed a school uniform and some odds and ends. “I packed like a child who’s going away for the first time. A lemon? A toy? At that hour your brain isn’t working quite right. Part of me thought we’d be home in a few hours.”They evacuated to a nearby parking lot, then another parking lot, then to an acquaintance’s house, and are now at another friend’s house. She learned her family’s house of 12 years was destroyed by looking at aerial photos the next day.“It’s rubble. You’ve seen the pictures — the whole place is rubble,” she said. “It’s been hard, but it ebbs and flows. The community has been wonderful, and we’re all keeping busy. There’s a sense of resiliency. … Life goes on.”This story originally appeared on EdSource.org"

In Sonoma County more than 71,600 students saw their schools close, with some schools — such as Santa Rosa City Schools — not due to re-open for another week, at least.Under the McKinney-Vento federal law, districts are required to survey students every fall about their housing conditions and ensure homeless children receive a high-quality education. As California is increasingly ravaged by fires and other natural disasters, the number of homeless children is expected to increase — putting districts in new territory.Untangling the complex logistics of school enrollment, transportation, free lunches and clean-up has been a monumental task, said Sonoma County Superintendent Steven Herrington.“We have schools that were destroyed. We have schools that are still standing but the neighborhood around them is flattened. We have kids that are in Sacramento, staying with grandparents. We’re trying to figure out transportation in a very spread-out county,” Herrington said.“We don’t know who’s going to show up when schools re-open,” he said, noting that he’s overseen other districts through floods, earthquakes and other disasters. “But it’s important we try to create as much stability for the children as possible. After home, schools are a second home-base for kids.”But there are legal protections for children who find themselves without stable housing. The federal McKinney-Vento law allows homeless students to stay in their original school no matter where the family is living, and enroll in a new school without having to provide proof of residence. It also requires school districts to provide transportation to school, which in a mostly rural county like Sonoma could mean school busses detouring miles to pick up children temporarily living out of town.School enrollment itself will also be a challenge, Herrington said. Considering the scale of the destruction in Sonoma County, school enrollment is expected to be wildly uneven in some areas. Some schools might see fewer students because so many families lost their homes, while others might see far more students than expected. After the 2015 fires in Lake County, school staff said two years passed before school enrollment stabilized, Herrington said.To prepare, school staff in Sonoma County are surveying shelters and communicating with parents via email and social media to see where students are likely to return. District staff are also making arrangements for students whose schools were damaged or destroyed, procuring portables at nearby schools or adopting “a.m. - p.m.” schedules to accommodate ballooning student populations.Students’ mental health needs are also a priority, Herrington said. Counselors will be available at all school sites, and teachers and other staff have been trained on how to tend to students feeling traumatized. Most elementary schools will spend the first two days putting academics aside and focusing on art projects and social activities, allowing students to share their stories and reconnect with friends. Schools in Cotati and Petaluma had therapy dogs for the kids to play with. At Mark West Elementary, students will make banners and write notes thanking first responders. Classrooms everywhere will have designated “cozy spaces” where students can sit quietly for a while, if they feel like it.Returning to school will be a relief for Lesley Van Dordrecht, who’s taught 2nd grade at Mark West Elementary for 24 years. Van Dordrecht and her husband lost their home in the fire and she’s been overwhelmed dealing with insurance paperwork, replacing lost items and the trauma of losing their home of 29 years.“There’s been so much support and love and hope. But I’m missing my kids,” she said, noting that her school will have been closed three weeks when it re-opens Oct. 30. “Routine is so important. Getting back to work, staying busy — it’s a gift.”The early morning of Oct. 8, she and her husband were listening to the 60-mph winds knock around their patio furniture when a friend called and said, “You should get out, there’s a big fire,” Van Dordrecht said.She grabbed her purse, a laptop computer and a few documents. Her husband, a musician, grabbed his favorite guitar. They left in two cars for a cousin’s house in Forestville. “Five minutes later our house exploded,” she said.The fire laid waste to everything, she said, except the St. Francis statue in the backyard.“Some people said we should move the statue because someone might steal it,” she said. “But I kind of like it there.”Hidden Valley Satellite elementary, a pre-K-through-2nd-grade school in Santa Rosa, was destroyed entirely. An estimated 50 percent of the children there lost their homes, said Kelly Kane, co-president of the Parent Faculty Organization.When school reopens, Hidden Valley Satellite’s students will go to the main Hidden Valley campus a mile away. By juggling classroom space, school staff hope to keep the Satellite children in their same class groups with the same teachers, if possible.“A lot of these kids have lost their homes and their school. It’s already so difficult,” Kane said.Kane, her husband, two kids and two dogs evacuated their home at 1 a.m., Oct. 9 when a neighbor banged on their door. Kane was awake anyway, listening to “wind like I’ve never heard before.” A few minutes later a sheriff’s deputy also banged on their door ordering them to evacuate.Kane went to wake up her kids, ages 6 and 8. Her son started crying. “I told him, ‘Just pack up a few things, buddy, it’ll be OK,’ ” Kane said. “Then I started to panic.”Her husband went next door to wake an 85-year-old neighbor who’s deaf. The door was locked so he broke a window to get inside and wake her. She made it out safely, and Kane and her husband met later at a nearby veteran’s center.“You could see the fires burning down the hill and then there was this glow. The kids thought that meant the fire was out. I thought, no — that glow is from the valley. The fire’s moved into the valley, where we live,” she said. “It was terrifying.”The Kanes’ home was spared as the winds shifted and firefighters moved in. But homes just a block away were destroyed, and the school community has been devastated, she said. Some families are staying in hotels, others are with friends or family far away, and with school closed parents are struggling with day-care for their kids while returning to work.Local churches and camps have opened to provide free child-care during the day, and families have formed informal childcare collectives while parents work, she said. A few teachers have emailed reading and math assignments for students to keep up academically after missing so much school. Kane’s kids are staying with family in Redding.“The kids can’t wait to get back to school because they’ll get to see their friends, get back to a routine. Basically, be kids again,” said Kane. “That’s something they all desperately need.”Sanders and her family also evacuated their home the early morning of Oct. 9. “It was pretty clear we had to go when a wall of flames” barreled through the neighborhood, she said.Rushed and panicking, she wasn’t sure what to pack. So she grabbed a school uniform and some odds and ends. “I packed like a child who’s going away for the first time. A lemon? A toy? At that hour your brain isn’t working quite right. Part of me thought we’d be home in a few hours.”They evacuated to a nearby parking lot, then another parking lot, then to an acquaintance’s house, and are now at another friend’s house. She learned her family’s house of 12 years was destroyed by looking at aerial photos the next day.“It’s rubble. You’ve seen the pictures — the whole place is rubble,” she said. “It’s been hard, but it ebbs and flows. The community has been wonderful, and we’re all keeping busy. There’s a sense of resiliency. … Life goes on.”This story originally appeared on EdSource.org"

According to Yu, Startup Institute students are trained with skills that can be used to start companies or be part of innovation teams at existing companies.While startup ventures are sprinkled throughout the country, nine out of 10 start-ups backed by venture capitalists are in California, according to PitchBook.“This lack of geographic diversity isn't surprising, but it does mean the other 40-plus states and regions don't get a lot of attention from the tech community,” Dana Olsen writes.The overall picture of the U.S. startup landscape is healthy, according to TechCrunch, as the third quarter of 2017 demonstrates, with new results just released.“Data shows a rise in late-stage funding and a stabilizing early-stage funding environment. At the late stage, U.S. venture investment hit its highest level in five quarters by both round count and total dollars invested. Total investment at the early stage was also at the highest point in the past year,” writes Joanna Glasner.In the third quarter of 2017, there were 791 early-stage startups launched, backed by $8.26 billion in investments, according to Tech Crunch. A total of 225 late stage startups received $11.61 billion in funding.“Overall, venture funding for Q3 of 2017 totaled $21.75 billion, according to Crunchbase projections,” Olsen writes.With this robust landscape for innovation funding, lowering the barriers to entry for everyone is essential. There is enough to go around for everyone.“We want to give people the opportunity to have access,” Yu says, to the innovation dollars and opportunities. Because the playing field is not level and the starting line keeps moving for those who are not well-connected to networks.“The upskilling of labor is a big problem,” she says. “Those who are fortunate to have access to resources can move around.” Others, however, cannot.To fix that accessibility gap, Yu says, “Startup makes it accessible, and gives technical skills, soft skills, a network and an ecosystem of companies.” And that accessibility is then available for non-traditional tech employees, including women, veterans, non-college grads and many more.Yu’s own route to leading Startup Institute began in a traditional way, but diverged because “I realized if I was going to work that hard, I wanted skin in the game. I knew more of what I don’t want than what I want,” Yu says.After graduating from Northwestern in 2002, Yu worked in sales management for a year, moved to operations, then moved into logistics for a Boston-based transportation company. She traveled and worked internationally in Singapore, Hong Kong and throughout China.Deciding to move out of transportation, Yu went to Harvard Business School starting in 2005, finishing in 2007.“It was a humbling experience, as I was one of the youngest there. And it was very transformational,” Yu says.One of her professors introduced her to a later stage startup after graduation and while there, she says she “realized my love for B2B, and went to San Francisco in 2008, working at a large company with pockets of innovation building out alternative business models.”While at that company, she was an advocate for hiring employees with nontraditional backgrounds, specifically candidates who did not have her brand of educational pedigree, or a degree at all.“A lot of companies want to see if you graduated from college,” Yu says. “But I care about how hungry and curious they are. I want to know that you are willing to learn.”Yu says she had to strongly fight for a candidate who was not a college graduate, and got pushback from human resources.“I had one candidate who was fantastic, she was a star, and she had the personality and the perspective.” Yu hired her and she became a stellar employee.In 2012, Yu returned to Harvard for her five-year reunion, and after conversations with her former professors, began working at the Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship at HBS. She left that position in August 2015 to try and decide her next career move.Now back in the Boston area, she became a volunteer mentor for students, then worked as a mentor in residence. And now is Yu is COO.With sights set on the future with diversity in the startup universe, Yu says her goal is to have “companies to sponsor a sales track, for instance, and give opportunities to students and pay for trainings.”Yu acknowledges that is is “hard to build trust on diverse teams,” but says ultimately it is worth it—for the best ideas, the best workplace cultures, and of course, for fairness. Stagnation on diversity in innovation is unnecessary, she says.And what does Yu think about a company culture that does not provide access to all?“That drives me bananas.”This post originally ran in Take The Lead.

The pool report from Yahoo’s Hunter Walker states: “As we rode up Connecticut Avenue, there were several clusters of onlookers. One group cheered the motorcade. A man with a baby on his shoulders waved. Just shy of Tilden Street, several of the riders in the press van reported seeing a man mooning the motorcade from one of the lower floors of an apartment building. One of our colleagues stated it was a full moon.”It’s not clear if Trump witnessed the display.Ironically, the full moon happened just hours after the actual new moon. The mooner has not been identified, but he has plenty of kindred spirits: In February, hundreds of demonstrators mooned the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago."

But she saw no improvement in her condition. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ea0322180000230ddfb706.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This article is part of HuffPost’s Project Zero campaign, a yearlong series on neglected tropical diseases and efforts to fight them.AMAOBU, Nigeria ― When Ndidi Ekeanyawu’s husband saw her severely swollen legs, he would turn away. “He gets angry with me when he sees my leg and says it puts him off me,” she said, gingerly raising her long skirt to show hardened scars covering legs twice their normal size. The 37-year-old mother of two went to a traditional healer in Nigeria’s Imo state. The healer would make cuts all over the swollen flesh, then pour on a tonic that made her legs burn. Someone from her village, Amadou, had told her the method worked, and she feared her husband’s rejection. So, despite the extraordinary pain, Ekeanyawu returned to the healer every fortnight for six years. Ekeanyawu was suffering from a painful and horribly disfiguring disease called lymphatic filariasis ― commonly known as elephantiasis, because it can cause people’s limbs to grow, harden and fold like an elephant’s.The disease is transmitted to and between humans by parasites carried by mosquitoes. Once in the body, the parasites turn into worms that block the lymphatic system, causing fluid to build up in the body’s lower limbs or genitalia. Elephantiasis currently affects an estimated 120 million people worldwide, but 1.1 billion people living across 54 countries are at risk of contracting it.Nigeria is one of the most affected countries in the world, with two-thirds of its 183 million people at risk. But many victims don’t understand that this is a parasitic disease. Instead, they waste precious time and money on alternative therapies, including traditional remedies to try to drain or burn off the fluid and prayers to lift what some people consider a curse.“For elephantiasis, when your limb begins to swell, in the early stages, it looks just like you have a bag of water on your ankle or lower leg,” said Frank Richards, a health expert working for The Carter Center, a U.S. nonprofit run by former President Jimmy Carter that works alongside the Nigerian health ministry to stop the spread of the disease in parts of this country. “It would seem logical that you would do an incision and the water would come out, as though you were popping a balloon,” Richards explained. “That’s not the case, but still people go to traditional healers who are always ready to do an incision, or several incisions, at high cost.”Draining fluid from the limbs by making incisions is not something that even a trained surgeon could master.“If you start cutting, you’re likely to also cut veins and arteries, and the blood starts pouring and you’re set up for getting infections,” Richards said.Ekeanyawu’s fortnightly treatments were physically crippling, with the cuts leaving her so wounded she had to take a motorbike taxi home. But the disease took a greater emotional and financial toll on Ekeanyawu as the 4,000 Naira (roughly $10) treatments fortnightly mounted and the swelling showed no signs of going down.“I complained to the doctor that I didn’t see any improvement, and he kept assuring me that I’d be well,” she said.“My husband is not happy about this whole thing, both how much it costs and how it looks,” she added. Richards said he has often seen “the social and economic disaster that results from people having a leg that swells four to five times its normal size” and plenty of rejection or divorces resulting from this deforming disease.“Elephantiasis is one of the greatest causes of disability in terms of its crippling effect, but unmeasured are the depression and social stigma that go along with it,” he said.“I’ve seen young, beautiful girls with a swollen foot, and you’ll see line after line of incisions of where they’ve gone to traditional healers and a story of: ‘My mother and father have spent everything they could so that I can get married and have a normal life, and nothing worked.’”Once the worms have stretched the lymphatic vessels and fluid has rushed to the lower limbs, causing swelling called lymphedema, there is no way of reversing it. If fluid builds up around the groin, forming a swelling called a hydrocele, it can be removed with surgery.The only way to stop further swelling is to take yearly doses of deworming drugs that kill the baby worms and phase out the parasite as the adults die off, usually after four to six years. “Once the lymphatic system has been destroyed, treating at that point will have little impact, so the purpose is to prevent progression to elephantiasis” by catching cases early, Richards said.Mass distributions of mosquito nets and preventative drugs in highly at-risk communities help stop the disease from spreading. Efforts to bring medicines to everyone in at-risk areas of Nigeria have been carried out since 2000. Organizations like The Carter Center work with the government and community volunteers to get these medications, which are donated by international pharmaceutical companies, to the right people.In October, The Carter Center announced that two Nigerian states with particularly bad elephantiasis problems had managed to eliminate the disease as a public health problem. Earlier this year, Togo became the first sub-Saharan country to fully eliminate the disease within its borders.But there is much work still to be done around the world, and it will require governments, donors and drug companies to do their part. “If the international community can’t come up with 20 percent of the cost to have such a major impact on such an age-old condition that we can do something about, then we will have a huge tragedy that will go down in the annals of history of not caring for our fellow mankind,” Richards said.“The next generations, ad infinitum, should not have to worry about swollen legs and elephantoid changes that are so terrible to behold.”Ekeanyawu’s chance meeting with doctors from The Carter Center, who were visiting a neighbor with elephantiasis, finally put an end to six years of trauma and confusion over her condition. They took her to a clinic with her two daughters to get examined and receive the right drugs.“This has really affected my life, physically and emotionally,” she said. “Now, I will make sure my daughters take these medicines.”The Carter Center is a recipient of grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which also partly funds Project Zero.

Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) a liar keeps backfiring.,2017-10-20,The White House has accused Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) of lying twice and has now been proven wrong twice.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ea18081500009b157469ce.jpeg?cache=bSgVHQsRAT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) took a victory lap in her feud with President Donald Trump after the White House was caught falsely maligning her for the second time this week.Twice this week the White House accused Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) of lying and each time the facts have vindicated her version of events.Most recently, evidence emerged disproving an accusation by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly that Wilson had gloated over securing funds for an FBI building in her district.Earlier this week, Wilson escalated a political firestorm over President Donald Trump’s response to the deaths of four American military service members in Niger.After bragging of his willingness to call the families of fallen troops, Trump spoke with the loved ones of the most recent casualties, including Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, and a constituent of Wilson’s.Wilson, who was with Johnson when Trump called and heard the conversation on speakerphone, said Tuesday that Trump had told Johnson that her husband “must’ve known what he signed up for.” The comments during a condolence call, Wilson said, showed that Trump has “no feelings for anyone.”Trump responded the following morning by alleging that Wilson “totally fabricated” the conversation and claiming he had “proof” that her version of events was not true.Then, on Thursday, La David Johnson’s mother Cowanda Jones-Johnson, who said she was also present during the call, corroborated Wilson’s version of events.“Yes, the statement is true,” Jones-Johnson said. “I was in the car and I heard the full conversation.”Caught in a lie, the White House, which had never offered evidence to contradict Wilson’s description, quickly shifted its public relations strategy. In remarks to the White House press corps on Thursday, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly suggested that Trump spoke appropriately.Kelly, whose own son died serving in Afghanistan, recalled his son’s commanding officer saying something similar.“He knew what he was getting himself into,” Kelly said, quoting his son’s commanding officer. “It was exactly where he wanted to be. That was the message.” But in keeping with Trump’s relentless combat with critics, Kelly could not resist taking another false potshot at Wilson.As part of a larger attempt to paint Wilson as a political showboat, Kelly alleged that Wilson had taken credit for securing the federal funding for the construction of a new FBI building in Miramar, Florida. Kelly was present at the 2015 ceremony dedicating the building in his capacity as head of the U.S. military’s Southern Command.“A congresswoman stood up, and in a long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there in all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call, he gave the money, the $20 million, to build the building, and she sat down,” Kelly said.Here too, Kelly was either gravely mistaken or deliberately lying.The legislation allotting the federal funds for the creation of the building passed Congress in 2010, shortly before Wilson began her first term in office, McClatchy reported on Friday.Instead, Wilson drew praise at the ceremony from Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.) and then-FBI director James Comey for pushing through legislation naming the buildings after two deceased FBI agents.Wilson during her ceremony speech took credit for ensuring that the buildings were named after the agents, but not for securing the funding, according to a video of the event obtained by the Sun-Sentinel.CORRECTION: This article initially identified Cowanda Jones-Johnson as Sgt.

For oil we don’t need?”",2017-10-20,"Parts of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, in northeastern Alaska, are thought to contain more than 10 billion barrels of oil.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e96907150000510d7468b5.jpeg?cache=gcUekirasz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Almost every Senate Republican voted Thursday to block an amendment that would have protected a swath of the Alaskan Arctic from oil exploration, flouting attempts from Democrats and environmental groups to keep the region under government protection.Democrats, led by Sen. Maria Cantwell (Wash.), were attempting to attach an amendment to the chamber’s budget plan that would bar drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which covers more than 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska. The region, described by the state’s tourism bureau as one of Alaska’s crown jewels, is home to polar bears, caribou, moose and hundreds of species of migratory birds.“The notion that we, tonight, after 60-plus years, would give up what is a biologically important area, a critical habitat for polar bears, a breeding ground for caribou, migratory birds and over 200 species ― for what? For oil we don’t need?” Cantwell said on the Senate floor Thursday, according to The Hill.Republicans, including Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have pushed to allow the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee (which Murkowski chairs) to pass legislation to raise $1 billion over the next decade. While a provision including the ANWR ― as the Arctic reserve is known ― isn’t explicit, environmental groups say government revenue from drilling permits in a portion of the refuge is a likely source to raise such money.“Those who would support this amendment will deny us the opportunity to do something constructive in this country, when it comes to our opportunities to produce energy, to produce wealth,” Murkowski said. Parts of the ANWR that could be opened for drilling are thought to hold 10.3 billion barrels of oil, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.The amendment was voted down, 52 to 48. Democrat Joe Manchin (W.Va.) was the sole member of his party to vote against it, and Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) was the lone Republican in support. A bill to open up drilling in the ANWR would require only a 51-majority vote in the Senate since it is in the budget plan, rather than the 60 votes needed for most legislation, making the prospects of such a decision far easier. “Republicans are trying to use the budget process to ram through drilling in the crown jewel of America’s wildlife refuge system because they know they don’t have the votes to do so through regular order,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said in a statement. “Republicans are moving forward with a budget that includes this poison pill to hand over the wildest place left in America to Big Oil. This is nothing more than fossil fuel folly.”Environmental groups were livid after the amendment’s defeat.“Right now polar bear mothers are preparing to hibernate and give birth on the coastal plain in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,” Jamie Rappaport Clark, president of Defenders of Wildlife, said in a statement. “Already contending with climate change, today’s vote casts their future into even greater doubt. Hundreds of bird species, as well as a vast caribou herd, muskoxen and wolves also stand to lose from drilling in the refuge. Enough already.” “The budget passed by the Senate today sets in motion a sellout of some of our most iconic public lands and waters to the highest bidder, in order to fund tax breaks for billionaires,” Trip Van Noppen, president of the environmental group Earthjustice, said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to use the budget reconciliation process to pass a divisive and controversial proposal that would lead us in the wrong direction on climate.”The Washington Post noted in September that the Trump administration was looking at the ANWR as a source of oil revenue. An internal memo laid out plans to lift restrictions on seismic studies in the refuge, which has been closed to such oil exploration for decades.“This is a really big deal,” Niel Lawrence, Alaska director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, told The New York Times in September. “This is a frontal attack in an ideological battle. The Arctic is the holy grail.”"

21,POLITICS,Progressives' Anger Over Key Committee Appointments Roils Democratic Party Meeting,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-perez-ousts-keith-ellison-loyalists_us_59ea6a44e4b0a484d0634a08,Officials who backed Rep. Keith Ellison over Tom Perez were removed from crucial posts.,2017-10-20,Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez is facing criticism for ousting backers of his former DNC rival.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ea6ad5140000610d8c8eeb.jpeg?cache=VC4aSofLY6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Members of the left wing of the Democratic Party are furious at Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez for removing party officials who backed Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison’s chairmanship bid from key party committees.“It’s a slap in the face to the activists in the party that are working so hard to make the party more responsive to the grassroots,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, a digital grassroots group. “The idea that you’re going to purge Ellison supporters and bring the party together doesn’t make any sense at all.”Becky Bond, founder of Knock Every Door and a veteran of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Democratic presidential campaign, argued that the decision to remove Ellison surrogates puts Ellison, whom Perez brought on as deputy DNC chairman, in a “really hard place.”“Ellison is someone who is the voice of the activists and grassroots of the Democratic Party,” Bond said. “If the grassroots feel Ellison is being ignored, that’s going to read that our priorities are being ignored.”Ahead of the DNC’s first meeting under Perez’s leadership, which began Thursday in Las Vegas, Perez released his roster of 75 at-large DNC members as well as appointments to key DNC committees.Activists immediately noticed that four Ellison supporters either lost their at-large posts or spots on influential committees. James Zogby, president of the Arab-American Institute and a top Sanders backer, was removed from the Executive Committee, which has major budgetary authority. Ray Buckley, the New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman who earned praise for treating Sanders fairly, lost spots on both the DNC Executive Committee and the Rules and Bylaws Committee, which regulates the party presidential primary.(Buckley endorsed Ellison for chair after ending his own bid to lead the organization.) Barbara Casbar Siperstein, the DNC’s first transgender member, was removed from the Executive Committee and the DNC at-large roster. Alice Germond, who worked as a secretary for the DNC for decades, lost her at-large DNC spot as well.Of the four, at least one regained a top post through other means. Buckley picked up a spot on the Executive Committee on Friday afternoon, after members of the DNC’s Eastern Caucus elected him to represent them on the influential body. A bid by Zogby to do the same was unsuccessful.For the broad camp of progressive Democrats (mainly Ellison or Sanders supporters) concerned about making the party more accountable to the grassroots and bringing in more independents, seats on the Rules Committee are especially prized.Many activists felt that the DNC inappropriately put a finger on the scale for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary, and now worry that it will not adopt a fairer process in 2020. The Rules Committee is charged with considering the recommendations of the DNC’s Unity and Reform Commission, a panel convened to reform the presidential nominating process that will present its slate of suggestions by the end of the year. (The commission consists of 10 Clinton appointees, eight Sanders appointees and three Perez picks.)Reformers hope that the party will accept a dramatically reduced role for superdelegates ― the party officials who can vote in presidential primaries independent of the will of the primary voters in their state ― as well make it easier for independents to participate in primaries and other party functions.“I don’t know what the Rules Committee is going to do,” Bond said of their forthcoming assessment of the Unity Commission’s recommendations. “But I know that there are five Clinton-appointed Unity Commission members on the Rules Committee and no Bernie-appointed ones now that Perez has shaken it up.”Of course, the power of the Rules Committee is a matter of debate. Regardless of how the Rules Committee votes on the Unity and Reform Commission recommendations, the panel’s recommendations are subject to a vote among the entire voting DNC membership.Perez’s critics have been piqued that the DNC responded to these concerns by highlighting the racial, ethnic, gender and sexual identity diversity of the broader at-large roster.“This slate doubles millennial and Native American at-large representation, provides unprecedented representation for our allies in the labor community, and increases the presence of Puerto Rican at-large members at a time when the Trump administration refuses to take responsibility for the millions of Americans who are still suffering through a major humanitarian crisis,” DNC spokesman Michael Tyler told NBC News in response to the criticism.The DNC’s response obfuscates the more critical question of who sits on key committees and the need to represent reform-minded people of all races and backgrounds in positions of influence, according to progressive critics.“It’s not only misdirection, but it’s also divisive,” Jane Kleeb, an Ellison supporter and chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said of the diversity retort. “It continues to paint the Bernie people as not caring about our native and Latino and black brothers and sisters, which is complete nonsense.”The anger at this particular line of attack came to a head at an Executive Committee meeting Friday when Karen Carter Peterson, the DNC’s vice chair of civic engagement and voter participation, accused Ellison loyalists of plotting to remove black women from party leadership and replace them with a less diverse slate of at-large members. Ellison and Zogby rose to deny that. “The progressive DNC members were absolutely not strategizing to remove these black women from the DNC,” said Yasmine Taeb, a Virginia Democratic National Committee member. “We want to make sure that the DNC is inclusive of everyone from all of the wings of the party whether that means inclusivity of ideas and thoughts or race and other backgrounds.”“We hope all of the other DNC members agree with us,” Taeb added. “We support Chairman Perez’s mission in trying to empower diverse Democrats.”Ellison’s office declined to comment for the story.An Ellison spokesman told NBC News, however, that some of Ellison’s suggestions for party leadership positions were accepted “and some were not.”DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa rejected the idea that Ellison supporters are not represented on key committees. Hinojosa noted that the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee includes five people who backed Ellison’s bid for the DNC chairmanship: Nevada union official Artie Blanco; AFSCME president Lee Saunders; American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten; Indiana Democratic Party chairman John Zody; and Florida Democratic Party chairman Stephen Bittel.The DNC does not look at presidential primary preferences when making committee assignments, Hinojosa added. “There will always be small things that seem controversial and attempts to take us back to the 2016 primary, but Democrats from all parts of the party are thinking about how best to win in 2017 and beyond,” Hinojosa said. The fuss over Perez’s appointments is the latest flare-up of a long-simmering dispute in the Democratic Party between progressive reformers and establishmentarians.Political observers frequently boil the internecine battle down to a replay of the contentious primary conflict between Clinton and Sanders in 2016.There is, of course, some truth to this characterization. Ellison, who endorsed Sanders in 2016, had the support of many Clinton backers in his bid to chair the DNC, but the excitement behind his campaign was always driven by progressives associated with the Sanders campaign. His supporters saw his bid as an opportunity for the party to correct its mistakes from the 2016 election and embrace grassroots populism ― and they resented the intervention of figures like former President Barack Obama on behalf of Perez.When Perez won in February, he immediately sought to assuage progressive skepticism by naming Ellison as his deputy.Now some supporters wonder how far Perez’s commitment to Ellison’s agenda goes.“Keith has been one heck of a loyal foot soldier,” Chamberlain said. “He has been shafted over and over again by a chair that appears to be incompetent at coalition politics.”Rather than come down to a conflict between supporters of different candidates, the debate is now between supporters of all politicians who want to wipe corporate influence out of the party and those who do not, according to Bond, who is also a former leader of Credo, a leading progressive online activism group.“You’re seeing it break down much more along issue lines: People who believe we need to be the party that stands up for a $15 minimum wage, single payer health care; that stands up for a strong real message on racial and economic justice that comes with actions that back it up,” Bond said.Last week, Perez rankled many of these anti-corporate Democrats by appointing Dan Halpern, a former chairman of the Georgia Restaurant Association and past board member of the National Restaurant Association, as a deputy finance chair of the DNC.The Georgia Restaurant Association and the National Restaurant Association have both opposed increases in the minimum wage, leading to charges that Perez had appointed a minimum wage opponent to a top fundraising post. But in his capacity as CEO of Jackmont Hospitality, an Atlanta, Georgia-based foodservice company, Halpern has publicly expressed support for an increase in the federal minimum wage. Joe Dinkin, national communications director of the Working Families Party, mentioned Halpern’s appointment in a broader criticism of Perez’s recent decisions.“For the sake of the nation, the DNC should reverse course, spend less time courting big donors and more time bringing progressives voices into the party instead of silencing them,” he said.Still other Democrats argue that the divide within the party is less about ideological differences than it is a fight between incumbents wary of threats to their power and reformers eager to open the party up to newcomers.“Are you interested in changing how the party operates? Because that’s then how we recruit and engage grassroots Democrats into our party,” said Kleeb, who also sits on the board of Our Revolution, the legacy organization of the Sanders campaign. ”Independents, who we need to win, are looking at our party and saying we want you guys to change things.”One thing seems indisputable: This is not the debate the party wants to be having just weeks before key legislative and gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia.The stakes are especially high in Virginia, where Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) is running for governor of a state where Clinton defeated Trump by 5 percentage points. The latest polling shows him neck-and-neck with Republican Ed Gillespie.Bond expressed hope that Perez would mend fences with progressive activists sooner rather than later.“Perez still has time to show to the grassroots that he’s listening to people like Keith Ellison and that he is respecting and listening to the priorities of the grassroots,” she said."
22,ENTERTAINMENT,Boyz II Men On The Secret To Their Success,Lauren Moraski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/boyz-ii-men-on-the-secret-to-their-success_us_59ea1a42e4b0f9d35bca4706,The trio also chimes in on where all the vocal groups have gone.,2017-10-20,"Nathan Morris, Shawn Stockman and Wanya Morris of Boyz II Men attend Build Series on Oct. 19, 2017, in New York.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ea1ef91500009b157469e0.jpeg?cache=rd4hNcigaN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Boyz II Men are still going strong ― an impressive 26 years after releasing their debut album, “Cooleyhighharmony.” And they show no signs of slowing down. They recently extended their Las Vegas residency through 2018 and just came out with a new album of doo-wop classics called “Under the Streetlight.” The Grammy-winning group that rose to fame in the ’90s with the hits “End of the Road” and “Motownphilly” credit some of their longtime success to having a broad appeal. At their Vegas shows, Nathan Morris, Shawn Stockman and Wanya Morris attract a diverse audience ― ranging from ages 5 to 75. The trio doesn’t necessarily fit into one category or appeal to a specific demographic, something that Stockman says has been both “a gift and a curse” over the years. This particularly came into play when they first got their start, with Jheryl Busby at the helm of their label, Motown Records. “When we first started and we came out with our first album, even our [record label] president at the time didn’t really understand why we were selling so many records,” Stockman told HuffPost at Build Series. “We were like, ‘Listen, everybody comes to these shows.’ And he was like, ‘I don’t believe you.’ He would have to actually come to the concert to see the actual people.”And that hasn’t changed.“You have black, white and every other color in between ... We’ve never been a black group, and we’ve never been just a pop group,” he said. “We appeal to everybody ... So it was kind of frustrating for the record labels, but on the side of us, it was fun, because everybody would come and we were happy with that.”The fans are still filling the seats for Boyz II Men, but today, fewer new singing groups are making it as big. Boyz II Men have some theories about why that might be the case.“The daunting thing about the business is that you have to dredge through so much stuff to get to the music ... to get to good music in general,” Stockman said, citing a few acts that stand out to him: H.E.R. and Daniel Caesar. Wanya Morris says he’s aware of a couple of vocal groups making small waves online, but not on a national scale. “It’s a selfish world. Everybody’s trying to get there. And when it comes to a group it takes so long to get to a group that it tears them apart,” he said, recalling an act he really liked called Imprint. “It took so long for them to find a place in this industry that the group disbanded, which is not a good thing because they were dope. They could have done things.”Nathan Morris echoed those sentiments, noting, “That’s always the problem with most groups. They don’t believe in the group first. They’ll sing together. They’ll sound great together. They’ll take all the accolades, but when things don’t go well the group is not what’s important. It’s, ’how do I get out of this?′ Or, ‘how do I figure it out?’ And they wind up going other places.”For Boyz II Men, there doesn’t seem to be an end of the road coming any time soon. Although their new album pays homage to their influences with throwback classics such as “Up On the Roof” and “Why Do Fools Fall In Love,” they’re keeping things current, too. The new set features a slate of guest artists, including Brian McKnight, Take 6 and Amber Riley. And Boyz II Men say they’re open to more collaborations down the line, and of course, recording new music. “Today it’s really tough for groups and artists to stay together and just stay focused on agenda,” said Nathan. “In this day and age when things change so rapidly it’s really hard for people to stay focused on one thing. We hope that longevity is a lesson that can be taught to a lot of different artists.”For more from Boyz II Men, watch the entire Build interview below. "
23,POLITICS,Houston Suburb Conditions Hurricane Relief Money On Residents' Vow Not To Boycott Israel,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dickinson-texas-hurricane-harvey-israel-bds_us_59ea2e0fe4b00f08619e9776,"Residents in Dickinson, Texas, who were affected by Hurricane Harvey may be ineligible for money to rebuild their homes because of their political beliefs.",2017-10-20,A snapshot of the relevant boycott section of the application is shown.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ea2f401500009b15746a12.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A suburb outside of Houston is requiring residents who were affected by Hurricane Harvey to certify that they do not boycott Israel in order to apply for grant money to rebuild their home or business. Dickinson, Texas, located alongside a bayou about 30 miles southeast of Houston, suffered extensive damage during the hurricane that tore through the area two months ago. Half of the city’s 20,000 residents were impacted, and the storm caused serious damage to more than 7,000 homes and 88 businesses, according to local police reports.On Monday, the city posted a three-page application for grant money on its website. The application requires residents to commit to using the money to repair their damaged homes or businesses, to follow all building codes and to verify that they do not boycott Israel. “It’s completely unreasonable,” said Ayesha Khan, a UTHealth PhD student who has been active in rebuilding and recovery efforts in Houston, and an organizer in the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement.“This can prolong the time it will take to rebuild homes,” she said. “It’s institutionalized in a way that can impact families that are still homeless.”Dickinson Mayor Julie Masters told HuffPost that her office has been “inundated” with angry phone calls and emails about the anti-BDS language in the grant application. When Dickinson’s city attorney recommended including the Israel boycott clause, Masters thought, “God, this kind of feels like it’s infringing on free speech,” she said. But she said city officials also didn’t feel like they had much of a choice in the matter. The Israel boycott provision in Dickinson’s application is a strict interpretation of a Texas state law passed earlier this year that prohibits state agencies from contracting with companies that boycott Israel. Dickinson applicants have to agree to act as an “independent contractor” in order to receive grant money from the city. Masters said she spoke with officials in the Texas attorney general’s office on Friday about clarifying the language in the state law so that the anti-boycott provision would only apply to contracts on the state level. The American Civil Liberties Union argues that the Texas law is unconstitutional and is asking anyone who was forced to choose between signing the Dickinson application and forgoing hurricane relief money to contact the group’s Texas chapter. “The Supreme Court ruled decades ago that political boycotts are protected by the First Amendment, and other decisions have established that the government may not require individuals to sign a certification regarding their political expression in order to obtain employment, contracts, or other benefits,” the ACLU wrote in a statement, referring to a 1982 decision that ruled that an NAACP boycott of a white-owned business in Mississippi was a protected form of free association and expression. The ACLU is currently representing a Mennonite school teacher in Kansas who was denied an employment opportunity after refusing to certify that she does not boycott Israeli products.Because the Texas law was enacted recently, it is not yet clear how the state or cities will enforce the anti-BDS measure.The primary purpose of the law is to “scare people away” from participating in “protected First Amendment activity,” Brian Hauss, an ACLU staff attorney said. Residents who are dependent on city funding to rebuild their homes and are worried about certifying something that isn’t true on a government document could decide it’s easiest to abstain from boycotting Israeli products, he said.Texas is one of more than a dozen states that have passed laws in the last several years aimed at combating the BDS movement against Israel. Congress is also considering a bill that would make it a felony for Americans to boycott Israel.Proponents of the BDS movement say it is a non-violent way to protest Israel’s decades-long occupation of the Palestinian territories. But critics of the movement describe it as an anti-Semitic effort to delegitimize Israel.“Anti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said when he signed the bill into law in May.The ACLU is not aware of any Texas cities other than Dickinson that have conditioned hurricane relief funding on vowing not to boycott Israel. But several cities, including San Antonio, Galveston, and Austin, have inserted anti-BDS clauses in their contracting documents.This story has been updated to include comment from Dickinson’s mayor."

And because of that fragmentation the full magnitude of the problem simply wasn’t visible to most people.”This study examined the affects of pollutants on a global basis, and, critically, involved economists from the very beginning to help “translate scientific findings into public policy.”“If you don’t put a dollar value on your findings,” Landrigan said, “if you can’t show the minister of finance in a particular country that pollution is costing his country money and dragging his economy down... it’s not sufficient to move the needle.”The study found that in 2015 one in six premature deaths could be directly attributed to pollution, with 92 percent of those deaths ― adding up to 9 million ― occurring in low- and middle-income countries. That’s around 16 percent of all global deaths.Aside from the obvious humanitarian burden of those premature deaths, they also take a very real economic toll as well. The study calculated the global cost of pollution at $4.6 trillion per year, equivalent to 6.2 percent of the global economic output.“What people don’t realize is that pollution does damage to economies,” Richard Fuller, the head of Pure Earth, an international nonprofit that studies pollution impacts in low- and middle-income countries, told the AP. “People who are sick or dead cannot contribute to the economy,” he said, adding that sick people also often require the care of others, which adds additional cost.Worldwide, air pollution is by far the biggest contributor to premature deaths. In developing countries, contaminated water is the second-largest contributor, followed by workplace exposures, then soil, chemicals, and metals: It’s not all bad news, however. Landrigan said the study found developing countries shouldn’t sell out their population’s health to achieve economic prosperity. On the contrary, curbing pollution and implementing more stringent environmental laws in those countries will likely help them become more prosperous.And unlike many health crises, like the AIDS epidemic, where the answer isn’t immediately attainable, many sources of pollution can be easily diagnosed and remedied.“The claim that pollution control stifles economic growth and that poor countries must pass through a phase of pollution and disease on the road to prosperity has repeatedly been proven to be untrue,” the report reads.Major sources of pollution identified in the report include electricity-generating plants, chemical manufacturing facilities, mining operations, deforestation, coal combustion and petroleum-powered vehicles.Further, Landrigan added that in addressing localized emissions on the city and country level, the world as a whole stands to benefit as they’re a substantial contributors to global climate change.“Actions to control one will help control the other,” he said. And it’s critical we take action on both for our near and longterm health. “Pollution is killing people here and now; the big deaths from climate change will come in the next century.”The report comes amid the Trump administration’s dramatic rollback of environmental regulations that advocates say risk exacerbating public health issues.Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency moved to eliminate the Clean Power Plan, a set of Obama-era regulations that put strict limits on carbon emissions from coal-fired plants. Health advocates said that scrapping the rules, which never went into effect, would have reduced asthma and other respiratory illnesses.In June, the agency put a two-year pause on regulations to reduce emissions from oil an gas operators, despite acknowledging that pollution from the leaks results in “disproportionate” harm to children.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced on Thursday afternoon he will not be attending and speaking at the Women’s Convention in Detroit, Mich. Instead, Sanders is heading to Puerto Rico to offer aid after Hurricane Maria. “I want to apologize to the organizers of the Women’s Convention for not being able to attend your conference next Friday in Detroit,” Sanders said in a statement. “Given the emergency situation in Puerto Rico, I will be traveling there to visit with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and other officials to determine the best way forward to deal with the devastation the island is experiencing.”Sanders congratulated the Women’s March organizers and gave best wishes for a successful conference. A few hour after Sanders’ announcement, the Women’s March organizers released a statement on Twitter, writing: “We were grateful that Senator Sanders had accepted our invitation to continue his longstanding record of support and allyship for women leaders... We understand his leadership is needed in Puerto Rico and, as always, we deeply appreciate his commitment to communities in need.” The Women’s March received backlash last week after announcing that Sanders would be the conference’s opening night speaker on Friday, Oct. 27. Many people criticized the Women’s March’s choice to start a women’s empowerment event with a male speaker. One critic created a petition to remove Sanders from kicking off the Women’s Convention and received over 1,300 signatures in support. Others noted that Sanders’ campaigned last year on behalf of a Democratic mayoral candidate in Omaha, Nebraska who is anti-abortion. “We have got to appreciate where people come from, and do our best to fight for the pro-choice agenda,” Sanders said to NPR in response to criticism. “But I think you just can’t exclude people who disagree with us on one issue.”Convention leaders countered critics, pointing out that the weekend’s program included 60 women speakers and just two men. They also added that Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Ca.) was the keynote speaker and her now-iconic “reclaiming my time” line is the theme of the entire weekend. Two days after the initial announcement about Sanders, Women’s March apologized for any pain they had caused and clarified that women’s voices are absolutely playing the central role in the convention. Sanders was slated to appear on a Friday night panel before bowing out of the convention altogether this week. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mi.) took Sanders’ place as the opening night speaker on Friday night, and Rep. Waters will be speaking on Saturday during the Women’s Convention weekend. "

Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) said earlier this week that she heard Trump offer the statement during a phone call between the president and Myeshia Johnson, the pregnant widow of slain Army Sgt. La David Johnson. The fallen soldier’s mother confirmed Wilson’s account.Trump said in a tweet that the congresswoman’s claim was “totally fabricated,” while his spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, later seemed to imply the comment was accurately reported but had been taken the wrong way. Fifty-four percent of the Americans surveyed say the comment was inappropriate. Just 10 percent find the remark appropriate, while 23 percent say they don’t believe Trump made that comment. The rest are unsure.Americans say by a 7-point margin, 44 percent to 37 percent, that they believe Trump respects the military. They’re more evenly split on his role as commander in chief, with 40 percent saying he has used the military responsibly and 36 percent that he’s done so irresponsibly.Among those who say they or an immediate family member has served in the military or is currently serving, 46 percent consider Trump’s reported comment inappropriate, 12 percent think it’s appropriate, and 30 percent don’t believe he said it. Fifty-five percent of those people say they believe Trump respects the military, with just over half saying he has used it responsibly.Voters who supported Trump in last year’s election are 85 points likelier than those who backed Hillary Clinton to say that Trump respects the military, and 80 points likelier to find his use of the armed forces responsible.A near-universal 92 percent of Clinton voters think it was inappropriate for Trump to say the deceased soldier “knew what he signed up for,” while the majority of Trump voters, 56 percent, believe he never said that.The attack in Niger has remained largely under the radar. Just 19 percent of Americans say they’ve heard a lot about the four U.S. soldiers who were killed there earlier this month, and a third say they’ve heard nothing at all.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 18-19 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

The federal government alleged that the trio was plotting an attack for Nov. 9, one day after the 2016 presidential election, that would “wake people up.” Their militia group, referred to as “the Crusaders,” was described as an organization that espoused “sovereign citizen, anti-government, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrant extremist beliefs.” Many of them traded in anti-Muslim rhetoric online, and some were vocally supportive of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.U.S. District Judge Eric Melgren ruled on Friday that Wright should be held ahead of his trial, saying he faced serious charges and a potential life sentence and was a flight risk.“The charges against Wright include serious acts of violence and mass murder,” Melgren said. “The evidence suggests that Wright was deeply involved in the planning of these atrocities, and intended to carry out the plan to fruition. In the eyes of the Court, there are very few charges more serious than a charge of planning to commit an act of terrorism, because that conduct undermines the very fabric of our society.”Melgren said that the evidence against Wright is “relatively strong” and made potential convictions and imprisonment a “significant” possibility.“Wright has been charged with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction against people and property within the United States,” Melgren wrote. “Specifically, the Government alleges that Wright and his co-defendants planned to use an improvised explosive device to destroy an apartment complex and mosque in Garden City, Kansas. The complex contains more than 100 units and is home to many Muslims of the Somali refugee community. The group, known as ‘the Crusaders,’ intended to accomplish this goal by obtaining four vehicles, filling them with explosives (made from aluminum powder and ammonium nitrate, amongst other components), and parking them at the four corners of the apartment complex to create a large explosion. Simply put, these allegations against Wright indicate a strong threat to society.”An attorney for Wright had argued that he only believed he was involved in “mere puffery and the venting of frustration” rather than an actual plot to kill Muslim immigrants. The lawyer argued that Wright was a “good, law-abiding man, who may be a not-so-good judge of character” who had exercised his First Amendment rights in way that was “distasteful but understandable given his loneliness.”The attorney said Wright was part of a group that “feared that then-President Obama was corrupt and in league with the Muslim Brotherhood” and that the “United Nations, China and Cuba were formulating an invasion of the United States that would have to be repelled by American partisans, such as themselves.”The group, the attorney wrote, “feared that then-President Obama would declare martial law if Donald Trump won the election. They feared massive social unrest would occur regardless of the outcome of the presidential election of 2016.” Ultimately, the judge was swayed by evidence from the government, which included recorded conversations, text messages and information obtained by an undercover FBI employee as well as a confidential FBI source. Judge Melgren said that Wright had “expressed extreme hatred and threatened violence against Muslims” and “expressed his desire to kill Muslims via a variety of different methods.” Wright, he said, “did more than simply vocalize his desire to murder Muslims” by taking an “active role in planning an actual attack on actual people.” A trial in the case is currently scheduled for Feb. 20, 2018.Read the judge’s order below.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

The mom and psychologist has developed a line of empathy cards, T-shirts and more through her #IHadAMiscarriage campaign. In honor of Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month this year, Zucker released a line of art prints focusing on one issue around this topic: how we talk about the early stages of pregnancy. “We zero in on the age-old notion that women should wait to share their pregnancy news until they are ‘out of the woods’ after the first trimester,” Zucker told HuffPost. “This recommendation/statement essentially translates into: ‘don’t share your good news in case it becomes bad news so that you won’t have to share the bad news.’ We need to rethink this conceptualization of sharing our news in an effort to bolster support for women in pregnancy, no matter the outcome.”She continued, “In so doing, we will loosen cultures grip on grief and encourage women to share their news whenever they desire. Plus, for those of us who have experienced later losses, we know too well that ‘out of the woods’ is a construct that doesn’t apply.”Zucker teamed up with artists like Kimothy Joy to create prints around this idea and give the pregnancy loss community a tangible item for support and encouragement. The prints are available for free download at her online shop.Zucker’s work around this topic is inspired by her job, as well as well as her own miscarriage experience in 2012 “As a psychologist that specializes in women’s reproductive and maternal mental health, I hear a lot about the isolation and loneliness that can accompany pregnancy/infant loss,” she explained. “After my 16-week miscarriage, I too experienced a sense of isolation firsthand.”The goal of the #IHadAMiscarriage campaign is to tackle that silence and sense of shame around loss and broaden society’s understanding of grief. “Keeping our pregnancy news secret might contribute to the resounding stigma, as it is basically sets women up to stuff their grief and be silent about their pain should they lose their pregnancy,” said Zucker. “My hope in encouraging us to rethink this construct is that women will relish connection and community during pregnancy, despite its outcome.”Although Zucker wants people to rethink this practice of waiting to share pregnancy news, she emphasized that it’s about choice. “Every woman can decide for herself when she openly talks about her pregnancy,” said the psychologist. “If someone is inclined to wait until the second trimester to share, she should maintain that privacy. However, if others would like to share sooner, that’s okay too.”Zucker added, “The point is really to look at what we are conveying when we encourage women to wait to share. If we don’t share our joy in case it becomes grief, this situates a woman to mourn quietly. On the other hand, if we provide the statistical facts about miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant loss and leave it up to her who and when she shares, then we disband the culture of silent grief.”With her free art prints, she hopes to empower women, their loved ones and healthcare providers by sparking conversations among peers and validating mothers who didn’t want to remain silent in their first trimester. Said Zucker “I wanted to illuminate that joy and grief sometimes live side by side. There needn’t be isolation in either.”"

Tragically, it has also",2017-10-20,<p>Rep. Terri Sewell (D-AL) attended Princeton with the help of a Perkins Loan</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ea2b61140000650d8c8e1a.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In today’s highly competitive global economy, a college education has never been more important. Tragically, it has also never been more unaffordable.Just this month, Congress allowed the Perkins Loan program to expire, potentially eliminating one of the most important federal student loan programs for low-income families. And Congress’s failure couldn’t come at a worse time for our nation’s students.A new study this year shows that a full 95 percent of colleges are completely unaffordable for students from low-income households. For them, the existence of the Perkins Loan program can mean the difference between earning a college degree and never having a shot at a higher education.I know because it was a Perkins Loan that gave me a shot to be who I am today. My parents were both public school educators. My dad was a high school basketball coach and my mom was a librarian. Together, they gave me a hunger for learning, and I remember spending countless hours in the library reading through books that brought to life all of the places I wanted to travel someday. But my family did not have the resources to send me to college on their own.It was the Perkins Loan program that gave me my chance to seek a higher education at Princeton University and eventually to go on to Harvard Law School. Offering the lowest-interest rate student loans I could receive, the Perkins Loan gave me a chance to afford the education that helped me chase my dreams.And after graduating, I paid back every dollar I received through the Perkins Loan program. For me, the Perkins Loan I received meant everything, but for taxpayers, it cost nothing.I am not the only student whose achievements were made possible by the Perkins Loan. Today, half a million students nationwide rely on the Perkins Loan to afford college. For them, the program provides a pathway not only to a higher education, but to competitive jobs in today’s economy.Unlike other student loan programs, Perkins Loans are administered directly by colleges and universities which counsel their students through repayment. These schools tailor the program to fit their borrowers’ and institutions’ situations. Most importantly, the Perkins Loan program targets support to students who wouldn’t otherwise have the chance to attend college. Studies show that more than a third of dependent Perkins Loan borrowers are from families with a household income under $30,000.For taxpayers, the Perkins Loan is a good deal. Since students repay their loans after earning their higher education, the program is largely self-sustaining. In fact, Congress hasn’t had to appropriate new federal money for the program for more than a decade except for reimbursements to schools when graduates qualify for loan forgiveness.But because the program expired this September, Congress has to act now to save the Perkins Loan program. Without an extension, 1,700 colleges and universities may soon be required to return billions of dollars in federal grants they received more than a decade ago under the program, eliminating their ability to help students today.The last time Congress reauthorized the Perkins Loan, it was a bipartisan effort. A Republican House, a Republican Senate, and a Democratic President came together to pass a two-year extension of the student loan program.Today, that same spirit and action is needed here in Washington. Since coming to Congress, I have made job growth and economic competitiveness in my home state top priorities. In today’s global marketplace, the ability of my constituents to compete in a global economy depends on access to education, and extending the Perkins student loan program is an easy step towards that goal.For students like me, who dreamed big but never had the resources themselves to attend college, saving the Perkins Loan requires Congress’s immediate attention. As students across the country struggle to afford an increasingly essential higher education, inaction is inexcusable."

He now awaits confirmation by the full Senate. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Friday that he wasn’t sure when Farr’s vote would be scheduled.Civil rights groups and the Congressional Black Caucus are outraged by Farr’s nomination, claiming he has built a 38-year legal career on restricting voting rights and stripping protections from people of color.Farr, 62, defended North Carolina’s sweeping voter suppression law passed in 2013, one of the most restrictive in the country. The law required voters to present government-issued photo IDs in order to cast a ballot, shortened the early voting period and eliminated same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting. Farr represented the state before the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016, arguing that the law “was not a nefarious thing.” But the court ultimately struck down the law that year, saying it targeted African Americans “with almost surgical precision” and noted the law’s correlation with data showing voting methods African Americans were most likely to use. Farr appealed to the Supreme Court, but the high court declined to hear his case.Farr also defended a number of the state’s redistricting maps that were rejected by federal courts for being racially discriminatory. As Mother Jones’ Ari Berman reported, the Supreme Court struck down two of the state’s congressional districts because the legislature had “packed black voters into heavily minority districts in order to reduce the influence of minorities in adjoining districts held by white Republicans.” A lower court also struck down 28 state legislative districts for discriminating against black voters.When civil rights groups sued North Carolina in 2015 for violating the National Voter Registration Act, better known as the “motor voter” law, Farr defended the state in court once again. The lawsuit alleged the state broke the law by failing to collect voter registration applications or provide online voter registration opportunities. A federal district judge ruled for the plaintiffs, stating, “Voter enfranchisement cannot be sacrificed when a citizen provides the state the necessary information to register to vote but the state turns its own procedures into a vehicle to burden that right.”Farr also has ties to the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), whose legacy includes opposing the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, and leading a 16-day filibuster against naming a federal holiday after Martin Luther King Jr. Farr was Helms’ campaign attorney in 1984 and 1990. In 1990, Helms sent postcards to 125,000 African American voters falsely stating they could be prosecuted and imprisoned for up to five years if they tried to vote in a precinct in which they had lived for fewer than 30 days.The Justice Department sued the campaign, saying the mailing was intended to intimidate black voters. Farr has denied knowing about the postcards.North Carolina’s senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, both Republicans, have thrown their support behind Farr’s confirmation.“His wealth of experience will serve North Carolina well,” Burr said in a statement.“He is impeccably qualified, and I am confident he will be an independent-minded judge committed to fairness and will faithfully apply the law,” Tillis said in a statement.But civil rights leaders say Farr is one of the worst federal court nominees they’ve ever seen. “It is no exaggeration to say that had the White House deliberately sought to identify an attorney in North Carolina with a more hostile record on African- American voting rights and workers’ rights than Thomas Farr, it could hardly have done so,” reads a letter to senators signed by members of the Congressional Black Caucus.William Barber, president of the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP, said there’s no reason to think Farr will be an independent voice on the bench, given how aggressively he’s fought against voter protections.“Thomas Farr has been the lead attorney in attacking every modern effort in North Carolina to empower the state’s African American voters; and in most cases, he has been a public architect of the regressive and discriminatory backlash,” Barber wrote to senators. “Based on his outspoken history and aggressive litigious style of opposing African Americans and the rights of the vulnerable, African Americans have no trust or faith that Thomas Farr can be independent, fair, and impartial in serving as a member of the esteemed federal judiciary.”Another group, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200 national organizations, also wrote a letter to all 100 U.S. senators this week urging them to vote no on Farr.Farr is one of a number of controversial judicial nominees that Trump has put forward this year. With Republicans in control of the White House and the Senate, conservatives have a lot of leeway to nominate and confirm whomever they want to lifetime jobs on the federal bench.In July, the Senate confirmed John Bush to a lifetime post on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. Bush has compared abortion to slavery, said he strongly disagrees with same-sex marriage, mocked climate change and proclaimed “the witch is dead” when he thought the Affordable Care Act might not be enacted.The Senate also confirmed Kevin Newsom to the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in August. Newsom wrote a 2000 law review article equating the rationale of Roe v. Wade to Dred Scott v. Sandford, the 1857 decision upholding slavery. He also argued in a 2005 article for The Federalist Society, a right-wing legal organization, that Title IX does not protect people who face retaliation for reporting gender discrimination. The Supreme Court later rejected that position."

The places I go, way I dress and even things I eat are dictated by how good of an Instagram picture they will make. Taking a good picture makes me really happy and makes me enjoy the moment I’m in a little more. It sounds insane. But it’s the way that so many of us millennials think. And even if the moment the picture was taken wasn’t glamorous, you better believe that our Instagram post still will be. Here’s an example:Yesterday my friend Kaitlyn and I decided to rent motor bikes in Thailand to go find a cool waterfall. Within the first five minutes, Kaitlyn had fallen off the bike... twice. So we decided to take the motor bikes back and get bicycles instead. What we didn’t realize was that we would be riding/walking our bicycles up a huge hill for 45 minutes to get to the waterfall we wanted to go check out. As motor bikes continually flew past us, we joked that we should have just risked death on the scooters. Once we finally made it up the hill to a waterfall, we admired how beautiful it was and then naturally started taking pictures. The water was freezing... But we pretended like it was perfect warm water and stripped down to our bathing suits. We stood there waiting for a girl who was taking photos to leave so that we could get a picture with no one else in it. I had Kaitlyn take pictures of me, I looked at them to see if my poses looked weird and asked her to take more with different lighting. Then I had round two of my photoshoot. Then it was Kaitlyn’s turn. Photoshoot round one. Photoshoot round two. She liked her photos, but I still didn’t have one that I loved, so I quickly had a photoshoot round three before people walked down to the waterfall. God forbid there was another human in my Instagram photo. Once we were happy with the pictures, we took a couple of selfies for snapchat and headed back to town. Later that day (at a planned time that will get me the most likes), I posted my glamorous waterfall picture of my perfect relaxing day in Thailand. No one knew what I went through to get this photo. No one knew how many photos we took to get the perfect shot. This is only a small portion of them.But I want my Instagram photos to look like my life is this amazing perfect dream world.Guess what?It’s not. My life is long bike rides uphill in the heat. My life is free crackers from the hostel, because I don’t want to spend money on food. My life is buses that break down and take eight extra hours to get to our destination. My life is using toilets with no toilet paper. My life is a crazy series of events that all bring me joy in one way or another, but my life is not all glamorous. But yet I still only show people some set up picture that literally was constructed for the Insta. Why? Why are my Instagram posts so important and why do I go out of my way to set up the perfect photo? Well the first thing that comes to mind is that I want to inspire people to travel. Hopefully my beautiful pictures will make other people want to go see the world. I want to help people find ways to travel on a budget and live the life they want! The people who get noticed and have a bigger impact are the ones that take the glamorous photos. But maybe there's more. Is that the only reason I care so much about the pictures I post on social media? Probably not. Social media ends up being a lot like a competition. I want to make sure that everyone knows how cool my life is and how many beautiful places I've been and how fun I am to be around. I want more people to read my blog. I want more followers. I want more likes. And it's crazy and addicting because it works. Because of social media more people want to hang out with me. Cute boys message me and want to travel with me. People introduce me to their friends in a way that makes me seem like a super star. And honestly I love the attention I get because of it. I want people to know that there are so many hard parts of traveling and it often is not glamorous, but I can't seem to post those moments on my holy Instagram page. Who wants to see the moments that aren't picture perfect? I want to be an authentic traveler who shares what really happens when you're not posing for Instagram. But I also really enjoy taking aesthetically pleasing pictures because it helps me remember the moment in a more beautiful way. No matter if it was real life or just for the likes, no one's life is perfect...no matter how perfect their Instagram photos are.Check out the glamorous side of my life here :p"

Andrew Cuomo (D) signed a bill into law that prohibits the pachyderms in entertainment events like circuses and parades.“Elephants will no longer be subjected to this cruel abuse,” Cuomo tweeted Thursday.His sentiment echoed the argument of animal rights activists, who have long said that the highly intelligent, social animals shouldn’t be confined and made to perform.State Assemblywoman Amy Paulin (D-Westchester) told the Daily News that the measure, known as the Elephant Protection Act, was drafted after reports of elephants being abused by trainers. Paulin was one of the sponsors.The law takes effect in 2019.The governor’s signature comes about four months after the New York City Council voted to ban circuses from using any wild animals in their acts.It’s been more than a year since the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus officially retired its elephants after pressure from animal rights groups and members of the public concerned for the animals’ well-being.However, as the Poughkeepsie Journal reports, smaller circuses in New York and the U.S. continue to include performing elephants. Those companies typically deny they mistreat their animals.“They’re not beaten or prodded; it’s voice command and hand command,” Jim Davis, executive director of Stellar Entertainment Group, told the Journal. The group produces the Garden Bros. Circus, which is touring in New York, but left its elephants in Pennsylvania because of the coming ban."
40,POLITICS,How Women Factor Into The Uniquely American Problem Of Mass Incarceration,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mass-incarceration-women_us_59ea1b51e4b0f9d35bca482b,"There are 219,000 women locked up in the U.S. Many have not been convicted.",2017-10-20,A detailed look at the incarcerated population in the U.S.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ea2de3140000610d8c8e24.png?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"The United States incarcerates more people than any other nation in the world, and women are an important part of that equation. About a third of all female prisoners worldwide are locked up in the U.S., according to one frequently cited study, and more recent reports suggest those numbers may have risen over the past few years.A new chart from the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative compiles federal data to give us a closer look at where the nation’s 219,000 incarcerated women are being held and for what. Although many of the trends are relatively consistent with the general incarcerated population ― which includes 2.3 million people behind bars in a sprawling network of prisons and jails ― some are amplified when looking exclusively at women.Women are more heavily concentrated in jails than the overall population. While state prisons nationwide house more than twice as many inmates as local jails, women are nearly evenly split between state prisons and jails. Previous studies have shown that women in jails are the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population.Of the women currently being held in jails, more than 60 percent have not been convicted. Overall, these individuals make up more than one-quarter of all incarcerated women in the U.S.Most of them are facing low-level charges, which suggests tens of thousands of women are in jail in the U.S. simply because they can’t afford to pay their way out. They are victims of a much broader money bail system that often leaves poor people to languish behind bars, where they’re often disconnected from family members and support systems, fired from jobs and stripped of access to public assistance. Sometimes they plead guilty to crimes they didn’t commit simply to get out of jail. The smaller number of women facing more serious charges may have been denied bail while they await trial.Women are also more likely than the overall population to be held in jails after conviction. About a quarter of all women serving time after conviction are locked up in local jails. Nationwide, only about 10 percent of all convicted inmates are housed in jails.Women in jail are mostly black and Latino, overwhelmingly poor and low-income, according to a recent study. Nearly 80 percent of them are mothers, and many are primary caretakers of their children. Many are victims of sexual or domestic violence or suffer from mental illness.Nationally, more than 70 percent of the U.S. jail population has not been convicted. These individuals make up about 20 percent of the incarcerated population.The two charts show that women are getting locked up for some of the same reasons as men. About 37 percent of all incarcerated women in the U.S. are behind bars for drug or public order offenses, a number that tracks closely with the overall incarcerated population.But women are less likely than men to be locked up for violence. Just under one-quarter of all incarcerated women are behind bars for violent offenses. That’s substantially lower than the total incarcerated population, of which nearly 40 percent are in jail or prison for acts of violence.The Prison Policy Initiative touts the study, done in collaboration with the ACLU’s Campaign for Smart Justice, as a “first-of-its-kind” look at incarcerated women in the U.S. Aleks Kajstura, the report’s author and legal director of the Prison Policy Initiative, hopes her work will be used to spark “a national conversation” about how the criminal justice system specifically affects women.“This new data on women underlines the need for reform discussions to focus not just on the easier choices but on choices that can lead to impactful policy changes,” wrote Kajstura. “While more data is needed, the data in this report lends focus and perspective to the policy changes needed to end mass incarceration without leaving women behind.”"

But that’s exactly what happened earlier this month when the Trump administration denied 25 critically imperiled animals protection under the Endangered Species Act.The species range from the Pacific walrus — found to be endangered by the Obama administration because of loss of summer sea ice to climate change — to the Florida Keys mole skink, which is rapidly losing habitat to sea-level rise. They also include 14 species of Nevada springsnails threatened by the Southern Nevada Water Authority’s plans to pump groundwater in the northern part of the state. You couldn’t ask for a clearer sign that the Trump administration puts corporate profits ahead of protecting endangered species. All of these unique and magnificent animals are now one step closer to extinction. That’s why the organization where I work is going to challenge as many of these bogus findings as we can. In addition to the species mentioned above, the Bicknell’s thrush, Big Blue Springs cave crayfish, black-backed woodpecker, Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle and Kirtland’s snake were among those denied protection. A number of the species — including the walrus, the mole skink, Bicknell’s thrush and northern Rockies population of fisher — are known to be threatened by climate change, as well as other factors. But the Trump administration denied protection anyway, saying their loss was too speculative. Denying protection for these 25 species despite the imminent threat of climate change and ongoing habitat destruction is tragically typical of the Trump administration’s head-in-the-sand approach. But the bad news for America’s wildlife doesn’t stop there. Research by the Center for Biological Diversity shows that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service failed to make decisions concerning protection of 22 species under the Endangered Species Act, pushing the lesser prairie chicken, Hermes copper butterfly and others closer to extinction as well. The Fish and Wildlife Service also failed to protect critical habitat for 20 already-listed endangered species, including the yellow-billed cuckoo and green sea turtle. The Trump administration and Department of the Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have failed miserably at preserving the nation’s natural heritage. It’s especially frustrating since the Fish and Wildlife Service made an honest attempt to prioritize species protections with extensive input from state wildlife agencies. But the Service wasn’t able to get the job done for these imperiled animals because of opposition from the Trump administration. The decisions were supposed to have been made in fiscal year 2017, which ended Sept. 30, according to a work plan developed by the Fish and Wildlife Service to address a backlog of more than 500 plants and animals awaiting endangered species protections. Under the work plan, as well as court orders in some cases, the agency was supposed to make protection decisions for 61 species and designate critical habitat for 20 other species. Instead agency staffers made decisions for 39 species, only protecting 10, and protected critical habitat for zero species. The Trump administration is totally out of step with the vast majority of Americans who back strong protections for wildlife. They want their children and grandchildren to experience the same rich, wild landscapes where they first heard the Bicknell’s thrush call through the forest or glimpsed the tail of a fisher as it disappeared into the underbrush. Now is not the time to deny protections to our most endangered animals – because if we don’t save them now, it will soon be too late. "

Citizens have been without access to power, clean water and medical care for months. The U.S.-led coalition has launched thousands of airstrikes on Raqqa since it came under ISIS control, and international monitors estimate the bombings have killed at least 1,000 civilians and destroyed key parts of the city’s infrastructure.

Bullet holes riddle the landscape, and martial law persists over Marawi and its surrounding region. Philippine military officials told the country’s media that the battle to take back the city was complicated by extremists taking hostages and looting homes for more supplies. They also found tunnels built to withstand the powerful airstrikes targeting the group.The nearly five-month-long fight for Marawi, which was aided by U.S. and Australian aircraft, displaced 400,000 people from the area around the city. The Philippine military says that at least 824 militants have died in the fighting, as well as 60 government troops and dozens of civilians. It will likely take years to rebuild Marawi, and the Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana claims that there is around $1.1 billon in damages as a result of the fighting. The fight for Iraq’s second-largest city of Mosul earlier this year saw a similar pattern of devastation, as Iraqi forces backed by U.S. air power recaptured the city in July. Rights groups alleged that during the offensive to take back Mosul, U.S.-led coalition airstrikes began killing an increasing number of civilians as jets dropped larger bombs with less careful oversight. Basic city infrastructure like roads, bridges and power lines were all destroyed in the blasts and fighting.Simply restoring Mosul back to a functioning metropolis with access to power and water is expected to take a year and cost $1 billion, according to U.N estimates. Long-term stability and rebuilding projects will cost even more. Much like in Raqqa, when ISIS left Mosul it rigged the city with improvised explosive devices that could take as long as a decade to fully clear out.Mosul also saw a mass exodus as a result of the fighting and ISIS occupation. Around 900,000 people were displaced from the city, a depletion of about half of the city’s population. Mosul and Marawi both face huge challenges in order to return to being functioning cities, and Raqqa has an even more convoluted and daunting path ahead. The conflict in Syria has divided the country along shifting battle lines, and there’s no comprehensive coordinated international effort in place to secure Raqqa in the long term.Efforts to immediately restore order to Raqqa are likely going to fall to the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, a U.S-backed coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters that were in charge of taking back the city from ISIS.But there are questions over how the SDF will be able to maintain security, as well as what role local forces and councils will play in the city’s future. Outstanding concerns include how the majority Sunni local populace will view the Kurdish-led forces. The influential Syrian activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently has already begun to portray these forces as new occupiers. "

Can we blame the pro-charter school Thomas B. Fordham Institute from arguing that ugly features of the Ohio charter school system will somehow miraculously become beautiful if we give reform a chance? You bet we can and better! Fordham and other charter school advocates including President Donald Trump of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos are pressing for the adoption of seriously flawed charter schools all over the country.The Ohio State auditor is demanding that companies owned by Bill Langer, founder of the charter school network ECOT (Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow), return millions of dollars to the State Education Department, money they “over-collected” because of inflated attendance claims. An attendance review found that ECOT was paid for 9,000 more students in 2015-2016 than it could document, an almost 40% overstatement.A business, not a school system, ECOT is threatening to shut down its programs in the middle of the school year if the Ohio State Education Department does not stop efforts to recoup what may be as much as $60 million. That could mean 600 lay-offs as well as suspended education for thousands of students. Ohio has already started to reduce monthly payments to ECOT to collect what it claims must be reimbursed. ECOT is seeking to block state education using Ohio courts. Smaller online Ohio “schools,” also really businesses, have joined the ECOT legal challenge.According to a report in the Columbus Dispatch, ECOT may have been using tax dollars targeted for educating students to purchase political commercials attacking the Ohio Department of Education. The ECOT Board of Directors authorized unlimited spending on a “strategic communications” campaign in response to what they consider “negative portrayals” of the school.The school’s non-profit corporation board “authorizes and approves the allocation of any funds at the (school’s) disposal to be paid to vendors, professionals, or other outside entities for purposes of defending the corporation and/or promoting the mission.”A National Education Association report documents that “one out of every six dropouts in Ohio are ECOT students. More ECOT students either leave or fail to finish high school within four years more than at any other school in the nation. And ECOT repeatedly scores F’s on state report cards.” Becky Higgins, president of the Ohio Education Association called ECOT “the poster child for the worst of Ohio’s struggling charter schools.” ECOT requested that the State Education Department designate it as a dropout-recovery school to avoid being closed because of low student-achievement scores.ECOT is only one of the Ohio charters under investigation by state auditors. Educational Service Center of Lake Erie West, is being ordered to return almost a million dollars it was overpaid because of inflated enrollments. This is the first time Ohio is demanding repayment from contractors and sponsors who received state money channeled through charter “e-schools.” State Auditor Dave Yost, while demanding the refunds, argued ""If a school was overfunded, it must not result in a windfall profit for a private company, while the school itself suffers with reduced funding."" Yost also threatened to penalize the schools and school board members if the money was not collected. ""They have a public duty and we're going to insist they follow that duty and get that money back for the kids."" ECOT’s Board President accuses the Ohio Education Department of being ""unelected bureaucrats"" who are attacking the school because it threatens the ""education-industrial complex.""The pro-charter Fordham Institute basically attributes the financial issues to growing pains, rather than systemic flaws inherent in the privatization of education. It argues that a 2015 modification in the Ohio charter school authorization law reversed “years of poor oversight” and strengthened accountability while “ protecting the very school-level autonomy that is essential to the charter model.” The “modification took 17 years to pass, and is now being challenged by ECOT in the Ohio courts.Fordham has already declared, “Bottom line, implementation is on the right track, bringing promising changes to the state’s charter school sector. If policy makers can maintain rigorous and faithful implementation, it will become increasingly likely that Ohio’s recently enacted charter reforms yield positive results.” The Fordham report excuses charter malfeasance quoting Paul Berman of the Rand Corporation and paraphrasing 18th century Scottish poet Roberts Burns to the affect that “The best laid plans of social reform invariably go astray.” A better quote is “You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.”Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8"

Next to them, she began to write words I did. At that time, it seemed we didn’t fear foreign languages in America.Juro lealtad a la bandera de los Estados Unidos de América y a la república que representa, una nación, bajo Dios, indivisible con libertad y justicia para todos.A translation to the words I did not quite understand: “I pledge allegiance...”Day after day we stood, children of all colors, and swore this oath. Even then, I knew I had immigrated. I had vague memories of a mythical land called Mexico: a place my parents fled to find a better life.Many people speak about legal immigration as if it is easy to attain. Yet they fail to explain how people like my parents, who barely achieved a middle school education, could have navigated a riddled and expensive legal system. How could they have afforded it when they’d resorted to lighting a plate of rubbing alcohol just so the makeshift room they’d created out of aluminum became warm enough to change their infant’s diaper?People will judge them, but I thank them. They risked it all for a chance to see their child reach higher than anyone in our family dared to dream.Of course, everything comes at a price. For my family and me, the opportunities we received in the United States were paid for with loneliness, because we were told never to talk about our status. I paid with the pit I felt in my stomach whenever a police car drove behind my parents. I, and others like me, paid by constantly being asked by U.S. citizens, “Why even try to go to college? You’ll never accomplish it.”Prior to DACA, as someone without status, it was extremely difficult to attend and navigate college. I’d have had to pay three times the tuition my classmates would if I wanted to attend the in-state university; I wouldn’t have been able to apply for most scholarships. I would not have qualified for any loans, and I would not be able to work. I still remember high school graduation day. As student body president, I was one of the first to walk on stage and receive my diploma. And as I held it in my hands, I was overcome with uncertainty. I imagined a future in which I lived a life struggling under the Arizona sun, burning to a crisp and toiling in the heat just to provide for my family ― living a life much like my father. But the very next morning, I received a letter in the mail. It was notice that I’d received a full-ride scholarship! I would became the first in my family to attend a university. I was torn, living in fear of my uncertain legal status but thankful for this opportunity to learn. Then, on June 15, 2012, my world changed.With the strike of a pen, I was plucked from the shadows. When President Barack Obama announced his administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, I felt I no longer had to fear deportation to a land I did not know. But DACA was then ― and still is ― a controversial act. Nearly 800,000 individuals across the nation have benefited, and we have shown our thanks tenfold. Some have found jobs, others have decided to reach for higher education and others offer our help to community resources. There are, predictably, some who have wasted this opportunity, and they are quick to make headlines. Yet even those who paint DACA recipients negatively must admit that less than 1 percent of DACA recipients have lost it due to criminal activity.Personally, though, the Obama administration’s actions changed my life dramatically. It meant I could finally learn to drive! I’d held off, because I thought doing so would jeopardize my status in this country. I finally was able to work (and I promise you, there was no one in the nation happier to get a minimum-wage check than I was). My status allowed me to graduate and eventually pursue my dream of going to law school. I fell in love and married the most astonishing woman, also a Dreamer who refused to give up. We have since graduated ― she with her master’s degree, me having just finished law school and passed the bar exam.And yet, despite our personal achievements, the last few months have been filled with speculation regarding the program. And as someone who grew up in Arizona, I recognize the dark cloud that now consumes the country. Latinos here are accustomed to figures who rise in popularity because of their xenophobic rhetoric. People like Joe Arpaio and former Governor Jan Brewer, who struck fear in our communities. At a time when the general public sought answers to the recession, these two made the immigrant a scapegoat. They understood they could freely attack this mute population ― a population muted because of the fragility of their legal status. And I remember seeing fear in the eyes of people in my community. Parents who were afraid to send their children to school. Who feared venturing to the grocery store. And it’s this same cloud ― a familiar cloud ― that now covers the United States.In my state, the Dreamers have always been the ones who’ve refused to be silent. We were the immigrants who knew how to navigate the political system, and unlike our parents, we knew the language and knew our rights. Some of us fought back by organizing and protesting in the streets. Others knocked on doors, registering voters; if we could not vote for our cause, we would register five those who could. And finally, others among us defied the odds and sought higher education. We understood that a degree provides a microphone, and a microphone enables us to advocate for people of all communities. This is a lesson that, today, goes beyond political ideology. Senator John McCain recently warned against the use of scapegoats. At the Liberty Medal Award ceremony, he warned America not to “abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe” and not to “refuse the obligations of international leadership” for the sake of some “half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.” His words oppose those of people currently in power who have seemingly taken the Arpaio playbook and now claim to “Make America Great Again” by being the nation’s “toughest.” These have brought quick political success, but humanity loses in the long run.And while many hoped DACA would remain, I always understood it was merely a Band-Aid; I always understood that true security can only come through Congress. This justification for rescinding DACA hasn’t lessened the sting and the looming cloud that threatens the lives of so many in our communities. With this, we urge those in Congress, those in the White House and those who have not spoken to Dreamers to venture into your communities, because we guarantee you we are there. We encourage our fellow immigrants to use their voices and tell their stories, because often it is merely ignorance that prevents understanding. And personally, I will be doing my part as an immigration attorney; I will be consuming information and fighting for the American Dream, because I am strangely optimistic. Always, I think back to those words I engraved into my soul, “I pledge allegiance…” I’m reminded of the individuals who have shaped this country. They were beaten, ridiculed and discredited but they overcame. They pushed forward when times seemed bleakest, and they sewed their story into this beautiful American tapestry. It’s this same grit that I see in my fellow Dreamers. I know we will persevere, because we only know one Constitution, we only know one Pledge of Allegiance. We are Americans, and we will also contribute to its story."

If he succeeds, he could become the first rabbi ever to serve in Congress.“I’m doing this for the same reason that drove me to become a rabbi 37 years ago,” Barr told HuffPost on Wednesday. “I felt I have a responsibility to make the world a better place, which is a concept that transcends religion.”Barr, who was ordained in the Reform tradition of Judaism, approaches faith through the lenses of ethics and humanistic values at Congregation Beth Adam, where he serves as head rabbi. After a lifetime of working as a clergy member, the rabbi said he isn’t just seeking a new career in politics. But he feels that Congress is “broken” and desperately in need of some unifying energy.The skills it takes to be a good rabbi are similar to those that make a good politician, Barr said. “One is to be able to articulate a message,” he said. “Part of the job of both clergy and political leaders is to be able to have a vision and articulate that vision. I think a lot of politicians no longer have a vision.”Another, the rabbi noted, is being able to work with people through times of difficulty. “I’ve worked with people through some of the worst moments of life,” he said, like bringing families together to plan a funeral after someone has died. “Family members can’t always get along, and my job has been to help them remember the bigger picture.”“My responsibility is to be there, listen to them and work to help to create a solution,” Barr said.That’s something the rabbi said he believes many U.S. politicians have forgotten how to do. “We have a culture in which people are no longer able to talk and listen to each other. At some point we will split if we don’t find a way to use politics to bring us together,” he said.Many of the issues driving Barr’s Congressional bid ― among them access to affordable health care and campaign finance reform ― continue to be deeply divisive in Washington.On top of that, the rabbi’s campaign will thrust him into the spotlight amid some of the highest levels of anti-Semitism the country has witnessed in recent years. But for Barr, the issues are fairly clear-cut. “We need to make health care available and affordable,” he said simply. As for anti-Semitism, the rabbi said it “speaks badly” of the climate in the U.S. right now that it’s even a concern.“I found it abhorrent that in Charlottesville in 2017 there were people walking down the streets of America shouting racist, anti-Semitic slogans,” he said. Barr added that anti-Semitism “is part of a constellation of prejudices,” including racism, misogyny and Islamophobia, which are “intertwined.”“We have a responsibility to address that,” he said “This isn’t about politics. This is about the country that we’re creating.”Two other Democrats, Sam Ronan and Dr. Laura Ann Weaver, have launched campaigns for the same seat. Whoever wins the May primary will face Republican incumbent Steve Chabot in the November 2018 election. Chabot has held his seat for over 20 years and only lost the reelection once ― to Democrat Steve Driehaus in 2008.But Barr isn’t daunted. “People who know me well know I love to talk,” he said. “I’m willing to talk to every voter in the district, and I think when they get to know me, those who may not have thought of voting for me will decide I’m the one they can trust.”"

When she came across Maria Crider’s story, she knew she wanted to offer her this experience. Crider has been battling breast cancer since her diagnosis in October 2016. “It’s been an emotional rollercoaster,” she told HuffPost. “I’ve been through a unilateral mastectomy, a planned cesarean, a salpingectomy, 16 chemotherapies, 25 out of 28 radiations. I still have ways to go before I can put this part of my life behind me.”Crider was 11 weeks pregnant at the time of her diagnosis and was able to receive treatment during her second and third trimesters. Although pregnancy can affect the timing and specific choice of treatments, it is considered safe for expectant mothers to get treated for cancer. On April 13, she gave birth to a baby boy named Logan at Florida Hospital for Women in Orlando. Hussey was on hand to photograph Logan’s birth. “A mutual friend of ours that I met when we were living in Washington state actually tagged her in my giveaway,” the photographer told HuffPost. “Since I had just moved back to the Central Florida area, I wanted to give back to the community I grew up in.”Logan’s birth was a unique and emotional experience for Crider and Hussey. Although all three of her children were born via C-section, Hussey said this time her doctor set up a camera and monitor so that she could watch it live. “It was very cool, but the biggest thing for me was seeing him born and be totally perfect,” Crider explained. “I did four cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan while pregnant. His delivery was confirmation that everything the doctors had told me was true and that he was perfectly healthy.”Hussey said she was struck by the kindness of Crider’s doctor, nurses and the other members of her care team. “After the initial newborn exam, she was able to hold her baby while her doctor completed the cesarean,” she recalled. “Even though she and the nurses knew that breastfeeding was a slim possibility given the circumstances ― only one breast and having gone through chemotherapy during her pregnancy for Triple Negative Breast Cancer ― her postpartum nurses encouraged her to try.”There was also a milk bank in the hospital for women who needed donor breast milk, the photographer added. When Crider saw the photos from Logan’s birth, she cried. “Bonnie captured all the emotions from the nervousness and excitement in the pre-op to the relief and joy and pain the operating room,” she told HuffPost. “I love the photos! It’s my ‘Hell yeah! We made it!’ moment caught in photos.”Hussey said the mom’s positive reaction meant the world her. With Crider’s encouragement, she shared the photos on social media. “When I took Maria on as a client, my initial instinct was to protect her and not share any of her images or film. I do not document birth stories for anyone other than my clients, and I don’t generally care if the work I make goes viral,” she explained.“But she said to me, ‘Sharing brings awareness, and you can share anything you want,’” Hussey continued. “After she said that to me I knew I needed to share her story and I could only hope that it would reach at least one other woman going through the same experience.”Crider told HuffPost she’s found encouragement in other women’s stories and joined a private Facebook support group for pregnant women with cancer ― “Kick Ass Cancer Mamas.” Said the mom, “It’s wonderful to see their testimony ― it’s where I turned to when looking for more women in my position.”Hussey said she loved working with Crider and hopes to document more of her medical journey. Said the photographer, “She has an amazing spirit. It’s truly an honor to be a part of her birth experience.”Crider hopes other women who are pregnant and have cancer see her birth photos. “I hope it gives them the courage to talk to their doctors seek a course of action that’s right for both mom and baby,” she said. “I want it to give them reassurance that you can go through certain treatment while pregnant.

53,WOMEN,Male Radio Host Demands Pay Cut For One Selfless Reason,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dave-hughes-kate-langbroek-radio-pay-parity-australia_us_59e87468e4b08f9f9edcf30d,Dave Hughes was horrified to learn he made 40 percent more than his female co-host. So he did something about it.,2017-10-19,"Kate Langbroek and Dave Hughes are seen in 2008. The Australian radio duo are hosts of the ""Hughesy & Kate"" radio show on the KIIS Network.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e87a16150000510d746624.jpeg?cache=beNBTN6itp&ops=crop_9_137_2000_1723%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Australian radio personality Dave Hughes says he asked his bosses for a pay cut to ensure that he and his female co-host make the same amount of money.Fans are now praising Hughes for being a “real man leaning in,” but he’s been quick to point out that his co-host is the “real hero.”The story began in March, on International Women’s Day, when Hughes’ longtime co-host, Kate Langbroek, announced on air that she made significantly less than he did. “This is heavy hitting. I found out last year that you get paid 40 percent more than I do for doing this show,” she said at the time.Hughes, who claimed not to know about the pay difference, was “audibly stunned” by the reveal, reported News Corp Australia. “I had no idea what we get paid. Now I feel terrible,” he said.“You don’t need to feel terrible,” Langbroek replied. “It wasn’t your fault that you were born with two oranges in a string bag.”After learning about the pay gap, Langbroek says she immediately went to her bosses at the radio station KIIS Network to discuss increasing her salary to match Hughes’.Management complied with her request, increasing her salary for the rest of 2016. However, according to News Corp, Hughes’ salary for 2017 had already been “locked in” ― and for undisclosed reasons, Langbroek’s pay was not increased to match it.Learning this, Hughes said he decided to request a pay cut so he’d be making the same amount as his co-host.“Fair’s fair,” he wrote on Twitter. Hughes and Langbroek, who are set to join a new radio station in 2018, told News Corp they’ve negotiated with their new employer to ensure they’ll be making the same amount when they start at their new gig. They added that they’ll be discussing their salaries going forward to ensure that parity is always achieved.People on social media were in a tizzy on Wednesday after news of Hughes’ decision went viral. But Hughes emphasized that Langbroek deserved the bulk of the praise, for knowing “her worth” and demanding it.He added that Langbroek would have quit the show if the pay inequality had continued, and he “did not want that.” The duo have been working together since at least 2001.Earlier this year, actress Emma Stone said that some of her male co-stars in Hollywood had chosen to take pay cuts so she’d get the same pay as them.“In my career so far, I’ve needed my male co-stars to take a pay cut so that I may have parity with them,” she told Out magazine. “And that’s something they do for me because they feel it’s what’s right and fair.”Stone added that “selflessly” taking a pay cut may sometimes be necessary to challenge the status quo.“If my male co-star, who has a higher quote than me but believes we are equal, takes a pay cut so that I can match him, that changes my quote in the future and changes my life,” she said. “It’s not about, ‘Women are this and men are that.’ It is, ‘We are all the same, we are all equal, we all deserve the same respect and the same rights.’”In the U.S., women on average are paid 80 percent of what men are paid for equal work. For women of color, however, the wage gap is even greater ― 60 percent for black women and 55 percent for Latino women."

Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, participates in the House Democrats' news conference on the Republican budget on Wednesday, April 9, 2014. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e8aa8a180000360ddfb392.jpeg?cache=Od4vVELPY9&ops=crop_8_297_4599_2672%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Texas Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson thinks women bear some of the responsibility in preventing sexual harassment and abuse. Rep. Johnson told local news station NBC 5 that she was disappointed and angered by the allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and misconduct against Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein. The Democratic Congresswoman who represents Texas’ 30th district added that a woman’s behavior, including the way she dresses, can invite sexual harassment and assault. “I grew up in a time when it was as much the woman’s responsibility as it was a man’s ― how you were dressed, what your behavior was,” Johnson said. “I’m from the old school that you can have behaviors that appear to be inviting. It can be interpreted as such. That’s the responsibility, I think, of the female. I think that males have a responsibility to be professional themselves.” Rep. Johnson said that she believes sexual harassment and assault happen because women allow it. “I think we also need to start talking about the power that women have to control the situation. There’s law enforcement, you can refuse to cooperate with that kind of behavior,” she said. “I think that many times, men get away with this because they are allowed to get away with it by the women.” Rep. Johnson’s comments exemplify the victim-blaming attitudes that often permeate discussions of sexual harassment and abuse, perpetuating the myth that a survivor’s assault could have been prevented if they had worn a different outfit or changed their behavior. Blaming the victim when an assault occurs contributes to the fact that rape is one of the least reported and convicted violent crimes in the U.S. When reporting to their schools or to law enforcement, many survivors are confronted with the same problematic questions: What were you wearing? Were you flirting with your attacker? Why did you go home with him? Because sexual violence ― from harassment to abuse and rape ― is about power not sex, a woman’s “inviting” behavior has nothing to do with the reason she was assaulted. In a statement sent to HuffPost, Rep. Johnson wrote that her earlier comments to NBC 5 came “from an old school perspective” and she believes that there are no excuses when it comes to sexual assault and harassment.Read her statement in full below: Sexual assault and harassment has no place in our society. This is something I believe deeply. And at each turn of my professional life, I have made it my mission to fight for women’s rights. I do not blame the victims of sexual assault for the actions of their assailants. I do acknowledge that my comments regarding behavior and attire come from an old school perspective that has shaped how some of us understand the issue, but that does not detract from the fact that criminals need to be held accountable for their actions. I will never condone those who feel they can abuse the power of their positions to sexually assault and harass women, and I will always encourage victims to come forward so that we can hold these criminals accountable. Thanks to the testimony of brave women like Anita Hill, students on college campuses, and most recently the victims of Harvey Weinstein’s attacks, we are able to have a public dialogue about the systemic issues that we face as a society. Ultimately, we need to unequivocally support the victims of sexual assault and harassment as best we can while working to hold the perpetrators accountable for their actions. And supporting all women in this fight will continue to be my life’s work.This article has been updated to include Rep. Johnson’s most recent comments on her conversation with NBC 5. "

Dustin Guy, an official at the National Weather Service in Seattle, described it to The Seattle Times as “one long stretch of moisture a few thousands miles long that will be hitting us in the face.”At least one city in Washington set a daily record for precipitation Wednesday, and Seattle was expected to have its wettest 24-hour period since February. Local ski blogs in British Columbia gleefully predicted the region could get 28 to 80 inches of snow during the week.Strong wind gusts knocked out power to more than 54,000 people in western Washington, and a ground delay was temporarily placed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to KING 5 TV. Ferry services were temporarily closed as well.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association describes such weather patterns as “rivers in the sky” that transport water vapor from warm tropical areas to cooler regions.“These columns of vapor move with the weather, carrying an amount of water vapor roughly equivalent to the average flow of water at the mouth of the Mississippi River,” the agency says. “When the atmospheric rivers make landfall, they often release this water vapor in the form of rain or snow.”The Washington Post notes that while this week’s storm is certainly dramatic in its scale, atmospheric rivers this large have been seen before. Another over the Pacific Ocean in October 2009 hit central California and dumped up to 15 inches of rain over parts of the state."
56,HEALTHY LIVING,Constantly Checking Social Media During A Tragedy Hurts Your Mental Health,Lindsay Holmes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-media-tragedies_us_59e8af5be4b0d0e4fe6d9e03,Here's how to stay informed without getting in too deep.,2017-10-19,Flowers and signs are seen at a vigil that was held for the victims along the Las Vegas Strip a day after 59 people were killed and more than 500 wounded at the Route 91 Harvest Country Music Festival on Oct. 2.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e8b0941500009e0d746693.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Social media has transformed the way people gather and learn news, particularly during tragedies like the Las Vegas shooting and the California wildfires. But while these platforms can provide a trove of useful information in real time, using them constantly may also be damaging to mental health.A new study published in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences shows that people who excessively check social media during horrific events may experience more psychological distress. Social platforms can spread misinformation more easily (think unconfirmed reports or updates from people who aren’t professionals investigating the situation), which may further affect a person’s mental state.Researchers surveyed more than 3,800 students at a university a week after their school was locked down due to an active shooter on campus. They also analyzed Twitter and other social media data posted during and about the shooting. Participants were asked what sources they relied on during the tragedy, which included school and local authorities, loved ones, social media and traditional media like television or radio news.Those respondents who relied on friends, family and social media for their news were subject to the most misinformation. Those individuals also experienced more anxiety surrounding the event, particularly those people who trusted the information they were told on social media. People who turned to traditional media sources didn’t have the same stressful experience, according to the study’s authors, but it’s unclear why this occurred.Since it’s nearly impossible to conduct a scientific study amid a crisis, a major caveat with this research is that it’s relying on self-reported emotions following the event. It’s unclear what people’s social media behaviors and stress levels actually were in the moment when the tragedy was occurring.That being said, researchers do believe the study offers valuable insight on how people respond to tragedies. Lead study author Nickolas Jones says people may turn to social networks for information as a way to help them feel in control of a situation where they’re otherwise helpless. This may cause the brain to search for answers, making people more susceptible to believing wrong information as well as feeling stress. “You’re going to feel something no matter what because you’re a human being,” Jones, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Irvine, told Mashable. “Where you go from there to mitigate anxiety is what really matters.”This can also apply to those people who may be following a tragedy but not directly involved, Jones told the publication.So what exactly do you need to do to manage that anxiety? Many people don’t want to ditch social media altogether, but there are some ways to navigate it while minimizing psychological distress. Below are a few expert-backed ways to take control of your mental health while still staying plugged in:Start by understanding that social media plays a role in how you feel.These platforms can influence your emotions, even if you’re not directly involved in an event, according to Francisco Cruz, lead psychiatrist at Ketamine Health Centers.

57,HEALTHY LIVING,Constantly Checking Social Media During A Tragedy Hurts Your Mental Health,Lindsay Holmes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-media-tragedies_us_59e8af5be4b0d0e4fe6d9e03,Here's how to stay informed without getting in too deep.,2017-10-19,"A firefighter uses a drip torch to set a backfire to protect houses in Adobe Canyon during the Nuns Fire on Oct. 15, 2017 near Santa Rosa, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e8eac0150000510d74677e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Social media has transformed the way people gather and learn news, particularly during tragedies like the Las Vegas shooting and the California wildfires. But while these platforms can provide a trove of useful information in real time, using them constantly may also be damaging to mental health.A new study published in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences shows that people who excessively check social media during horrific events may experience more psychological distress. Social platforms can spread misinformation more easily (think unconfirmed reports or updates from people who aren’t professionals investigating the situation), which may further affect a person’s mental state.Researchers surveyed more than 3,800 students at a university a week after their school was locked down due to an active shooter on campus. They also analyzed Twitter and other social media data posted during and about the shooting. Participants were asked what sources they relied on during the tragedy, which included school and local authorities, loved ones, social media and traditional media like television or radio news.Those respondents who relied on friends, family and social media for their news were subject to the most misinformation. Those individuals also experienced more anxiety surrounding the event, particularly those people who trusted the information they were told on social media. People who turned to traditional media sources didn’t have the same stressful experience, according to the study’s authors, but it’s unclear why this occurred.Since it’s nearly impossible to conduct a scientific study amid a crisis, a major caveat with this research is that it’s relying on self-reported emotions following the event. It’s unclear what people’s social media behaviors and stress levels actually were in the moment when the tragedy was occurring.That being said, researchers do believe the study offers valuable insight on how people respond to tragedies. Lead study author Nickolas Jones says people may turn to social networks for information as a way to help them feel in control of a situation where they’re otherwise helpless. This may cause the brain to search for answers, making people more susceptible to believing wrong information as well as feeling stress. “You’re going to feel something no matter what because you’re a human being,” Jones, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Irvine, told Mashable. “Where you go from there to mitigate anxiety is what really matters.”This can also apply to those people who may be following a tragedy but not directly involved, Jones told the publication.So what exactly do you need to do to manage that anxiety? Many people don’t want to ditch social media altogether, but there are some ways to navigate it while minimizing psychological distress. Below are a few expert-backed ways to take control of your mental health while still staying plugged in:Start by understanding that social media plays a role in how you feel.These platforms can influence your emotions, even if you’re not directly involved in an event, according to Francisco Cruz, lead psychiatrist at Ketamine Health Centers.

The fires have created a record high amount of air pollution spreading across the San Francisco Bay Area ― about as much produced by cars in the state in a given year, one air quality analyst told CNN. But scientists also say more research is needed to understand how wildfire smoke affects residents’ health.That smoky, polluted air is full of microscopic pieces of particulate matter around 2.5 micrometers or smaller, or PM 2.5, which are too small to be caught by our lungs’ filtration system and instead enter our bloodstreams. Those particles are what turned skies brown and hazy as far as San Francisco 50 miles away, prompting warnings to stay indoors and coughing, wheezing and other side effects among many of those exposed to the abysmal air. Numerous studies have linked premature death in people with heart or lung disease, heart attacks, asthma and other respiratory issues to inhalation of such particles, which are also emitted year-round by vehicles and other pollution sources. Other recent studies have linked PM exposure to increased kidney disease risk and shortened lifespans of those exposed to it in the womb.What’s less clear is whether PM in wildfire smoke ― which has a unique chemical makeup and comes in short, intense episodes during and after a fire ― presents a different set of risks than the particles produced by cars and other daily sources, said Jia Coco Liu, a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University who’s authored several studies exploring the link between wildfire pollution.The biggest question that she says needs to be solved is “whether the composition of fine particulate matters from wildfire smoke is more harmful or less harmful than those from traffic,” she said. Her recent research has made some strides in bridging that gap. In a study published in January in the journal Epidemiology, Liu and her co-authors found that during times of high exposure to wildfire smoke in western U.S. states, there was a 7.2 percent increase in those over 65 admitted to hospitals for respiratory issues, regardless of any pre-existing conditions. The most common issues people were admitted for were respiratory tract infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, an umbrella term that includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis and asthma.Her research has also found that women are more vulnerable than men to health issues linked to wildfire smoke, likely because they have smaller lung volumes. Other research has found the same for children, she said. But pinpointing these effects of wildfire pollution, she said, has proven to be a challenging task.“It is very difficult to isolate pollution specifically from wildfires” while other pollution sources are constantly churning PM into the atmosphere, she said. The number of studies may also be stifled by the limited interest in the subject. “It is also a regional issue ... it is not a huge concern in majority of the states in the U.S.,” she said.Other scientific inquiries into the effect of wildfire smoke on health have also found that current research is too sparse. A review out of the University of California, Davis, earlier this month raised concern about the scarcity, noting that more studies are needed to figure out whether chemicals and pesticides applied to forests and farmlands change the composition of the pollution.“It’s possible that what distinguishes it are the chemicals humans add to the environment, but researchers haven’t paid enough attention to this yet,” Jerold Last, a UC Davis professor and researcher on the environmental causes of disease, said upon the release of the review he co-authored.Breathing in carcinogens such as arsenic present in wildfire smoke, UC San Francisco physician John Balmes told New Republic last week, could possibly cause cancer, but again, “that hasn’t been well-studied,” he said. Currently, the Environmental Protection Agency is also hoping to gain some understanding of the link between wildfire smoke and illness by crowdsourcing information. Its newly launched Smoke Sense, a project launched in August and running through October, asks people to report wildfire smoke conditions and their health symptoms through an app. It’s the kind of undertaking Liu would like to see more of. ″As wildfires are getting more frequent and intense in the recent years, it is getting more attention and more research has been done,” Liu said. “So hopefully there will be more scientific information about wildfires in the coming years.”"

Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander have introduced a bipartisan proposal to shore up private insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e8f75b180000360ddfb4ec.jpeg?cache=IMT8mfncsj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) on Thursday formally introduced their proposal to shore up the Affordable Care Act’s private insurance markets. And in a show of the proposal’s bipartisan strength, they announced the bill now has 24 sponsors, with precisely 12 from each party.It will take that kind of support to push the proposal through Congress, given many Republicans’ feelings about anything related to “Obamacare,” not to mention the contradictory statements President Donald Trump has made lately. But both Alexander and Murray are acting like their proposal could still become law at some point and there is good reason to think they are right. The bill, which emerged from hearings and negotiations that Alexander and Murray convened over the course of the past few weeks, would restore several billion dollars’ worth of subsidies to insurers that Trump cut off last week. In addition, it would appropriate about $100 million in funding for enrollment and outreach ― again, effectively replacing money that Trump took away. At the same time, the bill would allow insurers to sell catastrophic policies, with extremely high out-of-pocket expenses in exchange for lower premiums, to consumers of all ages ― rather than only to consumers who are younger than 30, as the law currently allows. The bill would also make it easier for states to tweak some of the Affordable Care Act’s regulations.None of the changes the bill contemplates are particularly dramatic. It’s really a series of small wins and concessions for each side, in the hopes of keeping coverage more affordable and available at least for the next few years ― at a time when, for reasons that reflect both the Affordable Care Act’s design and recent management of it, consumers in many states are facing higher prices and dwindling choices.It’s precisely the kind of bill both Alexander and Murray had said they wanted to write. In successive remarks from the Senate floor, the two senators ― one the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee chairman, the other the committee’s ranking Democratic member ― praised each other for diligence and an open mind.“It sends a powerful message that when members of Congress decide to get past the talking points and take just a few steps out of partisan corner, there’s really a lot we can agree on ― and a lot we can get done,” Murray said.But it’s been years since such bipartisanship was typical, particularly on the polarizing issue of health care. Many Republicans refuse to even consider supporting legislation that might bolster ― or be seen to bolster ― a law they have spent seven-plus years vowing to rip out, root and branch. And then there is Trump, who has sent so many wildly inconsistent signals it’s difficult to keep track of them. In just the past few days, he seemed to change his mind on multiple occasions ― at various points praising the Alexander-Murray plan publicly, only to announce, in some cases hours later, that he could never back a bill that includes a “bailout” of insurance companies.In his floor remarks, Alexander addressed the bailout argument directly. He pointed out that the payments Trump cut off, known as cost-sharing reductions or CSRs, merely reimburse insurers for special low-deductible policies that they must, by law, offer to poor and some middle-class consumers. Alexander went on to say that the bill includes a whole section on making sure a restoration of the CSRs ends up benefiting consumers, not insurers. “The president says there should be no bailout of insurance companies,” Alexander said. “I agree 100 percent.” Alexander also told his fellow Republicans that endorsing his bill was not tantamount to giving up on repeal. As proof, he noted that among the GOP co-sponsors are Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who have pledged to keep working on the repeal package they tried but failed to get through the Senate in September.Besides, Alexander said, holding out for full repeal hasn’t worked so well for Republicans so far.“Someone said that this bill is not enough,” Alexander said. “Well, it’s more than we’ve gotten for eight years and it’s the first step.”Both Alexander and Murray spoke about the bill as if it could offer immediate relief on premiums. In reality, insurers and state regulators have already settled on rates for next year and in most cases they have done so in ways that will shield the majority of consumers from the immediate effects of Trump’s cutoff. That’s largely because other forms of financial assistance will automatically be increased to compensate for cuts in the insurer subsidies. One ironic result is that the federal government will end up spending more money, not less, unless and until the federal government restores the insurer subsidies ― a point Alexander noted in his appeal to fellow Republicans.But if Alexander-Murray becomes law and the subsidies start flowing again, the proposal envisions insurers paying back any extra money they receive, through rebates to consumers or the federal government or both. In addition, passing the bill could have a profound effect on the mentality of insurers, who will begin planning for 2019 sometime in the next few months. If the carriers know the federal government has restored the payments and is investing in outreach ― and, more important, if they see Congress acting to bolster insurance markets where they are weak ― they are more likely to continue offering policies.That still makes it a hard sell, particularly among conservative Republicans. On Wednesday, the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) released an official statement saying nothing in the Alexander-Murray proposal alters Ryan’s “view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare.” Some Republicans are already talking about modifying the proposal in ways that could make it toxic for Democrats.But particularly if Republicans worry they will take the blame for rising premiums this year ― a very real possibility, given that polls show most Americans now hold Republicans responsible for management of the health care system ― GOP leaders could pass the Alexander-Murray proposal, or something like it, by attaching it to larger, must-pass legislation. The spending bill that Congress will have to approve in December, in order to keep the government running, is the obvious candidate for this.That makes the bill’s show of support important ― particularly because it represents not just both parties but also different factions within the parties. Among the co-sponsors are mainstream conservatives such as Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), as well as relative moderates like Susan Collins (R-Maine), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).The co-sponsors from the Democratic caucus include members representing a similarly wide ideological spectrum ― with relatively liberal senators, like Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Al Franken (D-Minn.), along with relative moderates such as Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Angus King (I-Maine) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).Alexander and Murray are also drawing support from beyond Capitol Hill. A bipartisan group of 10 governors, including three Republicans and one Republican-turned-independent, on Wednesday issued a letter supporting the proposal. Also on board are a wide array of health care organizations ― all of whom, like most of those governors, had strongly opposed repeal legislation when it came up earlier this year.Perhaps the most interesting comments of the day actually came from one of those Republican co-sponsors: Murkowski, who spoke immediately after Alexander and Murray and praised the pair for their cooperation. “It’s not only good from a policy perspective,” she said, “it’s good from the perspective of the health of our institution.” Back in July, Murkowski was one of three Republicans to vote against repeal legislation the Senate was considering, thereby preventing its passage. One of her big objections was the process that led to the vote ― a rush to craft a bill without formal hearings or deliberation, or any serious attempt to win bipartisan support.On Thursday, Murkowski didn’t say explicitly that she viewed the Alexander-Murray proposal as a better way to legislate. But the point was clear enough."

Although 53 percent call the problem in Hollywood “very serious,” however, just over one-third say the same about workplace harassment nationwide.The survey comes in the wake of a litany of sexual assault and harassment allegations against film executive Harvey Weinstein, a story that has captured the attention of much of the nation. Eighty-six percent of Americans say they’ve heard at least something about the allegations, and 45 percent say that they’ve heard a lot about them. (For contrast, about one-third said they’d heard a lot about the Obamacare repeal bill that passed the House of Representatives in May.)But the survey also suggests that some Americans believe the worst sexual harassment is largely confined to Hollywood. Men, for instance, are about equally as likely as women to think sexual harassment is a very serious problem in Hollywood, but 15 points less likely to think it’s very serious across the country.As is often the case, the difference is even greater between those of different political persuasions. Voters who supported President Donald Trump ― many of whom may have already spurned Hollywood as a bastion of out-of-touch liberalism ― are about as likely as Hillary Clinton supporters to call sexual harassment in the entertainment industry a “very serious” problem. They’re 31 points less likely, however, to think it’s equally problematic in the rest of the U.S.In many cases, the allegations against Weinstein sound nearly indistinguishable from those levied against Trump in the run-up to last year’s election. Sixty-two percent of Americans polled consider the accusations against Weinstein to be credible, with just 3 percent saying they’re not credible and the rest uncertain. However, just 45 percent of respondents say the accusations levied at the president are credible, a number that’s relatively unchanged since last October. Currently, 18 percent say the allegations against Trump are not credible, with the remainder unsure.The difference in perceptions of Weinstein and Trump is, once again, largely political. A majority of both Clinton and Trump voters ― 74 percent and 66 percent, respectively ― say the allegations against Weinstein are credible. But 83 percent of Clinton voters, and just 8 percent of Trump voters, say the same of the allegations against Trump.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:Another poll released this week also highlights how partisanship affects Americans’ views of sexual harassment.According to a Washington Post/ABC News survey published on Tuesday, 64 percent of Americans now view workplace sexual harassment as a serious problem, up 17 points since 2011. Most respondents felt that men who harass female co-workers were unlikely to face consequences.Results, however, were significantly more polarized than they were six years ago, with Democrats’ and independents’ rising concerns about harassment contrasting sharply against Republicans’ more stagnant opinions on the issue. Seventy-nine percent of Democrats and two-thirds of independents, but just 42 percent of Republicans, considered sexual harassment to be a serious problem. The gap between men and women, by contrast, was far smaller.That survey also highlights how personally the issue resonates for many women. One-third of women polled said they’d faced sexual advances from men who worked with them and had influence over their jobs. Most said they’d faced inappropriate advances in some area of their lives.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 12-13 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Tom Wolf made a severance tax a central campaign promise in 2013. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e8ad9b140000610d8c8a2d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PITTSBURGH ― Six years ago, state Rep. Greg Vitali (D) made the first attempt to impose a tax on drillers sucking natural gas from Pennsylvania’s bedrock.Lawmakers have tried at least 66 times since, to no avail. This makes Pennsylvania the only major gas-producing state that doesn’t require oil and gas companies to pay a fee, or severance tax, on the amount of gas extracted ― 5 trillion cubic feet. The tax could raise $100 million this year alone to help plug the state’s $2.2 billion budget deficit. Failing to pass it amounts to “leaving money on the table,” according to the Brookings Institution. About 70 percent of voters in Pennsylvania support adding the tax.In July, the elusive severance tax seemed within grasp. The state Senate passed a bipartisan spending bill that included a severance tax that would charge fracking companies about 2 cents per thousand cubic feet of gas. But when the budget bill that included it came up for debate in the House of Representatives two weeks ago, the severance tax got cut ― illustrating what critics say is the deep-pocketed gas industry’s stranglehold on Pennsylvania politics. On Wednesday, Gov. Tom Wolf (D), for whom the tax is a key political issue, urged legislators to pass a severance tax proposal approved by a bipartisan committee.“This is a fair and commonsense proposal that will address our structural budget deficit,” Wolf told HuffPost by email.But the bill faces an upward slope slicked with lobbying money. Since 2009, the industry has spent more than $59 million lobbying state legislators, and contributed $9.5 million to campaigns and political action committees, according to data released this month by the watchdog group Common Cause. An investigation by The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette estimated the spending was more like $61 million.“It’s a matter of public record that they’ve lobbied heavily against this for years, and they’ve been very effective in doing that,” Vitali told HuffPost. “We have a huge, huge deficit and we’re starting to monetize assets and lease assets, yet we can’t get a severance tax done.”Vitali, who has represented a district in Philadelphia’s western suburbs for 25 years, said that while he still wants a severance tax, he wouldn’t have supported the version that passed in the Senate anyway. Republican leaders had only consented to include the severance tax in the legislation in exchange for measures weakening the state Department of Environmental Protection. One rule would have outsourced environmental permitting to a third-party panel staffed by businesspeople, including landscape architects. Another would have automatically approved all outstanding permit requests after a period of 30 to 45 days ― regardless of whether the request contained inaccurate information or violated other regulations. A third provision would put a seven-person committee appointed by Republican leadership in charge of setting rules on air quality and methane pollution from drilling sites. But even a severance tax bill loaded with polluter giveaways couldn’t pass. A top industry blog published a list of Republican senators who supported it, under a graphic reading: “Traitor in our midst.” The industry’s main trade group vowed to do “whatever is necessary” to stop the tax. And once again, the industry got what it wanted. “The lack of a severance tax, it’s an example of the best policy that money can buy,” Steve Herzenberg, executive director of the Pennsylvania economic think tank Keystone Research Center, told HuffPost. “Lawmakers need to think about a variation of the famous John F. Kennedy phrase, ask not what you can do for your gas industry, ask what your gas industry can do for your state.”The governor’s office said the latest tax legislation “did not include the same permitting reform,” but said the administration “was willing to make reasonable compromises” as long as they “would not sacrifice the Department of Environmental Protection’s ability to protect Pennsylvanians and the environment.” Natural gas companies do pay what’s called an impact fee for each new well they drill in Pennsylvania. Sixty percent of that money goes to the local government, providing a steady source of revenue for towns and counties hurt by mining and manufacturing decline. The rest goes to state agencies involved in regulating drilling, cleaning up the environmental damages left behind, and repairing roads and infrastructure. But collection of that fee peaked along with the number of new wells in 2013 at about $225 million, and has since fallen to $173 million, a record low.The American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s top lobbying group, argued in February that the impact fee has filled state and local coffers with more than $1 billion over the past five years as natural gas has transformed Pennsylvania’s energy profile. The state is on track to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, due largely to increased use of natural gas. (Methane emissions are on the rise, however, according to self-reported industry data released last month by the state DEP. Methane is a greenhouse gas roughly 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide.) “Investing in pipeline projects throughout Pennsylvania would bolster the impact tax, allowing currently shut-in gas to get to market, thereby increasing tax collections,” Stephanie Catarino Wissman, executive director of the American Petroleum Institute’s Pennsylvania branch, said in a statement in February. “This way, all Pennsylvanians benefit by increased impact tax investments and the environmental benefits of increased natural gas usage.”The governor made a 5-percent severance tax a central campaign promise in 2013, when he defeated incumbent Republican Gov. Tom Corbett. Environmentalists criticized Wolf, who received donations from the gas industry, for demonstrating only tepid support for cracking down on fracking polluters. One 2014 headline from the Pulitzer Prize-winning InsideClimate News read: “In Pa.’s Governor Race, It’s Drill, Baby, Drill...and Tax, Maybe, Tax.” Still, Wolf has included a severance tax in each of his three budget proposals since becoming governor. Last year, his proposal for a 6.5-percent tax failed. The latest bill proposes a volume tax that increases with the price of natural gas from 2 cents per thousand cubic feet to 3.5 cents per thousand cubic feet. The tax could generate between $100 million and $250 million annually.But state Sen. Scott Wagner (R) is trying to make the severance tax a central fight in his challenge to Wolf’s re-election. The Republican gubernatorial hopeful last month urged GOP legislators to kibosh any attempt to pass a severance tax, which he said would help Wolf secure a second term.“One thing has become abundantly clear: Too many Republicans in the legislature are more focused on the 2018 elections than on helping Pennsylvania succeed,” Wolf said at a press conference this month. “They would rather see me fail than Pennsylvania succeed. They would rather protect special interests, lobbyists and campaign donors than do the right thing. I’m not going to play their games anymore. I’m drawing a line in the sand.”To fill the budget gap, state legislators are looking to other sources of revenue. In lieu of a drilling tax, the bill debated this month in the House proposed adding a 5-percent tax on hotels, a move lawmakers could justify as putting the burden on visitors from outside the state rather than residents. In a state that invests very little in tourism ― just $4 million compared with New York’s $70 million ― the proposed tax was seen as a sign of how far legislators were willing to go to appease gas producers at the expense of other industries. “To put it bluntly, it would have been devastating,” said Melissa Bova, vice president of government affairs at the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association, a trade group.But even high hotel costs haven’t stopped the state from becoming a major hub for oil and gas industry events. Late last month, Shale Insight Conference, the gas industry’s foremost regional confab, hosted its annual event in Pittsburgh. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer gave the keynote address, telling gas producers they had a friend in President Donald Trump and Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who cultivated cozy ties with the gas industry as Oklahoma’s attorney general. “To the extent that you can, use the coalitions and groups that you have to get those issues to the forefront,” Spicer said. “The administration understands how important what you guys do is for national security, but sometimes it gets held up by the bureaucracy.”He said the industry should continue to “unleash itself.” The room erupted in applause.A week later, the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a private industry advocacy group that functions like a state agency, met in Pittsburgh. Next week, the annual Appalachian Oil & Gas Conference is set to take place at the Hilton DoubleTree in downtown Pittsburgh. For now, Wolf said he remains focused on passing the tax. “I urge House leadership to bring the severance tax to a vote on the floor as soon as they return to Harrisburg next week,” the governor said."

The Virgin brand is licensed for use by a range of businesses from airlines to train companies to telecoms and gyms.Branson wrote that six months ago, after an elaborate set-up involving a note on fake government notepaper, he spoke on the phone to someone purporting to be Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.The man told Branson that a British diplomat had been kidnapped and was being held for ransom by terrorists.He said that while the government did not pay ransoms, there was a particularly sensitive reason why the diplomat had to be saved, and the government was confidentially asking a syndicate of British business people to step in.“I was asked to contribute $5 million of the ransom money, which he assured me the British government would find a way of paying back,” Branson wrote.Feeling suspicious, Branson checked with the government and was told that Fallon had not spoken to him. The matter was reported to the police.Six months on, Branson learned that a friend, whom he described as a very successful businessman in the United States, had been called by a conman posing as him.“When the call happened, the conman did an extremely accurate impression of me and spun a big lie about urgently needing a loan while I was trying to mobilize aid in the BVI (British Virgin Islands),” he wrote.Branson owns a small island in the BVI archipelago which, as was well publicised, was devastated by Hurricane Irma. The caller took advantage of that context.“They claimed I couldn’t get hold of my bank in the UK because I didn’t have any communications going to Europe and I’d only just managed to make a satellite call to the businessman in America,” Branson wrote.“The business person, incredibly graciously, gave $2 million, which promptly disappeared.”A spokesman for Fallon said he was aware of two attempts, one not involving Branson, to impersonate the minister for illicit gain, and Fallon’s office was assisting the police in their efforts to try to catch those responsible."

Many of the alleged and documented atrocities against the minority Muslim group amount to crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing, Amnesty International charges.In its latest report, “My World Is Finished,” the human rights organization identifies specific Myanmar military units linked to a series of gruesome assaults in the country’s Rakhine State that have led at least 530,000 Rohingyas to flee to neighboring Bangladesh in less than two months.On Aug. 25, an insurgent group known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army attacked a number of government security posts, killing 12 state officials. The military’s brutal retaliation has widely targeted Rohingya men, women and children, who already had extremely limited rights in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.Amnesty is among several human rights groups that have documented state-sponsored violence against the Rohingyas during the current crisis, including unlawful killings, sometimes involving the use of landmines; forcible displacement; rape; arson and looting; torture, including beatings and sexual attacks; and other inhumane acts such as the denial of life-sustaining supplies and aid. These “extensive, egregious human rights violations and crimes” have been committed within a context of decades of systemic persecution of Rohingyas in Myanmar, but the Amnesty report described the current “ethnic cleansing campaign” as “beyond anything in the country’s recent history.”Based on more than 150 interviews with survivors and eyewitnesses, the report accuses the Myanmar Army’s Western Command, the 33rd Light Infantry Division and the Border Guard Police of committing the most abhorrent acts of violence.The Western Command in particular “has been intimately involved” in some of the worst abuses, including large-scale killings and targeted burnings, Amnesty’s Matthew Wells told reporters on a conference call. Wells spent the past several weeks at the Myanmar-Bangladesh border.In the report released Tuesday evening, Wells recounted meeting a 12-year-old girl named Fatima whose parents and siblings had been killed. Men in uniform opened fire on her family as they attempted to flee from their burning village, she recalled. Fatima said she saw her family members fall to the ground with bullet wounds as she ran. Then she was shot in the thigh. “I fell down, but my neighbor grabbed me and carried me,” she said.Amnesty sent photos of her injury to a forensic medical expert, who confirmed that she had been shot from behind. Fatima’s account matches other witness testimonies saying the military had shot them as they fled. An “incredibly concerning” number of Rohingyas are arriving in Bangladesh with gunshot wounds, Wells told reporters.Shara Jahan also told her story to Amnesty. The 40-year-old woman was home with her husband and sons when they noticed nearby houses on fire. The men ran outside as she called for her younger children inside the house. Soon, Jahan’s home caught fire. She escaped with severe burns, only to learn that her husband and 20-year-old son had been shot and killed.“No one was there to save me,” she told Amnesty. “We lost our children, we lost our husbands. It is very hard.”Tirana Hassan, Amnesty’s crisis response director, described the military-led crackdown as heinous and disproportionate.“In this orchestrated campaign, Myanmar’s security forces have brutally meted out revenge on the entire Rohingya population of northern Rakhine State, in an apparent attempt to permanently drive them out of the country,” she said.Amnesty’s researchers have asked Myanmar authorities to grant them direct access to Rakhine State, but have yet to receive a response. They’re urging the government to allow human rights groups, journalists and the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission unrestricted access to the region to investigate alleged crimes by both the state and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.The report also calls on international institutions ― including the U.N. Security Council, the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ― to impose a comprehensive arms embargo as well as financial sanctions on senior Myanmar officials reasonably suspected of serious crimes.Myanmar has been accused of downplaying the crisis. The U.N. recently removed a report from its website detailing the Rohingyas’ desperate living conditions after receiving pushback from the Myanmar government. The country’s civil leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, has dismissed mounting reports of atrocities as “misinformation.”U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who will visit South Asia next week, described the Rohingyas’ plight as “heartbreaking” on Wednesday. If the alleged atrocities are true, he said, “someone is going to be held to account for that.”“What’s most important to us is that the world can’t just stand idly by and be witness to the atrocities that are being reported in that area,” Tillerson said. “We really hold the military leadership accountable for what’s happening.”Myanmar’s military and government have repeatedly denied responsibility for the persecution of Rohingyas and have attempted to justify the current crackdown ― actions that fit “a longstanding pattern of impunity,” according to Amnesty.This article has been updated with comment from Tillerson."

The military’s brutal retaliation has widely targeted Rohingya men, women and children, who already had extremely limited rights in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.Amnesty is among several human rights groups that have documented state-sponsored violence against the Rohingyas during the current crisis, including unlawful killings, sometimes involving the use of landmines; forcible displacement; rape; arson and looting; torture, including beatings and sexual attacks; and other inhumane acts such as the denial of life-sustaining supplies and aid. These “extensive, egregious human rights violations and crimes” have been committed within a context of decades of systemic persecution of Rohingyas in Myanmar, but the Amnesty report described the current “ethnic cleansing campaign” as “beyond anything in the country’s recent history.”Based on more than 150 interviews with survivors and eyewitnesses, the report accuses the Myanmar Army’s Western Command, the 33rd Light Infantry Division and the Border Guard Police of committing the most abhorrent acts of violence.The Western Command in particular “has been intimately involved” in some of the worst abuses, including large-scale killings and targeted burnings, Amnesty’s Matthew Wells told reporters on a conference call. Wells spent the past several weeks at the Myanmar-Bangladesh border.In the report released Tuesday evening, Wells recounted meeting a 12-year-old girl named Fatima whose parents and siblings had been killed. Men in uniform opened fire on her family as they attempted to flee from their burning village, she recalled. Fatima said she saw her family members fall to the ground with bullet wounds as she ran. Then she was shot in the thigh. “I fell down, but my neighbor grabbed me and carried me,” she said.Amnesty sent photos of her injury to a forensic medical expert, who confirmed that she had been shot from behind. Fatima’s account matches other witness testimonies saying the military had shot them as they fled. An “incredibly concerning” number of Rohingyas are arriving in Bangladesh with gunshot wounds, Wells told reporters.Shara Jahan also told her story to Amnesty. The 40-year-old woman was home with her husband and sons when they noticed nearby houses on fire. The men ran outside as she called for her younger children inside the house. Soon, Jahan’s home caught fire. She escaped with severe burns, only to learn that her husband and 20-year-old son had been shot and killed.“No one was there to save me,” she told Amnesty. “We lost our children, we lost our husbands. It is very hard.”Tirana Hassan, Amnesty’s crisis response director, described the military-led crackdown as heinous and disproportionate.“In this orchestrated campaign, Myanmar’s security forces have brutally meted out revenge on the entire Rohingya population of northern Rakhine State, in an apparent attempt to permanently drive them out of the country,” she said.Amnesty’s researchers have asked Myanmar authorities to grant them direct access to Rakhine State, but have yet to receive a response. They’re urging the government to allow human rights groups, journalists and the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission unrestricted access to the region to investigate alleged crimes by both the state and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.The report also calls on international institutions ― including the U.N. Security Council, the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ― to impose a comprehensive arms embargo as well as financial sanctions on senior Myanmar officials reasonably suspected of serious crimes.Myanmar has been accused of downplaying the crisis. The U.N. recently removed a report from its website detailing the Rohingyas’ desperate living conditions after receiving pushback from the Myanmar government. The country’s civil leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, has dismissed mounting reports of atrocities as “misinformation.”U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who will visit South Asia next week, described the Rohingyas’ plight as “heartbreaking” on Wednesday. If the alleged atrocities are true, he said, “someone is going to be held to account for that.”“What’s most important to us is that the world can’t just stand idly by and be witness to the atrocities that are being reported in that area,” Tillerson said. “We really hold the military leadership accountable for what’s happening.”Myanmar’s military and government have repeatedly denied responsibility for the persecution of Rohingyas and have attempted to justify the current crackdown ― actions that fit “a longstanding pattern of impunity,” according to Amnesty.This article has been updated with comment from Tillerson."

Gil Caldwell, executive producers of the film “From Selma to Stonewall: Are We There Yet?”, in Selma with the San Francisco Gay Men’s Chorus and Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e79734150000340674646b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“See that place in the road where the boulevard starts, there at the end of the bridge?” Reverend Gil Caldwell and I were standing in the memorial park by the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. “See?” he said,That is where the AL State Troopers stood, about 20 of them in gas masks, each one wearing a belt loaded with tear gas canisters, backed by mounted lawmen; and there is where John Lewis and Hosea Williams stood in their overcoats, ties peeking out, and shoulders back.The space between the groups held that moment, that pause, before the troopers started striking down the peaceful protesters. Even though the violence was already familiar to black Americans, the images of the beatings hit the media, and millions of White Americans viewed awful scenes of unbridled hatred for the first time and right from their living rooms.I watched this same footage 50 years later during post-production of our documentary “From Selma to Stonewall: Are We There Yet?” The standoff is emblazoned in my mind. While it likely lasted for less than a minute, that pause was the moment before change began to unfurl for full voting rights for blacks.Where Gil and I stood in the park we could see the length of the bridge. I pointed to the middle of it and asked, “Is that where Martin Luther King knelt and prayed the day you were here?”He replied,Yes, I was in Selma for what is known as ‘Turnaround Tuesday’ (March 9, 1965). We started across the bridge but then we stopped. King and others at the front knelt in prayer, stood and turned back around. We went back to Brown Chapel. The plans for our security had not been completed, and we could not continue. We foot soldiers didn’t know that we weren’t to go all the way, but, still, our presence was significant.Gil and I had been to Brown Chapel once before when we filmed part of “From Selma to Stonewall: Are We There Yet?” there in 2010. At that time Gil had not been back since 1965; as we stepped into the sanctuary I saw tears come to my friend’s eyes, and watched the memories wash over him.Now, seven years later, Gil and I were standing outside Brown Chapel, and again I saw the tears well up in his eyes. We couldn’t have imagined this moment. As Gil described it:Then the buses arrived with police escorts, lights blinking, even a siren or two. It was like a presidential escort. This time with a chorus of 300 LGBT people and their allies ― who understand America and love it far more than the present occupant of the White House. Their arrival evoked emotions in me that are difficult to describe. When Marilyn and I had gone to Selma a few years ago to film, the response to the two of us was lukewarm because of some hesitation in linking the LGBTQ rights struggle to the black rights struggle. But, as the buses rolled in, I realized Marilyn and I had ‘set the table’ for their arrival. In the black Church we say, ‘God may not come when we want God. But God always comes on time!’ God, whatever you call or don’t call God, was present in the envisioning, planning, implementing, and on the buses! And then the music! I have never been as moved as I was when the two groups let loose, and lifted the roof of the Chapel with their music. It is said, ‘Music has charms to soothe the savage beast.’ The savage beast we know as homophobic heterosexism was more than soothed by the music. It was rendered helpless and irrelevant. I found myself in my mind and heart paraphrasing the words of a song, ‘If loving someone of the same sex is wrong, then our theological understanding of love is wrong!’Back at the edge of the bridge, we crossed over, a human ribbon of purple shirts unfurled down the sidewalks on both sides of the bridge as the members walked across, past where King and others knelt to pray before turning around on that Tuesday in 1965. We paused for a group photograph, a quick gathering in the street, a pause before we continued walking, crossing the line where troopers beat protesters on Bloody Sunday. There were tears, laughter, awe and a deep awareness of this profound moment where we had brought Selma and Stonewall (and the Castro) together.As we begin a week of screenings of our film in North Carolina, we hope you will join us to continue the conversation ― now, more than ever, as our country seems more divided and very much in need of substantive conversation about intersectionality, what we share and how we can make progress together.Marilyn Bennett and the Rev.

Even as Portugal observes a day of national mourning on Wednesday to mark the destruction, the fires are provoking an outcry over the government’s response and stirring up political turmoil.Critics allege that emergency services mismanagement and lax regulations on private landowners have greatly exacerbated the disaster. Opposition politicians and members of the public are demanding that Prime Minister Antonio Costa’s government answer for its failure to prevent so many lost lives.On Tuesday, a small opposition party called for a (largely symbolic) “no confidence” vote against the government. The interior minister, Constanca Urbano de Sousa, resigned a day later after months of political pressure.Silent protests are planned for the weekend in the capital of Lisbon and other cities to demonstrate against the alleged mishandling of one of the country’s deadliest natural disasters.A number of climate factors have helped make this an extreme year for fires, including Portugal’s driest summer in nearly a century and unusually high temperatures. But much of the anger at the government has revolved around the slowness of the emergency response and the longstanding lack of oversight of fire risks on privately held lands.The vast majority of Portugal’s countryside is divided into small, privately owned plots of land.

An independent investigation released earlier this month found that during this summer’s fires, authorities failed to evacuate villages fast enough. Costa blamed the June blazes for destroying lines of communication that would have allowed earlier alerts.This past weekend the prime minister pledged that Portugal would rework the way it deals with forest fires and implement some of the recommendations from the independent report."

73,STYLE,The Politics Of Your Clothes,"OpenSecrets Blog, ContributorPublished by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-politics-of-your-clothes_us_59e7c85de4b0e60c4aa367a8,by Calin Brown Designers are renowned for their bold political statements – from Tommy Hilfiger’s use of white bandanas on,2017-10-18,<p>A clearance clothing rack at T.J.Maxx in Miami.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e7c8a815000009067464fe.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," by Calin Brown Designers are renowned for their bold political statements – from Tommy Hilfiger’s use of white bandanas on the runway this year to fashion designer Tracy Reese’s advocacy for Planned Parenthood.However, many clothing brands and manufacturers choose a more subtle route by speaking with their wallets.During the 2016 election cycle, the clothing manufacturing industry spent $6.8 million on political candidates. Cintas Corp. ($1.3 million), Global Brands Group ($799 million), Calvin Klein Studio ($501,000) and Vera Wang ($393,000) were the biggest spenders.Historically, the industry has split its money evenly between Republican and Democratic candidates.In the 2012 cycle, Republicans garnered 53 percent of the industry’s contributions versus 46 percent for Democrats. For the 2014 midterms, the industry gave the two parties nearly an equal share of its total contributions.The 2016 election cycle was a break from the general trend, as 73 percent of the industry’s donations supported liberal candidates and three of the top four donors contributed exclusively to Democrats.While the clothing industry’s support for the parties is typically evenly split, most clothing companies are noticeably partisan. Often, companies give 100 percent of their overall contributions to one party or the other.In the 2016 cycle, 12 of the top 20 contributors gave entirely to one party — 11 for Democrats; one for Republicans. And of the top 20 contributors, each company gave at least 70 percent of its contributions to one party. Only Guess? Inc. was the exception. Delving into specific company examples further showcases this partisanship.Designer Diane von Furstenberg and her husband, media executive Barry Diller, have bundled more than $2.6 million for the Democratic Party since the 1990s. In 2016, she individually contributed $346,000 combined toward the Hillary Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party and Democratic-affiliated PACs.One hundred percent of the $389,000 spent by Vera Wang and employees affiliated with Wang was also given to Democrats last election cycle, with Wang giving the Clinton campaign $5,400 – the combined maximum an individual can contribute to a candidate for both primary and general elections. The same degree of partisanship could be said of clothing industries who are supportive of Republican Party candidates or committees. In 2016, the Miami-based Perry Ellis International donated nearly exclusively to the Republicans.Cintas, a large manufacturer of corporate uniforms among other products, was the largest contributor in the 2016 cycle. Of the $1.3 million spent by Cintas, 92 percent of it went to Republican candidates. Over the last five years, former CEO Richard Farmer has donated $328,000 to various Republican Party committees while current CEO Scott Farmer has added $151,000, according to FEC filings.So far in the 2018 cycle, contributions by clothing manufacturers continue to be partisan, with nearly all of the top 20 contributors donating solely to one party or the other.However, some non-designer-wear companies, such as American Apparel, Columbia Sportswear and The Hampshire Group, appear to be less notably partisan.Columbia Sportswear gave nearly $47,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee and $33,000 to the DNC Services Corp in 2016. American Apparel, too, appears to be a supporter of both parties as its PAC has donated to predominantly Republicans, while Dov Charney, its CEO, has donated to Democratic Party candidates.The Hampshire Group, a men’s clothing manufacturing company that filed for bankruptcy in 2016, was historically a staunch Democratic Party supporter but has so far donated only to Republicans in the 2018 election cycle.Hampshire’s former director Stevan K. Hill, who has donated the majority of the company’s contributions, said the Republican Party’s economic policies were the major reason for his shift in political support.“Frankly, their regulations are better for small businesses, especially with the potential NAFTA renegotiations,” Hill said.Contributions by Guess? Inc. has also become increasingly divided, with 42 percent of its $61,000 contributions going to Democrats and 58 percent to Republicans in the 2016 election cycle. But like the Hampshire Group, Guess’ contributions have not always leaned Republican. Until 2010, nearly all of the company’s contributions went to members of the Democratic Party or the party itself (with the exception of the 2004 election). In 2012, however, Guess gave nearly equal amounts to both parties, and in 2014, all contributions went to the Republican Party. This shift may be attributed to the change in the donation habits of Guess cofounders Maurice and Paul Marciano, who have in recent years donated increasingly to Republican candidates and Republican Party committees.Despite a few companies’ bipartisan leanings, the industry as a whole remains strikingly partisan, and their strong stance on politics is a reminder that our choice of clothing can be a political statement."

A significant corpus of qualitative and legal data, coupled with unsystematic studies, reveal an alarming number of allegations of sexual violence in the U.S. fire service. While not well documented, these cases have garnered press in the New York Times and Washington Post. Yet, no systematic analysis of sexual violence and harassment in the U.S. fire service has been completed. This is not surprising given the distributed nature of firehouses –there is no national governing body which can mandate studies or dictate terms to local firehouses, many of which (in rural areas) are voluntary. As well, most city firehouses report directly to the city mayors, who may have limited incentives for investigating sexual violence claims and potentially uncovering a scandal.Research on sexual violence in the fire service is only just beginning, but research on closely related service careers (the US military) lends credence to these alarming reports. Statistics show between 19% of female servicewomen and 2% of male servicemen experience sexual violence, with between 15-20,000 sexual assaults reported each year. These reported assaults are widely considered to be an underestimate.Significant qualitative evidence points to a similar yet unexamined pattern in the U.S. fire service. Anecdotal evidence from female members of city fire departments and wildland fire crews around the U.S. (and Canada and Australia, to name a few) consistently report sexual discrimination, harassment, and sexual violence. While not systematic, preliminary polls run by concerned fire chiefs and members of the fire community, as well as one peer reviewed study using focus groups, back up these claims, and personal accounts indicate firefighting is an arena wherediscrimination and sexual violence are comparatively unchecked.Indeed, female firefighters in these qualitative accounts state sexual harassment is the primary factor determining women’s low level of participation in the fire service “… there was a lieutenant that kept touching me and he finally slapped my butt,"" a female firefighter of five years said. “The chief told me, 'Oh, he's just joking. You got to learn to deal with that.’ That was the answer for everything.”The physical demands of the fire service are incredible and often associated with a hyper-masculine culture closely resembling the “boys club” of the military; indeed members tend to switch between each service. Research demonstrates women’s participation in traditionally male-dominated occupations, such as firefighting or the military, do not wreak devastation on readiness or outcomes, even in physically demanding positions. Similar to the military, all men and women must meet the same physical standards to be eligible for both wildland and structure firefighting positions.As Megan MacKenzie puts it when speaking about women soldiers: “the most persistent of these myths—that women are physically unfit for the demands of war, that the public cannot tolerate female casualties, and that female soldiers limit the cohesion of troops in combat—have been rigorously dismantled by scholars and female soldiers alike in recent years.”Fire Engineering and individual fire chiefs have noted women’s presence on a fire crew can enhance problem-solving, improve collaboration, and improve community outreach. Further, given the rise in city fire departments’ responses to medical emergencies, one chief noted women firefighters are better able to relate to women survivors, particularly survivors of domestic violence. Women are integral members of the fire service, yet face damaging stereotypes and assumptions of their worth, workplace discrimination and assault. Regardless of what individuals do or do not add to an occupation, sexual harassment and violence are unacceptable.Rates of harassment in any organization will not suddenly disappear if firehouses hire more women. As David Hollenbach writes: “Women are capable of performing the job requirements of a firefighter, and departments are capable of hiring women in increased numbers. However, hiring qualified women in increased numbers is not enough to perpetuate a meaningful change in the culture. If women are not accepted as members of the group, their success in the organization is often derailed by harassment ... For female firefighters to experience success to the same degree and with the same effort as male firefighters, the respective fire department must have a culture that is inclusive to women.”What does such an “inclusive” culture look like? Research demonstrates rape and sexual violence are not an inevitable part of human nature, and discrimination, harassment and sexual violence are a cultural phenomenon. Consequently, with the right approach, this is a preventable problem. Sociologists CJ Pascoe and Jocelyn Hollander describe “rape culture” as a culture in which rape is simultaneously abhorred but common. Rape culture finds much of its foundation in “symbolic” sexual violence: jokes and lewd comments about rape and assault.Even comments or actions that are not explicitly sexual (e.g., complimenting a woman’s appearance or demeanor in a work context instead of her qualifications or skills) result in an attitude where sexual violence is more permissible. Men can joke about sexual violence and thus demean women. But simultaneously, these men distance themselves from “those other men” who rape, by claiming they would “never do a thing like that,” even while their words sustain the very culture that enables discrimination, harassment and rape.Indeed, studies show that fraternities in which rape culture is emboldened are those in which rape is also frequent. Likewise, military organizations that empower women may be less likely to perpetrate rape against other groups.How can the relationship between the “band of brothers” culture and sexual discrimination, harassment and violence be changed? These changes require leadership from people in positions of power (read: men).Jackson Katz, a consultant on these issues for the U.S. Marine Corps, argues men in positions of power need to take the lead on changing the culture around these issues and argues sexual harassment and violence are, in fact, “men’s issues.” He states men in leadership positions need to consider this an integral part of their leadership approach rather than relegating it to “sensitivity” or “diversity” training. He argues we need a non-bystander culture and leadership, in which men and boys who harass women lose status rather than become valorized for their misogyny.Teams of individuals, whether fighting wildfires or sharing an office, will be stronger for serving all of its members. #MeToo provides a stark backdrop to these stories, which should be taken seriously.Emily Kalah Gade, Ph.D., is a research scientist in the Department of Political Science and a WRF & Moore/Sloan Innovation in Data Science postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington in Seattle.

(One grower who asked to remain unnamed told HuffPost their losses exceed $1 million.) And since the industry also has limited access to conventional banks, loans that could put farmers back on their feet will be hard to come by.The lack of conventional banking services hits hard in other unexpected areas as well. One farmer who spoke to HuffPost kept significant amounts of cash on hand due to federal banking restrictions. When the fire hit, it literally burned through their revenue that they kept in a storage area on the farm.Erich Pearson, CEO of the San Francisco Patient and Resource Center, is one grower who sustained devastating losses. His roughly 400-acre farm in Glen Ellen is just down the road from where the Nuns Canyon Fire started last Sunday, expanding rapidly into a behemoth that’s so far destroyed 54,423 acres.“We lost just about everything, really,” he told HuffPost. “We have some plants still left in greenhouses, but ... everything we had harvested to date went up in flames in one of the mini barns that burned to the ground.”“All of the structures, with the exception of one home, were burned down. There were four homes on the property, three homes have burned down and all of the barns,” he said.Pearson declined to put a dollar amount on the losses, but noted it’s harvest season, so many growers ― himself included ― had their entire year’s crop on hand.Despite the setback, Pearson considers himself lucky. He plans to rebuild and replant in time for the next growing season, describing his crew as “a resilient bunch.”“We are a pretty big organization,” he said. “This is not all of our eggs in one basket, so we can take a hit and keep moving forward.”“For a lot of small farmers though we’re concerned,” he added. “This is the year that regulations are kicking in and also the price of cannabis is falling, so a lot of growers are growing more than they normally do, have invested more to grow that larger quantity and also have spent a significant amount of resources on regulatory compliance in anticipation of a new market, building structures, and things like that.” California produces vast amounts of marijuana. Farmers saw a bumper crop this season, which ensured that these losses, while devastating to individual farmers, are unlikely to impact pricing elsewhere in the state.Farmers in this northern region of the Golden State, known colloquially as the “Emerald Triangle,” have been growing the plant since the 1960s. The industry blossomed in 1996 when California became the first state in the nation to legalize marijuana for medical purposes. Now more than 20 years later, 28 other states have also legalized medical marijuana and California, along with seven other states, have legalized the plant for adult recreational purposes.About an hour north of Pearson’s operation, Ashley Oldham of Frost Flower Farms in Redwood Valley had a harrowing tale of escape, leaving behind a thriving business and a home that burned to the ground minutes after she evacuated.Oldham told HuffPost she awoke around 3 a.m. Sunday to a friend banging on her door and screaming, as she was otherwise totally unaware the hills surrounding her house were on fire.“I’d been hearing these big banging sounds and kind of woke up to that a couple times, but for some reason in my half-dreaming state I thought it was the sound of my greenhouse doors slamming,” she said.“That’s when I realized those exploding sounds were actually the propane tanks exploding all around me throughout the neighborhood.” While she initially estimated she had 30 minutes to evacuate, the 100-foot flames descended on her property almost immediately. Aided by her friend, she grabbed her daughter, her dogs and a filing cabinet, then fled.“Within 15 minutes of me getting out, my house burned to the ground,” she said. “All my product and all of my money didn’t make it.”Oldham credits her friend ― whom she says deserves “superhero status” ― with saving her and her daughter’s life.Though she lost all of her harvest this year and her property sustained serious damage, Oldham plans to rebuild. She hopes the county can show some flexibility in its permit requirements for people like her.As an example, she noted for her to be in compliance with county code she has to have a fence, a permitted residence and a permitted septic system on site. All of those were destroyed overnight in the fire.“Are they going to give me time, like waive that for a year while I rebuild?” She wondered. “I would hope so.”“It’s my life’s work, lost.”"
