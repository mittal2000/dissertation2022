While still a pitch-black comedy, it’s set to take place in present day. The titular roles of Heather McNamara, Heather Duke and Heather Chandler will become, respectively, a black lesbian played by Jasmine Mathews, a genderqueer boy played by Brendan Scannell, and a third individual played by Melanie Field, who has been described as having the body of Martha “Dumptruck” Dunnstock. Whether Doherty will reprise her role as the original Heather Duke, who takes over for Heather Chandler as teen queen before Veronica deposes her, remains to be seen. But it seems unlikely given the new series’ direction.Doherty’s announcement comes after news of her breast cancer diagnosis broke in early 2015. The actress has been open and outspoken about her treatments, which recently caused her to miss a reunion of fellow “Beverly Hills 90210” cast mates."
1,ENTERTAINMENT,Chrissy Teigen Wants You To Survive Your Post-Election Thanksgiving,Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chrissy-teigens-tips-to-surviving-your-first-post-election-thanksgiving_us_582b7063e4b0e39c1fa6ac8b,Booze. And more booze.,2016-11-23,Teigen and Legend campaigning for Hillary Clinton together in October.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58349d411700002500e7be54.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Thanksgiving for Americans around the country is especially fraught this year. With only mashed potatoes and stuffing standing between you and that one uncle who’s dedicated his Facebook feed to boycotting a Broadway show he’ll never get tickets to, “thankful” might not be the word best used to describe the current predicament. That’s why we turned to Chrissy Teigen for some much-needed guidance on how to survive the holidays with family members of differing political persuasions. As necessary as it for us all to reach out across the dinner table and engage ― if not us, then who else? ― it’s just as vital to practice self-care and remember there’s a reason you only see these people once a year. Teigen also revealed how she plans to celebrate Thanksgiving ― her first with baby daughter Luna ― and why she hopes 2017 will be better than the endless barrage of garbage that was 2016. “Drinking always helps, especially this year,” the supermodel, who has partnered with Stella Artois this holiday season, told The Huffington Post about coping with conservative relatives. “It’s hard because people get in such huge fights around the dinner table. I think obviously try and never talk about politics or religion, but it’s going to come up, especially if you’re in my house or John’s home and everyone has very strong opinions all the time.”“This is going to be a fun one for families,” she continued. “I have heard a lot about people completely unfriending people they thought were great friends on Facebook.”Over the course of the election, Teigen has emerged as a much-needed voice of sanity on social media, unafraid to go toe-to-toe with our president-elect while dispensing sage advice on how to keep it real amid the craziness. Twitter, she says, has been especially toxic recently, which prompted her to make her account private one month before Election Day in an act of self-care. “The reason why things are so heated and people seem meaner and more divided has everything to do with the election, of course,” Teigen said. “Going private is very freeing. I was reading everything and I read way too much ... It wasn’t that I didn’t want to hear differing opinions. It was I didn’t want to hear hatred.”As social media has become an increasingly unfriendly place for a celebrity to voice their political opinion, Teigen says she’s relied on an old love ― no, not John ― to help her unplug when she needs a breather from the political circus. “My escape has always been reality television,” Teigen admitted, placing a special importance for her love of the “Real Housewives” franchise. “It’s like the background noise that makes you feel sane can relax now, even though people are screaming at each other.”“If I’m nervous or anxious about something, I need pure silence,” she added. “Even music doesn’t tend to calm me down in the same way unless it’s a rough flight and I’m alone and I listen to John to feel like he’s with me.”But she’ll turn off Bravo ― at least for a little while ― to make Luna’s first Thanksgiving one to remember, even if she’s too young to partake in any of Teigen’s mouth-watering culinary creations. When Thursday rolls around, Teigen will be celebrating Thanksgiving with her mother, who lives with her and Legend, and will welcome the singer’s family into their newly renovated Beverly Hills home.“Family is so important around the holidays, for me at least, so I want them around,” she said. “We’re going to have his whole family and my whole family as well for Thanksgiving. I can’t wait to see everybody gathered around our big table.”After a year of cookbook promoting, “Lip Sync Battle” hosting and political campaigning, Teigen says she’s ready to slow down and focus on her family in 2017.“I would love another child. I don’t know how soon, but if it happened tomorrow that would be great,” she said. “But I’m not gonna take on what I did last year. I want to enjoy my family and my daughter and go on tour with John more. Maybe, I’ll fulfill my destiny of being a Real Housewife.”From her lips to Andy Cohen’s ears. "

Wee heard from women after Hillary Clinton’s presidential loss. The Australian photojournalist attended a viewing party on the night of Nov. 8, organized by women’s advocacy group Ladies Get Paid. Wee was eager to capture what many had assumed would be a historic night for women. “I wanted to revel in the excitement that these women would have felt given that they have devoted their lives to fighting for gender equality,” Wee told The Huffington Post. But the outcome was not what the group had hoped for. As more swing states went red, the atmosphere at the party completely changed. “It was like all the energy had been sucked out by a vacuum,” Wee said. “Everyone was frustrated by what was happening, and even more confused by why it was happening. People were crying in corners. Seeing tears get shed was the moment I realized how threatened people felt.” To capture the overwhelming emotion in the aftermath of the election, Wee photographed every woman at the viewing party. Later that week, he reached out to them to discuss how they felt post-election and what they’re doing to mobilize and stay empowered. The series, titled “Where Do We Go From Here?,” is a powerful commentary on the 2016 election, misogyny and the growing importance of feminist organizing. The women, who are primarily in their 20s and 30s, expressed a spectrum of emotional sentiments about Clinton’s loss. Some discussed how angry they were at the role sexism played in this election, while others seemed ready to mobilize. “I witnessed all these public displays of feminism and solidarity, and in the moment of watching [Donald] Trump win, I felt like all that was undone,” one woman named Claire told Wee. Another woman named Isata was a bit more optimistic: “I’m feeling really inspired by how many people have been moved to action,” she told Wee. “I’ve been on email chains that are filled with information on how we can raise our individual voices, collectively organize and ensure that the election results don’t permanently disenfranchise the people that Trump and his cabinet have targeted throughout their careers.” Scroll below to see Wee’s portraits and read the powerful comments he heard from women.

Mike McCaul (R-Texas) fears Democrats may ""burrow"" into Trump administration jobs. He wants them purged.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5835f5fb180000230c30fbbc.jpeg?cache=uk7OwSBwoW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― There used to be a time when the big fear of homeland security officials was Soviet moles infiltrating American institutions. Now it appears to be that Democrats may be “burrowing’ into the Donald Trump-led government.At least, that’s the concern of Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who sent a letter Wednesday to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson seeking to purge President Barack Obama’s appointees.“Concerns exist that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) non-career positions might be ‘converted’ to career positions,” McCaul wrote. “Known as ‘burrowing,’ this practice can damage trust with a new Administration and undermine its new priorities.”As evidence for concern, McCaul points to two such conversions at DHS agencies in the Obama administration. He also notes a Government Accountability Office study that documented 139 conversions, including 17 at DHS. Those conversions, however, came in the final years of the Bush administration, when Republican appointees became permanent employees in the incoming Democratic administration.Indeed, the Bush administration was widely criticized for politicizing appointments of U.S. attorneys and for botching the Hurricane Katrina response because inexperienced, unqualified Republican political appointees couldn’t do the civil service jobs they took.The Obama administration tightened rules for converting political jobs to career civil servant jobs in the wake of such problems. All conversions had to be evaluated by the Office of Personnel Management after 2010.McCaul noted that OPM recently announced a moratorium on conversions. Nevertheless, he demanded that Johnson be especially careful preventing politically motivated Democrats from burrowing into the Trump administration.“I urge you to enforce applicable laws governing employee conversions from political to career positions,” McCaul wrote. “Such vigilance is vital to maintaining the principle the the federal workforce should be free from political influence.”“The President-elect has the right to pick his own team, and allowing Obama appointees to embed themselves into the bureaucracy for the long haul could create unnecessary interference,” McCaul said in statement announcing his letter.Do you work in a federal agency?

4,MEDIA,Donald Trump Has Brought The Fight For Press Freedom Home,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-press-freedom_us_5835a75fe4b000af95ed5f01,"“As a profession, let’s fight for what is right,” CNN's Christiane Amanpour said. “Let’s fight for our values.""",2016-11-23,"Christiane Amanpour spoke at the Committee to Protect Journalists’ annual fundraising dinner on Tuesday, and said journalists need to fight for their values both at home and abroad.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5835cd1e1a00000b03cc9840.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― CNN’s Christiane Amanpour has been to many fundraising dinners for the Committee to Protect Journalists, but none like Tuesday night’s gala. “I never thought in a million years that I would be standing up here, after all the times I’ve participated in this ceremony, appealing, really, for the freedom and the safety of American journalists at home,” she said at the event. Others echoed her sentiment during a dinner honoring the brave work of journalists from Egypt (Mahmoud “Shawkan” Abou Zeid), India (Malini Subramaniam), El Salvador (Óscar Martínez) and Turkey (Can Dündar). Journalists in the U.S. don’t face nearly the intimidation and repression of those working in countries where freedom of the press isn’t enshrined in the Constitution. But President-elect Donald Trump’s attacks and restrictions on the press during the 2016 campaign, and his refusal to provide traditional levels of access during his presidential transition, have alarmed journalists who have identified potential threats at home.  In October, CPJ’s board issued and unprecedented statement labeling Trump “a threat to press freedom unknown in modern history.” It’s not only that Trump could damage the media at home, they argued, but that journalists abroad would become more vulnerable if the U.S. was no longer seen as a beacon for free speech and an independent press. “The fight for press freedom is also quite close to home. It’s right here,” New Yorker editor David Remnick said. “The advocates for limiting that freedom have made their feelings very well known. And we have all heard the anti-media rhetoric, the attacks on journalists, the exclusion of reporters viewed as unfriendly during the presidential campaign.”Remnick, who replaced the late Gwen Ifill as the dinner’s host, paid tribute to the PBS anchor during his speech. He described Ifill as one of the “finest, most honest, and most ferociously decent broadcast journalists at a time when we need her most.” He urged journalists assembled in the Waldorf Astoria ballroom to follow her example and report “factually, fairly, with an open mind, but above all, fearlessly.”Remnick also said U.S. journalists “must defend our own First Amendment” in order to advocate for those imprisoned abroad. There are currently 240 journalists behind bars around the world, the highest tally in the 35 years that CPJ has existed.“For us to go silent ensures that they will remain under the boot,” he said. CNN chief Jeff Zucker, who was part of a group of top networks executives and anchors to meet with Trump on Monday, said the people at that private gathering had urged the president-elect to “preserve longstanding traditions that ensure coverage of his presidency.”The group of influential television figures have faced criticism in recent days for allowing Trump to hold the entire meeting off the record ― especially because The New York Times held a meeting with the president-elect the following day and insisted it be on the record. By agreeing to such conditions, the TV news stars couldn’t report on a newsworthy event that was clearly in the public’s interest. They also looked foolish as details leaked about how Trump ripped them ― and Zucker personally ― for their 2016 coverage.“It is still too early to draw conclusions about how this administration will work with the media,” Zucker said. “But I think it is fair to say based on some of what we saw during the campaign, we have some reason for concern.”Either way, he said, the media must “hold the new administration’s feet to the fire.”Amanpour accepted the Burton Benjamin Memorial Award for her career reporting and advocating for press freedom, and gave a speech in which she likened Trump’s recent tweet claiming protesters were being incited by the media as similar to the behavior of authoritarian leaders. “As all the international journalists in this room who we honor tonight know only too well, and who we honor ever single year: First the media is accused of inciting, then sympathizing, then associating ― and then suddenly find themselves accused of being full-fledged terrorists and subversives,” Amanpour said. “Then they end up in handcuffs, in cages, in kangaroo courts, in prisons ― and then who knows?”Trump’s attacks on the press have drawn comparisons to autocrats like Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has dismantled the country’s independent press by exercising sweeping executive powers gained after a failed coup attempt. Amanpour mentioned how Erdogan said recently that he can’t understand why people would protest against the recent election and how America “needs a strongman to get things done.”Amanpour gave a rousing defense of the press’ role in a democracy, but also voiced some criticism. While watching the race from abroad, she admitted she was “shocked by the exceptionally high bar put before one candidate and the exceptionally low bar put before another candidate.” “It also appeared that much of the press, much of the media, was tying itself in knots trying to differentiate between balance, between objectivity, neutrality and, crucially, truth,” she said. The press, she added, should be “truthful, not neutral,” and stop “banalizing the truth.”She urged reporters to “commit to real reporting across a real nation, a real world in which journalism and democracy are in mortal peril,” investigate wrongdoing and corruption, and to not give into an elitist backlash against the press. “As a profession, let’s fight for what is right,” she said. “Let’s fight for our values. Bad things, as we all know, do happen when good people do nothing.”"

A rep for the singer confirmed the news to The Huffington Post via email on Wednesday. Word got out that the iconic singer was reportedly performing at the president-elect’s inauguration in January after Anthony Scaramucci, a member of Trump’s transition team, revealed the news to the BBC. “Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the Mall for the inauguration,” he said. A few of John’s songs, including “Rocket Man” and “Tiny Dancer,” were played at Trump rallies throughout his campaign, much to the dismay of the “Crocodile Rock” singer. “Elton’s music has not been requested for use in any official capacity by Donald Trump. Any use of his music should not be seen as an endorsement of Donald Trump by Elton,” a publicist for the singer said in a statement. John himself has also spoken out about Trump using his music, telling The Guardian in February, “I don’t really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign. I’m British.”“I’ve met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it’s nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I’m not a Republican in a million years,” he added. “Why not ask Ted fucking Nugent? Or one of those fucking country stars? They’ll do it for you.” Perhaps Trump should take his advice here. "

Three years ago, Obama had pardoned almost as many turkeys as he had humans. But that’s since changed, following the launch of the administration’s clemency push. The president has now issued more clemency actions than his three presidential predecessors combined. As of this week, he’s pardoned 70 Americans and commuted prison sentences for 1,023 people, including more than 300 serving life sentences.Listen to Huffington Post reporter Ryan J. Reilly explain Obama’s pardons and commutations on “So That Happened,” the HuffPost Politics podcast: America’s founding fathers gave the president the “power to grant Reprieves and Pardons” in the Constitution. Prisoners convicted of federal crimes can apply for commutations, which will reduce their sentences. Only people who have been released from prison can apply for pardons, which signify forgiveness and can restore voting and gun ownership rights. “What President Obama has done for commutations is unprecedented in the modern era,” White House lawyer Neil Eggleston said in a blog post this month. Obama has focused on commuting excessive drug sentences, effectively sending a message to Congress about the need for criminal justice reform.  “Only Congress can achieve the broader reforms needed to ensure our federal sentencing system operates more fairly and effectively in the service of public safety,” Eggleston wrote.There’s no telling what President-elect Donald Trump, the self-styled “law and order” candidate, will do with his clemency powers, but criminal justice advocates don’t have much hope (especially given Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions’ views on drug sentences and clemency). But he should be unable to reverse any of his predecessor’s commutations, even for those who are still incarcerated but have had their sentences shortened by Obama."

This is no exercise class. For many of the women, it’s a chance to change their lives: they are learning to defend themselves against the widespread gender-based violence in their communities. The company that runs the class, SheFighter, is technically a self-defense academy for women. But founder Lina Khalifeh considers it the start of a movement.“I have to empower all women in the world,” says Khalifeh, 32, as she leans against a bright pink wall, a common color theme throughout her studio. “I want to see an army of women everywhere just from SheFighter.”But before she takes things global – a goal that seems feasible, considering she recently trained actress Emma Watson in Canada – Khalifeh is determined to make a lasting impact in her home country of Jordan, where women are routinely subjected to abuse in the home and harassment on the street.“We motivate women from the inside to start standing up for themselves,” she says. “One person can’t really change laws in Jordan, but if you have the whole female community asking the government to change a law, I think they would consider it.”SheFighter was just an idea in 2009, when Khalifeh – a 20-time martial-arts gold medalist – began training women in her parents’ basement. She had recently found out that her college friend was being abused by her father and brother, and her instinctual reaction was to teach women how to fight back. Three years later, she made things official by moving her underground passion project into an aboveground studio space. Since then, she has armed roughly 12,000 women and girls with the mental and physical strength they need to be able to fend off encounters like the ones her friend had to endure.“It’s mostly self-confidence,” says Khalifeh of SheFighter’s core lesson. Every month, around 150 students learn a combination of taekwondo, boxing and self-defense techniques for real-life scenarios like, “What’s going to happen if three men attack you?”Khalifeh tells the story of a former student who used her SheFighter skills to stop a man from raping her in an elevator. “She kept on pushing him and hitting him hard until he escaped,” she recalls, adding that the student chased the man down the street until the police arrived. While the perpetrator did end up in jail, Khalifeh says the sentence was reduced after her student had no choice but to drop some of the charges against him because she stood up for herself. “The policeman said to her, ‘Well, you were hitting him, too.’”Still, the student’s case turned out better than most in the country, where there is no guarantee of jail time for men who harass, attack or even kill women, especially when the act is committed in the so-called name of honor.Hadeel Abdel Aziz, executive director of the Justice Center for Legal Aid in Jordan, has supported hundreds of victims of gender-based violence over the years. She says that, while verbal and sexual harassment are prevalent in the streets of Jordan, the country’s No. 1 issue regarding violence against women is domestic violence.A 2012 survey funded by the Jordanian government found that out of the roughly 11,000 married women interviewed across the country’s 12 governorates, 32 percent had experienced emotional, physical and/or sexual violence at the hands of their spouses. And of those, 22 percent reported having endured one or more forms of violence over the previous year. One in two women said they had never sought help or even disclosed to anyone the violence they had experienced at home.Aziz says many women are simply too scared, too dependent on the abuser or too mistrusting of the legal system to come forward and press charges. Even if they do file a complaint, she adds, there are a lot of steps that need to be taken before protection is enforced and justice is served. While Jordan did pass a domestic violence law in 2008, women’s rights activists continue to criticize it for its restrictive definition of domestic violence and emphasis on reconciliation over the protection of women’s rights.“The system needs a lot of strengthening, whether it’s encouraging more women to come forward or how we actually process the complaint,” says Aziz. “There’s still a lot of men who go unpunished, and they’re likely to get away with it.”Khalifeh is well aware of the systemic impunity – it’s something she hopes to help change by inspiring women to protect themselves, in the home, on the street and in the legal sphere. But, ultimately, she wants to stop gender-based violence and harassment from happening in the first place. And she thinks providing women with the confidence to break free of the submissive role that society has placed on them is one way to do that.“We’re not weak,” says Khalifeh. “And if I see [my students] cry, I’m really hard on them: ‘You need to go to the bathroom, wash your face, and get in the training room right now.’ With time, they feel more empowered.”Dania Natsheh, 18, has practiced and, now as a coach, preached this philosophy at SheFighter for the past two and a half years. After reading about the self-defense academy online, she enrolled in the program as a way to get over her debilitating shyness and fear of walking alone outside. Watching her pummel the punching bag while wearing SheFighter’s trademark pink gloves, it’s difficult to imagine her ever being that afraid.“When you live in a community that’s wanting to control you, it’s hard,” she says. “So I needed to gain the confidence to be able to defend myself and know what to do in certain situations.”While she’s been fortunate enough not to have had to use the physical training she’s learned at SheFighter, Natsheh has at times tapped into the emotional and mental skills to stop harassment on the street. “Sometimes you just need to say the right word to them to shut it down,” she says of the men who make crude comments to her or follow her in their cars. “Other times, it’s a look or a walk with confidence that will keep them away from you.”Khalifeh’s mission is to help every girl and young woman find that confidence, one at a time. And, to her, that is how you build an army of change.“Twenty years from now, I want to see branches all over the world,” says Khalifeh. “Yeah,” she continues, as if lost in her own thoughts. “It’s a movement.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

This is no exercise class. For many of the women, it’s a chance to change their lives: they are learning to defend themselves against the widespread gender-based violence in their communities. The company that runs the class, SheFighter, is technically a self-defense academy for women. But founder Lina Khalifeh considers it the start of a movement.“I have to empower all women in the world,” says Khalifeh, 32, as she leans against a bright pink wall, a common color theme throughout her studio. “I want to see an army of women everywhere just from SheFighter.”But before she takes things global – a goal that seems feasible, considering she recently trained actress Emma Watson in Canada – Khalifeh is determined to make a lasting impact in her home country of Jordan, where women are routinely subjected to abuse in the home and harassment on the street.“We motivate women from the inside to start standing up for themselves,” she says. “One person can’t really change laws in Jordan, but if you have the whole female community asking the government to change a law, I think they would consider it.”SheFighter was just an idea in 2009, when Khalifeh – a 20-time martial-arts gold medalist – began training women in her parents’ basement. She had recently found out that her college friend was being abused by her father and brother, and her instinctual reaction was to teach women how to fight back. Three years later, she made things official by moving her underground passion project into an aboveground studio space.

14,POLITICS,Even Oil Companies In Europe Are Preparing For Climate Change,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-european-oil_us_5835f6bce4b09b6056000f80,"Meanwhile, the U.S. braces for a climate denier president and American companies lag far behind.",2016-11-23,"This chart, showing the companies in order of size, shows which firms are exposed to natural gas (pink), crude oil (red) and tar sand oil (dark red). ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5835f936180000270c30fbcf.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The United States and Europe have long differed on climate change. Even conservative parties in Europe acknowledge the science behind the issue, while the Republican Party remains the sole major party in the developed world to deny the evidence. Voters in eco-conscious Washington state rejected the country’s first attempt at a carbon tax on Nov. 8, whereas Finland became the first country to put a price on emissions 26 years ago. President-elect Donald Trump’s remarks about wanting to pull out of the Paris climate accord were met last week with threats of a special tax on U.S. goods ― from a famously conservative and pro-American French presidential candidate.Yet nowhere is the transatlantic divide more stark than in the industry peddling the products that literally fuel global warming.U.S. oil and gas companies invest less in clean energy and more in ultrapolluting tar sands compared to their European counterparts, and they fail to disclose information to investors about the financial risks posed by global warming, according to a report released this week by the British shareholder advocate CDP.“The performance between Europeans and Americans is quite stark, with Europeans making steps in the right direction to hedge themselves against the changes which are going to happen in the world,” Tarek Soliman, senior analyst of investor research at CDP, told The Huffington Post on Wednesday.European giants have invested more heavily in cleaner-burning natural gas and renewable energy sources, and have found ways to cut back on emissions that leak during the extraction process. Norway’s state-owned Statoil ranked first on CDP’s list for increasing its reserves of gas. It also reduced emissions from methane, a potent greenhouse gas, better than any rivals. Italian major Eni plans to invest over $1.05 billion in solar projects in Italy, Algeria, Pakistan and Egypt, and currently produces no oil from tar sands. French behemoth Total is on track to convert one-fifth of its portfolio to low-carbon fuels by 2035, and recently acquired solar and battery storage companies.By contrast, Texas-based Exxon Mobil ― currently embroiled in a high-profile legal fight with state attorneys general over its role in a climate change cover-up scandal ― ranked below all of its U.S. and European rivals on emissions and corporate governance on climate risk. Chevron has failed to invest heavily in natural gas and “performs below average” on most CDP metrics. ConocoPhillips had the second-highest exposure to tar sands after Canadian giant Suncor, which ranked at the bottom of CDP’s 11-company list. “If you’re in oil sands production, that’s not a good thing,” Soliman said. “If you’re in gas, that’s better. If you’re in crude, that’s somewhere in the middle.” The core issue may be that European investors seem more focused on the long-term financial stability of their companies. Even if Trump finagles a way for the U.S. to exit a treaty that has been enacted, the Paris agreement has already signaled the beginning of the world’s shift away from a carbon-fueled economy. “We’ve seen investors in Europe put pressure on companies to disclose and stress test their business models against climate change action,” Soliman said. “They have certainly been more vocal in their concern that climate change action and the Paris agreement will represent a fundamental change in business models and therefore encourage companies which they hold shares in to adapt future models so they can not only survive but flourish.” Adding Trump into the mix only complicates things. The incoming president has called climate change “a hoax” and has vowed to push policies to bolster the coal and oil industries. He has also signaled his desire to boost Canada’s tar sands industry by supporting U.S. pipeline projects, such as the Keystone XL, which President Barack Obama rejected last year.But, then again, Trump is notorious for changing his mind, depending on who is in his audience. “There’s uncertainty with Donald Trump,” Soliman said, “in that the only certainty we have is he’ll be in power for four years.” "

17,POLITICS,Refugees In The U.S. Wonder If They'll Still Have A Home In Trump's America,Willa Frej and Rowaida Abdelaziz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/refugees-home-trump-america_us_581cbeaee4b0aac62483e998,"“Every place we have gone something bad has happened,” a Somali woman said. “Now, we don’t know where to go.”",2016-11-23,"Amira Darbi (left) and her children Nabiha, Shaker and Hajar have been living in New Jersey since July 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5835d8bd1700002500e7c183.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"ST. PAUL, Minnesota ― The Hasen children came home from school a few weeks ago telling their mother that their fellow Somali classmates were threatening to leave the country because they worried that Donald Trump, who had just won the election, wanted them out. Their mother, Nasra, said she was horrified and had no idea how to respond.She and six of her eight children only just got here. They moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, in May of this year as refugees who have been on the move, from Somalia through various parts of the Middle East, since 2007. But her flight mode has yet again been activated since the man preparing to assume the highest office in the land has so vocally denigrated Muslims and refugees.“Every place we have gone something bad has happened,” she said. “Now, we don’t know where to go.”Hasen is one of many resettled refugees who have expressed astonishment, apprehension and confusion at this time of presidential transition in the U.S. The Huffington Post also spoke with several Syrian refugees living in Clarkston, Georgia, about 40 minutes outside of Atlanta. None of those interviewed wished to go on the record with their names out of fear for the safety of family members still in the Middle East.One 65-year-old woman said she worries that if Trump enacts a ban on Muslim immigrants or makes changes to the refugee resettlement program, her family members awaiting resettlement approval won’t be able to join her here.She’s particularly concerned about one of her sons stuck in Egypt whose child is disabled, she added. His family’s application for resettlement is pending as the vetting process, which usually takes between 18 and 24 months, is still underway. Another man, here with his pregnant wife and young child, said he fears outright expulsion from the U.S. Would it be to his home country of Syria, he wondered, or to one of the many countries that people flee to, like Jordan or Turkey?“Are they going to send me back to Bashar [al Assad]?” he said. Not everyone, however, buys into the Trump hysteria.A third refugee, who used to teach Arabic in Syria, said he doesn’t believe that Trump will follow through with what he pledged during the campaign. And besides, he said, there would be many legal obstacles.“There is Congress, there is the Supreme Court and the American people,” he said. “They will not let him do all of this.”He doubts that people ultimately want to see their country fall behind by 60 or 70 years. But if it really does happen, he said, “we are all in trouble.”The Darbis, a Syrian refugee family of five that HuffPost has been following for more than a year, expressed similar doubts about Trump’s proclamations. They all stayed up late on Nov. 8 to watch their first presidential election in the U.S. from their apartment in Jersey City, New Jersey, said Mohamed, the father.He, like the professor in Clarkston, said he thinks that Trump won’t actually follow through on most of what he’s proposed. But he did voice some concern about some of the people who Trump is adding to his Cabinet ― specifically future advisers, like Chris Kobach, who have advocated for a Muslim registry.“Do you think it will actually happen?” he wondered.He didn’t bother hiding his cynicism around the rise in acts of hate since the election, either.“Trump is normalizing a lot of the hateful rhetoric out there already,” Mohamed said. “I feel like a lot of Americans now feel more comfortable saying hateful things.”He and his wife, Amira, both said they felt at ease being in Jersey City because it’s so diverse. Mohamed hasn’t encountered any problems at work, he said, and his children’s teachers have assured the students that they have nothing to worry about. Except that Nabiha, the eldest, was the victim of an anti-Muslim comment.A handful of Hispanic students in her eighth-grade class told her that they were happy about Trump’s win. “You guys are so bad,” they said to her, referencing Muslims. The agencies that are responsible for resettling refugees say they’re just as confused as the refugees themselves but are focused on moving forward and helping people establish new lives.“There’s just so much uncertainty, confusion and certainly anxiety around the future of immigrants and refugees in this country,” said Elizabeth Ross, the refugee communities coordinator at the International Institute of Minnesota, a local resettlement group.The U.S. resettled a total of 84,995 refugees in the 2016 fiscal year, which ended in September, according to Refugee Processing Center statistics. Almost 10,000 have already been resettled since then.The Obama administration pledged to increase the number of refugees brought into the U.S. earlier this year. Up to 110,000 refugees can be offered new lives in the 2017 fiscal year, up from 70,000 in 2015 and 85,000 in 2016. What Trump will do to these quotas is anybody’s guess.“Right now we’re operating under the assumption that all of our programs will continue, that the administration will not reverse such a significant commitment to refugee protection and resettlement,” said Mark Hetfield, CEO of HIAS, one of the nine national resettlement agencies. “But there’s plenty of cause for concern.”One area of concern, he said, is the campaign to end Muslim immigration. “It would be a catastrophe in terms of the messages sent to religious minorities, in terms of how they will be treated when they get here,” he said.A second is the amount of divisive rhetoric that the Trump campaign has enabled, he said, echoing Mohamed Darbi.“It’s not just about what Trump might do,” he said. “A lot of people are now saying negative things about refugees and minorities.

PAUL, Minnesota ― The Hasen children came home from school a few weeks ago telling their mother that their fellow Somali classmates were threatening to leave the country because they worried that Donald Trump, who had just won the election, wanted them out. Their mother, Nasra, said she was horrified and had no idea how to respond.She and six of her eight children only just got here. They moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, in May of this year as refugees who have been on the move, from Somalia through various parts of the Middle East, since 2007. But her flight mode has yet again been activated since the man preparing to assume the highest office in the land has so vocally denigrated Muslims and refugees.“Every place we have gone something bad has happened,” she said. “Now, we don’t know where to go.”Hasen is one of many resettled refugees who have expressed astonishment, apprehension and confusion at this time of presidential transition in the U.S. The Huffington Post also spoke with several Syrian refugees living in Clarkston, Georgia, about 40 minutes outside of Atlanta. None of those interviewed wished to go on the record with their names out of fear for the safety of family members still in the Middle East.One 65-year-old woman said she worries that if Trump enacts a ban on Muslim immigrants or makes changes to the refugee resettlement program, her family members awaiting resettlement approval won’t be able to join her here.She’s particularly concerned about one of her sons stuck in Egypt whose child is disabled, she added. His family’s application for resettlement is pending as the vetting process, which usually takes between 18 and 24 months, is still underway. Another man, here with his pregnant wife and young child, said he fears outright expulsion from the U.S. Would it be to his home country of Syria, he wondered, or to one of the many countries that people flee to, like Jordan or Turkey?“Are they going to send me back to Bashar [al Assad]?” he said. Not everyone, however, buys into the Trump hysteria.A third refugee, who used to teach Arabic in Syria, said he doesn’t believe that Trump will follow through with what he pledged during the campaign. And besides, he said, there would be many legal obstacles.“There is Congress, there is the Supreme Court and the American people,” he said. “They will not let him do all of this.”He doubts that people ultimately want to see their country fall behind by 60 or 70 years. But if it really does happen, he said, “we are all in trouble.”The Darbis, a Syrian refugee family of five that HuffPost has been following for more than a year, expressed similar doubts about Trump’s proclamations. They all stayed up late on Nov. 8 to watch their first presidential election in the U.S. from their apartment in Jersey City, New Jersey, said Mohamed, the father.He, like the professor in Clarkston, said he thinks that Trump won’t actually follow through on most of what he’s proposed. But he did voice some concern about some of the people who Trump is adding to his Cabinet ― specifically future advisers, like Chris Kobach, who have advocated for a Muslim registry.“Do you think it will actually happen?” he wondered.He didn’t bother hiding his cynicism around the rise in acts of hate since the election, either.“Trump is normalizing a lot of the hateful rhetoric out there already,” Mohamed said. “I feel like a lot of Americans now feel more comfortable saying hateful things.”He and his wife, Amira, both said they felt at ease being in Jersey City because it’s so diverse. Mohamed hasn’t encountered any problems at work, he said, and his children’s teachers have assured the students that they have nothing to worry about. Except that Nabiha, the eldest, was the victim of an anti-Muslim comment.A handful of Hispanic students in her eighth-grade class told her that they were happy about Trump’s win. “You guys are so bad,” they said to her, referencing Muslims. The agencies that are responsible for resettling refugees say they’re just as confused as the refugees themselves but are focused on moving forward and helping people establish new lives.“There’s just so much uncertainty, confusion and certainly anxiety around the future of immigrants and refugees in this country,” said Elizabeth Ross, the refugee communities coordinator at the International Institute of Minnesota, a local resettlement group.The U.S. resettled a total of 84,995 refugees in the 2016 fiscal year, which ended in September, according to Refugee Processing Center statistics. Almost 10,000 have already been resettled since then.The Obama administration pledged to increase the number of refugees brought into the U.S. earlier this year. Up to 110,000 refugees can be offered new lives in the 2017 fiscal year, up from 70,000 in 2015 and 85,000 in 2016. What Trump will do to these quotas is anybody’s guess.“Right now we’re operating under the assumption that all of our programs will continue, that the administration will not reverse such a significant commitment to refugee protection and resettlement,” said Mark Hetfield, CEO of HIAS, one of the nine national resettlement agencies. “But there’s plenty of cause for concern.”One area of concern, he said, is the campaign to end Muslim immigration. “It would be a catastrophe in terms of the messages sent to religious minorities, in terms of how they will be treated when they get here,” he said.A second is the amount of divisive rhetoric that the Trump campaign has enabled, he said, echoing Mohamed Darbi.“It’s not just about what Trump might do,” he said. “A lot of people are now saying negative things about refugees and minorities. Refugees are even asking to be moved out of neighborhoods where we’ve placed them, but I don’t know where would be better.”Despite the odds being stacked against them, both Hetfield and Ross stressed that the commitment to assisting refugees has never been stronger.“As an agency we are here to help people not be so fearful and to be hopeful that there won’t be drastic changes,” Ross said. “Our mission is unchanged.

22,BLACK VOICES,Teen Who Killed Allegedly Abusive Dad Will Spend Holidays In Jail Awaiting Trial,Melissa Jeltsen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bresha-meadows-holidays-in-jail_us_5834a941e4b09b6055ff5162,"Advocates are calling for Bresha Meadows' release, citing the negative impact detention has on young people.",2016-11-23,"Bresha Meadows, a 15-year-old girl accused of killing her allegedly abusive father, has already spent almost four months behind bars.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5834a999180000270c30f85d.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was midsummer when 14-year-old Bresha Meadows picked up her father’s gun and allegedly shot him in the head, killing the man who she said brutally beat her mother and terrorized her family for years. Almost four months later, she remains in pretrial detention at Trumbull County Juvenile Detention Center in Warren, Ohio, charged with aggravated murder in the death of her 41-year-old father, Jonathan Meadows.On Tuesday, there was supposed to be a court hearing for Bresha, an opportunity for her lawyer to advocate for her release before trial. Instead Bresha’s hearing was postponed until January 20. By then, she will have spent almost six months locked up, missing a large chunk of the school year. The #FreeBresha campaign, a group of individuals and organizations raising awareness about her case and the intersection of domestic violence, race and incarceration, released a statement on Tuesday blasting the decision to delay the hearing:“As of today, Bresha has already spent 117 days in jail. By the time January 20th comes around she will have spent over 175 days in a cell. This is truly unconscionable and we are furious. Bresha should NOT have to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas away from her family in a jail cell. Bresha should be home for the holidays … Rather than support Bresha with resources to recover from her experience of extensive violence, prosecutors continue to punish and incarcerate her for defending her life.”As she sits behind bars, a national movement to free Bresha has slowly gained steam. Over 100 domestic violence organizations have endorsed a call to drop the charges against her and grant her an immediate release. A petition with the same request has over 23,000 signatures. A fundraising site has raised over $50,000 for her and her family.On average, pretrial detention for juveniles in Ohio is about 10 to 12 days, according to Erin Davies, executive director of Juvenile Justice Coalition, an organization advocating for youth involved in Ohio’s juvenile justice system.Detentions can have long-term effects on young people’s mental and physical well-being, she said, explaining that kids may be more likely to engage in self-harm, and can face serious challenges going back to school afterward. “Detentions can be really damaging to kids,” she said. ‘’It should be used as a last resort.”But she noted that Bresha’s case is unusual and may take more time to process. Because Bresha was 14 at the time of her arrest, she said, the case may still be transferred to adult criminal court. “Six months is long but this case is more complicated than the average case,” she said. Prosecutors have not yet decided whether they will try Bresha as a child or an adult. If she is charged as an adult, she could face a life sentence. She has pleaded “not true” to the charge of aggravated murder, which in juvenile court is equivalent to a not guilty plea. The prosecutor’s office did not return a call for comment. Mariame Kaba, an organizer and founder of Project NIA, which works to decrease the number of children and youth in Chicago who are arrested and incarcerated, said she was livid about the lack of urgency in the teen’s case.“The longer she stays in jail the worse it is for her,” she said. Bresha’s lawyer, Ian Friedman, said he would request her release at the Jan. 20 hearing.“We want her out as quickly as possible, but we have to give compelling information to the court that convinces them that her release, whether it be home or to some other facility, is appropriate and in her best interest,” he said. “There is a lot of work behind the scenes that the public will eventually see.” Mike Brickner, senior policy director for the ACLU of Ohio, explained that the juvenile justice system is supposed to have different goals than the adult system. Children are supposed to be rehabilitated ― not punished, he said. “When we keep kids in this kind of a limbo status, it’s negative,” Brickner said. “The quicker we can resolve these issues, the sooner we can move them towards treatment and reestablishing a normal sense of life.”For Bresha, re-establishing any semblance of normalcy will take time.Friedman said the young teen witnessed her father kicking and stomping her mom, Brandi Meadows. At times, Friedman said, the beatings left her mother unconscious. The gun that Bresha allegedly used to kill her father was the same one her father used to terrorize the family, he said. “She took the only step that she could, in her mind, to save her mother’s life and that of her siblings,” he told The Huffington Post in a previous interview.In 2011, Brandi Meadows went to police, telling them that her husband was capable of extreme violence and that he threatened to kill her and their three kids. In a request for a civil domestic violence protection order, she described in detail the violence she said he inflicted on her.“In the 17 years of our marriage, he has cut me, broke my ribs, fingers, the blood vessels in my hand, my mouth, blackened my eyes. I believe my nose was broken,” she wrote. “If he finds us, I am 100 percent sure he will kill me and the children … My life is like living in a box he created for me, and if I stepped out of that box, he’s there to put me back in that box.”The protection order was later dismissed and the couple reconciled, a common occurrence in abusive relationships. In the months leading up to the shooting, Bresha ran away from home multiple times. She confided in her aunt, Martina Latessa, a Cleveland police officer, about what was going on behind closed doors. “The nightmare she was born into had a profound impact on her, to the point where she was suicidal,” Latessa told The Huffington Post.The siblings of Jonathan Meadows have denied claims that he was abusive.As many as 10 million children in the United States are exposed to domestic violence each year. Experts say that witnessing abuse against a parent can be profoundly traumatic for a child, and can lead to depression, anxiety and suicide attempts. Kids who grow up in violent homes are also more likely to end up in the justice system: 84 percent of girls in the juvenile justice system have experienced domestic violence. In the aftermath of the shooting, Brandi Meadows publicly called her daughter a hero. Now, she just wants her home for the holidays. “I am so sorry she had to go through this,” she said at the time. “She helped me; she helped all of us so we could have a better life.” ______Need help?

She served as a Republican National Committeewoman in the 1990s, and chaired the Michigan Republican Party from 1994 to 2000 and again from 2003 to 2005. A billionaire powerbroker, DeVos has been a huge donor to and fundraiser for the Republican Party. A 2014 Mother Jones profile on the DeVos family referred to them as “the new Kochs.”DeVos currently serves as chairwoman for the American Federation for Children, a school choice advocacy group.“The status quo in education is not acceptable,” DeVos said in a statement accepting Trump’s offer. “Together, we can work to make transformational change that ensures every student in America has the opportunity to fulfill his or her highest potential.”Like many of Trump’s Cabinet picks, DeVos’ nomination was met with swift opposition.“In nominating DeVos, Trump makes it loud and clear that his education policy will focus on privatizing, defunding and destroying public education in America,” American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten said. The National Education Association, which represents teachers and school administrators, said the pick shows how “out of touch” the Trump administration is with what’s best for students and educators.“She has lobbied for failed schemes, like vouchers — which take away funding and local control from our public schools — to fund private schools at taxpayers’ expense,” the labor union said in a statement. “These schemes do nothing to help our most-vulnerable students while they ignore or exacerbate glaring opportunity gaps. She has consistently pushed a corporate agenda to privatize, de-professionalize and impose cookie-cutter solutions to public education.”Progressive Michigan executive director Lonnie Scott said the nomination “proves that having a shortage of experience means nothing as long you don’t have a shortage of money.”“The DeVos family education plan has been a disaster for Michigan and we are truly saddened that Trump decided to import their failed ideas to Washington D.C.,” Scott wrote in a statement.This article has been updated with additional reactions to DeVos’ nomination.

President Barack Obama ― who had to stop mid-address because he was “getting kind of choked up” ― bestowed the award on the television host for her unwavering ability to make “you laugh about something, rather than at someone.” He praised DeGeneres’ historic bravery for publicly coming out of the closet nearly two decades ago, putting her career in jeopardy.“It’s easy to forget now, when we’ve come so far, where now marriage is equal under the law, just how much courage was required for Ellen to come out on the most public of stages almost 20 years ago. Just how important it was not just for the LGBT community, but for all us to see somebody so full of kindness and light. Somebody we liked so much, somebody who could be our neighbor or our colleague or our sister challenge our own assumptions. Remind us that we have more in common than we realize, push our country in the direction of justice. What an incredible burden it was to bear, to risk your career like that. People don’t do that very often.” DeGeneres’ receipt of the award almost hit a snag when she forgot an ID to get into the White House. At the ceremony, she held back tears as a short speech was read celebrating her accomplishments:“In a career spanning three decades, Ellen DeGeneres has lifted our spirits and brought joy to our lives as a stand-up comic, actor, and television star. In every role she reminds us to be kind to one another and to treat people as each of us wants to be treated.

No one is particularly fond of Gov. Pat McCrory (R).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5834a36d1700002500e7be79.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"RALEIGH, N.C. ― It’s 9:55 p.m. on Election Day, and the gubernatorial race between Gov. Pat McCrory (R) and North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper (D) is effectively tied. The crowd at the Raleigh LGBTQ Center is waiting for the results. They sigh, boo and scream out as the returns pop up on a television screen. “Jesus fucking Christ!” yells one woman, banging her hands against her thighs. Many of the people attending this watch party are members of, or allies to, North Carolina’s LGBTQ community. No one is particularly fond of McCrory. In March, the governor signed HB 2, a law barring local governments from passing any anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay and transgender people. The law also mandates that individuals can only use restrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. The law has cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and even more in reputation. Later that month, McCrory added protections for sexual orientation and gender identity with an executive order, but did not reverse the bathroom portion of the bill. He dug in even further on the campaign trail, insisting that “the left” had brought the “radical concept” of gender identity to his state. The governor’s race became a referendum on HB2 in many ways, with Cooper and McCrory fighting over it throughout the campaign. By 11:22 p.m. on election night, the party at the LGBT center was dying down. It didn’t look like either Cooper or McCrory would be declared the winner that day. “Holy shit,” said one of the few remaining spectators as the TV screen showed McCrory still in the lead.Two weeks later, the party attendees are still waiting.McCrory still hasn’t conceded the election to his Cooper, although Cooper was ahead by 6,600 votes as of Sunday. And a winner may not be declared anytime soon ― McCrory’s campaign announced on Tuesday that it would officially file for a statewide recount. More than 60,000 provisional and absentee ballots hadn’t been counted as of Sunday, and the state GOP is trying to protest the tallies in half of the state’s 100 counties by claiming that McCrory is trailing because of fraud and technical difficulties. The McCrory campaign expressed specific concerns about early votes tallied in Durham County, a Democratic stronghold that put Cooper ahead after 90,000 votes were submitted late on Election Day. HB2 activated advocacy groups like Equality NC, Campus Pride, the Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union to try to oust McCrory, and the groups have asked state lawmakers to repeal the law. But James Miller, the executive director of the Raleigh LGBTQ Center, doesn’t think HB2 will be repealed even if McCrory leaves office. “Just because the governor is gone doesn’t mean with have an immediate path to repeal,” he said. “It will take much more energy than flipping a governor.”For Carla Merritt, a transgender woman attending the watch party, the bill and the prospect of another McCrory term is frightening. She said she has overheard people saying they would cut a trans woman’s throat if they were to see her in the restroom.“It’s just a good thing that I wasn’t identified by those people,” she said.The most common defense supporters of HB2 have offered is also the most transphobic. State lawmakers claim the law protects women and children from male sexual predators who wouldn’t rule out dressing in women’s clothing and entering a women’s bathroom with the intention of assaulting someone. McCrory seemed to echo this sentiment in March, saying that the Charlotte ordinance protecting the rights of trans people ― the backlash to which prompted the state-level bill ― was “government overreach forcing businesses to allow men to be in women’s or girls’ restroom or shower facilities.” “We’re throwing away basic etiquette,” he said. “I wonder if your daughter or son was showering and all of a sudden a man walks into the locker room and says, ‘This is what I am.’ Would you want that for your child?”But Kellie Burris, who runs the women’s group at the center, said she has transgender friends who have been beaten for using the bathrooms that coordinate with the sex on their birth certificate. “Trans people get raped,” she said. “They get beaten and they get murdered.” There are many personal accounts and studies about trans people being attacked in bathrooms, but no known reports of a trans person attacking anyone else. And as many transgender rights advocates point out, most trans people don’t want to bring attention to themselves in the bathroom because they’re afraid of being harassed.“HB2 really is a wink toward the religious conservatives who want to help steer this state’s direction,” Merritt said. “HB2 is all about us, people like myself, and he’s really fortunate he hasn’t gotten anyone killed yet.”As 11:30 p.m. rolls around on election night, people continue filing out of the center with their heads hanging. Merritt takes a deep breath and asks them for the latest results. She sighs again when they reply. “If McCrory wins,” she says, “it’s horrible for us.” "

Just 3 percent say they’re very likely to get into a political argument during dinner, while 8 percent say they’re somewhat likely to do so, and 80 percent that they’re not very likely or not at all likely to get into a fight.For a small fraction ― 4 percent ― that’s because they’ve actually changed their plans for Thursday to avoid conflict.“We are having a quiet holiday brunch alone, just the two of us,” one Clinton voter, who reneged on dinner with her Trump-supporting relatives, said in the survey. Several others also reported declining invitations from parents or family members who’d voted for Trump, or canceling their plans all together.Across the aisle, one Trump voter said she had decided not to invite her parents home for dinner “because they are Trump and Republican haters.” Another, irritated that her son had asked her to mind the feelings of his Clinton-supporting girlfriend, suggested that it might be “best that he go elsewhere” for the holiday.Some went to more elaborate measures to keep the peace. One woman polled said that her sister was planning to attend two separate get-togethers ― one for her family, all Trump supporters, on Thanksgiving Day, and another for her husband’s family, all of whom voted for Clinton, on Saturday.Most people, though, don’t have to go to such lengths to avoid people they disagree with. Fewer than one-third of Americans, according to a September survey, have both at least one family member or close friend who supports Clinton and at least one who supports Trump.And, as the latest poll shows, most of the public doesn’t have plans for a bipartisan Thanksgiving. Just 26 percent say they expect to see both Trump and Clinton supporters at their dinner, while 36 percent say everyone they’re sharing the holiday with will have backed the same candidate. Another 21 percent think no one at their Thanksgiving will care much about politics, while 16 percent aren’t sure about the political preferences of those they’re sharing dinner with.Those attending politically split dinners are prepared for relatively more strife. Eighteen percent say they’re somewhat likely or very likely to get into a political fight this year.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 16-18 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

His boss, President-elect Donald Trump, was scheduled to have an on-the-record meeting with reporters and editors from The New York Times. Priebus thought ― certainly not for the last time ― that Trump wasn’t prepared for the meeting. But it’s not easy to tell Donald Trump he’s not up to a task. So, according to three sources who spoke to the same New York Times, Priebus made up a little lie. The Times, he told Trump, had tried to unilaterally change the terms of the meeting. Priebus reportedly offered up this fib “believing it would result in a cancellation, these people said.”It did. Trump promptly took to Twitter and shut the whole thing down. Trump eventually learned that the Times hadn’t changed the terms of the meeting, and when the gray lady refused an only-off-record gathering, he buckled and made time for the reporters. So did Reince Priebus lie to Trump? Believing that requires you to believe the Times’ three sources are telling the truth. We don’t know specifically who they are, and Hope Hicks didn’t respond to a request for comment. But pretty much everybody in Trump’s inner circle, from Kellyanne Conway on down to Steve Bannon, has every incentive to clip as much off of Priebus’ wings as possible. Priebus, the chief of staff, commands a central position within the organization structure as gatekeeper to the president. Priebus’ main power is in whom he lets in and whom he doesn’t. The less that Trump trusts Priebus, however, the more he’ll sidestep the gate and lean on other advisers like Bannon.The public lying and knife-fighting might be giving off the impression of incompetence and chaos, but it may also just be how Donald Trump likes it.

28,POLITICS,Obama Administration Calls On Schools To Stop Abusing Kids,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/corporal-punishment_us_58337528e4b030997bc0efad,"In the 2013-2014 school year, more than 100,000 students were subjected to some form of corporal punishment.",2016-11-22,"Currently, 15 states have laws expressly allowing corporal punishment, and seven more states do not have rules prohibiting the practice.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583394e11700002600e7bbe5.jpeg?cache=HMshYdHltb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Although 28 states and the District of Columbia explicitly prohibit the act of physical discipline in school, corporal punishment is hardly a relic of the past. In the 2013-2014 school year, over 110,000 students were struck, paddled or flogged in the classroom, according to the most recent available data from the federal government. Now, the Obama administration is taking steps to reduce this number further.On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Education John King Jr. sent a letter to governors and state school officers imploring them to eliminate the practice from their schools. Currently, 15 states have laws expressly allowing corporal punishment, and seven more states do not have rules prohibiting the practice. The letter does not provide legal guidance but general reasoning for banning physical discipline. Corporal punishment “teaches students that physical force is an acceptable means of solving problems, undermining efforts to promote nonviolent techniques for conflict resolution,” says the letter. “The very acts of corporal punishment that are permissible when applied to children in schools under some state laws would be prohibited as criminal assault or battery when applied to adults in the community in those very same states.”As it is currently practiced, corporal punishment does not impact all students equally. While black students only make up about 16 percent of the student population, in 2013-2014 more than one-third of public school students subjected to corporal punishment were black. During that time, black girls were 2.9 times more likely to get physically disciplined than white girls. Students with disabilities also face disproportionate rates of corporal punishment. “These data and disparities shock the conscience,” says the letter.Moreover, the letter states that research simply does not bear out the usefulness of these practices. Corporal punishment does not deter misbehavior, and actually makes a child more likely to act aggressively. Besides the immediate physical effects of corporal punishment, the practice can cause long-term mental health damage, making a child more likely to develop anxiety disorders or a dependency on drugs and alcohol, research shows. The education department letter comes a day after the National Women’s Law Center issued its own statement to policymakers, also urging an end to corporal punishment. The center’s letter was issued on behalf of more than 60 organizations, including the American Association of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Psychological Association and the NAACP.The education secretary explained the letter on a call Monday with Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers; Nathan Monell, executive director of the national PTA; and Fatima Goss Graves, senior vice president for program at the National Women’s Law Center.  “Tradition is not a justification for ignoring the facts or failing to take steps to protect the rights of children,” said King."
29,TASTE,Millennials Are Loading Up On Their Vegetables,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/millennials-eating-vegetables_us_5834ade8e4b09b6055ff57cf,The rest of us should follow their lead.,2016-11-22,Don’t be surprised if your cousin Sally piles on the Brussel sprouts this Thanksgiving.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5834cb4d1700002600e7bf2c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s no secret that most Americans do a pretty lousy job when it comes to following mom’s advice to eat their vegetables.In fact, according to estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, less than 10 percent of Americans eat the recommended amount of two to three cups of vegetables per day. That means many of us aren’t getting enough of key nutrients, like potassium and dietary fiber, and vitamins that keep us healthy.But that statistic appears likely to change in the near future, according to a new analysis released this month by the NPD Group, a market research firm.According to the firm’s research, consumers under the age of 40 are eating 52 percent more fresh vegetables and 59 percent more frozen vegetables than they were a decade ago. Conversely, the boomer generation — aged 60 and up — is eating 30 percent less fresh vegetables, as well as 4 percent less frozen vegetables, over the same time frame.David Portalatin, vice president and food consumption industry analyst at NPD, said the data is a sign that younger generations of eaters are “turning back the clock” when it comes to the food they eat.Millennials, he said, appear to prefer food that is fresh and often local or in season instead of the fast food and packaged convenience foods that began to proliferate at the time their parents’ generation — today’s boomers — were themselves thirty-somethings.“The younger generation is taking a different look at these things,” Portalatin told The Huffington Post. “What’s old is new again.”The analysis is based off data from the firm’s National Eating Trends food and beverage tracker, which aggregates data from a nationally representative group of panelists who self-report everything they eat and drink using a web-based journal. The latest findings from the tracker were recently published in the firm’s Eating Patterns in America industry report.And even though the data depends on self-reported consumption patterns, which aren’t always the most reliable, Portalatin believes these numbers are no fluke.Over the firm’s 30 years of tracking eating patterns, Portalatin explained, vegetable consumption has increased with age, and he sees no reason that will change with the cauliflower-obsessed millennial crowd. The firm is forecasting that fresh vegetable consumption will increase another 10 percent overall over the next several years.Even if that forecast holds, Americans have a ways to go toward improving their diets.Portalatin pointed out that we’re still eating far fewer vegetables overall than we were 25 years ago, and these less-healthy eating patterns are often established from a young age. Currently, for example, the vegetable that U.S. toddlers are most likely to eat is a french fry.But at least it’s a start.―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

30,QUEER VOICES,Donald Trump’s Authoritarian Attack On The Queer Community – And How To Survive It,Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trumps-authoritarian-attack-on-the-queer-community-and-how-to-survive-it_us_58330987e4b030997bc056e3,"""Rule #1: Believe the autocrat. He means what he says.""",2016-11-22,"(L to R) Vice president-elect Mike Pence and president-elect Donald Trump on November 20, 2016 in Bedminster Township, New Jersey.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58345e6f180000230c30f701.jpeg?cache=OwLk3XSwPz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Make no mistake, Donald Trump sent a warning to the queer community (and other communities expressing dissent) over the weekend, launching an authoritarian attack on Twitter. As I wrote last week, pay no mind to his word-games in interviews, like his claim on “60 Minutes” that marriage equality is “settled,” and believe instead what he has said of his actual positions ― sometimes blurted out impulsively― and the promises he’s made to opponents of LGBTQ equality.I don’t believe, as some have suggested, that Trump fired angry missives at the cast of “Hamilton” ― or “Saturday Night Live” or the protestors who rose up after the election ― because he was trying to distract from some other big stories, namely his having caved on the Trump University suit, shelling out 25 million dollars, and the dangerous conflicts presented by his having a business empire that spans the globe.These are important stories, but if much of media isn’t covering them in addition to others ― nor playing them as big as they should be ― that is on our lousy corporate media, which seems to have already forgotten that Stephen Bannon is a white nationalist and Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions made racist remarks but now will be charged with protecting civil rights as attorney general.It is giving Trump too much credit to say that he throws out crazy Twitter taunts as part of a strategy to distract. Much of the media could walk and chew gum at the same time if it wanted to do so ― and on occasion actually does, and many did so in this case. No, Trump does these things for the same reason he has throughout the campaign: He is recklessly impulsive, highly unstable and angry. Even as his advisors probably try to stop him, he often can’t be controlled nor help himself. He is driven by revenge and is intent on making threats against those who dared to speak out against him. It’s what he did to the Khan family for days, and it’s what he did to beauty queen Alicia Machado, also for days on end, events that cost him ― though obviously didn’t cost him the election in the long run.Whether or not these outbursts will cost him as president remains to be seen, but they are exactly what they seem: impulsive blasts from an authoritarian who demands everyone bow to his feet.The “Hamilton” eruption in particular, in which Trump demanded an apology from the cast, was directed in part at the queer community. The Broadway theater world has been a gay space forever, and the boos that came at Mike Pence as he entered the theater were directed at a man who has been an ardent homophobe, had tried to stop LGBTQ rights at every turn and promoted “conversion therapy.” He is a man who, as I explained last week, will be in charge of much of the day-to-day running of a presidential administration, likely halting or even rolling back LGBTQ rights during Trump administration.Now here he is, coming to the New York theater, a space where we have historically found a home ― along with Jews, blacks and others ― and he wanted respect? (I know it’s speculation, but my instincts tell me that the cheers came from Midwestern tourists –- who are among those whose money keeps Broadway thriving ― who scored tickets to the show on their trip to New York.)Boos – and cheers – from a crowd in public directed at a public figure are democracy in action, and guaranteed by the First Amendment. Pence – who was booed at a baseball game in his home state of Indiana last April ― even acknowledged this the next day, telling Chris Wallace of Fox News that he “wasn’t offended.” President Obama was booed at public events and was even shouted down by a member of Congress as he gave the state of the union. He did not send out tweets chastising people or demanding an apology, as Donald Trump did. Furthermore, what Trump actually did was attack the cast of the show – not the booing crowd – which delivered a respectful, heartfelt message to Pence at then end of the show, which included these words: We have a message for you, sir. We hope that you will hear us out. Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you, and we truly thank you for joining us here at “Hamilton American Musical,” we really do. We, sir, we are the diverse America, who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights... Again, we truly thank you for [inaudible] this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men, women, of different colors, creeds and orientations.”The reference to “orientations” was part of the message to Pence from the theater community about his brutal attacks on LGBTQ people.In response, Trump tweeted:Before Trump’s tweets ― and even before news of the cast’s message had surfaced ― there was strong criticism on Twitter of New York Times political reporter Maggie Haberman, after she tweeted that the booing was “disrespectful” of the vice president-elect.(This is the same Haberman, by the way, who laughed mockingly on ABC’s “This Week” back in May when Minnesota Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison warned that Trump could win the GOP nomination.) She was quickly rebutted by gay commentators and others who pointed out that, not unlike in the past, she was being tone deaf to the gay community. What she was also being was overly generous to the incoming Trump administration, something we’ve seen the Times and much of the TV media doing in recent days.There’s a constant, hopeful portrayal since the election of Trump as “moderating” or becoming like a normal president. Then he does something crazy and they’re forced to pull it back. Even the Times’ coverage of the Hamilton incident stated that Trump issued a “surprisingly sharp rebuke.” What was surprising? This was the same Trump they’d covered for over a year. Don’t they know him by now?That brings me to Masha Gessen, an expert author and commentator on Putin and Russia, and a Russian immigrant and lesbian I’ve known for many years, having worked with her at the pioneering LGBTQ weekly magazine, Outweek, 25 years ago. She wrote a piece for the New York Review of Books that is a must-read: “Autocracy: Rules for Survival.” You should read the whole thing, but apropos of the “Hamilton” controversy, just some snippets:Rule #1: Believe the autocrat. He means what he says. Whenever you find yourself thinking, or hear others claiming, that he is exaggerating, that is our innate tendency to reach for a rationalization. This will happen often: humans seem to have evolved to practice denial when confronted publicly with the unacceptable. Back in the 1930s, The New York Times assured its readers that Hitler’s anti-Semitism was all posture. More recently, the same newspaper made a telling choice between two statements made by Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov following a police crackdown on protesters in Moscow: “The police acted mildly—I would have liked them to act more harshly” rather than those protesters’ “liver should have been spread all over the pavement...”So believe what Trump is saying and doing, as he demonizes and targets groups. Don’t fall for those in the media and elsewhere who try to normalize him. And be prepared for the fight.Follow Michelangelo Signorile on Twitter: www.twitter.com/msignorile"

The response to her first segment in front of the camera has been “overwhelmingly positive,” she told The Huffington Post in an email. Still, nasty comments are difficult to escape.“I think in Canada we are sometimes a little smug because we are such a multicultural and accepting country, we often like to act like we don’t have to worry about hatred and racism here, but it does exist,” she said.One person tweeted that putting Massa in front of the camera was “a massive stride backwards in evolution.” But the journalist appears to take even comments of that nature in stride:“It tells me that I need to continue what I’m doing because for some this may be the only interaction they ever have with a Muslim woman in hijab, and maybe it will change their perception about who we are and what we can do,” Massa said, adding that she’s proud to have broken the mold. “I worried that I would never be hired or accepted simply because I had never seen anyone who looked like me on TV,” she said. “I once had a colleague tell me that a women in hijab would never be hired on-air because it’s ‘too distracting.’ That only made me want to work harder to prove him wrong.”She said she credits her colleagues at CityNews for helping her flourish.“I have been treated as an equal by my colleagues and producers who are always eager to hear my story ideas and opinions,” she said. “They treat me with respect and listen to the perspectives I have to offer.”Massa also shared a message of support for other Muslim women: “How you’re dressed shouldn’t define whether or not you can succeed. I’m really excited to be the first hijabi to anchor the news, but I certainly hope I’m not the last.”Anyone who missed Massa in the anchor seat on Nov. 17 can find her in front of the camera again next month.

We’re here to answer your most pressing, puzzling, even politically incorrect questions, about all things related to the Chinese in Africa and Africans in China.Although leaders in Asia, Europe and the Americas are speculating as to what the implications of Donald J. Trump’s election to the U.S. presidency are, at least those regions have some idea of what actions and policies he may pursue. The president-elect has already met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on security and trade, spoken to NATO’s secretary general on the phone about whether Washington should continue to support the alliance and, of course, expressed throughout his campaign his desire to build that great wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. Africa, by contrast, was barely discussed, if at all, during the seemingly never-ending 18-month duel between Trump and his former rival Hillary Clinton. Now, with the election settled, African policymakers are struggling to figure out what it will mean for their countries when a potentially isolationist U.S. president assumes power in January.There are early indications that some African countries may lean further in to China’s embrace to compensate for what they expect could be a retrenchment  in U.S. trade, investment and overall engagement on the continent. For Beijing, this could be a huge opportunity to strengthen its diplomatic positioning in Africa as the Chinese continue their massive aid, infrastructure and investment drive across the continent. All that Chinese money is also now paying dividends in the form of improved public opinion towards the Chinese in Africa which, according to a 2016 Afrobarometer survey, has been steadily rising. So if Washington either falters or retreats from constructive engagement in Africa, China may in fact be a major beneficiary.South Africa, in particular, has been steadily shifting its foreign policy away from the West towards China in recent years. Now, with the election of Donald Trump, Pretoria should no longer count on Washington in the international community as it’s done in the past, warns University of the Witwatersrand international relations professor John Stremlau in an interview with CNBC Africa following the U.S. election. Dr. Stremlau joins Eric & Cobus ― in the podcast above ― to discuss why he thinks President-elect Trump is such a threat to Africa’s stability and how this new direction in U.S. foreign policy could reshape Africa’s international relations.Join the discussion. Is it premature to be worried about President-elect Trump’s foreign policy in Africa and how it might damage U.S. relations while helping China’s engagement on the continent?

Last week, Adam Yauch Park in New York City, named for a late Jewish member of the Beastie Boys, was defaced with swastikas. And on Monday, CNN hosted a TV news segment with a debate topic scrawled across the screen reading: “Alt-right founder questions if Jews are people.” Not to mention the countless other swastikas that have shown up across the country since the election.All of this is appalling. But I take issue with our outrage ― or rather, not the outrage itself, but the selectivity of it. By all means, we should be photographing every swastika we come across and calling out the self-described “alt-right” as the neo-Nazi white nationalists they really are. The proximity of a man who has been accused of anti-Semitism to the highest office in the country is frightening. And anti-Semitism’s apparent resurgence among the American public harkens back to a darker time in history.But what we must not do is act as though this hate is a sudden revelation, rather than simply a confirmation ― or an expansion, perhaps ― of the hate people of color, immigrants and Muslims have been at the receiving end of for generations.The reality is, as a white Jew, I have the ultimate privilege when it comes to fearing hate: skin privilege. I can walk the streets and no one can identify me as “other,” no one can single me out for harassment ― which, needless to say, is not the case for black or brown people, or for Muslim women who choose to wear the hijab.Perhaps Jews in places other than New York, or of an older generation, will call me privileged ― for as Jewish as my name might sound, and as stereotypical as I always thought my protruding nose was as a child ― I’ve never felt discriminated against. I’ve never felt unsafe or that opportunities weren’t handed to me because of my being Jewish. Not once.I’ll admit, at times reading messages of hate in my Twitter mentions has burned ― the occasional troll’s particularly deplorable tweet (usually something mentioning ovens) has even brought me to tears.But when I sent the screenshots of these anti-Semitic tweets to my family, and they reacted with such absolute outrage ― one of my cousins even bursting into tears herself ― I had to think: Where was your outrage when Trump called for Muslims to be banned, where were the tears when you read the stories of repeated police killings of black people?The truth of the matter is: I feel safe. I feel physically safe the moment I step away from my computer screen. And that’s more than many can say.So, white Jews, I would say this: Call out all of the anti-Semitism you see, but don’t wallow in it ― use your perhaps newly kindled understanding of just how much it burns to be treated as less than as a call to arms, to stand in solidarity with those who have been facing this hate for generations, and will continue to face it for the next four years and beyond. Use your skin privilege to first listen to people of color, and then educate yourself and other white people so people of color don’t have to do that tiresome work ― because let’s be honest, white people are the problem here.Now they’ve come for us, and we’re demanding that everyone say something. But first they had come for them, and we didn’t say enough. So let’s say something now ― call out the hate our community is facing, but also vow not to stay silent when it comes to the hate people of color, immigrants and Muslims are facing now, and have been facing all along."
34,POLITICS,Michael Bloomberg's First Comments Since Trump Win Do Little To Quell Climate Fears,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-bloomberg-donald-trump-climate-change_us_5834a50be4b09b6055ff4e1a,The billionaire is offering up his elite club of mayors to fight the president-elect's environment plans.,2016-11-22,Michael Bloomberg made his first public comments on President-elect Donald Trump's climate plans. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5834b649180000270c30f88c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Michael Bloomberg, one of the deepest-pocketed advocates for fighting global warming, on Tuesday offered his first challenge yet to Donald Trump’s plans to unravel much of the climate progress made in the last eight years. If Trump pulls out of the historic Paris climate accord, which the president-elect has repeatedly vowed to do, the former New York City mayor will rally mayors around the country to adhere to the treaty’s terms, anyway.“Washington will not have the last word on the fate of the Paris agreement in the U.S. ― mayors will, together with business leaders and citizens,” Bloomberg said in a speech to Chinese officials and business leaders.Trump is poised to gut environmental regulations and revive heavily-polluting fossil fuel industries. Through out his presidential campaign, Trump threatened to shred President Barack Obama’s signature policy to fight climate change. He has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the Paris agreement signed by nearly every other country on Earth. The success of Bloomberg’s plan depends on a litany of factors. Does Bloomberg’s loose coalition of city chieftains, the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, have any real power? Will mayors actually buck with a president who has already threatened to withhold funding from cities that don’t obey his immigration orders? Can small cities even afford to go it alone on clean energy projects with enough scope to make a difference? Bloomberg credited city-level policies and private companies for most of the progress made in cutting carbon emissions over the past decade. The 74-year-old billionaire blamed inaction on climate change on partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C.“The U.S.’s success in fighting climate change has never been primarily dependent on Washington,” Bloomberg said. “Bear in mind: Over the past decade, Congress has not passed a single bill that takes direct aim at climate change. Yet at the same time, the U.S. has led the world in reducing emissions.”In fact, the U.S. has been slow to adopt renewable energy, compared to China and European countries such as Denmark, France and Germany. The country has reduced emissions, in large part by converting coal-fired power plants to natural gas, a cleaner-burning but still-dirty fossil fuel. The clean energy industry has soared in recent years, but still depends heavily on federal subsidies that could be in jeopardy under Trump.The incoming president has repeatedly trashed solar and wind energy for being too expensive, and for killing eagles that collide with turbines. On Monday, he renewed his personal vendetta against a wind farm off the coast of Scotland, in view of a luxury golf resort he owns. “Over time, as more and more Americans come to recognize what climate change means to their families and their futures ― by seeing the increasingly severe impact of storms, droughts and other weather events ― they will demand action from the federal government, too,” Bloomberg said. In July, Bloomberg called Trump a “dangerous demagogue” and a “con” whose business plan for the country “is a disaster in the making.” If Bloomberg’s elite club for mayors is his best proposed bulwark against environmental catastrophe, the future looks increasingly clouded by smog."
35,THE WORLDPOST,Alarm In Germany And Israel At Emboldened U.S. White Supremacists,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/germany-israel-white-supremacists_us_5834b8d4e4b01ba68ac36e3e,Neo-Nazis and white nationalists have vocally backed Trump.,2016-11-22,"A supporter of the Ku Klux Klan is seen with his tattoos during a rally at the statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina July 18, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5834bc881700002600e7beef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BERLIN/JERUSALEM, Nov 22 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is concerned that white supremacists in the United States are being emboldened by the election of Donald Trump and is watching developments closely, senior officials told Reuters.The Berlin government declined to give an official reaction to a video circulating on the internet which showed members of the “alt-right” movement, a grouping that includes neo-Nazis, white nationalists and anti-Semites, meeting on Saturday in Washington a few blocks from the White House.But one senior official close to Merkel described the video - which shows a speaker shouting “Hail Trump” and some audience members making the Nazi salute - as “repulsive and worrying.”“I don’t think this is Trump’s ideology because he seems to be largely free of ideology. But these people are riding on his coattails. We are watching this very closely,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Yair Lapid, a member of the foreign affairs and defense committee in the Israeli Knesset, called the video “sickening” and “intolerable.”“One of the greatest mistakes humanity ever made was a failure to recognize the danger of fascism early enough and tackle it head on,” said Lapid. “We cannot let history repeat itself.”A spokesman for the Trump-Pence transition team said on Monday that Trump “continued to denounce racism of any kind” and was elected to be “a leader for every American.”Trump, who has been active on Twitter in recent days, has not commented directly on the meeting himself. It came days after he outraged many Democrats, rights activists and minority groups by appointing Steve Bannon, former head of a website linked to the alt-right, as his chief White House strategist.In the video, taken inside the conference and published by The Atlantic, Richard Spencer, a leader of the “alt-right” movement, says America belongs to white people, who he describes as “children of the sun.” He denounces the movement’s critics as “the most despicable creatures who ever walked the planet.”“Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” Spencer shouts at one point as some members of the audience raise their arms in the Nazi salute.The gathering on Saturday drew protesters who blocked traffic around the Ronald Reagan Building, a federally owned conference center in downtown Washington for both public and private use.CRYSTAL CLEARDavid Harris, CEO of the American Jewish Committee (AJC) in New York, said fringe groups espousing anti-Semitism and targeting minorities had emerged from the U.S. presidential campaign with a “vigor” that has not been seen in decades.“President-elect Trump issued a statement (about the Saturday meeting) but, assuming this group endures, will need to continue to find other opportunities to make crystal clear that he is the president of all Americans and condemns the alt-right and what it stands for,” Harris told Reuters in response to written questions about the meeting.In Germany, which has spent the past 70 years atoning for its Nazi past, using the “Heil Hitler” salute and other Nazi symbols is illegal and can result in a prison sentence of up to six months. Other European countries including Austria and France have similar laws.A second German government official said Trump’s decision to bring Bannon into the White House showed he was “not willing to forgo the movement and mobilization of anger and resentment” that swept him to the presidency.Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian prime minister and a member of the European Parliament, accused Bannon on Tuesday of seeking to influence elections in France and Germany next year with the launch of new Breitbart News websites in Europe.American allies face a delicate balancing act when reacting to incidents and events like the one on Saturday, which have no direct link to Trump but seem fueled by his campaign, in which he called Mexicans rapists and floated the idea of registering Muslims like the Nazis did with Jews.David Keyes, foreign media spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said in response to a Reuters query about the Washington meeting: “Prime Minister Netanyahu condemns anti-Semitism everywhere and appreciates President-elect Trump’s denunciation of all forms of racism.”Pinchas Goldschmidt, president of the Conference of European Rabbis, told Reuters that the United States appeared to be “veering away” from its own moral standards and might need to reexamine its stance on free speech.“If words like this were used in Germany or Austria or France the people would have gotten in trouble with the law,” he said, referring to the Washington meeting.“Social media has created huge change. It has empowered and amplified the voices on the fringes. There may be a need in the United States to consider changes or limits to free speech to address this.”"
36,POLITICS,Donor At The Center Of A Clinton Pay-To-Play Scandal Also Gave To Trump's Foundation,Jessica Schulberg and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-ukraine-victor-pinchuk_us_5834a687e4b01ba68ac35072,"The Victor Pinchuk Foundation gave $150,000 to the Trump Foundation in 2015.",2016-11-22,"The Trump Foundation received $150,000 from the Victor Pinchuk Foundation in Ukraine after President-elect Donald Trump launched his campaign. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5834a8281700002500e7be9a.jpeg?cache=J3NZT3B0sv&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― After Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign, his foundation received a generous donation from a Ukrainian oligarch whose donations to the Clinton Foundation sparked accusations that Hillary Clinton engaged in an ethically murky mix of philanthropy and politics. The information became public on Tuesday, with the publication of the Trump Foundation’s 2015 tax documents. The Victor Pinchuk Foundation gave $150,000 to the Trump Foundation in fall 2015 ― the only time it did so, according to Thomas Weihe, head of the Victor Pinchuk Foundation’s board. Pinchuk, a billionaire steel magnate who is a former member of Ukraine’s parliament and son-in-law of a former Ukrainian president, has donated far more generously to Clinton’s foundation, with gifts of $10 and $25 million. According to The New York Times, Pinchuk let the Clintons borrow his private plane, attended former President Bill Clinton’s birthday party in 2011, and met with State Department officials several times while Hillary Clinton ran the agency. That placed Pinchuk at the center of accusations that the Democratic presidential nominee operated a “pay to play” scheme at the State Department while Clinton was secretary of state. Critics viewed gifts from Pinchuk, who favors closer ties between Ukraine and the European Union, as attempts to steer policy at Foggy Bottom.Pinchuk’s donation to the Trump Foundation appears to be more of a direct quid-pro-quo. Weihe said it was tied to an agreement that Trump would speak via video link at a an annual conference Pinchuk organized in September 2015. Pinchuk and Trump met years ago in New York, which led the Ukrainian businessman and philanthropist to invite the presidential candidate to speak at the Yalta European Strategy forum, a gathering of politicians and businessmen. The Washington Post first reported on the donation.Shortly after Pinchuk’s foundation gave $150,000 to Trump’s foundation, the then-Republican presidential candidate delivered 20 minutes of remarks, skirting the details of his policy toward Russia and Ukraine and offering only vague words of encouragement to his audience. “I know many people that live in the Ukraine, they’re friends of mine, they’re fantastic people,” Trump said, evidently unaware that Ukraine asked Russia to stop referring to it as “The Ukraine” after it gained independence. “Part of the problem that Ukraine has with the United States,” Trump told the room full of Ukrainians, “is that Putin does not respect our president whatsoever.” Trump accused President Barack Obama of paying “lip service” to Ukraine without actively helping the country. But he also suggested Europe should assume more responsibility for Ukraine’s security. “I don’t like what’s happening with Ukraine. But that’s really a problem that affects Europe a lot more than it affects us. And they should be leading some of this charge,” he said. The revelation that the same Ukrainian billionaire who donated to Clinton also donated to Trump in exchange for his appearance at an event undercuts his claims that Clinton was the more morally deficient candidate. For government ethicists, it also raises further doubts about the president-elect’s ability to craft future policy uninfluenced by moneyed interests. “The implication is that Trump, like Clinton, has close ties with international figures ― and unlike Clinton, corporate investments all over the world,” Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, said in an interview. “These kinds of cases raise questions about whether, while acting as public officials, people like Trump would be able to discharge their duties without bias in favor of their international ties.”Clinton said her family’s nonprofit organization would stop accepting foreign donations if she became president (though some Republicans demanded she shut down her foundation entirely). Trump, however, has hinted strongly that his businesses and foundation will remain operational under his children’s control. Do you work in a federal agency?

A federal law that allows them to recoup taxes paid on any compensation they received for their wrongful convictions is about to expire, and yet many of them don’t know the law exists or how to take advantage of it. But one man has made it his mission to set things right.The National Registry of Exonerations lists 1,928 men and women in the United States since 1989. They served, on average, about nine years in prison and, collectively, lost 16,000 years behind bars. Some had been on death row. Some were minors when they were convicted or had intellectual disabilities. All of them had been swept into a justice system that failed them. When released, these exonerees often are given little assistance as they try to readjust to freedom, update job skills and reenter society after years, even decades behind bars. Thirty-one states, Washington, D.C., and the federal justice system have enacted some form of compensation for the time spent unjustly caged. But those statutes vary wildly in terms of who qualifies and what is offered. The vast majority of exonerees do not receive meaningful compensation for having their lives derailed. And many of those who had been compensated, either through a state law or a civil rights suit, faced an additional burden: paying taxes on that money. For years it was unclear if they were obligated to pay taxes on the compensation, but President Barack Obama cleared that up in 2015 by signing the Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act, which prohibited the federal government from taxing compensation paid to the wrongfully convicted. Retroactively, it opened the door for all exonerees, no matter the year when they were compensated, to request an IRS refund of any tax, interest and penalties paid on that money.  But there was a problem: There was no mechanism for notifying those eligible for a refund, and for anyone who had paid taxes prior to 2013, the law provided only a one-year window, which expires Dec. 19, in which to claim a refund. All taxpayers, including exonerees, have three years from the date they originally file their tax return to file an amended return to get a refund. That means that exonerees who paid taxes within the last three years are not affected by this deadline. It does affect those who filed taxes more than three years ago and are eligible for relief, but most of them aren’t aware that the law has changed in their favor. That’s where Jon Eldan comes in.“One year was an unnecessarily short and rather unrealistic deadline, considering the difficulty in notifying those affected,” said Eldan, an attorney in Oakland, California, and founder of the nonprofit After Innocence. “There is no comprehensive list of the exonerees who received money in connection with their wrongful conviction, let alone the relatively small subset of them who paid income tax on that money. The only way to be sure would be to call them and ask. So I have been trying to identify as many potentially eligible as possible, track down their contact information, let them know about the change in law and provide free assistance to those who need help filing.” Eldan’s After Innocence provides free post-release assistance to more than 300 exonerees nationwide. Its focus is on ensuring that these men and women have access to and actually use the health care and social services they are eligible for and that they have legal assistance for any post-release problems.Prior to the 2015 law, the status of money paid for wrongful incarceration was vague under IRS rules. If it was deemed to be compensation for physical injury, it was not taxable. If it was deemed to be for something else (such as lost wages), it was taxable. “At the end of the day, most exonerees who received money did not end up paying income tax. But some did. And those are the ones who were to benefit by making the law retroactive,” Eldan said.He explained that the change in law was long overdue. “I think that when we compensate exonerees, we should be making amends for their loss of liberty, not by providing them the income we think they would have otherwise earned.”That’s exactly how exoneree Antoine Goff, an After Innocence client, feels, too. Goff, if the IRS approves his application, may receive more than $60,000 in taxes he paid, plus interest, on part of the compensation he received in 2009 as part of a settlement of a civil rights lawsuit. It’s money, Goff says, that is rightfully his and would help him get back on his feet.“I feel as if the American system has railroaded me, and I deserve every penny that has been given to me in compensation ― even though you couldn’t put any monetary value on my situation anyway,” said Goff, a Californian who was convicted for a 1989 murder he didn’t commit. Goff served more than 13 years in prison until he was freed in 2003. “They shouldn’t take a dime away from me on that. They owe me that. Period.”For others, the refund process is more complicated. Take the case of Julius Earl Ruffin, a Virginia man, also an After Innocence client, who was convicted of rape and spent more than two decades in prison until DNA evidence linked the crime to another man. He was freed in 2003. Ruffin told The Huffington Post that he received about $1.3 million in compensation from the state of Virginia. A portion came in a lump sum, with the rest scheduled to be paid monthly over 25 years. Ruffin has been paying taxes on those monthly checks, so to get a refund, he will need to file a separate amended return for each of the last 12 years. Tax refunds aren’t the only issue at stake. Some former inmates who have been compensated, like Larry Peterson of New Jersey, have massive unpaid tax bills. A lien has been placed on Peterson’s home for $160,000. If the IRS approves Peterson’s application, that tax bill, and the lien it created, will be canceled. “It’s just hell going through this,” Peterson said. “This is supposed to be America, yet innocent people are being robbed by the system that is supposed to be protecting us and fighting for us. They’re robbing us.”Eldan has been working day and night for the better half of a year to try to identify, contact and assist as many of the more than 1,900 exonerees who appear in the National Registry of Exonerations as he can to guide them toward any tax relief they may be eligible for. Using data compiled largely from media reports that the registry tracks, he identified about 750 people who received some form of compensation for being wrongfully convicted. But the registry does not compile contact information for those on the list, so Kroll, a large corporate investigations firm, is donating its help, and law students from The College of William & Mary and Stanford University are also digging up contact information. When Eldan does reach eligible exonerees, he can refer them to the Reed Smith LLP law firm, which coordinates free assistance for filing refund claims.Eldan so far has contacted more than 330 wrongfully convicted individuals nationwide and identified nine who may qualify for tax relief. “We knew this was like looking for a needle in a haystack. But if you are that needle, you would not want to miss out on the opportunity for a refund.” In a letter that twenty-three innocence organizations, including After Innocence, sent last week to Reps. Sam Johnson (R-Texas) and John Larson (D-Conn.), who introduced the tax relief legislation, the groups indicated that Eldan’s effort will not reach all of those he has identified as having received compensation nor the 1,000 more whose compensation status remains unknown before the Dec. 19 deadline. Along with two dozen other organizations who work on behalf of the wrongfully convicted, he has urged the congressmen to extend the deadline by two years. When contacted by The Huffington Post about the letter, both Larson and Johnson pledged wholehearted support for an extension of the deadline but did not yet have a concrete plan. Both criticized the IRS for not providing tax guidance on the law until just this last summer.“Unfortunately, the IRS took six months to release its guidance,” Johnson said. “This delay penalized the very folks who deserve this tax relief. But they shouldn’t pay for the negligence of the IRS. That is why we support an appropriate extension of the deadline for these innocent men and women.”Larson said he will work with Johnson to push for an extension. “Those who were wrongfully convicted deserve our assistance and support,” Johnson said. “I believe,” Eldan told HuffPost, “that Congress intended in good faith to make this remedy available, and we’ve provided ample evidence that, after very diligent efforts to reach these people, more time is necessary to minimize the chance that any will miss out. To do anything other than extend the deadline would be to frustrate the very purpose of this provision in the law.”Eldan, whose work is focused on helping those who have paid a terrible price for our criminal justice system’s errors, said that it’s just not clear how many more exonerees are eligible for refunds under this law. “But if Congress provides the additional time, I will keep trying to find them and help them.”"

When Eldan does reach eligible exonerees, he can refer them to the Reed Smith LLP law firm, which coordinates free assistance for filing refund claims.Eldan so far has contacted more than 330 wrongfully convicted individuals nationwide and identified nine who may qualify for tax relief. “We knew this was like looking for a needle in a haystack. But if you are that needle, you would not want to miss out on the opportunity for a refund.” In a letter that twenty-three innocence organizations, including After Innocence, sent last week to Reps. Sam Johnson (R-Texas) and John Larson (D-Conn.), who introduced the tax relief legislation, the groups indicated that Eldan’s effort will not reach all of those he has identified as having received compensation nor the 1,000 more whose compensation status remains unknown before the Dec. 19 deadline. Along with two dozen other organizations who work on behalf of the wrongfully convicted, he has urged the congressmen to extend the deadline by two years. When contacted by The Huffington Post about the letter, both Larson and Johnson pledged wholehearted support for an extension of the deadline but did not yet have a concrete plan. Both criticized the IRS for not providing tax guidance on the law until just this last summer.“Unfortunately, the IRS took six months to release its guidance,” Johnson said. “This delay penalized the very folks who deserve this tax relief. But they shouldn’t pay for the negligence of the IRS. That is why we support an appropriate extension of the deadline for these innocent men and women.”Larson said he will work with Johnson to push for an extension. “Those who were wrongfully convicted deserve our assistance and support,” Johnson said. “I believe,” Eldan told HuffPost, “that Congress intended in good faith to make this remedy available, and we’ve provided ample evidence that, after very diligent efforts to reach these people, more time is necessary to minimize the chance that any will miss out. To do anything other than extend the deadline would be to frustrate the very purpose of this provision in the law.”Eldan, whose work is focused on helping those who have paid a terrible price for our criminal justice system’s errors, said that it’s just not clear how many more exonerees are eligible for refunds under this law. “But if Congress provides the additional time, I will keep trying to find them and help them.”"

40,POLITICS,Donald Trump Basically Says Conflicts Of Interest Aren't Illegal If The President Has Them,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-conflict-of-interest_us_58349547e4b09b6055ff367d,"“The law’s totally on my side,"" he said.",2016-11-22,"President-elect Donald Trump (right) and his adult son Eric Trump (left) cut the ribbon to open the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58349807180000270c30f813.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump told The New York Times Tuesday that laws around conflicts of interest don’t apply to him, and he can simply keep running his businesses from the White House.“In theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly,” Trump said, according to tweets from New York Times reporters interviewing the president-elect Tuesday. “There’s never been a case like this.”He is technically correct on both counts. Federal conflict of interest laws do not apply to the president of the United States, and the obvious conflicts of interest created from his ownership of a global real estate empire are unprecedented in the nation’s history. Just because the federal laws mandating other federal officials to place their assets into a true blind trust run by an independent trustee do not apply to the president, does not mean that Trump’s conflicts of interest are not real.Trump seems to think otherwise: “The law’s totally on my side, the president can’t have a conflict of interest.” To take Trump seriously, and not literally, as his defenders like to do, he is saying: If the president does it, it’s not illegal.The comments come just hours after Trump tweeted Monday night that people knew about his glaring conflicts of interest when they voted for him. It is therefore supposedly the media’s fault for reporting on them.Trump’s global real estate empire presents the potential for massive conflicts of interest or their appearance as every U.S. government policy action could be directed or seen to be directed to benefit the president’s pocketbook. The United States government is supposed to act in the public interest of the people and not in support of one individual’s private benefit.The list of the president-elect’s conflict of interest problems has grown over the two weeks since he won election.Trump has claimed to place his three adult children, Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, in charge of his business, but also appointed them to the executive committee of his presidential transition, thus nullifying any separation between company and government. He met with three of his Indian business partners one week after winning election. Trump is involved in at least five real estate deals in India. His Argentinian business partners celebrated with him at his victory party and helped President Mauricio Macri get in touch with the president-elect after the election. Trump hopes to build an office tower in Buenos Aires. Ivanka Trump, supposedly leading the Trump business independent of politics, also spoke with Macri on that call. She also appeared in a photograph with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe when he met with the president-elect.Laws against bribery most certainly apply to the president. Another thing that does is the emoluments clause of the Constitution. It states that no government official shall receive favorable payment from a foreign government, foreign government-owned company or foreign official without the consent of Congress. Trump owes millions in debt to the Bank of China, which is owned by the government of China. He also owes hundreds of millions in debt to Deutsche Bank, a private German bank that is currently in settlement talks with the Department of Justice over its illegal mortgage abuses. He operates a hotel in Las Vegas currently in a labor dispute.He owns a government lease for his Washington, D.C., hotel even though the lease states that it could not be held by a government official. The D.C. hotel held an event the week after his election to sell foreign diplomats and dignitaries on staying at its expensive luxury rooms to curry favor with the president-elect. In the New York Times interview, Trump stated that the D.C. hotel is “probably a more valuable asset than it was before.” He bragged that his brand is “hotter” now that he is president.On Monday, the Times reported that Trump spoke to British political figure Nigel Farage, the former head of the right-wing UK Independence Party, about opposing the construction of offshore wind farms in the UK. Trump has long protested the construction of offshore wind farms near his golf course in Scotland. He claims they would sully the view and lower his property value. Farage appears to have gone ahead and denounced those offshore wind farms.“I might have brought it up,” Trump sheepishly admitted in the Times interview.He added, though, “My company’s so unimportant to me relative to what I’m doing.”“I don’t want to influence anything.”"

But Trump reversed course a few hours later and is heading to the Times, according to his spokeswoman. And it appears the Times, which rejected a request for the entire visit to be off the record, has gotten its way. Trump’s early morning Twitter tirade, followed by an abrupt change of plans, is emblematic of his tumultuous relationship with the news media. The president-elect has craved the attention of the press, and perhaps its approval, over the past 18 months, while also demonstrating more hostility to journalists than any previous presidential candidate. Trump was scheduled to meet off-the-record with Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and a few other key representatives of the paper before participating in an on-the-record session with the reporters and editorial columnists, a Times spokeswoman told The Huffington Post on Monday. But Trump claimed early Tuesday that the “failing” paper changed the ground rules, prompting him to back out. A Times spokeswoman told HuffPost on Tuesday that the paper did not change the conditions, but that Trump’s team had requested the visit only be off-the-record. “We were unaware that the meeting was cancelled until we saw the President Elect’s tweet this morning,” said Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. “We did not change the ground rules at all and made no attempt to.”“They tried to yesterday ― asking for only a private meeting and no on-the-record segment, which we refused to agree to,” she continued. “In the end, we concluded with them that we would go back to the original plan of a small off the record session and a larger on the record session with reporters and columnists.”The meeting was considered off until Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told reporters at Trump Tower that it was back on. The ground rules appear to be the same as previously agreed upon. “Mr. Trump’s staff has told us that the President Elect’s meeting with The Times is on again,” Murphy said in a second statement. “He will meet with our publisher off-the-record and that session will be followed by an on-the-record meeting with our journalists and editorial columnists.”Trump met Monday with top network executives and anchors who agreed to off-the-record ground rules that have since prevented them from discussing the newsworthy meeting, even as explosive details leaked. The president-elect is said to have vented about how networks have covered him. He even personally criticized some executives present, such as CNN chief Jeff Zucker, sources said. Presidents meet privately at times with both network anchors and executives, but rarely do these off-the-record talks occur together. The decision to allow Trump to speak only off-the-record Monday has drawn criticism because has not held a press conference since July and has already limited access expected of him.Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that another meeting with the Times could take place in the future, but he added the paper had been covering him “inaccurately and with a nasty tone!”Though Trump routinely attacks the Times, even threatening to sue during several points of his presidential campaign, he also seems to really care how the paper portrays him. The Times has closely been covering Trump’s foreign business dealings as he become president-elect, including a Monday story detailing how Trump urged a British politician he met with after winning the election to oppose wind farms that could affect the views on his Scottish golf course.This article has been updated to reflect Trump’s meeting with the Times is back on."

Tom Price has a dismal record when it comes to LGBTQ rights.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5834a3dc1700002600e7be80.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: Nov. 29 ― President-Elect Donald Trump’s transition team confirmed on Tuesday that Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) is his pick for secretary of Health and Human Services. “Price’s hateful record on LGBTQ issues shows that he lacks an understanding of basic human rights and dignity,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD, an LGBTQ advocacy organization. That record renders him “completely unfit for secretary of Health and Human Services,” she added.The Trump transition team and Price’s office did not respond to requests for comment.Over the years, Price co-sponsored a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. He voted against a bill that banned employers from discriminating against gay people and a bill that fought anti-gay hate crimes. He called the Obama administration’s guidelines allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity “absurd.”Price went out of his way to back Kelvin Cochran, an Atlanta fire chief who was terminated in January 2015 after employees received copies of his self-published book, which equated homosexuality with pedophilia and bestiality. The city’s mayor claimed Cochran was fired for his “judgment and management.” But Price, along with five other Georgia lawmakers, signed onto a letter asking the mayor to reinstate him. (Cochran filed a lawsuit claiming that he was discriminated against because of his faith.) Price also appeared on a conference call in 2013 with Rabbi Noson Leiter, who once suggested that Hurricane Sandy was divine punishment for gay marriage. Leiter asked the congressman whether he thought it prudent to consider the medical and economic impacts of legislation that promotes a “homosexual agenda.” Price said he agreed. “The consequences of activity that has been seen as outside the norm are real and must be explored completely,” he added. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer individuals have long dealt with particular health challenges, including discrimination ― which can contribute to mental health issues, poverty and substance abuse ― physical and sexual violence, HIV and AIDS. They also routinely face stigma from health care providers, such as denial of care and being blamed for their health status. Carriers have also denied coverage based on “pre-existing conditions,” such as having a transgender medical history. Democrats and the Obama administration took unprecedented steps to address these problems, including carving out nondiscrimination protections through the Affordable Care Act. If the health care law is repealed ― an action Price has supported ― many of these protections would likely go away. But even if the law stays on the books, the Trump administration could choose not to prioritize enforcement of LGBTQ protections, or to go further and try to change the rules. The Affordable Care Act has a nondiscrimination provision, for example, that the Obama administration has defined to include gender identity and sex stereotyping. But the language does not explicitly state whether discrimination based on sexual orientation alone is included in that provision. The Trump administration will have leeway in deciding how to interpret this. Robin Maril, associate legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, said people are concerned the new administration could chip away at protections “by not enforcing them, or undermining them with exemptions.”Enforcement is key to making the Obama administration’s rules meaningful. Last year, for example, HHS’s Office for Civil Rights entered into an agreement with the Brooklyn Hospital Center to ensure that transgender patients received equal care. Among the provisions were items making sure staff didn’t make derogatory comments and ensuring appropriate room assignments. More broadly, the Obama administration has prioritized LGBTQ care in numerous other ways, including awarding grant funding to organizations that help minority men living with HIV and AIDS, taking a stand against so-called conversion therapy for gay kids, and removing the gender marker from Medicare cards to minimize privacy violations. “It is still too early to know what a Trump administration will do,” said Jennifer Kates, vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. But, “any cutback in coverage would affect those in the LGBT community, and the stakes are particularly high.” Do you work at HHS or another federal agency?

43,POLITICS,New Endangered Species: Deficit Hawk,"Chris Weigant, ContributorChris Weigant is a political commentator.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-endangered-species-deficit-hawk_us_583392f3e4b0eaa5f14d49d4,"Deficit hawk sightings used to be quite common in Washington, D.C., but early indications are that this bird’s about to become",2016-11-22,"A red-tailed hawk perches on a tree on the north grounds of the White House in Washington June 26, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583895661a00002500cc9c82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Deficit hawk sightings used to be quite common in Washington, D.C., but early indications are that this bird’s about to become a lot rarer. It may even wind up on the endangered species list, in fact. This sort of thing normally happens every time a Republican is in the White House (remember Dick Cheney’s infamous “deficits don’t matter” line?), but this time around it’s already looking like the deficit hawks could disappear entirely from within the Beltway.Donald Trump’s agenda includes many items which are going to cost a bunch of money, but few explanations of how any of it will be paid for. Of course, the favorite Republican way to pay for stuff is to shred the safety net, but Trump actually spoke out against this while campaigning, so that’s going to be an interesting battle to watch as budgets are hammered out between Congress and the White House.Congressional Republicans, of course, will be pushing for a huge tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. It’s what they do best, after all. They still firmly believe in the fantasy that “tax cuts pay for themselves,” even when the numbers clearly show this not to be true. But exacerbating the situation will be Trump’s costly agenda, which includes a big military buildup, a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, and a wall/fence on the southern border (although Trump insists that he’s somehow going to make Mexico pay for this ― just about the only time Trump addressed how any of his agenda will be paid for). All of this costs money. Even Trump’s smaller promises ― like doubling or tripling the Border Patrol ― will require more federal money be spent. And if Trump follows through on his deportation plan, that also will require a lot more federal cops to implement. The crowning cherry on top of this mountainous sundae of spending is repealing Obamacare ― which actually saves the federal government a lot of money, meaning a repeal will drive the deficit up.Trump never really talked much about deficits while running, except to occasionally take a shot at Obama. He’s obviously not a deficit hawk himself, as evidenced by his numerous bankruptcies. If he sticks to his promise not to touch Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, then pretty much everything both Trump and a Republican Congress does is going to increase federal deficits. The only tax hike Trump ever supported was to close the carried-interest loophole, but it’s highly doubtful that Republicans in Congress are going to go along with this.The problem with Republican ideology is that the numbers just never seem to add up. If they begin by slashing federal revenues with a big tax cut for the wealthy and then enact major parts of Trump’s agenda, the deficit will explode. I leave it to the economists as to whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing right now, but no matter how you feel about deficits, math is math.Jared Bernstein helpfully explains how the standard Republican model usually works:“There’s no plausible pathway that gets you from a huge trickle-down tax cut to a doubling of the growth rate,” said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former chief economic adviser to Vice President Biden. “What will happen is what always happens in these moments: You exacerbate after-tax inequality, and you generate large deficits.”. . .“When their phony growth agenda doesn’t work,” he said, “they’re going to throw their hands up and say, ‘Sorry, folks, we’re going to have to cut entitlements.’”Except this time Trump may reject entitlement cuts altogether. If he sticks to this promise (anything’s possible), Republicans won’t have any other answer and they’ll all start channeling their inner Cheney (”deficits don’t matter... because a Republican’s in the White House!”).Perhaps all of this will unleash record growth and the tax cuts will pay for themselves and the deficit will go down. Again, anything’s possible, right? But what happens if the record-long expansion period we are in ends? The business cycle often shifts almost independently of what is happening in Washington, and some economists already say we’re overdue for another recession. What happens if that occurs in the midst of the grand Republican experiment? This isn’t so far-fetched when you consider that Trump and the Republicans are already salivating at the prospects of freeing Wall Street from meaningful oversight, which might result in another financial crisis.Whether such a downturn happens on Trump’s watch or not, if Trump gets what he wants (massive spending increases) and the congressional Republicans get what they always want (a big tax cut for the wealthy), the only real possible result is larger deficits. Republicans may attempt to do away with agencies like the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency, but even those savings will likely be swallowed up by the growing deficit.Which means the most likely outcome is that Republicans just conveniently stop caring about deficits altogether. After all, it’s easier to shift your ideology than it is to balance a budget. Which is why I’m predicting that deficit hawks will become so rare in Washington that they will merit inclusion on the endangered species list. Their numbers will decrease to the point of extinction, right up to the time when a Democrat wins back the White House. When that happens, the deficit hawks will stage an amazing recovery, and be seen everywhere in Washington once again.Chris Weigant blogs at: Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigant"

Daddy Yankee de-throned Ed Sheeran with more than 44 million monthly listeners, according to the streaming platform.The feat shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who’s tuned into a radio station in the last month only to hear Daddy Yankee drop verses in Luis Fonsi’s mega hit “Despacito.” The single became the first Spanish-language hit to reach No. 1 in the U.S. on Billboard since the “Macarena” in 1996. The Puerto Rican artist first exploded into the mainstream in the early 2000s with his global hit “Gasolina,” and quickly cemented his role as a pioneer for the reggaeton genre. Daddy Yankee took to Instagram to thank Spotify and fans for their continued support, and to describe a few of the struggle he faced on his way to the top.“In 1992, I decided to dedicate myself to the art of music in this entertainment industry. I remember that no one believed me, it cost me many sacrifices and many moments missed with family,” the artist said in Spanish. “I had to face prejudice and marginalization, but today this genre called Reggeaton is the most heard around the world.” “This number 1 isn’t for Daddy Yankee, it’s for a whole genre,” he added.After thanking his fans in Spanish, the artist addressed his English-speaking fans as well. “And also thank you to all our brothers around the world who have embraced our culture,” he said. “We’ve been on this wave for a long time, now it feels good that the whole world gets to surf with us.”DY!"

The Oklahoma-based pipeline company has met stiff resistance to its proposed Atlantic Sunrise pipeline since it was first announced in 2014. On Sunday, hundreds of opponents of the project congregated in an outdoor chapel in Columbia, Pennsylvania on property owned by the Adorers of the Blood of Christ, an order of Catholic nuns. Among those in attendance were representatives from another order, the Sisters of Loretto, from Kentucky who helped defeat Williams’ Bluegrass pipeline in 2014.The Sisters of Loretto led the congregants in the singing of “Amazing Grace.” A video of the nuns singing the hymn at a Bluegrass pipeline open house in 2013 became an internet sensation after it was spotted by Mother Jones.Lancaster Against Pipelines, a grassroots group dedicated to stopping the nearly 200-mile natural gas transmission pipeline, constructed the chapel on a grove just feet from where the pipeline would cut through a corn field. The field and nearly cloudless blue sky above provided the backdrop for the simple wooden altar facing a few rows of wooden benches.Williams Partners tried to stop the dedication. Last Thursday, the company submitted a 45-page emergency motion to a federal district judge in an attempt to take immediate possession of the property and get permission to deploy U.S. Marshals on the nuns and “any third parties authorized by the sisters to be on the property.”It was a particularly brazen attempt on Williams’ part to get ahead of the legal process. The company was already scheduled to take the nuns to court later this month when it filed its emergency motion. The regulatory process is not complete yet either.

But for women,2017-07-10,"United Nations peacekeepers control South Sudanese women and children before the distribution of emergency food supplies in Juba, South Sudan, July 25, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5963a980180000350067380c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Getting a condom or the morning-after pill might be as simple as popping down the street to the local pharmacy. But for women whose lives have been upended by mass displacement or conflict, and for whom pregnancy or childbirth could be life-threatening, many or all family planning options may be out of reach.Governments and donors are gathering this week in London to assess and renew progress toward a goal, set in 2012, to give 120 million more women access to modern contraception by 2020. Often women and girls in crisis settings have the most overlooked needs. Aid workers attending the summit are prepared to point out that family planning works in crisis settings, that it saves lives, and that women both want and need it.It’s important to understand that being able to decide if and when to get pregnant is a human right and a key component of women’s empowerment. Country representatives at the summit should pledge political support and funds for family planning for women whose other rights are often violated in abusive conflicts.I was recently in the rebel-held Nuba mountains in Sudan, where aerial bombing of villages and other violations in a six-year war have forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. Most of the women I interviewed had never seen a condom; many had no idea what one was. No one I spoke to had any access to family planning. Women’s rights, one civil society leader said, were on hold.Hassina, now 19, first experienced obstructed labor when she was 14. She had already lost a lot of blood in two days of labor and was passing in and out of consciousness when her family put her on a motorcycle to reach a hospital where her dead baby was removed by caesarean section. A doctor advised her she was at risk of complications and should go to a hospital for future births. However, the continuing conflict meant that in her next pregnancy, she was stranded in a dry riverbed seeking refuge from Sudanese government bombs when she went into labor. By the time she reached medical help, they again removed a dead baby.Hassina never had access to contraception. Tragically, women and girls in a war zone ― where getting enough food for their existing children is a struggle ― have no control and no choice on spacing births.Global family planning efforts have focused primarily on delivery of services in more stable settings. But donors and policy-makers need to start making concerted efforts to reach women in humanitarian crises with a range of options for family planning. The greatest proportion of women who die in pregnancy or childbirth are in conflict-affected countries, or countries recently emerging from conflict. Family planning is lifesaving. But studies show that family planning lags behind other needs in humanitarian funding.Aid groups have shown that when they provide a choice of family planning methods in crisis settings, women and girls eagerly use these services. Sometimes these groups are the first service providers to offer women control over their own fertility. These services are key not only for women recently and temporarily displaced because of conflict, but for the huge numbers who are stuck in long-term and complex conflicts that show no sign of ending soon.Making family planning an adequately funded and normal part of aid may save lives of women like Hasina but could also open up choices that women in the rest of the world take for granted. The basic right to be able to control your own fertility, to choose when to be pregnant, should be one that all women have access to...Skye Wheeler is a women’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch."

I just think we ought to direct our resources and our energies to doing something about it. And other people have made this point: If the guy was running Dairy Queen, he’d be gone. This guy couldn’t work at The Gap. So why do we have to be victimized by his fecklessness, his ignorance? But it’s just the behavior is insulting to Americans, whether you voted for him or not ― and I feel bad for people who did vote for him because he promised them things that they really needed and one wonders if he’s really going to come through. I know there’s trouble in this country and we need a guy who can fix that trouble. I wish it was Trump, but it’s not, so let’s just stop whining about what a goon he is and figure out a way to take him aside and put him in a home. The comedian’s comments come as his new video series with Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) premieres on Funny or Die.The new project, “Boiling the Frog with Senator Al Franken,” debuted Monday and will roll out new episodes weekly. Franken said the goal is to “fight back” against the country’s uninterested attitude toward climate change and other science-based problems.In particular, “Boiling the Frog” will address the White House’s stance on those topics.“Since taking office, President Trump has decided to disregard science in order to repeatedly put the short-sighted interests of his friends in the fossil fuel industry ahead of the safety of our planet,” Franken told the AP. “We hope to bring some much needed attention to this critical issue and ultimately, to help encourage people in Minnesota, Dave’s home state of Indiana and all Americans to make their voices heard and join the fight to combat climate change.” The team behind the Emmy-winning show “Years of Living Dangerously” ― in which Letterman traveled to India for an episode partly about climate change ― is also on board.Watch the first episode below:"

Through her lawyer, Fairooz argued that her “brief reflexive burst of noise” could not sustain a conviction, and that the jury that convicted her “was not reasonable in its evaluation of the evidence.”But in court documents filed last week ahead of Fairooz’s scheduled sentencing on Friday, prosecutors wrote that the jury “could have reasonably rejected” Fairooz’s contention that her laugh was a reflexive reaction to a claim about Sessions’ record that she found absurd. In a court filing signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kimberly Paschall, the government argued that the jury “could reasonably infer that the laugh was a deliberate disruption” and “intentional.”HuffPost spoke with several members of the jury following the guilty verdict. On condition of anonymity, the jurors said they’d focused more on Fairooz’s conduct after Capitol Police Officer Katherine Coronado began taking her into custody ― even if they disagreed with Coronado’s decision to do so. “We did not agree that she should have been removed for laughing,” the jury foreperson told HuffPost. Coronado was a rookie officer who had never made an arrest nor worked a congressional hearing. However, prosecutors wrote that she was acting upon her belief that she was supposed to immediately remove anyone from the room who made any sort of disruption.“The jury reasonably considered all of the defendant’s actions together in reaching the verdict. She did not merely laugh,” the government wrote. It went on:Rather, the jury could infer from testimony and video evidence about the laugh and Fairooz’s subsequent conduct that her laugh was an intentional, loud statement of disagreement. The jury could have considered that upon being removed, Fairooz had a sign at the ready and loudly proclaimed and demonstrated her views. The jury then could reasonably view the resulting disruption as both an intentional and foreseeable result of the defendant’s course of conduct.Even if Coronado was mistaken in arresting Fairooz, prosecutors said that didn’t give Fairooz the right to disrupt the hearing. They emphasized Fairooz’s words as she was being taken out of the room: “I was gonna be quiet, and now you’re going to have me arrested? For what?” (See video above.) “Just as a defendant cannot resist arrest when the arrest is unlawful, a defendant should not be able to disrupt a hearing before Congress based on her opinion that police action was unlawful,” prosecutors wrote.The government does not appear to have taken a position yet on what Fairooz’s sentence should be.Fairooz is scheduled to be sentenced alongside Tighe Barry and Lenny Bianchi, two protesters affiliated with Code Pink who dressed up as members of the Ku Klux Klan and pretended to support Sessions when he entered the room for his nomination hearing.UPDATE: July 11, 3:40 p.m. ― In a memo ahead of her sentencing, Fairooz’s attorney requested a suspended sentence followed by a period of unsupervised probation for “the shortest period of time that the Court sees fit under the circumstances.” The sentencing memo also included letters from several of Fairooz’s friends, as well as a letter from Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), who serves as ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee.In the letter to Judge Robert E. Morin printed below, Conyers asked for leniency in Fairooz’s case, noting the conviction had “garnered substantial attention in the press, due to the appearance that the arrest resulted from merely emitting laughter over the record of a deeply controversial Executive Branch nominee in a public hearing.” He wrote that “substantial questions exist with respect to the application of law in this particular case” given the nature of the offense.“As the Ranking Member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, I take seriously breaches of decorum in Congress. However, in this instance, the finding of guilt under these particular circumstances raises questions that should counsel leniency with regard to sentencing,” Conyers wrote. “In your sentencing decision in this particular case, I hope you will take these circumstances into consideration.”"

Prosecutors allege that Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, known by the nickname “Teodorin,” earned around $80,000 per year as agriculture minister during the period in question, but somehow bought a 101-room mansion on one of Paris’ most exclusive streets, dozens of super-luxury cars and millions of dollars’ worth of watches, clothing, wine and art.The trial may be the first time such a senior sitting official is being tried for a corruption-related offense in another country. The defendant is not in Paris — he is being tried in absentia — but the trial is a landmark event and a prime example of why fighting corruption requires a global strategy.French authorities say that Teodorin, who is also the son of the president, paid for his shopping spree with more than $100 million he embezzled from public funds. The government of Equatorial Guinea, which is on the western coast of Africa just south of Cameroon, has argued that even if Teodorin did transfer all of this public money to his business accounts, it would not be a crime because Equatorial Guinea has no laws against officials owning companies that do business with the government. Teodorin’s lawyers made the same argument when the U.S. Department of Justice seized his Malibu mansion and million-dollar collection of Michael Jackson memorabilia in 2012.Political power and economic interests are deeply intertwined in Equatorial Guinea, which has been ruled for just shy of 38 years by Teodorin’s father, currently the world’s second-longest-serving ruler, who ousted his predecessor in a military coup in 1979. Over the decades, President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo installed his sons and other family members in high-level government positions and allowed senior government officials, and the ruling family in particular, to siphon off the country’s oil wealth. The Equatorial Guinean government has gone to great lengths to protect Teodorin. Days after the French court ordered Teodorin to stand trial, in 2012, his father promoted him to vice president and filed a case in the International Court of Justice claiming France was violating Teodorin’s immunity. (The court dismissed the argument.) On the first day of the trial in Paris, a court decision from Equatorial Guinea arrived in the French judges’ office that purported to clear Teodorin of any wrongdoing.I’ve spent the past year researching Teodorin and corruption in Equatorial Guinea, and what struck me most when I visited the country last year was the brazen impunity enjoyed by corrupt officials. As a corruption researcher for Human Rights Watch, I had read all the history books, court documents and financial reports on the county I could find. I thought I knew the story well: The discovery of oil more than two decades ago turned Equatorial Guinea from one of the poorest countries in the world to the country with the highest per capita income in Africa.But health and education remain stubbornly poor, and in some ways are worsening. The government invests only a tiny fraction of its budget in health and education, instead spending the vast majority of its oil revenue on infrastructure projects that function as conduits for enriching the ruling elite. For example, the government is building a new capital called Oyala in middle of the jungle at a cost of $8 billion ― half the country’s 2016 budget, according to the International Monetary Fund ― even after spending billions on ministry buildings in the current island capital, Malabo, and on the alternate capital, Bata. The shameless display of officials’ wealth contrasts sharply with the government’s neglect of ordinary citizens. In Malabo and Bata, endless walls protect enormous mansions that loom over homes that lack running water. Some neighborhoods I visited had a central pump where residents could collect drinking water, but in others residents had to boil water from wells or the river — if they have the money for gas needed for boiling.Nearly everyone I spoke with described their frustration when a major road was closed just so that Teodorin could take a ride in his exotic cars. Unlike that speedway, most of the roads in neighborhoods I visited were unpaved, with large pools of water from the near daily rains making it difficult to drive.I interviewed teachers, doctors and nurses who described a myriad of problems: overcrowding, lack of basic equipment, poor training, low salaries and high fees that often left patients without proper treatment and students without a basic education. One nurse said she had to work all day with the same pair of gloves; another described regularly turning away patients who couldn’t pay the hospital fees. Teachers, students and parents told me that public school teachers often don’t show up for class and barely have more education than their students. The data bears out this neglect: vaccination rates are among the lowest in the world and Equatorial Guinea has the seventh highest rate of primary school-age children out of school.“Nothing has changed,” someone who has taught high school for the past 23 years told me when I asked about the impact of the oil boom on his public school. Many people expressed the feeling that nothing will ever change, even as declining oil production threatens to slam shut the window of opportunity. What power do ordinary people have to puncture the impunity of an elite that has controlled the political, economic and legal spheres of their country for nearly four decades?Teodorin’s trial presents exactly this opportunity. Shining a light on the transfer of millions of dollars funneled into bank accounts owned by the president’s son sends a powerful message that the arm of the law is long enough to reach even those who have the resources of an entire government at their disposal to protect themselves at home.This lesson is especially important as the U.S. seems to be withdrawing from its role as a leader in fighting corruption around the world. One of Congress’ recent acts was to repeal an Obama-era rule that required companies that extract natural resources to publish what they pay to governments, key information for citizens to hold resource-rich governments accountable. There has even been talk of putting the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act — a 40-year-old law that prohibits American companies from bribing foreign officials — on the chopping block.Equatorial Guinea exemplifies the harm done when the world turns a blind eye to corruption. But whatever the outcome of Teodorin’s trial, its three French judges are now showing what it looks like when the world does exactly the opposite."

This time on the Greek Island of Zante or Zakynthos.I was driven to tears reading the Washington Post story about another young person taken from us too soon.The article stated:Bakari Henderson, 22, was with friends at a bar in Laganas, a tourist village on the island of Zakynthos, when the fight occurred early Friday morning. It began when another customer approached Henderson, and the confrontation quickly escalated to a fistfight outside, where more people beat Henderson, according to state news agency ANA-MPA. It is not known whether his friends were involved in the altercation.Everyone has a right to a few beers or cocktails while on vacation. Being beaten to death in front of a bar on an exotic island is a dastardly and horrific event, and the assailants should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.From the ages of 16-24, I spent many a summer on beaches and in bars on the Aegean islands of Santorini, Ios, Naxos, Paros, Mykonos and in Ibiza in Spain. At the end of the evening, people went back to their pensions for a night’s rest, before sleeping off their hangovers on the beach. Out of control hooligan behavior, even brawling in bars was rarely seen.While the events of the cowardly attack continue to unravel, eight people, mostly of Serbian descent, have been arrested in association with the brutal beating of the 22-year-old American.The forested island of Zakynthos is on the lesser visited western side of islands in the Ionian Sea. Sadly, many Americans miss out on the many outstanding hidden white sand beaches of Corfu, Kefalonia, and Zante/Zakynthos.The island would not strike you as a big party destination. However, low-cost carriers the likes of Easy Jet and Ryan Air haul in package deal vacationers for a bit of fun in the sun. Most arrive on this breathtaking island to visit Navagio Beach with its shipwrecked boat left on the beach, and probably the most stunning beach in all of Greece. The Blue Caves leave incoming tourists bedazzled by its illuminated, out of this world shade of turquoise waters, created by the suns reflection of the cave rock formations sculpted over thousands of years.Yet some arrive in search of a week-long drinking binge, in a competition to out drink one another. Many times the end result is a not so cozy cell in a Greek jail, or, in certain instances even been sent home, cutting short that dream vacation.Young people have been flocking to the sun-drenched islands of the Mediterranean since the ’60s. I just can’t recall many circumstances involving such of control behavior.Whereas no one nation leads the way in drunk and disorderly conduct, some travelers from the U.K. have been at the forefront of more than one recent elixir induced episode.The authorities have been called in on numerous occasions to break up rowdy bar fights, that can extend onto Greece’s pristine beaches.Clearly, the Greeks are on top of their game in curtailing such matters of blatant intoxication.Greece is one of the top 20 visited countries in the world. The Greek GNP relies heavily on the travel and tourism sector. Visitors are a necessary means to a sluggish economy.Sadly, these episodes can and do happen everywhere in the world; as well as your own home. We’ve all seen out of control behavior somewhere on holiday, from South Beach to Bondi Beach; from South Padre Island to the island of Koh Samui in Thailand. Unfortunately, too regularly nowadays.We hear these tragic tales far too often. Here was a young man in the wrong place and at the wrong time, just starting adult life. Starry-eyed, filled with dreams and aspirations and probably on cloud nine just to be on an epic vacation in Greece.RIP Bakari Henderson."

It was quiet on the main Manshiya front near the border with Jordan, which he said had been the site of some of the heaviest army bombing in recent weeks.A Syrian official indicated that Damascus approved of the ceasefire deal, describing the government’s silence over it as a “sign of satisfaction”.“We welcome any step that would cease the fire and pave the way for peaceful solutions,” the government official told Reuters.A witness in Deraa said he had not seen warplanes in the sky or heard any fighting since noon.CRUMBLEDHowever, several ceasefires have crumbled since the onset of the conflict.With the help of Russian air power and Iranian-backed militias, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government has put rebels on the back foot over the last year. The wide array of mostly Sunni rebels include jihadist factions and other groups supported by Turkey, the United States and Gulf monarchies.Earlier talks between the United States and Russia about a “de-escalation zone” in southwest Syria covered Deraa province on the border with Jordan, nearby Sweida and Quneitra which borders the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.“We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives,” Trump said on Twitter on Sunday. “Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!”The deal marks the first peace-making effort in the Syrian war by the U.S. government under Trump, appearing to give him a diplomatic achievement at his first meeting with Putin.A senior U.S. State Department official involved in the talks said further discussions would be necessary to decide crucial aspects of the agreement, including who will monitor its enforcement.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the deal included “securing humanitarian access and setting up contacts between the opposition in the region and a monitoring center that is being established in Jordan’s capital.”The U.N. Deputy Special Envoy for Syria said on Saturday the deal was a “positive development” ahead of the latest round of U.N.-sponsored peace talks to begin in Geneva on Monday.Deraa and Quneitra are home to tens of thousands of people and form a center of the insurgency south of the Syrian capital Damascus. Rebels said intense air strikes had pounded Deraa’s opposition territory in recent weeks.The multi-sided Syrian conflict, which grew out of popular protests against Assad’s rule in 2011, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world’s worst refugee crisis.(Additional reporting by Suleiman al-Khalidi and Laila Bassam; Editing by Janet Lawrence)"

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi congratulated the armed forces as the end of the battle for the city nears.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59627f861500006303bfcb9f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi traveled to Mosul on Sunday to declare victory during the final phase of the long campaign to drive the self-described Islamic State militants out of the city of Mosul. Armed forces were still battling over the last part of the Old City under militant control on Sunday as Abadi congratulated Iraqi fighters and Baghdad residents celebrated by dancing in the streets. On Monday, the U.S.-led coalition that supported Iraq throughout the battle announced that fighters had managed to clear the rest of the city. “While there are still areas of the Old City of Mosul that must be backed-cleared of explosive devices and possible ISIS fighters in hiding, the Iraqi Security Forces have Mosul now firmly under their control,” the coalition said in a statement. As the end of the battle neared, the destruction brought on by nine months of fierce fighting came into plain sight. Thousands of Mosul residents have lost their lives in the violence. Nearly a million people have been displaced. Entire districts have been leveled.ISIS swept into Mosul in the summer of 2014 in a lightning offensive and made the majority Sunni city its headquarters in Iraq. In June 2014, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addressed his followers and celebrated the declaration of a caliphate from inside the city’s history Grand al-Nuri Mosque.The battle to retake Mosul started in October 2016, and first focused on the eastern districts before moving to the narrow streets of the Old City in the west.The campaign lasted far longer than expected, and took a far heavier toll than predicted.“In western Mosul what we’re seeing is the worst damage of the entire conflict. In those neighborhoods where the fighting has been the fiercest, we’re looking at levels of damage incomparable to anything else that has happened in Iraq so far,” Lisa Grande, the United Nations’ humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, told Reuters on Wednesday. At least six of western Mosul’s 44 districts have been leveled, Grande said. Air strikes, fierce house-to-house combat and attacks by suicide bombers have obliterated crucial infrastructure like roads, bridges, the water works and the electricity net. Homes, schools and hospitals have been destroyed. On June 21, as Iraqi armed forces were closing in, ISIS blew up the 12th-century Grand al-Nuri mosque where Baghdadi had given his caliphate speech.The UN estimates it will take up to a year, and more than $1 billion, to restore basic services like water, sewage, electricity, schools and medical facilities. Long-term rebuilding is expected to cost billions more. The level of destruction severely complicates the return of hundreds of thousands of Mosul residents who fled the fighting. More than 900,000 people, about half of the city’s population, are now living with family members or in refugee camps. “For families that come from other neighborhoods that are moderately destroyed, I think we can expect that many of them will try to go back and they’ll do the best they can to try to rebuild,” Grande said. For the others, a longer stay in one of the many overcrowded refugee camps lies ahead. At the Hassan Sham camp east of Mosul, a reporter for Reuters last week witnessed residents selling food rations in order to buy ice to keep cool amid temperatures topping 104 degrees. Mohammed Haji Ahmed had fled Mosul just five days before telling Reuters he had lost his home, business and 15 members of his family since ISIS took over the city. “If there is no rebuilding and people don’t return to their homes and regain their belongings, what is the meaning of liberation?” he asked."

On Monday, the U.S.-led coalition that supported Iraq throughout the battle announced that fighters had managed to clear the rest of the city. “While there are still areas of the Old City of Mosul that must be backed-cleared of explosive devices and possible ISIS fighters in hiding, the Iraqi Security Forces have Mosul now firmly under their control,” the coalition said in a statement. As the end of the battle neared, the destruction brought on by nine months of fierce fighting came into plain sight. Thousands of Mosul residents have lost their lives in the violence. Nearly a million people have been displaced. Entire districts have been leveled.ISIS swept into Mosul in the summer of 2014 in a lightning offensive and made the majority Sunni city its headquarters in Iraq. In June 2014, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addressed his followers and celebrated the declaration of a caliphate from inside the city’s history Grand al-Nuri Mosque.The battle to retake Mosul started in October 2016, and first focused on the eastern districts before moving to the narrow streets of the Old City in the west.The campaign lasted far longer than expected, and took a far heavier toll than predicted.“In western Mosul what we’re seeing is the worst damage of the entire conflict. In those neighborhoods where the fighting has been the fiercest, we’re looking at levels of damage incomparable to anything else that has happened in Iraq so far,” Lisa Grande, the United Nations’ humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, told Reuters on Wednesday. At least six of western Mosul’s 44 districts have been leveled, Grande said. Air strikes, fierce house-to-house combat and attacks by suicide bombers have obliterated crucial infrastructure like roads, bridges, the water works and the electricity net. Homes, schools and hospitals have been destroyed. On June 21, as Iraqi armed forces were closing in, ISIS blew up the 12th-century Grand al-Nuri mosque where Baghdadi had given his caliphate speech.The UN estimates it will take up to a year, and more than $1 billion, to restore basic services like water, sewage, electricity, schools and medical facilities. Long-term rebuilding is expected to cost billions more. The level of destruction severely complicates the return of hundreds of thousands of Mosul residents who fled the fighting. More than 900,000 people, about half of the city’s population, are now living with family members or in refugee camps. “For families that come from other neighborhoods that are moderately destroyed, I think we can expect that many of them will try to go back and they’ll do the best they can to try to rebuild,” Grande said. For the others, a longer stay in one of the many overcrowded refugee camps lies ahead. At the Hassan Sham camp east of Mosul, a reporter for Reuters last week witnessed residents selling food rations in order to buy ice to keep cool amid temperatures topping 104 degrees. Mohammed Haji Ahmed had fled Mosul just five days before telling Reuters he had lost his home, business and 15 members of his family since ISIS took over the city. “If there is no rebuilding and people don’t return to their homes and regain their belongings, what is the meaning of liberation?” he asked."

Though the briefing identified Abe as “President Abe of Japan,” Trump correctly referred to him as prime minister in his remarks.The White House also released a press read-out that misidentified Chinese President Xi Jinping as the president of the Republic of China. Xi is the President of the People’s Republic of China, while Tsai Ing-wen is the president of the Republic of China, which is more commonly known as Taiwan.The distinctions are significant and could have been seen as a slight to Beijing, as China sees the island of Taiwan as a breakaway province, while Taiwan’s government asserts it is an independent country.Before being sworn into office, Trump flirted with the idea of the U.S. no longer officially having a “one China” policy, which states that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it. He sparked some anger and a diplomatic protest when he accepted a congratulatory phone call from Ing-wen after his presidential victory. That marked the first contact between a Taiwan leader and a U.S. president-elect or president since President Jimmy Carter put the “one China” policy in effect in 1979.In February, Trump said he would be honoring the “one China” policy after all."

The meeting, which included Jared Kushner and Trump’s then-campaign manager Paul Manafort and took place at Trump Tower in Manhattan, came to light in an investigation published Saturday in The New York Times. Trump Jr. defended the summit, which he said focused on Russian child adoption policies. On Sunday, Priebus said “the individual that set up the meeting may have been” associated with Fusion GPS, the Washington, D.C.-based strategy firm behind a leaked intelligence dossier that suggested Russian officials possess materials that could be used to blackmail President Trump. Trump’s Republican rivals in the primary funded the opposition research at first, but it was later continued with backing from the Democrats. “There’s more questions on the Democrat side than anywhere else,” Priebus said on “Fox News Sunday.” He pointed to an article on Circa, the news site owned by the right-wing media giant Sinclair Broadcast Group, which cited a spokesman for Trump’s legal team. The story was splashed on Drudge Report on Sunday morning.“We have learned from both our own investigation and public reports that the participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for,” Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump’s lawyers, said in a statement published by Circa. “Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the President and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier.”Priebus brushed off the meeting as a “very short meeting,” lasting about 20 minutes. But asked for details, he demurred.“I have no idea, Chris, you’re going to have to talk to them,” Priebus told host Chris Wallace, referring to Kushner, Trump Jr. and Manafort. “However, talking about issues of foreign policy, issues related to our place in the world, issues important to the American people, like adoption, is something that’s not unusual.” But, just hours later, another report from The New York Times cast doubt over the narrative Priebus spun. According to the report, which cites three White House advisers and two others briefed on the meeting, Donald Trump Jr. met with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, after being promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton, then the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The meeting, the report noted, represented the first public indication that the Trump campaign was willing to accept help from a Kremlin-linked individual. In a statement, Trump Jr. admitted to meeting with the lawyer after learning she may have a tip about the Clinton campaign, but said she offered nothing of value and instead used “claims of potentially helpful information” as a pretext for a meeting about Russian adoption issues.“Here statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense,” he said in a statement given to ABC News after the Times report published. “It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.” Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign last August amid reports that he worked with pro-Russian forces in Ukraine. The extent of his ties to Russian interests became clearer later, with reports as recently as last month revealing that he received more than $17 million over two years working for a pro-Kremlin party. Manafort remained in contact with the president after his resignation, and reportedly advised the White House on how to deal with the ballooning Russia scandal. In May, The New York Times reported that Kushner faced scrutiny in the F.B.I. probe into Russian hacking of the 2016 election. Kushner allegedly tried to circumvent diplomatic channels to open a direct line between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The revelation on Saturday could drag Trump Jr., a loud cheerleader for his father’s administration, into the investigation. On Sunday, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said he may push Trump Jr., who runs the Trump Organization with his brother, to testify before the committee. “We are going to want to question everyone at that meeting about what was discussed,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”This story was updated to include the follow-up report published Sunday by the Times.

To many Lebanese, the refugees are straining Lebanon’s rickety infrastructure, taking citizens’ jobs, contributing to a growing crime rate, and being used by terrorists in their midst to undermine the country’s existence.Beyond the hyped, fear-mongering and/or sympathetic reporting, an almost neglected side effect is the impact on video journalists, photographers and reporters relaying the story.The International News Safety Institute (INSI) produced an invaluable report published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism on the adverse effects of refugee coverage on journalists. “The Emotional Toll On Journalists Covering The Refugee Crisis” comes not a moment too soon and describes the stress they feel, a/k/a “moral injury.” According to an executive summary:Moral injury rather than PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) or depression emerged as the biggest psychological challenge confronted by journalists covering the migration crisis. Given that moral injury is strongly associated with journalists becoming actively involved in helping refugees, the industry needs to reach consensus on defining appropriate expectations in situations such as these.Award-winning Greek-Canadian Agence France-Presse (AFP) freelancer Will Vassilopoulos knows this well.He told the 24th Annual Conference and 23rd General Assembly of COPEAM, the Permanent Conference of Mediterranean Audiovisual Operators, in Beirut in May that he and other journalists have had to balance coverage of refugees flooding into Greece with helping save, and sometimes carry corpses of, countless asylum seekers from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere.He also spoke of how he felt he hadn’t done enough to help the refugees who overwhelmed several Greek islands’ resources.The INSI report quoted him as saying:‘The feeling of guilt was very strong,’ he recalled, when breaking the news to the refugees that despite their joy at arriving on Greek shores they still had 60 kilometres to go to the town where they could be registered. ‘For sure, you’re keeping your journalistic integrity, you’re not changing history,’ but, ‘the problem is there is so much grey.’ Vassilopoulos recognises there were times when that grey threatened to become overwhelming.Since the outbreak of the Syrian conflict and influx of millions of refugees into neighboring countries, Arab journalists’ coverage has been limited to certain angles and manipulated to serve political ends and agendas, said Amman-based Rula Amin, Senior Communications Advisor/Spokesperson at the United Nations High Commission for Refugees’ Director’s office for the Middle East and North Africa.“And in that context it (media coverage) missed out on the crucial important aspect of the refugees’ needs, which are their rights, rights for asylum and right to pursue their lives in dignity and with full protection,” she explained.I asked Amin, a veteran of CNN and Al Jazeera English, what reporters were getting right, and what they had missed in this story. “What reporters are getting right is the misery of the refugees’ living conditions,” she said. “Anybody who visits a refugee camp or refugees living in urban areas will be immediately overwhelmed by the difficulties, the challenges and the hardship these people are enduring.”But what's missing is the larger context, how best to help them, how best to receive them, what the host countries’ obligations are, she added.Another missing aspect is a healthy questioning of the standard impact of the influx of the refugees on the host communities, Amin noted.“It's very true that the influx of this huge number of refugees will burden any society, its government, its infrastructure, and it puts an additional financial burden, but it's important to note also the influx of funds and aid from donor countries to the host community to help share the burden,” Amin said.Lebanon’s Al Joumhouriya newspaper headlined an article “Displaced Syrians Establish Comprehensive Economy at Expense of Lebanese.” Away from the humanitarian aspect of the Syrian displacement to Lebanon, and far from the overwhelming circumstances the displaced Syrians face, facts show the presence of over 1.5 million (refugees) on Lebanese territory, most of whom have settled and established businesses and commercial enterprises, while the remainder have jobs in Lebanese organizations, replacing Lebanese workers. Damned if you do, and damned if you don’t, with your reporting.But the presence of hundreds of thousands of refugees also contributes to the growth of consumer markets, through their purchasing power, a contribution to the economy absent from the narrative, Amin argued. So are refugee-related international organizations and NGOs doing a credible job of providing journalists with information they need or are there problems of communication? “I think, as a former journalist, it's the job of good reporters to get the story right, regardless of whether the UN agencies are doing their job right,” she insisted.How, then, can journalists continue covering it without suffering from ""refugee fatigue"" and guilt about their inability to improve the refugees' situation?“We can't afford to grow numb to human suffering, we can't shut our eyes to the huge price these people are paying and we can always learn from the resilience of the refugees, their strong will to overcome the hardship, to make ends meet, to give their children an education,” Amin concluded. “Their determination to survive is always inspiring.”"

Given that moral injury is strongly associated with journalists becoming actively involved in helping refugees, the industry needs to reach consensus on defining appropriate expectations in situations such as these.Award-winning Greek-Canadian Agence France-Presse (AFP) freelancer Will Vassilopoulos knows this well.He told the 24th Annual Conference and 23rd General Assembly of COPEAM, the Permanent Conference of Mediterranean Audiovisual Operators, in Beirut in May that he and other journalists have had to balance coverage of refugees flooding into Greece with helping save, and sometimes carry corpses of, countless asylum seekers from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere.He also spoke of how he felt he hadn’t done enough to help the refugees who overwhelmed several Greek islands’ resources.The INSI report quoted him as saying:‘The feeling of guilt was very strong,’ he recalled, when breaking the news to the refugees that despite their joy at arriving on Greek shores they still had 60 kilometres to go to the town where they could be registered. ‘For sure, you’re keeping your journalistic integrity, you’re not changing history,’ but, ‘the problem is there is so much grey.’ Vassilopoulos recognises there were times when that grey threatened to become overwhelming.Since the outbreak of the Syrian conflict and influx of millions of refugees into neighboring countries, Arab journalists’ coverage has been limited to certain angles and manipulated to serve political ends and agendas, said Amman-based Rula Amin, Senior Communications Advisor/Spokesperson at the United Nations High Commission for Refugees’ Director’s office for the Middle East and North Africa.“And in that context it (media coverage) missed out on the crucial important aspect of the refugees’ needs, which are their rights, rights for asylum and right to pursue their lives in dignity and with full protection,” she explained.I asked Amin, a veteran of CNN and Al Jazeera English, what reporters were getting right, and what they had missed in this story. “What reporters are getting right is the misery of the refugees’ living conditions,” she said. “Anybody who visits a refugee camp or refugees living in urban areas will be immediately overwhelmed by the difficulties, the challenges and the hardship these people are enduring.”But what's missing is the larger context, how best to help them, how best to receive them, what the host countries’ obligations are, she added.Another missing aspect is a healthy questioning of the standard impact of the influx of the refugees on the host communities, Amin noted.“It's very true that the influx of this huge number of refugees will burden any society, its government, its infrastructure, and it puts an additional financial burden, but it's important to note also the influx of funds and aid from donor countries to the host community to help share the burden,” Amin said.Lebanon’s Al Joumhouriya newspaper headlined an article “Displaced Syrians Establish Comprehensive Economy at Expense of Lebanese.” Away from the humanitarian aspect of the Syrian displacement to Lebanon, and far from the overwhelming circumstances the displaced Syrians face, facts show the presence of over 1.5 million (refugees) on Lebanese territory, most of whom have settled and established businesses and commercial enterprises, while the remainder have jobs in Lebanese organizations, replacing Lebanese workers. Damned if you do, and damned if you don’t, with your reporting.But the presence of hundreds of thousands of refugees also contributes to the growth of consumer markets, through their purchasing power, a contribution to the economy absent from the narrative, Amin argued. So are refugee-related international organizations and NGOs doing a credible job of providing journalists with information they need or are there problems of communication? “I think, as a former journalist, it's the job of good reporters to get the story right, regardless of whether the UN agencies are doing their job right,” she insisted.How, then, can journalists continue covering it without suffering from ""refugee fatigue"" and guilt about their inability to improve the refugees' situation?“We can't afford to grow numb to human suffering, we can't shut our eyes to the huge price these people are paying and we can always learn from the resilience of the refugees, their strong will to overcome the hardship, to make ends meet, to give their children an education,” Amin concluded. “Their determination to survive is always inspiring.”"

After all, the name “Lincoln Center” is steeped in cultural relevance and serious creative exploration. But Midsummer Night Swing is more of a neighborhood block party - a mix of old and young, children and dogs, neighbors and friends out for a night of musical enjoyment on the Upper West Side. And the fact that it’s free certainly helps to democratize the crowd.So when you take Damrosch park, add comfortably cool summer night - and then add Disco, well you can’t help but have a good time.On June 8th, Midsummer Night Swing presented - Nu Disco LIVE! with performances by Body Language and French Horn Rebellion featuring guest vocalist Megan Vice and with DJ sets by Tommie Sunshine and The Golden Pony.French Horn Rebellion is lead by David and Robert Perlick-Molinari. Robert plays the French Horn. The sound is ‘80s-style synthpop - with a thumping disco beat. As Robert explains it to Milkcrater - “Years ago, I was playing in the Chicago Civic Orchestra as a French horn player, and one day decided it wasn’t the right place for me. I rebelled against the horn establishment. My brother and I decided to make dance music and put horn on top.” “So needless to say, we’ve been having a lot of fun. The obvious name for the project then became, ‘French Horn Rebellion.’”For this gig Perlick-Molinari was joined by singer Megan Vice.She’s equal parts glam and grit, pairing polished production and structured songwriting with syncopated beats and raw, unfiltered lyrics. She told music.allaccess.com “I think my sound on this collection has really evolved from my first release, taken a gutsier turn if you will… I feel like I shed old skin and unveil a fresh layer of myself with every new project, and I think that’s evident when you listen to/view my work.”Bringing a fun pop sound to Lincoln Center Midsummer Night Swing - Vice say’s that’s what music is all about. “I usually pull inspiration from my love life, or ridiculous scenarios surrounding love in general, or things I am going through that are rough for me that I try to make light of in a song because it helps me cope.”"

Missouri may be the most glaring case yet.",2017-07-09,"Fast-food workers in St. Louis could see their wages go backwards, after state Republicans nullified the city's new minimum wage.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595f8c062100003400fc5c47.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two months ago, Cynthia Sanders got a raise at her janitorial job, from $8.30 to $10 per hour, after St. Louis passed a law raising its minimum wage. The extra money has helped the 51-year-old cover groceries and utilities as she raises three grandchildren.But in just a few weeks, Sanders’ pay rate could drop back down again, thanks to a new law Republicans in the Missouri legislature passed invalidating St. Louis’ minimum wage.“It was life-changing to get this, and it’s going to be life-changing to have it taken away,” said Sanders, who cleans four kitchenettes and eight bathrooms per shift at a Wells Fargo building downtown. “You’ve got children looking at you to be a provider. How do I tell them we’ve got to eat noodles again this week?”Like other low-wage workers in Missouri and beyond, Sanders finds herself caught in a political and legal battle between local Democrats and state Republicans. As blue cities become incubators for progressive policy, their red state legislatures are trying to thwart them through “preemption laws” that forbid cities and counties from implementing their own measures related to the minimum wage, paid sick days, plastic bag taxes and other hot-button issues. So far, Republican state legislators are winning the fight. In Missouri, for example, the GOP controls both chambers of the statehouse as well as the governor’s mansion.Under the law Republicans passed in response to St. Louis’ new ordinance, no locality could have a minimum wage higher than the state level of $7.70 per hour. And St. Louis is not the only city immediately affected. A referendum to gradually raise the minimum wage in Kansas City to $15 was slated to go on the ballot in August. While preemption laws have been around for years, Republicans are increasingly turning to them to nullify local liberal policies. According to a February report from the National League of Cities, 24 states now block local minimum wage hikes, 17 block local paid leave mandates, and three block local anti-discrimination measures. The group attributes the growing use of preemption laws to the fact that Republicans now have 25 so-called state government “trifectas” ― control of both legislative chambers and the governor’s office.The laws have become a particularly effective tool for blunting the “Fight for $15” campaign, a union-funded initiative aimed at raising the minimum wage and unionizing low-wage workers. While the federal minimum wage has remained $7.25 since 2009, voters and city halls have embraced proposals to raise the local minimum wage, in some cases hiking the wage floor to as high as $15. (The federal minimum wage prevails anywhere local law does not mandate a higher one.) The preemption laws have provided Republican state officials with a way to block proposals that poll extremely well and have strong financial backing from unions. Dennis Shaw, who works at the St. Louis grocery chain Schnucks, received a $1.70 raise due to the St. Louis ordinance. The pay bump translated into an extra $30 or so each week after taxes ― a welcome addition that has helped him pay rent on his one-bedroom apartment downtown and avoid bank overdraft fees. He said that legislators in the state Capitol don’t understand what it’s like for someone trying to survive on the minimum wage in the city.“It borders on disgraceful,” Shaw, 36, said of the preemption law. “This isn’t just not getting a raise ― it’s a pay cut. It will result in bills not being paid.” Shaw’s union, the United Food and Commercial Workers, estimates that 500 of its members in the city could see their pay downgraded in August, according to a spokesman. Republicans who have pursued preemption laws have often argued that they want to avoid a patchwork of minimum wages around the state, which they claim could be confusing for employers. But Rep. Jason Chipman, a Republican who represents a rural district southwest of St. Louis, said he sponsored the measure in the Missouri House of Representatives because he didn’t think the government should dictate minimum wages to employers. “The government is not here to run people’s businesses,” Chipman said in an interview, arguing that higher minimum wages kill jobs. “If an employee doesn’t like what’s being offered, they can go somewhere else. Be more productive. Be worth more.”“These are supposed to be entry-level jobs,” he added. “We understand there are people who rely on these jobs who are not entry-level-type people, but you can’t legislate by the exception.”One of the prime grievances lobbed against preemption laws is that they undermine local governance. It’s an odd look for Republican legislators who often rail against meddling in parochial affairs by Washington. Asked why St. Louis or Kansas City shouldn’t be able to determine its own policies ― even if those policies are folly ― Chipman said the cities are economic drivers that impact the whole state. “When you lose economic output, you lose revenue to the state,” he said. “It doesn’t happen in a vacuum.”Many of the preemption battles are tinged with a racial component, as mostly white legislatures override the laws of heavily minority cities. (St. Louis has a black plurality, and the minimum wage raise would disproportionately affect minorities.) In Alabama, the overwhelmingly African-American city of Birmingham also raised its minimum wage to $10.10, only to have the majority-white legislature block it with a preemption law. The Alabama chapter of the NAACP filed a civil rights lawsuit, which was thrown out by a judge but is now on appeal.The Missouri law presents an unusual case because so many workers in St. Louis have already received raises. Chipman said he had hoped to avoid such a situation, blaming the state Senate for not moving quickly enough to pass the preemption law before the St. Louis ordinance went into effect. Greitens, too, chided the state Senate for not fast-tracking a bill, providing that as the reason he would not put his signature on it. Missouri Democrats have called Greitens’ passive approval of the law craven.Nick Desideri, a spokesman for the Service Employees International Union Local 1, said he still holds out hope that Greitens will veto the preemption measure, given the optics in St. Louis. “The level of cruelty in this thing just boggles my mind,” said Desideri, whose union has been the primary backer of the “Fight for $15.” The St. Louis employers who doled out raises due to the short-lived minimum wage hike will soon have to decide whether or not to revoke them. Of course, workers don’t appreciate seeing their pay go backwards. A spokesman for Shaw’s employer, Schnucks, which has eight stores in St. Louis, said the company plans to revert to the pay rates laid out in the union contract. That means Shaw’s pay would drop back to $8.30. Shaw said that he considers Schnucks a good employer, but he wouldn’t expect them to honor the higher rates once legislators give them an out.“Businesses are not in business for moral obligations,” Shaw said. “I would hope they keep [the raises] in place, but I could imagine them taking them away. And I wouldn’t blame them should that happen. There are others I could blame.”"

(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596213451500002000bfcb2e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - A few dozen Ku Klux Klan members and supporters shouted “white power” at a rally on Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia where they protested against a city council decision to remove a statute honoring Confederate General Robert E. Lee.The group was guarded by scores of police and outnumbered by hundreds of counter-protesters who waved signs denouncing racism. Anti-KKK protesters raised their voices in chants and shouts, drowning out speeches from the white supremacists, live video feeds on social media showed.There were no initial reports of violence at the rally that lasted less than an hour. The Klan group that brandished Confederate flags and signs with anti-Semitic messages was separated from crowds by a ring of fencing and a heavy police presence.Later police fired tear gas cannisters when some protesters refused orders to disperse. Twenty-three people were arrested, but officials could not confirm their affiliations.In February, the Charlottesville City Council voted 3-2 to remove the statue from the park once named for Lee and make plans for a new memorial to remember the southern city’s enslaved population, The Daily Progress, the local newspaper reported.At least one person who participated in the Klan rally against the statute removal could be seen with a holstered pistol.Confederacy statues and flags have been removed from public spaces across the United States since 2015, after a white supremacist murdered nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church.Critics of the monuments say they foster racism by celebrating leaders of the Confederacy in the pro-slavery South during the U.S. Civil War. Supporters say they represent an indelible part of U.S. history and part of regional heritage.The bronze figures of Lee and his horse, Traveller, atop an oval-shaped granite pedestal has been in the park for nearly a century, the city of Charlottesville said.Torch-wielding white nationalists rallied in the college town that is home to the University of Virginia’s flagship campus in May to protest the move. A legal battle is going on over the statue’s removal and no date has been set.(Reporting by Jon Herskovitz and Chris Michaud; Editing by Alistair Bell and Himani Sarkar)"
