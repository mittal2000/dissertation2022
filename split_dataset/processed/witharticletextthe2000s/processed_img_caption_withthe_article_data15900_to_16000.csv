0,POLITICS,DCCC Advised Candidates To ‘Be Careful’ With Initial Comments On Parkland Shooting,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dccc-be-careful-parkland-shooting_us_5a9711eae4b09c872bb0da23,"A staffer said they should avoid politicizing the tragedy, but thoughts and prayers were fine.",2018-02-28,"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, led by Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), urged social media caution right after the Florida high school massacre.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9713c12000007d06eb0466.jpeg?cache=H1KSbxhWiL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee not only warned its candidates to avoid talking about gun control policy immediately after the Las Vegas shooting in October, but also sent a similar message after the recent massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.The afternoon of the Parkland, Florida, shooting on Feb. 14, a member of the DCCC press staff counseled House campaigns to avoid saying anything that could be construed as “politicizing” the tragedy.“I think it’s ok to express your thoughts/prayers on social media,” DCCC regional press secretary Evan Lukaske wrote to candidates and their staff in the Northeast region. “But please be careful about what you post on social media and I would not blast any statements right now. There will be a time for politics, but we are still understanding what happened here and gathering the facts.”As HuffPost reported Tuesday, Lukaske sent an email the day after the Oct. 1, 2017, Las Vegas shooting in which he was more explicit in his guidance for candidates to avoid doing anything but offer thoughts and prayers.“You and your candidate will be understandably outraged and upset, as will your community. However, DO NOT POLITICIZE IT TODAY,” he wrote. “There will be time for politics and policy discussion, but any message today should be on offering thoughts/prayers for victims and their families, and thanking 1st responders who saved lives.”The DCCC, which helps elect Democrats to the House, emphasized that these messages were recommendations, not mandatory instructions.It shared with HuffPost an email chain in which a progressive House candidate wrote to Lukaske after the Parkland shooting to express the candidate’s strong disagreement with his advice.“While it may not be time for personal attacks on opponents, if we don’t promote gun control when people are emotional, it will never happen,” the candidate wrote. Lukaske replied that his message was “just a suggestion.” “You of course have to do what you feel is right and I wouldn’t presume to tell you otherwise,” he wrote.There’s growing frustration among rank-and-file voters and activists that politicians offer seemingly heartfelt sympathies after these tragedies, but repeatedly fail to take any real action to address gun violence. The disconnect has been especially stark in the wake of the Parkland shooting. Students who survived the massacre have sparked a national movement with their immediate willingness to confront elected officials and the National Rifle Association about the need for gun policy reform.The morning after the shooting, several Parkland survivors specifically slammed politicians for sending them “thoughts and prayers.”The DCCC emphasized to HuffPost that its advice was directed at the immediate aftermath of a shooting, noting that Lukaske sent his email mere hours after the tragedy at Stoneman Douglas High. Two days later, Lukaske was back on the attack, blasting Steve Lonegan, a New Jersey Republican candidate, for his response to the shooting. In a press release, he denounced as “sick” Lonegan’s claims that a “return to prayer” in schools would mitigate the risk of shootings. “When senseless tragedies happen, we urge our candidates to be thoughtful and ensure they have all the facts,” DCCC communications director Meredith Kelly said. “This guidance was sent about two hours after the first shot was reported in Parkland, and ultimately amounted to a recommendation that candidates avoid making partisan political attacks about a deadly tragedy ‘right now’ while we were ‘still understanding what happened.’”Kelly added, “This was short term guidance, and many Democratic candidates have taken powerful, political stands and policy positions on gun violence prevention in the days since.”She also defended Lukaske’s decision: “A communications staffer who fails to provide immediate and thoughtful guidance after a national tragedy, based on the best available information at the time, is not doing his job.” The DCCC’s advice to candidates on guns is one in a series of revelations about the House campaign arm’s electoral strategy that progressive activists believe reflects an unduly narrow view of who can be elected. A particular source of controversy is the DCCC’s involvement in primaries, which took a nasty turn last week when it published opposition research about Laura Moser, a progressive candidate in Texas’ 7th District."

The surgeries, which included the removal or construction of genitalia or breasts, overall made up just 11 percent of the more than 37,000 related medical encounters reported by hospitals to an inpatient care database.The study’s findings are touted by the medical center as offering a first-of-its-kind look into trends in gender-confirming surgery services for people with gender dysphoria, which is when a person feels discomfort or distress due to the gender they were assigned at birth not corresponding with the person’s true gender.Brandyn D. Lau, who serves as director of quality and research for the new Johns Hopkins Center for Transgender Health in Baltimore, stressed the importance of such reviews to improve health care coverage.“Without data specific to transgender patients, we can’t tell what we’re doing right and what we need to improve, and this study was an attempt to address that problem with the best data we have available now,” he said in a release.Regarding methods of payment, the study also found that there was a rise and fall in the number of people who paid for procedures out of pocket, opposed to the care being covered by Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance.In the earlier years studied, roughly half of the patients who underwent gender-affirming surgery from 2000 to 2005 paid for it out of pocket. That rose to about 65 percent from 2006 to 2011 but then decreased from 2012 to 2014. In the last year studied, only 39 percent of patients paid out of pocket.The drop in 2014′s out-of-pocket expenses is likely no coincidence with it coming the same year that a provision of the Affordable Care Act that prohibits insurers from discriminating against patients based on their gender went into effect. Though not all insurance claims for gender dysphoria may be covered, the Affordable Care Act’s anti-discrimination provisions guarantee individuals’ rights to make civil rights claims against those who deny them coverage or necessary care because they are transgender.The study also found that about 57 percent of the patients were white, and they had a median age of 38. It also didn’t find any deaths attributed to the surgeries over the 14-year period, suggesting that the procedures are safer than some have suggested in the past.“When exploring national databases, you always have to be careful about the reliability of outcomes linked to procedures,” Lau said. “Mortality is usually a pretty reliable outcome, and we were excited to see that there were no instances of mortality associated with inpatient gender-affirming surgery.”"

The marketing entrepreneur was a key player in Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, when he worked as a digital director. Political experts often point to Parscale as an essential element in the Trump campaign’s success in 2016, specifically referring to the digital expert’s use of Facebook ads.Parscale’s relationship with Trump began when he started designing websites for the Trump family’s various companies. Eventually, during the 2016 campaign, Pascale became one of the few people with the privilege of tweeting on Trump’s behalf from the president’s own Twitter account, Bloomberg reported in 2016.The AP’s report, published Tuesday, found that Parscale sold his web development company, Giles-Parscale, in August for $9 million to CloudCommerce Inc., which is listed as a penny stock (traded apart from the major exchanges and at a very low price) and hasn’t been profitable “in nearly a decade.” After the acquisition, Parscale was appointed to CloudCommerce’s board of directors.Read the full Associated Press investigation here.According to a recent quarterly earnings report obtained by the AP, the company has $107,000 in funds, but has spent more than $19 million in investor money since 1999.The company has repeatedly changed its corporate name and lines of business, according to the AP.In 2006, a chief executive for CloudCommerce’s predecessor was caught attempting to bribe undercover FBI agents posing as hedge fund managers who wanted to buy stocks of Roaming Messenger, a former name of the company, without telling their clients, the AP reported.The executive, Jonathan Lei, entered a plea agreement on one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, according to the AP. While Lei was sentenced to five years of probation and was barred from being involved with publicly traded companies, he reportedly maintained his ownership stake in the company for years.In Trump’s 2020 campaign announcement, Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser, said that Parscale “was essential in bringing a disciplined technology and data-driven approach to how the 2016 campaign was run.”"

Over those two shifts she had to meet a quota of five political posts, 10 nonpolitical posts and 150 to 200 comments on other workers’ posts. And here’s how Adrianne Jeffries described Mic for The Outline:Furthermore, Mic’s fixation on traffic bothered reporters, who were sick of being forced into reductive headlines and catering to an echo chamber while being told they were changing the world. “It’s like they know the right things to tell their staff, but at a certain point it starts to feel like gaslighting in the office,” said the former staffer who covered social justice issues. “I didn’t just want to know what my path forward was, I didn’t just want a raise. I wanted someone to stop bullshitting me. To tell me I was selling out and I was just writing for clicks, that would be one thing. But there was this ethos of, ‘you are doing important work. You are making a difference,’ when I wasn’t.”The differences between the two operations scarcely need elaboration. Mic’s goals were the goals of any modern media startup: to attract venture capital and advertising dollars. Meanwhile, as Facebook’s vice president of advertising, Rob Goldman, explained on Twitter this month in the course of defending his own company: “The main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions, like free speech and social media, against us. It has stoked fear and hatred amongst Americans. It is working incredibly well. We are quite divided as a nation.”The United States is quite divided.

This isn’t anything new. “If it bleeds, it leads” was the phrase coined by journalist Eric Pooley in 1989 on the subject of TV news. What’s new is that online media’s distribution channels are limited to those provided by massive companies such as Facebook and Google, which have eaten up almost all new advertising dollars and reached economies of scale that make them unavoidable for media, politics and international ratfucking operations alike.Algorithms are the new assignment editors, and media companies rise and fall and remake themselves altogether because of tweaks to seemingly insignificant protocols.

This often included pointlessly divisive outrages of the day.“We simply had to mimic the rest of the Internet ― write about the same outrage as everyone else, jump on the same topic of the moment,” Foer writes. The design of the platforms encouraged media companies to share the same outrage material.Remember the #BoycottStarbucks hashtag? Conservatives made that go viral after the coffee company announced a plan to hire refugees in response to Trump’s Muslim ban executive order in January 2017. Many news sites all wrote up the same story, including many of the same tweets from the same outraged conservative accounts. It was a perfect story. Readers could agree with the outraged or be outraged by their outrage.Fox News included two tweets from @Pamela_Moore13 in a story about the controversy. “Hiring 10k refugees makes liberals feel warm BUT we have homeless vets that need those jobs. #BoycottStarbucks #ReasonsToProtest #MuslimBan,” @Pamela_Moore13 wrote.Her other tweet said: “I would rather take care of TEN homeless US Veterans, than 50,000 migrants/illegal aliens How About You? #BoycottStarbucks #ReasonsToProtest.” The Los Angeles Times, The Baltimore Sun, HuffPost Mexico and Vice all quoted the same tweets by @Pamela_Moore13. So did numerous conservative outrage sites. The official Starbucks Twitter account even responded to her suggestion to hire veterans instead of refugees, saying, “We’re committed to both ― we also set a goal to hire 10,000 veterans by 2018 and we’re very close to reaching it.”Months later, we found out that @Pamela_Moore13 was a Russian troll account created by the Internet Research Agency. The ratfuckers and internet media, together at last. Content was a political dirty trick, and the dirty trick was content. I believe that’s what they call synergy."

5,POLITICS,The Conservative Supreme Court Majority Was Built To Crush Unions,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/janus-supreme-court-unions_us_5a95d39ae4b09c872baea8c9,And that's just what it'll do.,2018-02-28,"Plaintiff Mark Janus in front of the U.S. Supreme Court after a hearing on Feb. 26, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a95d5511f00002c00168a48.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The conservative majority on the Supreme Court looks poised to deliver a historic blow to labor unions after hearing oral arguments in the Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees case on Monday.An expected 5-4 decision ― with Justice Anthony Kennedy expected to join the court’s more conservative members ― would prevent public sector employee unions across the country from mandating agency fees from members and would be a crowning achievement for a conservative movement founded on opposition to labor.The only reason this case is before the court now is because Donald Trump, an anti-labor billionaire, won the 2016 presidential election and appointed conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch to replace the deceased Antonin Scalia. The seat was only available because Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to hold even a hearing on Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee to fill the open seat.Holding a five-vote majority is the most important priority for the conservative movement, and not just because of evangelicals and Catholics’ desire to repeal Roe v. Wade. The business wing of the conservative movement that dominates the Republican Party has its priorities, too, and crushing labor’s power is item No. 1.“It’s a culmination of this long struggle that goes way back,” Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, told HuffPost. He said the Supreme Court oral arguments were “kind of like one of the last skirmishes in what remains in the New Deal order.”After being roundly driven from power in the Great Depression, the conservative corporate class reorganized for the long haul in opposition to nearly every policy adopted as part of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, from price and wage controls to Social Security to the Tennessee Valley Authority to the Wagner Act, which fully legalized labor unions and established federal oversight of labor-business relations.The opposition to labor unionism, McCartin said, is based on “a fundamental discomfort with the New Deal itself.”Among all of these New Deal successes, workers’ empowerment was the most infuriating for wealthy conservatives. Labor unions were their biggest target because they represented organized opposition with significant monetary resources that supported social democratic policies and backed the political opposition to conservative business interests. As Walter Reuther, head of the United Auto Workers, once said, “The labor movement is developing a whole new middle class.”The conservative movement saw unions as a force that would promote increased government spending and further workers’ empowerment in relation to management.When pro-business Republicans briefly won control of Congress after World War II, they passed the Taft-Hartley Act to rein in labor union power over President Harry Truman’s veto. The bill banned direct labor union contributions to political parties and candidates, banned closed shops and allowed states to pass so-called “right-to-work” laws.Right-to-work laws ban unions from mandating the collection of agency fees, which cover the cost of collective bargaining and dispute resolutions. Without a mandate to pay these fees, employees can, and do, choose not to pay them while still receiving the benefits of union protection. Under these rules, unions are almost always short on cash and at a significant disadvantage to protect workers in contract negotiations and disputes.Barry Goldwater, often referred to as the ideological godfather of the modern Republican Party, got into politics in 1946 as a member of the business elite in Arizona to push for a right-to-work law. He would go on to begin the conservative movement’s takeover of the Republican Party by securing the party’s 1964 presidential nomination.After Taft-Hartley’s passage, right-to-work legislation swept through western states and the South, where the idea of labor unions exacerbated segregationist fears of black and white workers working and organizing together. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the main focus of the anti-union movement was the passage of right-to-work laws.At the same time, the movement’s wealthy corporate funders built up their intellectual infrastructure. They promoted the free market ideas of Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek and Ayn Rand and pushed anti-labor messages that labeled unions as everything from proto-communist operations to autocratic monopolists.During the 1950s, General Electric emerged as the major corporate force fighting labor unions and boosting the conservative business movement. The company hired Lemuel Boulware as vice president to oversee labor relations and lead the fight against labor. In 1945, Boulware explained in a memo, “Management is in a sales campaign to determine if business and the country will be run right.”Boulware told the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce that crushing labor was the business community’s “biggest job.” And management needed to defeat unions through marketing to workers and politics, not through brute force of arms, as it had done prior to the New Deal.Boulware hired actor Ronald Reagan, the former New Deal liberal turned free market true believer, to proselytize the pro-business agenda to GE workers. This was a successful move in both changing workers’ minds on unionizing and cultivating the future of free-market politicians. Reagan’s 1980 presidential victory was the crowning achievement of the conservative movement at the time and marked the beginning of the end of New Deal politics.The conservative movement’s particular focus on public sector unions did not emerge until the early 1970s. This is largely because Wisconsin’s first-in-the-nation adoption of public sector collective bargaining in 1959 spread across the country, especially after President John F. Kennedy issued an executive order in 1962 providing limited collective bargaining rights to federal workers.McCartin points to the work of the anti-union activist Sylvester Petro, whom McCartin wrote about in The American Prospect, as pivotal in raising the issue of public sector unions for the conservative movement. Petro was inspired by the writings of Hayek and von Mises and was a member of their Mont Pelerin Society, which had been funded by the same forces that emerged from the post-New Deal conservative movement. In 1957, Petro wrote his first call for the full repeal of the Wagner Act and the end to all collective bargaining.“It’s right to see the emergence of the opposition to the public sector movement as one that was born at first being opposed to the New Deal itself,” McCartin said. “Being opposed to the very idea of collective bargaining.”By 1973, Petro was arguing that collective bargaining for public sector workers had destroyed government by putting labor unions on the same level as elected and appointed government officials in making decisions about funding and policy. He argued before the Supreme Court in 1977 in the Abood v. Detroit Board of Education case that public sector employees should not be mandated to pay agency fees.The court did not agree with him then, but looks poised to overturn that 41 year old decision now. That’s thanks in large part to the corporate elite and managers behind the anti-union conservative movement who, over the ensuing years, built and funded a conservative infrastructure to make the dreams of that small number of post-New Deal free marketeers come true. This included the creation of the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the State Policy Network and the Federalist Society. The latter counts four Supreme Court justices ― Gorsuch, Chief Justice John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas ― as members.The ideological descendants of this movement, including the libertarian billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into a mix of old and new free-market political organizations after Obama’s 2008 victory. They helped flip state governorships and legislatures across the country to Republicans who supported their long-held desire to crush labor unions.A wave of attacks on labor unions ensued, with six states adopting right-to-work laws over the next few years. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) and a newly elected Republican-controlled legislature immediately repealed the state’s historic public sector collective bargaining law in 2011. In 2015, Wisconsin would pass a right-to-work law. Michigan and West Virginia, both states important in the history of the American labor movement, also adopted right-to-work legislation. This was the most rapid adoption of right-to-work laws since the 1940s and 1950s.Gutting labor union power was never just about establishing management power in the workplace, but also about gutting labor unions’ political power. Union members have long been able to opt out of making political contributions to union political action committees. But, as anti-labor activists pointed out back in the 1940s, unions also derive power from their ability to fund efforts to advocate for policies on behalf of their workers and keep workers connected to politics in their communities.This translates to the ballot box, particularly in presidential elections where only the Democratic Party is staunchly pro-union. A recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the share of the vote for Democratic Party presidential candidates dropped by 3.5 percentage points in states that passed right-to-work laws. Voters also turned out at a lower rate in right-to-work states, which also hurt candidates, largely Democrats, who support labor unions.This all led to Monday’s court case, and a decision that could gut public employee unions. The conservative justices who spoke during Monday’s oral arguments, and who did not include Gorsuch or Thomas, were openly hostile to the idea of mandatory union agency fees for public employee unions.Kennedy asked the representative of the state of Illinois arguing in favor of mandatory agency fees whether public employee unions will work with state governments to advocate for “a greater size workforce, against privatization, against merit promotion, against ― for teacher tenure, for higher wages, for massive government, for increasing bonded indebtedness, for increasing taxes.”The big difference between Kennedy’s argument and the arguments his intellectual ancestors made back in the 1940s is that his will win. The conservative movement will have scored a huge victory in its fight to smash labor’s power. While voters may not have realized it at the time, this is exactly what was on the line when Trump won on Nov. 8, 2016."
6,POLITICS,The Conservative Supreme Court Majority Was Built To Crush Unions,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/janus-supreme-court-unions_us_5a95d39ae4b09c872baea8c9,And that's just what it'll do.,2018-02-28,"Supporters cheer on Mark Janus, the plaintiff in a case that could lead to the gutting of public sector labor unions, after he spoke to them outside the Supreme Court on Feb. 26, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a95d3fd1e0000fb077acfde.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The conservative majority on the Supreme Court looks poised to deliver a historic blow to labor unions after hearing oral arguments in the Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees case on Monday.An expected 5-4 decision ― with Justice Anthony Kennedy expected to join the court’s more conservative members ― would prevent public sector employee unions across the country from mandating agency fees from members and would be a crowning achievement for a conservative movement founded on opposition to labor.The only reason this case is before the court now is because Donald Trump, an anti-labor billionaire, won the 2016 presidential election and appointed conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch to replace the deceased Antonin Scalia. The seat was only available because Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to hold even a hearing on Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee to fill the open seat.Holding a five-vote majority is the most important priority for the conservative movement, and not just because of evangelicals and Catholics’ desire to repeal Roe v. Wade. The business wing of the conservative movement that dominates the Republican Party has its priorities, too, and crushing labor’s power is item No. 1.“It’s a culmination of this long struggle that goes way back,” Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, told HuffPost. He said the Supreme Court oral arguments were “kind of like one of the last skirmishes in what remains in the New Deal order.”After being roundly driven from power in the Great Depression, the conservative corporate class reorganized for the long haul in opposition to nearly every policy adopted as part of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, from price and wage controls to Social Security to the Tennessee Valley Authority to the Wagner Act, which fully legalized labor unions and established federal oversight of labor-business relations.The opposition to labor unionism, McCartin said, is based on “a fundamental discomfort with the New Deal itself.”Among all of these New Deal successes, workers’ empowerment was the most infuriating for wealthy conservatives. Labor unions were their biggest target because they represented organized opposition with significant monetary resources that supported social democratic policies and backed the political opposition to conservative business interests. As Walter Reuther, head of the United Auto Workers, once said, “The labor movement is developing a whole new middle class.”The conservative movement saw unions as a force that would promote increased government spending and further workers’ empowerment in relation to management.When pro-business Republicans briefly won control of Congress after World War II, they passed the Taft-Hartley Act to rein in labor union power over President Harry Truman’s veto. The bill banned direct labor union contributions to political parties and candidates, banned closed shops and allowed states to pass so-called “right-to-work” laws.Right-to-work laws ban unions from mandating the collection of agency fees, which cover the cost of collective bargaining and dispute resolutions. Without a mandate to pay these fees, employees can, and do, choose not to pay them while still receiving the benefits of union protection. Under these rules, unions are almost always short on cash and at a significant disadvantage to protect workers in contract negotiations and disputes.Barry Goldwater, often referred to as the ideological godfather of the modern Republican Party, got into politics in 1946 as a member of the business elite in Arizona to push for a right-to-work law.

Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) on Twitter on Monday: “Most prevalent theme so far in Congress: ‘We have to do this bad idea so that we don’t end up with a worse idea.’”When HuffPost asked Davidson about that tweet on Tuesday, he said it wasn’t unique to guns or just this week in Congress, but he granted that many Republicans were making that argument in support of the current Fix NICS bill. That legislation, co-sponsored by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), would reinforce existing background check laws to provide the FBI with more information about the criminal histories of those seeking a gun. (Agencies often fail to report criminal records to NICS, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.)The extremely modest proposal has already passed the House. But to get the bill out of the lower chamber, GOP leaders made a deal with more-conservative members to couple it with another measure allowing citizens with a concealed carry permit in one state to use that permit in another state ― even if the concealed carry law is different in the second state.Both provisions appear to be non-starters with Senate Democrats, and Senate Republicans appear open to stripping the concealed carry portion and passing a clean Fix NICS bill. But Democrats also feel that a bill that simply reinforces laws already on the books would do little to address the problem of gun violence and would just give Republicans political cover. They want other changes, like universal background checks, which would be more difficult to pass in either chamber of Congress despite overwhelming public support.Whichever route the Senate takes ― passing a limited Fix NICS bill, something larger or nothing at all ― there are real questions about what the House would do next. Conservative members say GOP leaders promised that the House would not vote on a background check bill without the concealed carry provisions. And Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Tuesday that a decision by the Senate to send back the Fix NICS bill without the concealed carry part shouldn’t change the commitments that Republican leaders made.“Why should that change their promise?” Jordan asked.But Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) sounded less than resolute when asked about his commitment on Tuesday.“We obviously think the Senate should take our whole bill,” Ryan told reporters, “but if the Senate cannot do that, then we’ll discuss and cross that bridge when we get to it.”While that sort of noncommittal statement will certainly alarm conservatives, it will also alarm Democrats and those Republicans who are actually trying to pass a bill.Senate leaders appear close to some sort of agreement that would allow their members to vote on some amendments, though perhaps not all. At that point, it would be up to senators to decide what the gun package coming out of the Senate looks like ― and then it would depend on Speaker Ryan giving that legislation a vote in the House.Republicans who are supportive of more gun restrictions say they expect any bill that makes it to President Donald Trump’s desk would have needed the backing of a significant number of Democrats. And the mood in the Capitol ― the one where Republicans fear inaction could ultimately lead to even tighter laws ― could bring along enough Republicans as well to give Ryan cover to bring up a revised bill in the House.Already Republicans are providing quotes that would have once been unthinkable.When Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) was asked about the political implications of gun control, he said that he thought it would hurt Republicans nationally, but that the issue was different for each individual member.“Again, I come from a part of the country where, again, the only ones with guns are cops and bad guys,” King said."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) even filed it on Wednesday morning. The Defense Department’s acting general counsel sent Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) a letter criticizing the resolution on Tuesday. That letter was sent to all Senate offices Wednesday morning, hours before a high-profile news conference at which Sanders and Lee argued that current American efforts in Yemen ― providing aerial refueling and intelligence to a Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed rebels ― are unconstitutional because Congress has never explicitly approved them.William S. Castle of the Pentagon disagrees. His letter maintains that the U.S. support does not count as “hostilities” because American forces are not having exchanges of fire with the rebels, known as the Houthis, or commanding the coalition. It also suggests that the resolution threatens American authority to combat the local branch of the Islamic State ― and even holds that Congress cannot end the policy because it is the president’s prerogative, adopting an expansive view of presidential control over war-making that some experts likened to controversial George W. Bush-era arguments once HuffPost published the letter.At stake is a debate ― the likes of which hasn’t been seen in the Senate for decades ― over how America wages war.The resolution from Sanders, Lee and Murphy is guaranteed a vote on the Senate floor because of authorities outlined in arms control legislation, staffers say; the U.S. is a major supplier of weapons to Saudi Arabia and its chief partner in the war, the United Arab Emirates.While all three senators have been top critics of the deadly effects of the U.S. support for the Saudi-UAE coalition, including food shortages for close to 20 million people and the deaths of thousands of civilians, they want the ensuing debate to focus on the constitutional question of whether the president should have been allowed to initiate such a policy rather than the wisdom of the strategy itself, staffers told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday.“We believe that, as Congress has not declared war or authorized military force in this conflict, the United States’ involvement in Yemen is unconstitutional and unauthorized, and U.S. military support of the Saudi coalition must end,” Sanders said Wednesday. Lee said the resolution will allow Congress to reassert its authority over foreign policy by voting on whether to withdraw American forces currently aiding the coalition. (The bill specifically excludes U.S. forces fighting Yemen’s al Qaeda branch.)Their resolution invokes the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which states that the U.S. is involved in a conflict if it is helping to command or even just “participate in the movement of” another country’s forces as they fight. While the Pentagon letter says that resolution does not apply because U.S. forces are not engaged in such activities against the Houthis, it also notes that American planes currently provide refueling to the Saudi and UAE planes that go on to bomb Houthi-controlled areas.This week is just the start of the battle over the resolution. A House version prompted complicated weeks-long negotiations last year, failing to produce a vote but forcing the House to officially acknowledge that the policy was not covered by authorizations for the use of military force passed after 9/11.Saudi Arabia has already begun expanded outreach to lawmakers because of the wave of criticism it has received over Yemen, sending them weekly updates on its humanitarian work for the victims of the conflict that experts and aid groups say it is deliberately worsening. One set arrived in Capitol Hill inboxes around the same time as the Pentagon letter.And it’s already clear the Trump administration, which has developed a close relationship with Riyadh, will be working against the proposal, too. The senators involved have been in touch with the executive branch, staffers said Tuesday; they did not comment on how those conversations went.If all goes according to plan, the resolution will move out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by early March and can then be called up at any time for a debate and a vote. That means there’s a chance it could even come up on or around March 19, when the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Muhammed bin Salman, arrives in Washington for meetings at the start of a U.S. tour that could last close to two weeks. Its supporters are already rallying their allies for a fight they say could be monumental. Actor and activist Mark Ruffalo tweeted in support of the resolution on Wednesday, and national security experts are already praising it. “There is a reason why the Founders gave the power to declare war to the Congress, the body closest to the people, to decide when and where our military will fight,” said retired Gen. Paul Eaton of the Vet Voice Foundation in a statement shared with HuffPost. “We can no longer turn a blind eye to our worldwide interventions without clear authorization.... If the President or members of Congress believe that support for the Yemen War is in the U.S. interests, they should argue for it. They had best be articulate because many of our citizens see no plausible explanation for why backing the Saudis is helpful in a region saturated by violence.” Read the Pentagon’s letter criticizing the resolution below: "

The motion says Trump is unworthy of the honor “based on a long history of numerous documented statements that are antithetical to our core values and beneath the standard for Lehigh’s honorary degrees holders.” A preamble to the motion declared that “statements made by President Trump do not meet Lehigh’s standards for respectful discourse where differences of opinion exist.”“If a member of Lehigh’s on-campus community made one of these statements, he/she would be subject to disciplinary action; taken in their entirety, he/she would be at risk of dismissal,” the motion said.“By staying silent we are bystanders; we normalize hate speech, condone discrimination and bullying; we enable people in positions of power to corrode the foundations of civil society; and we abdicate our commitment and responsibility to uphold and sustain our core values,” it added.The Lehigh faculty motion cited as a precedent the university’s revocation of Bill Cosby’s honorary degree in 2015 for “behavior inconsistent with the character and high standards expected of honorees.” Cosby faces dozens of sexual assault allegations.“The faculty spoke, and I think spoke rather strongly, in terms of the number of faculty participating and the overwhelming support of the motion as written,” Doug Mahoney, the chair of the faculty’s steering committee, told the student newspaper The Brown And White.The university’s student government body also moved to support the motion.The final decision on whether Trump’s degree will be revoked will come from the board of trustees, which in October 2017 voted to take “no action” on a Change.org petition that called on it to take back the honor.The petition, which garnered more than 31,000 signatures, said Trump’s “rejection of diversity and his lack of respect for the differences of others around him stands in direct opposition to the principles” of the school.“He does not reflect Lehigh University’s values,” it added. “Therefore, he does not deserve to bear the distinction of an honorary degree from Lehigh.”In 2015, Scotland’s Robert Gordon University revoked the honorary doctorate of business administration it gave to Trump in 2010."

The British actress is featured in one of the romantic comedy’s few not-so-happy endings when her character, Karen, discovers that her husband, played by the late Alan Rickman, is having an affair with his assistant.In one of the film’s most gut-wrenching scenes, Karen realizes he gave the other woman a necklace she thought was intended for her. “That scene where my character is standing by the bed crying is so well known because it’s something everyone’s been through,” Thompson said at a fundraiser in London on Sunday, according to The Telegraph. The “Sense and Sensibility” star struggled with infidelity in her own marriage to actor and director Kenneth Branagh. The pair fell in love on the set of the 1987 BBC drama “Fortunes of War” and married two years later. They became a beloved acting-directing duo in the early ’90s, starring in films like “Peter’s Friends” and “Much Ado About Nothing” together.However, their rom-com took its own dramatic turn when they publicly separated in 1995, blaming their busy work schedules. Later, rumors surfaced that Branagh had begun an affair with actress Helena Bonham Carter the year before, while filming and co-starring in “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.”“I had my heart very badly broken by Ken. So I knew what it was like to find the necklace that wasn’t meant for me,” Thompson said Sunday. “Well, it wasn’t exactly that, but we’ve all been through it.”Thompson essentially confirmed that the affair was more than just speculation when she revealed that any bad blood about the breakup was “under the bridge” in a 2013 interview. “I’ve had so much bloody practice at crying in a bedroom, then having to go out and be cheerful, gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer,” she told The Telegraph.“You can’t hold on to anything like that. It’s pointless,” she added. “I haven’t got the energy for it. Helena and I made our peace years and years ago.”The Oscar winner went onto marry actor and producer Greg Wise in 2003 and they now have two children together. That same year, Branagh tied the knot with his current wife, Lindsay Brunnock."

Wood appeared before the House Judiciary Committee as part of an effort to encourage states to implement the federal Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights Act in all 50 states. Currently, the bill provides survivors with basic rights in federal cases, but has only been adopted by nine of the 50 states. “I’m here today to use my position as an artist, survivor, mother and advocate to bring a human voice to the population of 25 million survivors in the U.S. who are currently experiencing inequality under the law and who desperately need basic civil rights,” Wood said. The actress testified along with the CEO and founder of anti-sexual violence organization RISE, Amanda Nguyen, RISE chief of staff Lauren Libby and the vice president of the Rape Abuse Incest National Network (RAINN), Rebecca O’Connor. “I struggle to speak to you today because I’m not sure what words are appropriate when discussing this issue,” Wood told the committee. “However, if you can’t hear the whole truth you will never know true empathy, and I believe in the saying ‘If we have to live through it then you should have to hear it.’” Wood described how she was in a violently abusive relationship with a former partner who physically, verbally and sexually abused her repeatedly. She discussed how her former partner raped her while he believed she was unconscious. Sometime after, Wood said, she was raped by a different man in a storage closet at a bar.Wood termed the federal law a “recognition of basic civil rights for sexual-assault survivors and serves as a first step.”“It’s a safety net that may help save someone’s life one day,” she said.During the hearing, committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) explained how the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights Act works on a federal level:This legislation assured that in federal cases, a victim would have the right to have their rape kit preserved for the duration of the statute of limitations or up to 20 years; a victim would not have to pay for their own forensic examination; a victim would be informed of any results of their forensic examination; would be provided with written policies on forensic testing kits; and finally, would be informed before their sexual assault examination kit was destroyed and be permitted to request further preservation.While these rights are afforded to survivors of federal crimes, Goodlatte noted that said they are “not consistently recognized” by all of the states. “And of course, it is in the states where most sexual assault cases are prosecuted,” he said. While Wood said that while the Me Too movement spotlighting the problem of sexual abuse has been “empowering and validating for survivors,” it also has triggered disturbing memories for her. Many survivors have echoed her feelings over the past months. “While no one had to tell me that rape was such a worldwide epidemic, to see the flood of stories so similar to my own was both freeing and soul-crushing,” Wood said. “Waves of memories and details came flooding into my brain every time I read the words. I froze. I thought I was the only human who’d experienced this and I carried so much guilt and confusion about my response to the abuse.” She discussed the aftermath of rape, reminding the panel that it’s a “huge part of the conversation that needs much more attention.” She listed some of the lasting effects of the abuse she’s endured: feelings of shame and despair, depression, addiction, agoraphobia, two suicide attempts and post-traumatic stress disorder. “So often we speak of these assaults as no more than a few minutes of awfulness, but the scars last a lifetime,” she said. “Even though these experiences happened a decade ago, I still struggle with the aftermath. My relationships suffer, my partner suffers, my mental and physical health suffers. ... Rape is often more than a few minutes of trauma, but a slow death.” Wood concluded her statement on a powerful note, discussing her role in combating sexual violence as the mother of a young son.“This makes me think of my son and the world that he will be raised in and the day I will have to explain to him what rape means and why it happened to his mother,” she said. “When I knew I was to become a mother I prayed for a boy for this reason. However, I realized it could be just as easy for my son to fall prey to the lies society tells us about men. ... So I’m also here to advocate for men and for my son, who I hope grows up knowing he’s much more valuable than that and who I can only hope I will set an example for by continuing to fight for him and myself and for all the people affected by abuse, because that is our job as parents and as leaders.”Watch the full hearing below or fast forward to minute 18:30 to hear Wood’s statement.

20,ENTERTAINMENT,YouTuber Anna Akana Is Done Taking Roles That Don't Show Asians In A Positive Way,Kimberly Yam,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/youtuber-anna-akana-is-done-with-taking-roles-that-dont-represent-asians-in-positive-way_us_5a905199e4b03b55731be618,The Asian-American actress and producer bucks stereotypes as a strong lead in an upcoming series that’s being described as the “woke ‘Mean Girls.’”,2018-02-28,Anna Akana has more than 2 million subscribers on her YouTube channel.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a96f2b61f00005100168bfb.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Though they’re still fighting to be heard in the entertainment industry, Asian-Americans have found a refuge of sorts in YouTube. Members of the minority group, who’ve been largely brushed aside by mainstream media, have emerged as some of the strongest voices on the video-sharing site. As YouTube has steadily risen in popularity, Asians have dominated. Among those top online personalities is Anna Akana.Akana, whose channel now boasts more than 2 million subscribers, has used humor and wit to create a massive repertoire of funny skits and short films on topics ranging from cats (she has six!) to mental health. She does not shy away from her Asian-American identity online, often making videos that speak to the community — like this one on yellow fever, or this one about that moment of solidarity that occurs when Asian strangers in the U.S. spot each other. (It’s so real.) The actress will be starring in upcoming teen dramedy “Youth & Consequences,” premiering on March 7 on the paid streaming service YouTube Red. In the series, which is being described as a “woke ‘Mean Girls,’” Akana plays high school queen bee Farrah Cutney. The significance of an Asian-American lead who bucks the quiet, obedient Asian stereotype isn’t lost on Akana, who hopes to show viewers what Asian-American representation can look like. HuffPost sat down with Akana to chat about her new series, the Asian-American space on YouTube, as well as why fellow YouTuber Logan Paul’s trip to Japan was all-around horrifying. Oftentimes, Asian characters assume background roles or are just completely erased from the narrative. How does it feel to play a character who’s front and center? I’ve said this a lot but this definitely feels like my dream project. It’s the kind of show I loved watching ― I loved high school dramas and more importantly it has a female ensemble that’s diverse and reflects real life. [The characters] are incredibly empowered and complex and not just accessories in a man’s life. Especially being able to be the lead character of something like this, as an Asian woman who’s struggled to be seen past stereotypes, and to even have Piper Curda in it ― two strong Asian women vying for power, but it’s not women against women ― feels like absolutely everything I’ve been working for for the last decade. YouTube has been a place where many strong Asian-American personalities have launched their careers. But we’re still struggling in other platforms and on-screen. Why do you think YouTube has become such a haven for Asian-American personalities? I think, definitely, the reason why Asians are on YouTube is because we weren’t seeing representation anywhere else. It was finally a platform that catered to us having representation. At the beginning of YouTube, the biggest stars were Asian ... They were able to amass incredible followings. I was introduced to it by my brother and I watched because it was like, “Wow, that’s someone who looks like me and they’re funny and they’re great, and you never get to see Asians acting this way.”You have experience in both the web industry as well as Hollywood. Do you feel a stark difference between both industries in terms of how you’re treated as an Asian-American? It’s a little harder to say because the lines have blurred a lot. I think the difference to me feels like creative involvement. In traditional, if I’m hired as an actor, I don’t get a lot of creative say in what happens whereas on YouTube, if it’s great, I get all the glory, if it sucks, I get all the shame because I’m the driving force behind whatever I’m putting out. The most interesting part is now that I’ve had a following online, I’m able to leverage that and use that financial stability to turn down roles that I now feel are degrading and I don’t want to go out for. At the time, it felt really necessary to go out for certain things because I felt I needed credits and that was all that was available to me. Now I’m in a position where I don’t have to do that anymore. I can go for roles that represent me and my race in a positive way and I can make a positive change. Do you feel like there’s been a difference in the roles available to you as time has gone on from when you started on YouTube? Oh, 100 percent. I have so much more of an empowering say in my career now. My first job ever was in what was rated something like the worst movie of all time by Metacritic. I played an Asian driving student, and the whole scene was basically this guy called “The Amazing Racist” berating me and asking me if my pussy was slanted and how I could possibly see out of my tiny eyes. It felt awful that I was like, “Well, this is paying my rent and it’s my very first movie credit so cool.” And I feel like these days now I can absolutely look at that and be like, “No, 100 percent no.” My manager would never even bring something like that to me. It has completely impacted how powerful I feel about what I get to put out. Yeah, there’s sometimes a tendency for people to blame an actor of color to take a stereotypical role but especially for Asians, who have few roles available to them in the first place, it’s much more complicated than that. There’s a line that Farrah says that I think about all the time ― it’s “Get on top and then you can make change.” I think that is so true because you have to start from the bottom and then work your way into the system. The year started off with Logan Paul’s horribly offensive suicide video, which you spoke out about. Do you think that situation was handled properly? I think by de-monetizing his channel and taking him out of the partnership, [YouTube] made a strong statement about the type of content they were going to tolerate on the platform, which I commend them for. I put 100 percent of the blame on Logan Paul. I think we’ve gotten so desensitized to everything ... It’s a huge omen about what we expect for content to be. I loved the reaction to it, I loved how everyone was like, “This is not OK, and we’re not going to tolerate that.” But then the very next week he came out with a video with him tasing dead rats and taking a fish out of water.I’m really disappointed he didn’t take this opportunity to really learn and understand the power he has over young people, but that’s his task. So the most we can do is just speak out. Another aspect to that incident that was covered less in the media was the way in which Logan Paul treats Asians or portrays them in his videos. You see him doing offensive things, like treating people like Pokémon, along with the already offensive suicide video. What was your reaction to that? It was awful, especially because Japan is all about respect. They are an incredibly respectful nation. I lived there when I was a kid and was enrolled in public school and the sense of community is as strong as America’s sense of individuality. They place such an emphasis on conducting yourself as a respectable member of society who contributes accordingly.He made Americans seem like total fucking buffoons. It’s heartbreaking, because I did watch that video of him throwing Pokémon balls in the street and at elderly people and he prefaced it with recognizing that Japan is a place for respect. To not only be completely aware of the country you’re visiting and their values, but to completely ignore that and do stuff for the sake of your content was just gross and disrespectful. Would you say there’s a way to bring in viewers and put out viral content without having to resort to exploiting shock? Yes! I would hope so. Look at Liza Koshy. She’s a huge YouTube star and the whole premise of her videos is dancing and being silly and being funny, and people don’t have to resort to shock value or being insane in a public space to get a following. I’m very against that whole culture. Going back to your new series ― it’s being talked about as a “woke ‘Gossip Girl’” or “woke ‘Mean Girls.’” What kind of social issues do you go into? We touch on transgender issues ― there’s an episode dedicated to a character who we’re not sure if he’s trans or not and he’s trying to change in the girl’s locker room. There’s a big debate of, is this some guy who’s an asshole jock who’s trying to take advantage of the laws to watch women change? Or is there something going on here? We also tackle issues of social media and privacy. Some people get doxxed in the series in terms of their private sexual lives or infidelity. The thing that [creator Jason Ubaldi] did best with these scripts was he tackled social media in a way I hadn’t seen before and treated these teens as the sophisticated adults that they are ... Now teens have access to everything they want to know immediately and that’s such a frightening place to be. High school already felt like life and death to me. The stakes felt so high because the reference level in life is so short. For kids today, it’s crazy. They can’t get away from high school no matter where they are! When you’re in that writers’ room, creating, how do you bring in voices from other issues that you’re touching on? How are you able to make these issues feel authentic in representation? It was really important to us ― because none of us are trans ― to consult someone from the community and ask, “How are we representing this?” The hard part is ― and I think this is the same with a non-Asian writing an Asian story ― you want to believe that all experiences are universal to a degree and we’re all human and we can all relate to each other and we are compassionate with each other. But at the same time, everybody’s story is completely different. Everyone’s view on something is completely different, so even consulting a trans person we were like, “OK, we’re getting one opinion on this but there might be 10 or 20 other people who disagree with this person.” So we tried to make it the most empathetic, compassionate story possible of someone being outed against their will and someone going through a confusing time. Do you have any advice for any Asian-Americans trying to make it on YouTube? I would say, don’t give up. You would be surprised to see how lazy people in LA are. If you have tiger parents who’ve instilled a work ethic in you, you can make it here. We don’t see representation, so you don’t think it’s possible, but oh, my God ― the amount of friends I have here who just don’t do the work is astounding. I just try to tell people, “Come! Be ready prepared to work hard and for it to take a long-ass time.” But if you’re willing to take 12 years for medical school, fuck it. Come be an actor, come be a writer, come be a director. It’ll take the same amount of time and you’ll be doing something that you love. "

Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton expressed her sympathy on social media, telling the skier that the comments “reflect on the people making them, not you.”Later in the day, Kenworthy received a response from YouTube’s official Twitter page, which said the company was “actively working” to remedy the situation.“This is unacceptable, we’re so sorry these comments and notifications came through to you,” the tweet reads. “We’re actively working to fix this so you won’t see or be notified of abusive comments and exploring more ways to protect people from abusive comments overall.”Kenworthy responded on Wednesday with some suggestions for the company’s screening policy, explaining that these slurs and hateful messages could have done serious damage to a younger, less confident version of himself.Kenworthy, who won a silver medal during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, didn’t come out until the following year. Since then, he’s been a proud advocate for the LGBTQ community.“For me getting to be out at this Games has been the most rewarding thing,” he told HuffPost earlier this month. “But getting to leave here knowing that I actually brought myself to the Games, and I was true to myself and I gave it my all, I think I’m leaving with my head held higher than I did last time with a medal when I wasn’t being honest about who I was.”"

Brown brightens up a room as soon as he enters one. And Tuesday was no exception.The actor, who’s coming off two historic award show wins, was on hand Tuesday in Harlem, New York, to help launch a new arts and mentoring hub for at-risk youth. It’s part of an initiative with Clorox and Thrive Collective, an organization that helps bring arts education and mentorship to low-income communities throughout New York City.Brown was all smiles. So were the kids who met him in that space.I met with Brown to discuss the partnership and his roles in the hit TV series “This Is Us” and in the box office smash “Black Panther.” Warning: This story contains spoilers for “Black Panther.”This is a beautiful space. Why was it important for you to get involved in this particular project? Being a dad and having two boys it’s important for me to raise them with certain sorts of values. I want them to take responsibility for their space. I want them to be kind and resilient human beings. It’s really interesting, the research that Clorox has done shows that taking ownership of your space and providing something that’s clean will make you more productive. There are also ties to show that it also makes you more empathetic … And when you grow up to be an adult you feel a sense of responsibility to your community. So cleaning is not just an end unto itself. Cleaning is the beginning.[Clorox has] used that paradigm to create this wonderful space through Thrive Collective — this youth arts center. Just a couple of months ago it was a run-down school, and now they’ve created a space where kids can express themselves ― visually, artistically … There’s over 400 schools that Thrive Collective works with that have lost their arts funding in New York City, primarily [its] inner-city areas. So when you take those things away from kids it makes it seem that imagination is not something that should be prized or important. As an actor myself, my imagination, without it, you couldn’t do what I do. This is about mentorship as well. Who were some of your mentors growing up or one person who stands out to you? That’s a good question. There’s a woman by the name of Barbara Bull who was my high school adviser. In eighth grade, she was my algebra teacher. And I asked her, “Mrs. Bull, where did you go to school?” And she said, “I went to Stanford University.” I said, “Well, that’s where I will go.” And she said, “It’s hard to get in.” I said, “OK, that’s where I want to go.” And that’s where I wound up going. She taught me about investing in the stock market. She would come to all my plays — sometimes when other family members weren’t able to be there. I would hang out in her room and do my homework. In between football practice and play rehearsal, I would go to Mrs. Bull’s room because she would always be there. So, she is a second mother to me. I haven’t seen her in awhile, but I love you Mrs. Bull. I hope to see you soon.“This Is Us” returns this evening. Last time we saw you, we saw an older Randall. What is it like stepping into an older self on the show?It is interesting. One thing I learned about myself. I didn’t like seeing fat older Randall. They gave me a belly pooch. Look, I’m a pretty easy, go-lucky kind of guy. And they gave me this belly thing, and I was like, “What is this? This does not belong to me. Take this back!” They were like, “We need something different. We need to make sure that people recognize [the older Randall].” It’s nice to know that our show and our creator has the imagination to say we could go anywhere. As long as we have a family member, this Pearson family, we can track them into the future, into the past. And it’s exciting. It’s exciting to know someone has vision and knows where he wants to take the show because when you trust in the direction you’re being led in, you’re like, “I’ll go wherever you take me.”In that case, if you could take Randall anywhere, where would you take him? I think at some point in time Randall has to have more time with his family from Memphis. We opened up this whole other family that he didn’t even know that he had. I hope that we get more time to explore that arena. And then this is sort of a “Black Panther” / “This Is Us” crossover, if you will. I remember I was talking to a person of African descent who lived in Britain, and she would ask me where I was from. And I was like, “I’m from St. Louis, Missouri.” And she was like, “No man, where are you from?” Well, my mom’s from Arkansas, and my dad’s from Mississippi. She’s like, “No, no, no. But where are you from, right? And I was like, “I don’t know.” So maybe if Randall could trace his ancestry back to the motherland that would be a really interesting thing to explore because we as African-Americans are a group denied the answer to that question: Where are you from?Speaking of which, there’s been so much success with “Black Panther.” What is it like to see black representation on the big screen in this way?It fills your boy up! Just being on the set and looking at the trailers at base camp. There would be 20, 25 trailers lined up and then we’d get called to set, and you see a black face coming out of those trailers over and over again. To know that Marvel had the vision and the courage to put this sort of financing behind a film with all these African and African-American faces, and that it has proven that it can be financially viable and not just to the community to which it represents but to the mainstream as well. And that people see themselves. There’s a very fundamental question at the center of the film: Are you your brother’s keeper? Am I my brother’s keeper? And whether you’re black, white, Asian, Latino, it doesn’t matter — I think that’s a question that we all wrestle to deal with. Ultimately, we say yes, and there are a couple of misguided attempts throughout the course of the film to try to answer that question. But ultimately T’Challa takes it on in a way that hopefully we can move forward in the universe in a way that makes sense. I love this film. I love the way in which the audiences are responding to this film. I love going on Instagram and seeing people dress up in dashikis and African garb and just feeling so big because for so long you’ve been denied that image of yourself on the big screen, that image of yourself as superhero. And now it’s here. And people are feeling it.How do you feel about who Killmonger becomes in the film?As his father, he expresses his disappointment. Like I was trying to give you something, and I made a mistake. I kept you away for too long. I didn’t give you enough. I feel like his journey is an interesting parallel to African Americans’ journey in terms of like how exactly am I connected to this thing from which I’ve been disenfranchised. Have I been separate, or am I a part? And so, while he has good intentions, he doesn’t have the best of intentions. The man shot his girlfriend … He burned up all of the earth. It wasn’t like he was trying to be magnanimous to make sure that this continued. He wanted to have absolute power … But it was misguided … and that’s what happens oftentimes. People have these great intentions. But the manifestation, the practical application, they don’t know exactly how to make that happen. So, it’s nice to see that T’Challa is able to take and recognize within Killmonger that he has a point. But there’s another way to go about it. The conversation over Killmonger has been one of the more fascinating things about the film. I love going on and reading the articles about how this character has struck a chord. You’re hosting “SNL” on March 10. Who is Sterling K. Brown as “SNL” host?I’m going to have so much fun. I love being onstage. I love performing. I love making people laugh. So you’re going to see one of the most fun versions of Sterling K. Brown that you can get. I’ll do anything. I’m crazy."

The survivors of the Valentine’s Day school shooting spent the last two weeks pressuring lawmakers and the National Rifle Association to take action against gun violence. To get their attention, the survivors, mostly students, maintained a steady presence in front of news cameras, organized nationwide school walkouts and staged protests in front of state capitols and the White House.Before Walmart’s announcement, President Donald Trump met with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the White House to discuss gun laws and school safety.Though Trump spoke vaguely about his support of a number of different policies, the president urged lawmakers from both parties to write a “strong bill” that is “really strong on background checks.”He also accused Republican lawmakers of being intimidated by the National Rifle Association after Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) told him that a bill he co-wrote to strengthen background checks did not raise the age requirement for gun purchases from 18 to 21.Trump told Toomey, “Because you’re afraid of the NRA, right?”The president’s remarks were also directly at odds with some of the NRA’s positions: Trump said he wanted to ban bump stocks, an accessory that modifies guns to simulate automatic fire, and he insisted that police should be able to confiscate guns from people who may appear to be dangerous.This article has been updated with information about the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and Trump’s comments on gun laws."

A new HuffPost/YouGov poll on school safety found that 45 percent of respondents who identify as white expressed at least some support for arming teachers with firearms, compared to only about 30 percent of non-white respondents. Meanwhile, 50 percent of people of color said they somewhat or strongly opposed arming teachers, versus 44 percent of white respondents. Respondents who identify as black were especially opposed to the idea.This divide is even more intense when comparing Democrats to Republicans. Nearly 70 percent of Republicans said they supported the idea of arming teachers, compared to 20 percent of Democrats. Overall, 41 percent of respondents expressed at least partial support for the idea, compared to 46 percent who opposed it and 13 percent who were not sure. However, there appears to be an intensity gap on the issue. While only 20 percent of respondents overall said they strongly support arming teachers, 36 percent said they strongly oppose it.But parents with children under the age of 18 showed some enthusiasm for the idea. Overall, 33 percent of parents said having armed educators would make them feel more safe, while 22 percent said it would make them feel less safe. One-quarter said it wouldn’t make them feel more or less safe either way. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said teachers should be armed to prevent school shootings like the one in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead on Feb. 14. In the weeks since, a group of the school’s surviving students have mobilized widespread resistance to pro-gun organizations like the National Rifle Association. In the wake of the shooting, the president held a listening forum with survivors of gun violence and their families. Trump heard from attendees who want to increase the level of security in schools via police officers or armed educators. But some critics have expressed fear that this would only exacerbate the school-to-prison pipeline, a phenomenon in which biased or overly strict security and discipline processes help funnel students from school into the criminal justice system. Others posited that arming teachers could put the lives of black students in danger. The president’s words aren’t being taken lightly. Nearly half of survey participants ― 44 percent ― called the idea of arming educators with firearms to prevent mass shootings a “serious policy proposal.”In the same vein, white respondents were more likely to say that they would support having armed police officers stationed at schools. As of 2014, 30 percent of schools employed a school-based police officer. Most poll respondents who identify as white ― 70 percent ― said they at least somewhat endorsed this idea, compared to 58 percent of non-white respondents. Overall, 66 percent of survey respondents said they supported this idea. Overall, Republican respondents were significantly more likely to support the idea of armed police officers in schools than the general population, at 83 percent versus 66 percent. About 60 percent of Democrats said they backed the idea. But at the same time, white and Republican respondents were less likely to think schools in the U.S. have safety problems, the poll found. Nearly 60 percent of white participants called schools at least somewhat safe, compared to about 40 percent of people of color. Republicans, too, generally called schools in the U.S. safe, at 65 percent, compared to about half of Democrats. Teachers groups and the National Association for School Resource Officers, which represents school-based police officers, have warned against giving teachers weapons.NASRO “recommends that no firearms be on a school campus except those carried by carefully selected, specially trained school resource officers who are career law enforcement officers with sworn authority,” the group said in a statement last week.

Yet the plan by President Donald Trump and the NRA to arm teachers seems to have come straight from “All in the Family.”In a 1972 episode, the iconic TV character ― played by Carroll O’Connor ― tackled the issue of gun control. At the time, Bunker was responding to hijackings rather than mass shootings, but his solution was eerily similar to Trump’s plan to put guns in schools. “Arm all your passengers,” Bunker said. Bunker said a theoretical gunman would no longer have “superiorority” and “ain’t gonna dare to pull out no rod” as a result. He continued: “And then your airlines, then they wouldn’t have to search the passengers on the ground no more, they just pass out the pistols at the beginning of the trip, and they pick ’em up again at the end. Case closed.”Norman Lear, one of the producers of “All In The Family,” noted in 2012 that this clip was frighteningly similar to the NRA’s plan for putting more guns in schools after the Sandy Hook mass shooting. “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” NRA executive Wayne LaPierre said at the time. And now Trump wants to arm 20 percent of teaching staff at schools following the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed on Feb. 14. He even suggested offering bonuses for teachers who agreed to bring guns into the classroom.Alas, when this “All in the Family” clip first went viral, Lear noted that Bunker’s similar “plan” was used for laughs on his show. “Can we possibly have any other reaction to Wayne LaPierre’s similarly insane idea to provide armed guards for every school but to laugh?” Lear wrote. “Or cry. I find myself doing a lot of both lately.”"

Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government has kept the area, located just outside of Damascus, under siege since 2013. Movement in and out is prohibited except at a handful of crossings, heavily guarded by both regime and rebel forces.While the government campaign to regain control of eastern Ghouta has dragged on for years, the intensifying military offensive in recent weeks has produced what United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called “hell on earth” for the almost 400,000 trapped civilians.More than 500 people have been killed in the past week, according to estimates from Doctors Without Borders. Schools and medical facilities have been targeted, forcing people to take shelter underground. And because the Assad regime has placed a blockade on humanitarian access, food is severely limited. As of last November, the proportion of children under age 5 suffering from acute malnutrition in eastern Ghouta was the highest percentage recorded during the Syrian civil war.The U.N. unanimously approved a resolution on Saturday calling for a 30-day ceasefire. “The resolution will be immediately implemented and sustained, particularly to ensure the immediate, safe, unimpeded and sustained delivery of humanitarian aid and services, the evacuation of the critically sick and wounded and the alleviation of the suffering of the Syrian people,” Guterres said.Yet no convoys have been able to travel into Syria since the U.N. vote.“We still don’t have the green light to go inside and bring desperately needed food and medical supplies, and to do medical evacuations,” Panos Moumtizis, the U.N.’s regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, told France 24.The Syrian government has by and large prevented humanitarian aid from reaching eastern Ghouta in the last few years, with the exception of a few deliveries of food and medical aid.Assad cut off the tunnels used by those smuggling in aid supplies in February of last year, said Aron Lund, a fellow with The Century Foundation, and the U.N. has barely been granted access since September. In October, the government closed the last remaining checkpoint leading into the eastern Ghouta city of Douma, the al-Wafideen crossing, according to Amnesty International, which isolated that area from basic necessities like food and medication.At the same time, rebel groups have been known to use the blockade on humanitarian access for their own political or financial gain, Lund said. Rebels have monopolized the local economy by being the ones to smuggle in goods and sell them at highly inflated rates, while government soldiers manning the checkpoints profit from their control over some of the smuggling routes.Violence has repeatedly flared up between Islam Army and Failaq al-Rahman, the two predominant rebel factions in eastern Ghouta, due to disputes over smuggling profits, Lund noted.“The government has used the humanitarian crisis to its advantage in ways that are not legal under international law,” he said. “It’s not a fair tactic. But you’ve had rebel groups also making money off people’s hunger, so it’s not a black and white situation.”With both checkpoints and tunnels out of commission, however, innocent civilians are the ones bearing the brunt of the political fighting between the regime and the rebels."

The center would be modeled on the new Firearm Violence Prevention Research Center at the University of California at Davis, which launched last summer with $5 million in state money over five years.The impetus for both initiatives is the vacuum created by the federal government’s virtual abandonment of research into gun violence — its causes, its patterns, its perpetrators, its victims, and the best ways, based on scientific evidence, to curtail it.The federal government’s reluctance to fund research has had a ripple effect. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last year found that between 2004 and 2015, research related to gun violence was “substantially underfunded and understudied” compared with other leading causes of death, based on the mortality rates of each. The study said that gun violence research received a paltry 1.6 percent of the funding ($22 million) that would be predicted ($1.4 billion) based on the number of deaths caused by guns — 36,252 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The influence of pro-gun groups has also dissuaded many private foundations from funding such research, according to David Hemenway, who studies gun violence and injury prevention at the T. H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard University.“If you fund gun research, you know you’ll be attacked, and there are so many other things that need research,” Hemenway said. “Funders figure they don’t need the headaches that come with studying gun violence.”In California and New Jersey, supporters of research say states must pick up the slack.“California essentially said that the federal government wasn’t fulfilling its responsibility, so we’re going to step into the breach, just as we have with climate change and years before with highway safety,” said Garen Wintemute, the director of the new California center and an emergency physician who has studied gun violence for three decades.The feeling in New Jersey was the same, according to state Sen. Troy Singleton, a Democrat who introduced a separate bill to fund a $400,000 study of gun violence. It passed out of a Senate committee this month.“I’m dismayed over the political decision that caused the federal government to walk away from studying this issue, which has put us in a dangerous situation nationally,” Singleton said. “When we develop evidence-based solutions, that’s when we’re at our best.”The sponsor of the bill to establish a gun research center at Rutgers, Democratic Assemblywoman Joann Downey, said she is more optimistic than ever before about the legislation’s chances.“Especially with what happened in Florida,” she said. “Our parents are scared. Our teachers are scared. Our students are scared.”A Shift on Capitol Hill?In the wake of the killings at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida earlier this month, a few congressional Republicans have indicated a willingness to lift federal restrictions on gun research.Gun-violence researchers say such a shift would make a huge difference. Without federally funded research, they say, policymakers lack the basic information that would help them make wise policy decisions.“What isn’t known?” Hemenway said. “Everything. Everything.”For instance, there are no national studies of who owns guns, how gun owners acquired their weapons, the theft of guns, the number of households with guns, the attributes of a high-quality gun training, or the risk factors associated with gun violence.Without that knowledge, Hemenway said, “How are you supposed to come up with effective policy?”The federal government’s withdrawal from gun research began in the late 1990s. Gun researchers such as Hemenway said it was spurred by the first studies indicating that the presence of a firearm in the home increased rather than decreased the chances of gun-related fatalities, either by suicide or homicide. Subsequent studies confirmed those findings.The studies incensed pro-gun organizations such as the National Rifle Association, which protested to congressional supporters. The result was the Dickey amendment, which Congress added to the 1996 funding bill for the CDC, and which bars the agency from using money to “advocate or promote gun control.” Former U.S. Rep. Jay Dickey, an Arkansas Republican who died last year, eventually expressed regret for the amendment that bears his name.The Dickey amendment does not explicitly prohibit the CDC from studying gun violence. But it has had a chilling effect on such research, especially since Congress cut the CDC’s annual budget by exactly the amount that it had been spending on gun-related research, about $2.6 million a year.Though the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Justice have continued to hand out small grants for such research, NIH several months ago quietly shelved an $11.4 million gun-violence research initiative that President Barack Obama launched in 2013 in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. The initiative has funded 14 firearm related projects over the past 3 years. Many pro-gun groups continue to support the Dickey amendment — and they are still angry about CDC studies published with federal money.“At the time the amendment was proposed, officials in the CDC were indicating that they were going to use the agency in order to attack firearms ownership — and to demonize firearms in the same sense as they had demonized tobacco,” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, wrote in an email to Stateline.Valuable ResearchEven if there isn’t as much gun research as there should be, Philip Cook, a professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, argues that policymakers should be paying attention to what is being produced.In a December article in Science, Cook cited published research that shows an increase in violent crime as states replaced concealed carry laws with right-to-carry laws. Concealed carry laws gave law enforcement the authority to determine if a gun owner had a justifiable reason to carry a concealed weapon. Right-to-carry laws give most gun owners that right without having to justify themselves.Similarly, according to Cook’s paper, research has shown that laws preventing those with misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence from owning guns have saved lives. Finally, he noted, research showed that laws that increased prison sentences for those using a firearm in an aggravated assault or robbery has reduced the rate of robberies in which a gun is involved.“Despite the relative lack of federal funding in this area, there has been quite a lot of research going on,” Cook said. “And it’s productive and evidence-based, exactly what is needed to create effective policy.”At UC Davis, Wintemute said his center plans to give California lawmakers what they need to create effective policy.“Soon we’re going to publish the first large-scale epidemiological study on gun violence in California in 30 years,” he said. “The reason I know that is because I’m the one who did the study 30 years ago.” Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

The initiative has funded 14 firearm related projects over the past 3 years. Many pro-gun groups continue to support the Dickey amendment — and they are still angry about CDC studies published with federal money.“At the time the amendment was proposed, officials in the CDC were indicating that they were going to use the agency in order to attack firearms ownership — and to demonize firearms in the same sense as they had demonized tobacco,” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, wrote in an email to Stateline.Valuable ResearchEven if there isn’t as much gun research as there should be, Philip Cook, a professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, argues that policymakers should be paying attention to what is being produced.In a December article in Science, Cook cited published research that shows an increase in violent crime as states replaced concealed carry laws with right-to-carry laws. Concealed carry laws gave law enforcement the authority to determine if a gun owner had a justifiable reason to carry a concealed weapon. Right-to-carry laws give most gun owners that right without having to justify themselves.Similarly, according to Cook’s paper, research has shown that laws preventing those with misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence from owning guns have saved lives. Finally, he noted, research showed that laws that increased prison sentences for those using a firearm in an aggravated assault or robbery has reduced the rate of robberies in which a gun is involved.“Despite the relative lack of federal funding in this area, there has been quite a lot of research going on,” Cook said. “And it’s productive and evidence-based, exactly what is needed to create effective policy.”At UC Davis, Wintemute said his center plans to give California lawmakers what they need to create effective policy.“Soon we’re going to publish the first large-scale epidemiological study on gun violence in California in 30 years,” he said. “The reason I know that is because I’m the one who did the study 30 years ago.” Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

He has been instrumental in crafting U.S. policy on the Korean peninsula since his appointment by President Barack Obama in 2016 and helped secure the release of gravely ill American student Otto Warmbier last year.“It was completely my decision to retire at this time,” Yun told CNN about his departure.The news was first reported by CNN and The Washington Post, and later confirmed by the Department of State.“The Secretary has reluctantly accepted his decision and wished him ‎well,” State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement provided to HuffPost. “Ambassador Yun has served with distinction for more than 30 years ... we are sorry to see him retire.”Nauert noted that “diplomatic efforts regarding North Korea will continue based on our maximum pressure campaign to isolate the DPRK until it agrees to begin credible talks toward a denuclearized Korean peninsula.”Yun is the State Department’s top official working on North Korean issues and has been a strong advocate for engagement with the regime, particularly as tensions have increased in the region. He was among the first to learn that Warmbier had fallen into a coma at some point during his 17-month detention in the country, and he flew to Pyongyang last June to secure his release.Warmbier died just days later.The Post noted that Yun also served as the U.S. official tasked with communicating with North Korean representatives at the United Nations in New York, the backchannel used by diplomats to communicate even while official channels are closed.Yun’s departure comes just days after the close of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, where diplomats from North Korea hovered around envoys from the United States for weeks. A secret meeting between Vice President Mike Pence and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sister was canceled at the last minute after Pence used the trip to slam the regime and declined to acknowledge the North Korean representatives.But, despite the frosty encounters, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Sunday the North was willing to open a dialogue with the United States, although it was unclear if such talks would come with strings attached. The U.S. has said in recent weeks it would hold preliminary talks with the North, but only to explain that it would keep up international pressure in hopes of convincing the North to abandon its nuclear weapon programs.The U.S. also announced a new barrage of sanctions against Pyongyang last week.Yun’s departure leaves the Trump administration without another senior official on the Korean peninsula. The White House has yet to nominate an ambassador to South Korea and pulled back from a widely respected candidate last month after the man, Victor Cha, expressed concerns over policy decisions related to North Korea.It’s unclear who will replace Yun, but morale in the foreign service has been falling since Donald Trump took over the presidency in January 2017. Dozens of top-level officials at the State Department have left the agency over the past year, and applications to join the foreign service have plummeted."

While “This Close” wouldn’t feel out of place on premium cable, the six-episode, Los Angeles-based series breaks fresh ground in the television landscape as the first show written, created by and starring deaf artists. That Feldman and Stern communicate with one another onscreen using a combination of sign language and gestures is, in some respects, beside the point; the experiences their characters convey are messy, relatable and funny. (Catch a behind-the-scenes sneak peek at the show in the video above.) The actor-creators first collaborated in 2015, introducing less-developed versions of their “This Close” characters on a web series called “Fridays.” A second, five-part incarnation of the show, “The Chances,” debuted to great acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival last year.Their mission with “This Close,” Feldman said, was to give members of the deaf community the onscreen complexity they had lacked. “In the past, when deaf characters are represented or introduced, it’s because they’re deaf. The sole purpose that they’re in the story is because they’re deaf,” he told The Observer. “With this show, Kate and Michael are deaf, yes, but they are so many other things, too, and I think that’s new.”Ahn, who is also a Sundance veteran, told HuffPost that he took an interest in Feldman and Stern because of the pair’s willingness to “challenge and redefine the mainstream” through their work. The filmmaker won near-universal acclaim for his 2016 feature, “Spa Night,” about a closeted gay teen who experiences a sexual awakening amid the underground world of Korean spas. “This Close,” he said, offered him a chance to follow up “Spa Night,” which won the prestigious John Cassavetes Award at the 2017 Independent Spirit Awards, with a project that explored “themes of identity and intersectionality” in a similar way. “Shoshannah and Josh have created characters and a relationship that reveal our humanity, our connection to each other,” Ahn told HuffPost. “I felt an intense sense of community while making the show. Whether we’re deaf or hearing, gay or straight, man or woman or somewhere in between, we are connected.” Like “Spa Night,” “This Close” has a distinctly queer element, too. Michael is revealed as gay in the first episode, and over the course of the season, he struggles to recover from a devastating breakup with his fiancé, Ryan (Colt Prattes), through drugs, alcohol and casual sex. On the flip side, Michael’s relationship with Kate seems deeper and more affectionate than the one she has with her hapless fiancé, Danny (Zach Gilford) ― a testament to the enduring kinship many gay men enjoy with straight women.Already, “This Close” has also provided some much-needed opportunity for other deaf artists, too. Both “America’s Next Top Model” heartthrob Nyle DeMarco and Marlee Matlin, who remains the only deaf performer in history to win an Oscar (for 1986′s “Children of a Lesser God”), appear in guest roles in later episodes. Between “Spa Night” and “This Close,” Ahn said he definitely feels a responsibility to depict often-overlooked communities in his work and wishes other Hollywood players would follow suit. “I really believe that the true impact of the show will reveal itself in all the films and television shows in inspires,” he said. “If I made something just for the money or entertainment, I think I would get bored.” To that point, he’s confident that Feldman and Stern’s influence will resound beyond the show’s first season. “It takes artists like Josh and Shoshannah to take the initiative and tell their stories,” he said. “I know they will inspire others.” Catch the trailer for the series below.

A House bill to revamp the Higher Education Act has moved out of committee for debate, while the Senate is still discussing reform ideas in committee.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a95b5e51e00000a087acf9e.jpg?ops=crop_0_539_1125_1046%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"By Delece Smith-Barrow, The Hechinger ReportWASHINGTON — A bill proposed by Republicans in the House of Representatives could change the college-financing system dramatically, moving billions of dollars out of financial aid programs.If H.R. 4508, becomes law, college affordability would go from bad to worse, say many higher education experts, and students from low-income backgrounds would suffer most.According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the net loss of funds to students over the next 10 years would be almost $15 billion if the bill is enacted as written. Other analysts say that figure would be even higher.The bill, known as the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act, would also make more money and regulatory flexibility available to for-profit colleges, many of which have been cited for high costs, low graduation rates and a history of taking advantage of low-income students and military veterans.“If enacted, it would decimate the loan repayment safety net for low-income borrowers,” said Ben Miller, senior director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. “It would expose students to unscrupulous actors, especially in the for-profit space. And it would do nothing to actually address the real problems we have around completion and equity.”The Higher Education Act, first passed in 1965 and revised perodically, regulates how the federal government financially assists postsecondary institutions and students. It governs how federal student loans are distributed, who is eligible for federal financial aid, how loans must be repaid and which institutions can receive federal money. The PROSPER bill was moved out of committee by House Republicans in December. The Senate is holding hearings to develop its own version.With the national student debt hovering around $1.3 trillion, lawmakers, parents and students have been crying out for a fix to the higher education lending system.But many see the new bill’s proposed fixes as harmful to those who most need the boost toward the middle class that comes with a college education. For some, it would make college less affordable altogether; for others, it would add to the debt burden they would carry after college.To meet its stated goal of simplifying the many federal grant and loan programs, the House bill proposes streamlining application processes, which could help students and their families, but also eliminating several of those programs.Among the proposed cuts are grant programs, including Teacher Education Assistance grants (for those who agree to teach, after college, for four years in a public school serving low-income families) and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (additional grant money for qualified undergraduate students from the lowest income levels).The bill would also eliminate some loan programs — including a key loan program for graduate students — and some beneficial repayment options. These include the option for some low-income students to extend their repayment plans (without extra interest) and a program that forgives loans after 10 years of repayment for those working in government or nonprofit public-service jobs.For-profit institutions, conversely, would benefit from the proposed bill because it would eliminate the 90-10 rule, which currently prevents these institutions from receiving more than 90 percent of their revenue through federal financial aid. The rule pushes schools to create programs that enable students to be successful after graduation, because some revenie is coming directly from students or employers. Before the 90-10 rule was instituted, for-profit-colleges often enrolled low-income students who had little prospect of earning a degree, obtained those students’ federal grant and loan money, and suffered no consequences when the students dropped out or received a substandard education.“A for-profit college could be a hundred percent federally funded,” if the PROSPER Act becomes law, Miller said.The bill would also narrow the eligibility requirements for deferment of loans and require those in certain types of payment plans to pay more than previously expected. For example, the percent of what’s defined as discretionary income that borrowers must pay under an income-driven repayment plan would increase from 10 to 15 percent. And the bill would require even full-time students from low-income backgrounds to pay interest on their federal loans while they are pursuing their degrees. Currently, students are not responsible for any interest while they are in school.“Undergrad students with low expected family contributions should not have to accrue interest while in school,” said Jean McDonald Rash, chair of the Higher Education Loan Coalition, a group of financial aid professionals who work to improve federal loan programs. She said the group has many concerns about the bill in its current form.For example, as noted, the new bill proposes ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which benefits students who go into nonprofit fields or government work and are not likely to earn large incomes.“We think that’s very important to attract students into those kinds of fields of study,” said McDonald Rash, who’s also a director of financial aid at Rutgers University.Some believe that with fewer options from the government to pay for school, students and educators would have to think more carefully about how to finance the cost of a degree. Currently, schools don’t have an incentive to lower their prices because students can use government aid to foot the bill, said Mary Clare Amselem, an education policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a right-leaning think tank.“Overwhelming economic evidence is suggesting that heavily subsidizing federal student loans has led to college tuition increases,” Amselem said. Schools “know that pretty much regardless of what they charge, students are going to be able to find the loans from the federal government.”Amselem also believes the new bill would push students to borrow from private lenders, which she says is a good thing. “The federal government controls 90 percent of the student loan market, so they’ve virtually crowded out private lenders,” she said. “I think if we had more options for students, we would have a very robust, very competitive market that would offer really great options for students.”Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, introduced the new bill in December. It was voted out of committee on straight partisan lines and sent for debate in the full House.“Our proposals offer the same deal for everyone, regardless of occupation, and put downward market pressure on institutions to keep costs down,” Rep. Foxx said in an emailed statement. “Additionally, the PROSPER Act puts additional funding behind the time-tested cornerstone of financial aid for low-income students: the Pell grant.”Pell grants are awarded to students most in need; to qualify, family income must usually be below $50,000 a year. The maximum grant for the 2018-19 school year is $5,920. Under the proposed new bill, Pell recipients would receive an additional $300 if they’re taking at least 15 academic credits per semester, a provision designed to encourage people to finish college as quickly as possible.The Education Trust and 34 other organizations — including the NAACP and the National Association for College Admission Counseling — wrote a letter to several members of Congress in which they said the proposed act “exacerbates the increasing burden of student debt and continued inequity in higher education access and outcomes. It would make higher education less affordable, saddle students with greater debt, and push more students into loan default.”While a bill this vast — nearly 600 pages — has a number of pros and cons, many say it’s not an even split.“There’s a couple things here and there that aren’t bad for low-income students,” Miller said, “but they are far outweighed by the litany of items that would hurt them.”Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, has said he hopes to see a bipartisan version by early spring that can be recommended to the full Senate.This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

42,POLITICS,Conservative Republicans Push For Retreat On Food Stamp Fight -- For Now,Arthur Delaney and Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-republicans-food-stamps-snap_us_5a958c98e4b0bef79e306d09,They fear other Republicans aren't ready to cut benefits in an election year.,2018-02-27,"Rep. Jim Jordan, a conservative stalwart, said ""you know the lay of the land"" this year. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a958d051e000017087acf60.jpeg?cache=wDr06B38sJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― One of the major policy goals of House Republicans in 2018 was supposed to be a sweeping “welfare reform.” But an unlikely force may delay that fight for another year: the Republicans’ own conservative wing.House conservatives have been vocal cheerleaders for overhauling the food stamps program, known officially as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Conservatives specifically support adding stricter work requirements for people to receive SNAP benefits, and the traditional place for that debate would be as part of the five-year reauthorization of the farm bill, which expires in October. But reading the mood of their fellow Republicans in this election year, conservatives now seem to be pushing for a tactical retreat.“They better not do a long-term reauthorization,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told HuffPost on Tuesday. “Only way I’d be for a long-term reauthorization is if we actually addressed the food stamp issue and do welfare reform.”Jordan said he supported a five-year reauthorization of nutrition and farm programs in the unlikely event the bill included his priorities. “But you know the lay of the land. And so there better not be a long-term reauthorization unless we deal with that,” Jordan said, referring to stricter work requirements.“In lieu of doing what we need to do,” Jordan continued, a one-year extension of existing programs would be “much better.”Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told HuffPost that “any momentum for a new bill is weak,” also suggesting that a short-term extension of nutrition and farm programs might be the way to go.Part of the problem for conservatives is that they know Democratic votes will be necessary to pass a farm bill ― at least in the Senate ― and they think many of their fellow Republicans won’t go along with a plan that puts tighter restrictions on SNAP beneficiaries in an election year.A prominent conservative aide noted that without the advantage of a fast-track budget process ― in which Republicans could pass a work requirement bill with a simple majority in the Senate, like they did for tax reform ― and with the intra-party disagreements over both food stamps and agriculture subsidies, the farm bill “becomes a needlessly divisive process for House Republicans this year.”But on the other side of the GOP conference, some Republicans who oppose more SNAP cuts sense that passing a five-year reauthorization this year is their best shot at preventing things like SNAP work requirements for able-bodied adults with young children.“To pass a farm bill, we need a bipartisan coalition,” Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, told HuffPost on Tuesday. “We’ll need that now, and we’ll need that a year from now.”Conservatives have been holding out hope that Republicans would use the budget reconciliation process to enact additional SNAP work requirements.“If budget reconciliation was perceived as an option,” the senior conservative aide told HuffPost, “leadership could dump any welfare reform ideas that they didn’t want to deal with during the farm bill into the budget.”Since there’s apparently no plan to do a budget, however, there’s no shot of using the special reconciliation process. And without any other realistic way to enact the changes conservatives want, the farm bill becomes the only vehicle to push for those changes, meaning they won’t want to give up any of their leverage there.When HuffPost raised the idea with Dent ― that conservatives were holding out hope to pass SNAP work requirements through reconciliation, but didn’t want to give up leverage on the farm bill just yet ― he suggested the argument was irrelevant.“The farm bill’s expiring,” Dent said. “We should deal with it now because that’s our job, not kick the can in hopes of getting some other policy that we can’t get today.”The House Agriculture Committee is moving ahead with at least a markup of the farm bill. Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) told HuffPost on Tuesday that he intends to finish the reauthorization this year. Asked about a one-year extension, Conaway said that was “not something I’m considering.”In fact, the Agriculture Committee plans to unveil a draft of the farm bill next month, and the panel actually met Tuesday morning to discuss it.“We hope to be able to convince at least 217 of my good friends to support the legislation,” Conaway said.The congressman, who has in years past resisted cuts to SNAP, does seem more open to ideas like additional work requirements ― a fact that Meadows noted when he praised Conaway as a “great advocate for the ag community.” But even if Conaway did go along with what conservatives want on work requirements, there’s a good chance the Senate wouldn’t.Spokespeople for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said they expect the Senate to vote on its version of a farm bill later this year. With 60 votes needed to pass a farm bill in that chamber, Democrats there have significant sway over changes to SNAP.Back in the House, the Freedom Caucus has some say over what comes out of the chamber, but they don’t control what gets a vote. By pushing for a low-drama extension, conservatives are hoping to persuade House leaders to kick this can down the road rather than getting into a potentially messy fight.Spokespeople for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) did not immediately respond when HuffPost asked if they were committed to giving Conaway’s farm bill a floor vote this year.SNAP is one of the biggest safety net programs in the U.S., with more than 42 million beneficiaries. The program provides a monthly stipend averaging $125 per recipient that can be redeemed in grocery stores for most food products.Federal law already prohibits more than three months of SNAP benefits for unemployed able-bodied adults without dependents, but states are allowed to waive the time limit in areas with high unemployment. Republicans agree on making it more difficult for states to obtain such waivers, even though childless adults without disabilities represented only about 8 percent of SNAP beneficiaries in 2016. But Jordan has also proposed expanding the work requirement so that it applies to some parents as well.The proposed changes, the exact text of which Democrats on the House Agriculture Committee have not been shown, already have SNAP advocates worried. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) is concerned that how Republicans have gone about preparing for the farm bill markup shows that many people will, in fact, get kicked off food stamps — even if the changes are less aggressive than what Jordan wants.“The way this is playing out right now you are paving the way for a more partisan bill,” McGovern said."

He currently represents another Russian oligarch, Aras Agalarov, and his son Emin Agalarov — two key figures in the Trump-Russia investigation who helped arrange the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian operatives at which Trump campaign officials were promised derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.“Mr. Balber’s admission that unnamed ‘others’ are also financing this lawsuit is strange — raising the specter that the Kremlin itself might be acting through proxies here,” Walden said in a statement to Yahoo News. “Certainly, this could be problematic for all involved in this shady suit.”In his letter to Prokhorov, Walden asks that all documents relating to the litigation be preserved, including any communications between the Brooklyn Nets owner and “any current or former Russian government officials, Russian law enforcement officers, officers or agents of the FSB [Russia’s domestic intelligence service] or representatives of the Russian Olympic Committee.”Asked for comment, Balber called Walden’s letter “a publicity stunt” and said, “As far as I know, there is absolutely no Russian government role in the filing of the lawsuit.

After the Sochi Olympics, Rodchenkov was awarded a prestigious Order of Friendship medal by Putin.The allegations by Rodchenkov were confirmed by international investigators and led to the International Olympic Committee’s decision to bar Russia from sending a delegation to this year’s Winter Olympics in South Korea, although Russian athletes were allowed to participate as individuals. That decision was reaffirmed just this week by the Olympic Committee, which refused to let Russian athletes march under their own flag in the closing ceremony at the South Korea Olympics.Since fleeing to the United States, Rodchenkov, now in the federal witness protection program, has provided key evidence to international investigators and Justice Department officials about potential violations of federal law by the Russians.

46,POLITICS,"Trump Talks A Good Game On Guns, But He Hasn’t Actually Pushed For Any Action",Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-gun-control-immigration_us_5a95c31ce4b09c872bae8e19,"And now maybe he’s backtracking, just like he did on the failed immigration bill.",2018-02-27,President Trump appears to prefer talking about gun control over passing it.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a95c4111f00005100168a1c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump has been all over the place on guns, but he hasn’t yet done the one thing that helps move votes in Congress: publicly support specific legislation to address gun violence.In the days since the horrific school shooting in Parkland, Florida, the president has suggested arming teachers, toughening background checks, opening more mental hospitals and increasing the age limit to buy some weapons to 21. Last week, he directed his administration to regulate bump stocks, the gun accessory used to simulate automatic fire in the 2017 Las Vegas attack.Trump has even urged state governors not to be afraid of the National Rifle Association, the nation’s most powerful gun lobby, as they seek to address school safety ― a remarkable thing for a Republican president to say.“Don’t worry about the NRA. They’re on our side,” Trump told a bipartisan gathering of governors on Monday during a White House meeting. “If they’re not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while. That’s OK. They’re doing what they think is right.”It’s not hard to understand why Trump has tried to move to the middle on guns. Support for stricter gun laws has spiked to its highest level since 1993, according to a recent CNN poll, with 70 percent of Americans now saying they support more gun control. That’s up from the 52 percent who said they supported stricter gun laws in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, where 58 people died. Trump’s approval rating, meanwhile, has slumped again to match the lowest of his presidency.Yet Republicans in Congress, many of whom are facing competitive primaries ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, seem no more willing to tackle the issue of gun control. Without clear direction from the leader of their party, it’s unlikely they’ll do so in a substantial way this year. “If President Trump weighs in ― and leans in ― we could see some reasonable changes on things like bump stocks and age restrictions. If not, the status quo will largely remain,” said Doug Heye, a veteran Republican operative and former Republican National Committee communications director.Trump’s tactics on guns so far have mirrored his handling of the immigration debate. Early in conversations with lawmakers over the legal status of young undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, the president expressed a desire to pursue comprehensive immigration reform and even said he’d be willing to “take the heat” from his supporters if Congress decided to act. He also told lawmakers that he would sign any bill they sent him that would institutionalize President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, buoying activists’ hopes that Congress would reach a compromise.Yet his vague promises and platitudes on immigration were quickly followed by intense lobbying from immigration hawks in the White House and the Department of Homeland Security against a bipartisan measure in the Senate that would have paired $25 billion for border security with a pathway to citizenship for nearly 2 million undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Neither that bill nor other competing ones received enough votes to advance.With more Republicans expressing skepticism this week about additional restrictions on guns, Trump seems to be heading toward a similar backtrack. The president, per CNN, appears to be softening his position on raising the age at which people can purchase AR-15 rifles, the weapon used in the Parkland massacre, and similar weapons. But a White House spokesperson insisted Tuesday that the president still supported the idea.It’s also unclear what kind of bill toughening background checks Trump is willing to endorse. Democrats are calling for universal gun background checks, while Republicans support more modest efforts to beef up the national background check system. Trump is scheduled to meet with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a top gun control advocate, to discuss the matter on Wednesday. “We expect to have some specific policy proposals later this week,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Tuesday.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) called on the Senate the same day to “immediately” pass a bill to strengthen background checks for gun purchases, which he co-sponsored with Murphy. The measure, called Fix NICS, would require states to produce an implementation plan focused on uploading all gun purchaser information to the federal background check system and penalize federal agencies if they failed to record that information.Democratic senators support Cornyn’s bill but call it a “tiny” effort to curb gun violence. They would also like the Senate to consider more gun-related initiatives, such as an assault weapons ban, magazine restrictions and stricter background checks ― all ideas opposed by Republicans and the NRA.“My sense is Republicans aren’t going to move here on serious gun legislation unless the president pre-endorses it, so what he says in the next few days and what he says tomorrow will be important,” Murphy said Tuesday.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) agreed that it would be helpful if Trump said what he preferred Congress to do on the issue of guns.“The president said some things that were encouraging, that were common sense,” Graham said during a sit-down with reporters. “But whether he follows through with them ― I don’t know.”"

Georgia’s Senate voted 35-19 in favor of Senate Bill 375, or the Keep Faith in Adoption and Foster Care Act, Feb. 23. Introduced by Sen. William Ligon (R), the legislation would permit taxpayer-funded adoption agencies and foster care providers to refuse referrals if they are deemed to violate “sincerely held religious beliefs.”SB 375 now heads to Georgia’s House of Representatives for consideration. Ligon and his supporters believe the legislation will encourage more faith-based adoption agencies to open in Georgia. “We’re failing these children by not doing everything that we can do to ensure every door of opportunity is open and available to them for placement,” the senator told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “There are agencies that are willing to do this if they’re given legal certainty.”Opponents, however, see SB 375 as little more than government-sanctioned discrimination targeting the LGBTQ community. Among them is Ben Wexler, who worked as an executive producer on “The Grinder” and a consulting producer on “Arrested Development.” Wexler spoke out against the Keep Faith in Adoption and Foster Care Act on Twitter late Friday. A number of LGBTQ celebrities, including actor-comedian Billy Eichner and Oscar-winning “Milk” screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, retweeted Wexler’s remarks. By Monday, “West Wing” and “Transparent” actor Bradley Whitford had tweeted similar sentiments ... ... as did the creator of Lifetime’s “Army Wives,” Katherine Fugate, who is currently in talks to shoot an upcoming movie in Georgia.If a boycott did materialize, the impact on Georgia’s economy would be considerable. In 2016, the Peach State reportedly outpaced California as the top U.S. location for movie production, with 17 feature films produced within its borders. A number of Marvel blockbusters ― including “Black Panther,” which raked in a reported $89 million for the state ― were shot at Pinewood Atlanta Studios. Georgia also stands in for rural Indiana on the Netflix smash “Stranger Things.”"

Turns out, Samantha lives on... well, sort of. In a new interview with Variety, Streisand revealed that her two new pups, Miss Violet and Miss Scarlett, were cloned via cells extracted from Samantha’s mouth and stomach.“They have different personalities,” Streisand said. “I’m waiting for them to get older so I can see if they have [Samantha’s] brown eyes and seriousness.”Her third dog is a relative of Samantha’s, named Miss Fanny, a nod to Streisand’s iconic Broadway and movie role in “Funny Girl.” Incidentally, the breeder who brought Streisand the pup had named her own dog Funny Girl. When Streisand posed with her canine trio for a portrait to accompany the interview, she suggested captioning the photo “Send in the Clones,” a wink to Stephen Sondheim’s ballad, “Send in the Clowns,” which she recorded on 1985's “The Broadway Album.” The remainder of Streisand’s Variety interview is just as dishy, tackling everything from her forthcoming memoir to the Academy Awards to the Me Too movement.

HartungImagine for a moment a scheme in which American taxpayers were taken to the cleaners to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars and there was barely a hint of criticism or outrage. Imagine as well that the White House and a majority of the politicians in Washington, no matter the party, acquiesced in the arrangement. In fact, the annual quest to boost Pentagon spending into the stratosphere regularly follows that very scenario, assisted by predictions of imminent doom from industry-funded hawks with a vested interest in increased military outlays.Most Americans are probably aware that the Pentagon spends a lot of money, but it’s unlikely they grasp just how huge those sums really are. All too often, astonishingly lavish military budgets are treated as if they were part of the natural order, like death or taxes.The figures contained in the recent budget deal that kept Congress open, as well as in President Trump’s budget proposal for 2019, are a case in point: $700 billion for the Pentagon and related programs in 2018 and $716 billion the following year. Remarkably, such numbers far exceeded even the Pentagon’s own expansive expectations. According to Donald Trump, admittedly not the most reliable source in all cases, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis reportedly said, “Wow, I can’t believe we got everything we wanted” ― a rare admission from the head of an organization whose only response to virtually any budget proposal is to ask for more.The public reaction to such staggering Pentagon budget hikes was muted, to put it mildly. Unlike last year’s tax giveaway to the rich, throwing near-record amounts of tax dollars at the Department of Defense generated no visible public outrage. Yet those tax cuts and Pentagon increases are closely related. The Trump administration’s pairing of the two mimics the failed approach of President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s ― only more so. It’s a phenomenon I’ve termed “Reaganomics on steroids.” Reagan’s approach yielded oceans of red ink and a severe weakening of the social safety net. It also provoked such a strong pushback that he later backtracked by raising taxes and set the stage for sharp reductions in nuclear weapons.Donald Trump’s retrograde policies on immigration, women’s rights, racial justice, LGBT rights, and economic inequality have spawned an impressive and growing resistance. It remains to be seen whether his generous treatment of the Pentagon at the expense of basic human needs will spur a similar backlash.Of course, it’s hard to even get a bead on what’s being lavished on the Pentagon when much of the media coverage failed to drive home just how enormous these sums actually are. A rare exception was an Associated Press story headlined “Congress, Trump Give the Pentagon a Budget the Likes of Which It Has Never Seen.” This was certainly far closer to the truth than claims like that of Mackenzie Eaglen of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, which over the years has housed such uber-hawks as Dick Cheney and John Bolton. She described the new budget as a “modest year-on-year increase.” If that’s the case, one shudders to think what an immodest increase might look like.The Pentagon Wins BigSo let’s look at the money.Though the Pentagon’s budget was already through the roof, it will get an extra $165 billion over the next two years, thanks to the congressional budget deal reached earlier this month. To put that figure in context, it was tens of billions of dollars more than Donald Trump had asked for last spring to “rebuild” the U.S. military (as he put it). It even exceeded the figures, already higher than Trump’s, Congress had agreed to last December. It brings total spending on the Pentagon and related programs for nuclear weapons to levels higher than those reached during the Korean and Vietnam wars in the 1950s and 1960s, or even at the height of Ronald Reagan’s vaunted military buildup of the 1980s. Only in two years of Barack Obama’s presidency, when there were roughly 150,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, or about seven times current levels of personnel deployed there, was spending higher.Ben Freeman of the Center for International Policy put the new Pentagon budget numbers in perspective when he pointed out that just the approximately $80 billion annual increase in the department’s top line between 2017 and 2019 will be double the current budget of the State Department; higher than the gross domestic products of more than 100 countries; and larger than the entire military budget of any country in the world, except China’s.Democrats signed on to that congressional budget as part of a deal to blunt some of the most egregious Trump administration cuts proposed last spring. The administration, for example, kept the State Department’s budget from being radically slashed and it reauthorized the imperiled Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for another 10 years. In the process, however, the Democrats also threw millions of young immigrants under the bus by dropping an insistence that any new budget protect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or “Dreamers,” program. Meanwhile, the majority of Republican fiscal conservatives were thrilled to sign off on a Pentagon increase that, combined with the Trump tax cut for the rich, funds ballooning deficits as far as the eye can see ― a total of $7.7 trillion worth of them over the next decade.While domestic spending fared better in the recent congressional budget deal than it would have if Trump’s draconian plan for 2018 had been enacted, it still lags far behind what Congress is investing in the Pentagon. And calculations by the National Priorities Project indicate that the Department of Defense is slated to be an even bigger winner in Trump’s 2019 budget blueprint. Its share of the discretionary budget, which includes virtually everything the government does other than programs like Medicare and Social Security, will mushroom to a once-unimaginable 61 cents on the dollar, a hefty boost from the already startling 54 cents on the dollar in the final year of the Obama administration.The skewed priorities in Trump’s latest budget proposal are fueled in part by the administration’s decision to embrace the Pentagon increases Congress agreed to last month, while tossing that body’s latest decisions on non-military spending out the window. Although Congress is likely to rein in the administration’s most extreme proposals, the figures are stark indeed ― a proposed cut of $120 billion in the domestic spending levels both parties agreed to. The biggest reductions include a 41% cut in funding for diplomacy and foreign aid; a 36% cut in funding for energy and the environment; and a 35% cut in housing and community development. And that’s just the beginning. The Trump administration is also preparing to launch full-scale assaults on food stamps, Medicaid, and Medicare. It’s war on everything except the U.S. military.Corporate WelfareThe recent budget plans have brought joy to the hearts of one group of needy Americans: the top executives of major weapons contractors like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. They expect a bonanza from the skyrocketing Pentagon expenditures. Don’t be surprised if the CEOs of these five firms give themselves nice salary boosts, something to truly justify their work, rather than the paltry $96 million they drew as a group in 2016 (the most recent year for which full statistics are available).And keep in mind that, like all other U.S.-based corporations, those military-industrial behemoths will benefit richly from the Trump administration’s slashing of the corporate tax rate. According to one respected industry analyst, a good portion of this windfall will go towards bonuses and increased dividends for company shareholders rather than investments in new and better ways to defend the United States. In short, in the Trump era, Lockheed Martin and its cohorts are guaranteed to make money coming and going.Items that snagged billions in new funding in Trump’s proposed 2019 budget included Lockheed Martin’s overpriced, underperforming F-35 aircraft, at $10.6 billion; Boeing’s F-18 “Super Hornet,” which was in the process of being phased out by the Obama administration but is now written in for $2.4 billion; Northrop Grumman’s B-21 nuclear bomber at $2.3 billion; General Dynamics’ Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine at $3.9 billion; and $12 billion for an array of missile-defense programs that will redound to the benefit of... you guessed it: Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing, among other companies. These are just a few of the dozens of weapons programs that will be feeding the bottom lines of such companies in the next two years and beyond. For programs still in their early stages, like that new bomber and the new ballistic missile submarine, their banner budgetary years are yet to come.In explaining the flood of funding that enables a company like Lockheed Martin to reap $35 billion per year in government dollars, defense analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group noted that “diplomacy is out; air strikes are in... In this sort of environment, it’s tough to keep a lid on costs. If demand goes up, prices don’t generally come down. And, of course, it’s virtually impossible to kill stuff. You don’t have to make any kind of tough choices when there’s such a rising tide.”Pentagon Pork Versus Human SecurityLoren Thompson is a consultant to many of those weapons contractors. His think tank, the Lexington Institute, also gets contributions from the arms industry. He caught the spirit of the moment when he praised the administration’s puffed-up Pentagon proposal for using the Defense Department budget as a jobs creator in key states, including the crucial swing state of Ohio, which helped propel Donald Trump to victory in 2016. Thompson was particularly pleased with a plan to ramp up General Dynamics’s production of M-1 tanks in Lima, Ohio, in a factory whose production line the Army had tried to put on hold just a few years ago because it was already drowning in tanks and had no conceivable use for more of them.Thompson argues that the new tanks are needed to keep up with Russia’s production of armored vehicles, a dubious assertion with a decidedly Cold War flavor to it. His claim is backed up, of course, by the administration’s new National Security Strategy, which targets Russia and China as the most formidable threats to the United States. Never mind that the likely challenges posed by these two powers ― cyberattacks in the Russian case and economic expansion in the Chinese one ― have nothing to do with how many tanks the U.S. Army possesses.Trump wants to create jobs, jobs, jobs he can point to, and pumping up the military-industrial complex must seem like the path of least resistance to that end in present-day Washington. Under the circumstances, what does it matter that virtually any other form of spending would create more jobs and not saddle Americans with weaponry we don’t need?If past performance offers any indication, none of the new money slated to pour into the Pentagon will make anyone safer. As Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies has noted, there is a danger that the Pentagon will just get “fatter not stronger” as its worst spending habits are reinforced by a new gusher of dollars that relieves its planners of making any reasonably hard choices at all.The list of wasteful expenditures is already staggeringly long and early projections are that bureaucratic waste at the Pentagon will amount to $125 billion over the next five years. Among other things, the Defense Department already employs a shadow work force of more than 600,000 private contractors whose responsibilities overlap significantly with work already being done by government employees. Meanwhile, sloppy buying practices regularly result in stories like the recent ones on the Pentagon’s Defense Logistics Agency losing track of how it spent $800 million and how two American commands were unable to account for $500 million meant for the war on drugs in the Greater Middle East and Africa.Add to this the $1.5 trillion slated to be spent on F-35s that the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight has noted may never be ready for combat and the unnecessary “modernization” of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, including a new generation of nuclear-armed bombers, submarines, and missiles at a minimum cost of $1.2 trillion over the next three decades. In other words, a large part of the Pentagon’s new funding will do much to fuel good times in the military-industrial complex but little to help the troops or defend the country.Most important of all, this flood of new funding, which could crush a generation of Americans under a mountain of debt, will make it easier to sustain the seemingly endless seven wars that the United States is fighting in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. So call this one of the worst investments in history, ensuring as it does failed wars to the horizon.It would be a welcome change in 21st Century America if the reckless decision to throw yet more unbelievable sums of money at a Pentagon already vastly overfunded sparked a serious discussion about America’s hyper-militarized foreign policy. A national debate about such matters in the run-up to the 2018 and 2020 elections could determine whether it continues to be business-as-usual at the Pentagon or whether the largest agency in the federal government is finally reined in and relegated to an appropriately defensive posture.William D.

This year, Holi falls on March 1 and 2. Hindus participate in the festival by smearing brightly colored powder on each other, throwing water balloons and indulging in sweets. As is true of many Hindu festivals, Holi is associated with a number of different spiritual texts and traditions that vary from region to region in India. For some, Holi is a day to remember the divine couple, Radha and Krishna, or the love and sacrifice of the Hindu god Kama. Others think of the faithfulness of Prahlada, a devotee of the Lord Vishnu.Holi is a time of year when traditional social boundaries are overturned ― children are able to squirt elders with water and women douse men with colored powders. People come together in public spaces to dance, play with the colored powders, and most importantly, celebrate life.Scroll down to see photos of people taking part in this remarkable festival in India."

Although “Moonlight” ultimately emerged victorious, director Barry Jenkins still hasn’t gotten over the shock. Jenkins told the Hollywood Reporter that the history-making Oscars flub made him question whether or not “Moonlight” was, in fact, the evening’s real winner. He said he was so “distraught” by the way his film’s win played out at the ceremony, he continues to have a difficult time celebrating its success. “I wasn’t sure that thing was mine or who it belonged to because of how everything happened,” he revealed in a Feb. 23 discussion with fellow black Best Director nominees John Singleton, Lee Daniels and Jordan Peele. “It’s bittersweet because when that switch happened, I didn’t enjoy it ... And it made 2017 a very long year.” The director said he’d come to terms with his film’s loss even before presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway erroneously announced “La La Land” as the winner. “For two minutes, we lost,” he said. Pointing to his forthcoming film, “If Beale Street Could Talk,” as well as a new series about the Underground Railroad he’s developing at Amazon, he added, “And in those two minutes, I was still self-satisfied because I knew I’m going to go off and do these things, you know? Winning or losing is not gonna take any of those things off the table.”Jenkins stressed that he didn’t make “Moonlight” — which depicts a queer, black latchkey kid’s sexual awakening in the Miami projects and was unanimously praised for humanizing marginalized voices — for “the awards conversation.”The experience, however, has him somewhat jaded by the prospect of future nominations.“I’m never going to get the opportunity to enjoy that — because even if it happens again, it won’t be the same,” he said. ”‘Moonlight’ was a very special film for me.”"

Gov. Casey Cagle, who also serves as president of the Georgia state Senate, intimated in a tweet he would “kill any tax legislation” as punishment to Delta, which last week said it would end its discount program for members of the NRA. Delta, headquartered in Atlanta, is one of more than a dozen companies that have distanced themselves from the gun lobby following the massacre of 17 people at a Florida high school on Feb. 14.“Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” Cagle, a leading Republican candidate to replace Gov. Nathan Deal, wrote on Monday.HuffPost has reached out to Delta and Cagle for comment.The Georgia legislature has been considering a new bill that would restore a massive sales tax exemption on jet fuel. Delta, the state’s largest private employer, would be the provision’s main beneficiary and save about $40 million a year.Just last week, Cagle had endorsed the measure, and it was expected to move through to Gov. Nathan Deal’s desk quickly.Cagle’s statement drew some rebukes from other lawmakers, including Stacey Abrams, a Democratic candidate for governor, who urged lawmakers to “take action to roll back dangerous laws that put guns in the wrong hands.”“I applaud Delta’s decision to listen to feedback from its customers and reject #NRA extremism that has prevented commonsense reform for too long,” Abrams wrote on Twitter.Another Democrat, state Sen. Steve Henson, told ABC News that “Republican fear of the NRA is evidently more important than the Georgia business climate, jobs, or the well-being of Georgia citizens.”And the ACLU of Georgia also called Cagle’s threat inappropriate in a statement to ABC. “Politicians should not use taxpayer dollars to impose ideological litmus tests and punish organizations that express views that politicians dislike,” ACLU Executive Director Andrea Young said.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Monday that Delta had been attempting to downplay the political motivations behind its decision, saying it was a supporter of the Second Amendment and that the company held a “neutral” stance on gun control measures. The company noted a separate instance in which it had withdrawn support “over a politically and emotionally charged issue” after it ended its sponsorship of a staging of “Julius Caesar,” which depicted the assassination of a Donald Trump-like character.The memo did little to assuage Cagle and other conservatives in the Georgia General Assembly.“I’m tired of conservatives being kicked around on our values. It’s time we stand up and fight and show corporations that conservative values are important, not just to Georgia but to the entire nation,” Cagle told the Journal-Constitution. “We can fight for jobs, but we can also fight for values.”"

You’d be like, ‘Uh, you should call your doctor.’ Why? ‘We’re not going to be able to have you on our show, but you should call your doctor.’Although that would be an incredibly embarrassing way to learn that you had a sexually transmitted disease, genital herpes is actually much more common than many people realize. More than 1 in 6 Americans ages 14 to 49 have genital herpes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making its status as the chief disqualifier on a mainstream reality show rather less surprising.What does raise an eyebrow, however, is the way Michael Carroll, a “Bachelor” producer, described how he and other producers judge the applicants’ psychological evaluations:“There’s psychological tests they have to pass, but there’s a window of the pass, do you know what I mean?” insinuated Michael Carroll, the producer who got so close to contestants that he even crashed in their rooms occasionally. “You’d know there’d be a possibility of [someone] being kind of unhinged — like, she passed, but just barely.

Specifically, the sacred herbs that give the Black Panther his power are all destroyed during Erik Killmonger’s short reign. But Bassett hinted that perhaps Shuri, the princess of Wakanda, will save them all. “We have no more herb left,” she said. “Shuri will figure it out. My daughter will figure it out.”The theory is a popular one. The movie’s post-credits scene shows Shuri rehabilitating the Winter Soldier, who hasn’t been seen since “Captain America: Civil War” and is rumored to be a huge part of the next Avengers movie. This short moment also suggests that Shuri, and the events of “Black Panther,” will be integral to future major Marvel story arcs.The Marvel superhero movies tell pieces of a continuous storyline set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and are planned years in advance. “Black Panther” falls within the Phase 3 arc. Phase 4, announced in 2014 with movies scheduled through 2028, will likely include “Black Panther 2.”“[Black Panther] has been around for more than half a century in the comic books and there are many, many stories to tell,” Marvel Studios President Keith Feige told Variety earlier this month. He also revealed that he wants director Ryan Coogler to return for a sequel. And the film’s record-breaking success at the box office should remove any doubt that there will be a sequel.Bassett summed up the overall emotions around the new franchise.“We didn’t think we’d change history,” she said. “But to this degree and with this urgency, with this speed and this love and good feeling, we’re humbled.” "

Instead, her room full of preschool special-needs children was helmed by a teacher’s aide with the help of a parent.“We just don’t have enough substitutes,” said Cole, who’s 24 and in her second year of teaching.Striking teachers with stories like Cole’s have flooded the halls of the West Virginia capitol since last week. Schools across the state have been shut down for three days in an unprecedented show of force by teachers and public employees in all counties. The workers and their unions are demanding more funding for the public employee health plan and raises significant enough to offset several lean years without them.But in interviews, school employees who traveled from across the state to Charleston said the fight was about much more than their paychecks. West Virginia is one of the few U.S. states with a falling population. As the state grapples with a severe teacher shortage, many educators worry their younger peers will continue to flee for greener pastures, with long-term consequences for successive generations of students.A series of business tax cuts have left the state with little money to give public servants who’ve been waiting for meaningful raises. West Virginia now ranks 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in teacher pay, and it was one of just five states to see average teacher pay go down in 2016, according to the National Education Association. Of West Virginia’s 55 counties, more than half border a state with better teacher pay. And the state was trying to fill 700 vacant positions as of last spring.“There’s just no reason to stay here, especially the ones who aren’t married,” said Patty Hamilton, a second-grade teacher with 30 years at the same elementary school. “It’s very sad that this is happening.”As one protester’s sign outside the capitol succinctly put it, “Country Roads: Leading teachers out of West Virginia.”Cole herself is a prime example of what’s at stake. A recent graduate of West Virginia’s Marshall University, she carries around $50,000 in student debt and makes a salary of around $33,000, she said. She wants to earn her master’s degree but fears taking on more loans when legislators balk at 1 and 2 percent raises. She guesses she sinks around $1,000 per year into supplies for her classroom to make up for inadequate funding. Her fiancé believes they have better prospects out of state. What’s kept her in Kanawha County so far is her fidelity to home.“It’s something you can’t explain to people who aren’t from here,” Cole said.The feeling among strikers is that the state has milked their love for teaching and for West Virginia as much as it can. While many teachers receive annual increases based on length of service, the state legislature has not granted teachers an across-the-board pay increase since 2014. In the meantime, health care costs have increased, leading take-home pay to decline for some. Long accustomed to modest salaries, many teachers said pay raises are less important to them than stabilizing the Public Employee Insurance Agency, or PEIA.Without a guarantee to curb health premiums, teachers could still lose out even with statewide pay raises, according to Greg Cruey, a K-8 social studies teacher in McDowell County, along the Virginia border. “They could give me $80 with the left hand and take $130 with the right,” he said.Cruey said he could earn an additional $10,000 working across the state line in Virginia. He works at a school with 32 teaching positions, nearly a third of which he said are not staffed by a regular teacher. Some classrooms, he added, see four different teachers over the course of a year due to staff shortages and turnover. “The kids are instructional casualties,” he said.The last time West Virginia schools closed due to a strike was 1990, in a work stoppage that lasted 11 days. While the current walkout was initially scheduled for just last Thursday and Friday, local unions agreed to continue it into this week. Christine Campbell, president of the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, told a crowd of thousands in front of the state capitol on Monday that schools would be closed on Tuesday. Public sector workers in West Virginia do not have collective bargaining rights, and strikes by public employees are illegal. School districts could potentially pursue court injunctions ordering teachers and other employees back to work if the strike continues. But judging from the honks of support from drivers passing protests and picket lines ― not to mention the considerable number of students who came out to protest at the capitol ― the teachers have a lot of public support behind them. They are gambling that legislators and Republican Gov. Jim Justice will make a satisfactory offer before they begin to lose leverage. Justice was expected to travel to a handful of counties across the state on Monday, in what unions described as an effort to urge certain districts back to work to weaken the strike. But at publication time, all 55 counties were still onboard according to Kym Randolph, spokeswoman for the West Virginia Education Association.Among many teachers, there’s a sense that they have little to lose. Paige Muendel, a seventh-grade special education teacher from Morgantown, said her take-home pay has decreased due to rising health care costs. She lives close to the border of Pennsylvania, a state where the average teacher salary is $20,000 higher. So far, she’s resisted looking for a job there, but she doesn’t know how long she could hold out under the status quo.“I’ve considered it, but I’m here in West Virginia for a reason,” said Muendel. “I don’t want to leave my home. I don’t want to leave my state.”"
59,POLITICS,DCCC Advised Candidates Not To Discuss Gun Control Policy Right After Vegas Shooting,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dccc-las-vegas-massacre-email_us_5a9579f6e4b036ab0142c108,The campaign organization said Democrats should focus on offering thoughts and prayers.,2018-02-27,"Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) is chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which elects House Democrats.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a957a521e0000fb077acf38.jpeg?cache=tXmzef48gP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The morning after the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas, a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s press staff warned House candidates and their staffs not to “politicize” the shooting that day. Politicization, according to the DCCC official, included talking about gun violence prevention policy.“You and your candidate will be understandably outraged and upset, as will your community. However, DO NOT POLITICIZE IT TODAY,” DCCC regional press secretary Evan Lukaske wrote to candidates in the Northeast. “There will be time for politics and policy discussion, but any message today should be on offering thoughts/prayers for victims and their families, and thanking 1st responders who saved lives.”The email, seen in its entirety below, reflects the careful balance that Democrats have tried to strike as they strive to advance modest gun safety regulations and shield candidates in swing districts from the political price that could accompany comments about guns.But the cautious approach in Lukaske’s email is increasingly out of touch with what many party members, as well as gun violence prevention activists, would like to see from politicians ― especially in the wake of the recent deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Many of the surviving Parkland students waited almost no time before beginning to agitate for different gun policies, sparking a movement that has captivated the country.Gun violence prevention activists said they were disappointed the DCCC was advising candidates not to aggressively talk about policy solutions as often as possible. Ladd Everitt, director of the gun violence prevention group One Pulse for America, described the DCCC email as “pathetic.” Mark Glaze, senior adviser to the group Guns Down, said it was “straight out of the NRA’s talking points.”“If the DCCC is willing to give up a key issue and offend virtually every Democrat so as not to bother eight Independents in rural Missouri, they’re even more incompetent than we thought, and Democrats should be very worried about the midterms,” Glaze said. Several Democratic lawmakers have taken to mocking the traditional practice of sending gun violence victims “thoughts and prayers” without any follow-up of policy solutions. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who became a leading advocate of greater gun regulations after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, wasted no time after the Las Vegas massacre calling for greater action to prevent gun violence.“To my colleagues: your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers,” he tweeted a few hours after Lukaske’s email went out.Asked about the email on Tuesday, Murphy emphasized that it was a message from “one staffer.”Still, he added, “No Democrat should be worried about talking about policy changes in the wake of these mass shootings.”Former Democratic Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and her husband, retired Navy Capt. Mark Kelly, “led by example” the day after the Las Vegas shooting by demanding congressional action on the steps of the U.S. Capitol the day after it occurred, noted Katie Peters, of the former congresswoman’s group Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence. (Giffords became a more aggressive gun regulation advocate after being gravely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting.)“Following the tragedy in Parkland, we’ve seen the students show incredible leadership in demanding more than thoughts and prayers from their elected officials,” Peters said.Meredith Kelly, the DCCC’s communications director, emphasized that Lukaske’s message was intended to discourage hasty responses before all information about the shooting was known, rather than silence opinions about gun policy. It was also general advice that candidates were free to ignore. “A communications staffer who fails to provide immediate and thoughtful guidance after a national tragedy, based on the best available information at the time, is not doing his job,” Kelly said. The DCCC would not say whether it sent candidates similar guidance after the Parkland shooting. However, Kelly said the group, which is responsible for getting Democrats elected to the House, continues to caution candidates to consider their words carefully in the immediate aftermath of major national tragedies. The revelation that the DCCC advised candidates to avoid “politicizing” the Las Vegas shooting occurs as the House campaign arm struggles to fend off progressive criticism of its electoral strategy, particularly through its involvement in primary elections.Waleed Shahid is a spokesman for the left-leaning Justice Democrats, which backs a variety of candidates, including some the DCCC opposes. He called Lukaske’s email “a slap in the face to the movement” against gun violence. “Politics is exactly how people come together to make change and hold those in power accountable,” he said.This post has been updated with comment from Murphy.

She broke barriers for black athletes during her tennis career, winning the French Open in 1956, as well as the women’s singles and doubles at Wimbledon in 1957 as the first black person to compete in the tournament. She won the U.S. Open (then called the United States National Championships), 1957 and 1958.The tennis association board voted unanimously to honor Gibson with the statue, which association President Katrina Adams told The Undefeated was long overdue.“This is something that I have wanted for a while, something that I have floated within my office, as to getting something named after Althea,” Adams said. “Recognizing for me as an African-American woman and recognizing what Althea stood for and understanding that she truly broke the color barrier for tennis — a lot of people think it’s Arthur [Ashe], but it was Althea 11 years before him.”Tennis champion Billie Jean King played a pivotal role in getting Gibson recognition, calling her “our Jackie Robinson of tennis.” Gibson’s skills earned her a spot in the International Tennis Hall of Fame."

What about now, after Trump and his administration announced a ban on transgender people in the military; fired the entire presidential AIDS commission; decided not to collect data on LGBTQ people in the census; pulled questions about LGBTQ seniors in a health survey on the elderly; supported employer discrimination against LGBTQ people; backed allowing discrimination in public accommodations against LGBTQ people; appointed anti-LGBTQ judges to federal courts; and said he would stop investigating discrimination against trans students in bathrooms, among many other hostile actions? Angelo is sticking by his word, and even taking it a step further. In an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress at CPAC last weekend, Angelo implied that Trump is even better for the LGBTQ community than former President Barack Obama, at least in one way. “This president is the first president to enter the White House who believes that marriage equality is settled law of the land,” Angelo said, referring to a “60 Minutes” interview from over a year ago in which Trump was asked about his views on same-sex marriage. He didn’t actually state his own position on the matter, but said that the issue was “settled law.” “Barack Obama didn’t believe that when he entered the White House,” Angelo said. “Hillary Clinton only came around to that position in 2013.”But Trump never changed his stated position from the presidential campaign, and he doesn’t actually support marriage equality. Obama and Clinton both have supported same-sex marriage for several years.And within months of that “60 Minutes” interview, Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, making good on a promise to religious conservatives that he would install judges who could overturn the landmark Obergefell v.

He has already written a dissent while on the high court that some legal scholars say sends an encouraging message to states that might want to challenge Obergefell. When asked about reports that anti-LGBTQ leaders have a lot of access to Trump, Angelo responded that he himself had similar access. “I’ve been to the White House numerous times,” Angelo said. “I’ve met with senior White House officials.”“As I’ve long said, if you’re calling Donald Trump out for what are actual or perceived biases against the LGBT community, you have to call a spade a spade, highlighting the pro-LGBT things he has done,” Angelo said.And yet, Angelo offered few actual examples of “pro-LGBT things” Trump has done. He said he opposed Trump’s tweets announcing a ban on transgender people serving in the military, but excused the action as “cynical politics” meant to help a defense bill pass in a conservative Congress. He also said he thought Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was wrong to announce that the Department of Education would no longer investigate discrimination claims by transgender students regarding bathroom use, but added that she is “still pursuing other instances of discrimination against the transgender community.”“You have to include these things,” Angelo said.But seriously, a “pro-LGBT” president?“The facts speak for themselves,” Angelo responded. “I don’t want to keep belaboring these points, but: [Trump] entered the White House as first president saying he supports that marriage equality is settled law of the land, sent a letter of congratulations and commemoration [on Log Cabin’s 40th anniversary], and has people in his Cabinet who support marriage equality.” It’s hard to imagine how much lower the bar could be set.

Vandals defaced headstones at the Jewish cemetery, one of at least seven such cemeteries to be targeted by vandalism in 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a958b261e000008087acf58.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The number of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States rose nearly 60 percent in 2017, according to a new report from the Anti-Defamation League, marking the largest single year increase the organization has ever recorded. According to the report, published Tuesday, the ADL counted 1,986 anti-Semitic incidents in 2017, a 57 percent increase over the year before. It’s also the second highest tally the ADL has recorded since 1979, when the organization, which tracks anti-Semitism and other forms of hate, started conducting its annual count. Only 1994 saw more, with 2,066 anti-Semitic incidents. “A confluence of events in 2017 led to a surge in attacks on our community – from bomb threats, cemetery desecrations, white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, and children harassing children at school,” said ADL CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt in a statement. “These incidents came at a time when we saw a rising climate of incivility, the emboldening of hate groups and widening divisions in society.”The report breaks down anti-Semitic incidents into three categories: There were 1,015 incidents of harassment last year, a 41 percent increase over the prior year; 952 incidents of vandalism, an 86 percent increase; and 19 incidents of assault, a 47 percent decrease. The most common place for these acts of hate was in schools. There were 457 anti-Semitic incidents at K-12 schools in America last year, a 94 percent increase from the 235 recorded at schools in 2016. “The consistent increase of anti-Semitic incidents against students of all ages is deeply troubling,” Greenblatt said. “We know that students do not always report when they are being bullied, so for every incident that’s reported, it is likely there’s another that goes unreported.” Another ADL report released last month detailed 204 incidents of anti-Semitism on college campuses in 2017, a nearly 90 percent increase over the year before. The most anti-Semitic incidents last year occurred in the first three months of 2017, as the country reeled from a particularly contentious presidential election. January, February and March saw 208, 273 and 273 incidents respectively.There were 163 bomb threats made against Jewish institutions during those three months. A 19-year-old Israeli-American named Michael Ron David Kadar was arrested in Israel for making the bulk of those threats. It later emerged that Kadar, whom his mother described as autistic and suffering from a brain tumor, sold his bomb threat services on the dark web. “Our goal in the Audit is not to count anti-Semites, but rather to document cases where Jews were targeted for assault, vandalism and harassment,” an ADL spokesman explained to HuffPost. “Regardless of the motivation of any specific perpetrator, Jewish communities were repeatedly traumatized by these assaults on their institutions and threats to their safety. The bomb threats sowed fear and anxiety among Jews across the country.” The report similarly states that the desecration of seven Jewish cemeteries in 2017 — most of which occurred at the beginning of the year — “contributed to a sense that the Jewish American community was under siege.” The ADL’s report adds to a growing body of evidence pointing to a rise in hate in America. A recent report, also from the ADL, found that white supremacists in the U.S. killed more than twice as many people in 2017 as they did the year before, helping make 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence in America. (Already in 2018, a neo-Nazi allegedly murdered a gay Jewish college student in California.) Hate crimes rose about 5 percent in 2016, according to the latest FBI tally, marking the first time in over 10 years that the country has experienced consecutive annual increases in hate crimes.Preliminary hate crime statistics for 2017 — collected by Brian Levin, a professor at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino — showed a 20 percent rise in hate crimes in 13 large American cities. Earlier this month, the Southern Poverty Law Center released its annual “Year in Hate and Extremism” report, identifying 954 hate groups in the U.S. – an increase of 4 percent from 2016. The SPLC attributed this rise in hate groups, and a similar increase in 2016, to the rhetoric of President Donald Trump.“President Trump in 2017 reflected what white supremacist groups want to see: a country where racism is sanctioned by the highest office, immigrants are given the boot and Muslims banned,” said Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC’s Intelligence Project. To the delight of racists and fascists across the country, Trump has on numerous occasions given political cover or tacit support to white nationalism. During the campaign, he was slow to disavow the support of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard and avowed anti-Semite. The president also tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton standing next to an apparent Star of David and a pile of cash. (This anti-Semitic meme originated on an alt-right message board on 8chan.) Once in office, Trump issued a Holocaust Remembrance Day statement that omitted any mention of anti-Semitism or Jews. He refused to condemn his supporters for making anti-Semitic threats against journalist Julia Ioffe. “I know nothing about it,” he said. “You’ll have to talk to them about that.” (Andrew Anglin, the anti-Semite behind the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer, told HuffPost that he interpreted Trump’s lack of condemnation as “an endorsement” for the threats against Ioffe.) And after the violent white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August — which ended with a neo-Nazi allegedly driving his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, injuring 19 people and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer — Trump said there were “very fine people” on both sides of the rally. America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on.

68,BLACK VOICES,"After 'Black Panther,' Will Hollywood Finally Admit That Black Films Can Travel?",Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/after-black-panther-will-hollywood-finally-admit-that-black-films-can-travel_us_5a9024f9e4b0ee6416a279e2,The worldwide success of the Marvel film calls into question how we think of black-led films and markets abroad.,2018-02-27,"""Black Panther"" has made headlines for its box-office pull with director Ryan Coogler (left) and a mostly black cast including Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a903e351e000046057aca45.jpeg?cache=u4l9jQgPDr&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As of Tuesday, Marvel’s “Black Panther” has made $476.6 million domestically in just two weeks ― and it pulled in the second biggest 10-day total for a theatrical release, behind only “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”It has broken many other records, too: the highest-rated superhero film of all time on Rotten Tomatoes, the biggest opening for a black director ever, and the highest-grossing first week for a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.Having now earned over $704 million worldwide, box-office experts predict it is “inevitable” that the film will surpass the billion-dollar mark in a few days.Directed by Ryan Coogler and starring an almost entirely black cast, the movie has made headlines not only for its huge numbers and critical acclaim, but also for dispelling the myth that movies with black leads don’t have box-office pull with audiences of all backgrounds.Indeed, it seems like every few years a film starring a predominantly black cast or directed by a black filmmaker smashes records. The story always becomes how improbable the success is, and how, perhaps, the movie in question will finally break down barriers and assumptions about the potential of black movies in Hollywood. Of course, the scale of the success of “Black Panther” must be celebrated, but it shouldn’t be a surprise. In the past few years alone, movies starring and/or directed by black people have gone on to both critical acclaim and commercial success. “Hidden Figures,” starring Octavia Spencer, Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Monáe, was Fox’s second biggest domestic release in 2016 after “Deadpool” and made about $236 million worldwide. The indie “Moonlight,” last year’s Best Picture Oscar winner, made $413,175 in just four theaters on its opening weekend. With “Get Out,” Jordan Peele made the highest-grossing debut for a writer-director based on an original screenplay, ever. And “Girls Trip” became the first film written, produced, directed by and starring black people to hit the $100 million mark at the box office. This is all to say: The story that “Black Panther” marks some kind of Hollywood turning point is a non-story. One thing that can be said is that “Black Panther” does add to the conversation surrounding the international appeal of films with black stars. Just as Hollywood has propagated the myth that black movies don’t sell domestically, there’s a similar myth that they don’t sell in foreign markets, particularly in Asian countries like South Korea and China, which have fast become key to the global success of blockbuster movies. There are those who theorize it’s impossible to promote so-called black films in Asian markets because they are, apparently, too “racist” to accept anything other than a white lead. This doesn’t jive with the fact that films with diverse leads have done incredibly well in China ― “The Fate of the Furious,” with its wildly diverse cast, became China’s second-highest-grossing film in 2017. It still remains to be seen how “Black Panther” will do in the all-important Asian market of China. (It comes out there on March 9.) It has exceeded expectations elsewhere, making $41.2 million in the U.K. and $36 million in South Korea. With $2.5 million in Vietnam, the film had the fifth biggest opening weekend in industry history in that country, according to Variety. So, then, is Hollywood finally ready to move past a very familiar narrative? Miriam Bale, a film critic and senior programmer for the Indie Memphis Film Festival, thinks it probably isn’t, which makes the conversation around black films and the box office “frustrating.” “The industry says: ‘Black films don’t perform well overseas,’ when that’s clearly not the case. Just as these dinosaur aspects of the industry make films for men, when women are buying tickets,” she told HuffPost.“It’s too early to say, as far as numbers, but I think ‘Black Panther’s’ international success is going to be record-breaking and so harder to ignore,” Bale added. “And I think one reason for that success is how truly international that release was: premiering on so many continents at the same moment. The slow rollout doesn’t make as much sense anymore when word-of-mouth is international and 24-7.” Indeed, the problem with the “black films don’t travel” myth is that it operates under the false assumption that black people do not exist in the rest of the world. Asian markets are huge, yes, but “Black Panther” was as much bolstered by numbers in South Korea and Vietnam as it was in countries with large populations of black people, like South Africa, Nigeria and Brazil, where it has even inspired black Brazilians to protest white elitism.“Black Panther” proves that Hollywood must shift its ideas about what international success truly means. If representation is important to black people in the States, it is just as important (if not moreso) to those in countries abroad that have even less diversity in the media landscape. For example, Germany, where “Black Panther” is currently No. 1. So the question isn’t whether the success of “Black Panther” will change the way Hollywood views and markets films with predominantly black casts. The question is: When will we stop asking this altogether? When will Hollywood support black-led films without caveats or concessions? Will “Black Panther” truly be the turning point we need?Paul Dergarabedian, a media analyst at ComScore, believes that “great movies can travel anywhere in the world” and that “Black Panther” stands as “a lesson to anyone who believes a film may be limited in its appeal around the world due to the cultural background of its cast or specific point of view.”This is an optimistic outlook. But whether it’s true remains to be seen. Next month, Ava DuVernay’s “A Wrinkle In Time” will debut in theaters, as will the sequel to “Pacific Rim,” starring John Boyega. There’s little doubt that they will do well at the box office at home, and abroad. But the true question is ― will their success at home and worldwide come as a surprise as well? This story has been updated to include a more recent statistic for the global box office earnings of “Hidden Figures.”"

71,MEDIA,Leak: How NYT Editor James Bennet Justifies The Op-Ed Page To His Colleagues,Ashley Feinberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-times-opinion-james-bennet_us_5a8db27de4b0273053a70f47,"“The world needs this from us right now.""",2018-02-27,"James Bennet, at left, meets with a group of New York Times employees in December. A source provided a video of the meeting to HuffPost.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8dd1fc2000007d06eaf921.png?cache=cFIv0MY7Gz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In December, New York Times editorial page editor James Bennet met with a group of Times employees to answer questions about his much-questioned opinion section. At the time, A.G. Sulzberger, now publisher of the Times, was conducting a tour of the company he was about to inherit, meeting with employees from different corners of the newspaper. The Q&A session with Bennet was apparently convened in a similar spirit of transparency and goodwill. But according to some Times staffers who were present, little clarity was offered by Bennet and even less goodwill was spread. One person who was there, still angry more than two months later, called Bennet’s answers “equivocal bullshit.”In the meeting, a recording of which was recently viewed and transcribed by HuffPost, Bennet talked extensively about some of the choices he’d made since his hiring in 2016, the problems he’d encountered, the criticism he’d received both internally and externally, and his successes and failures.It was as frank an explication as Bennet has given of how he conceives of the opinion section. Slaloming between contradictions, Bennet laid out an ideology of no ideology. The editorial page is beholden to no priors (except when it is). It proudly forswears the idea of right answers (except when it doesn’t). It is humanist and ecumenical but also of the belief, for instance, that some kinds of ethnic cleansing are worthy of debate.“The world needs this from us right now,” Bennet told the dozen or so New York Times staffers in the room. “I don’t mean to sound pious, but it really is true that this is a crude and dangerously polarized time... And to simply assert that we know what the right answers are is not good for the democracy.”Some answers, though, are evidently so “right” in Bennet’s view that they can simply be asserted. “I mean, I think we are pro-capitalism,” he said later in the meeting. “The New York Times is in favor of capitalism because it has been the greatest engine of, it’s been the greatest anti-poverty program and engine of progress that we’ve seen.”Bennet’s ideology of no ideology admits to a few other caveats. In the meeting, he talked about how some issues are “settled law” and thus beyond debate, citing the evils of Nazism and the science of climate change. He also talked about which views are too “poisonous” to be given an airing in his pages, such as Richard Spencer’s white nationalism. But even then, perhaps uneasy with the idea of a value-neutral editorial page having any values at all, Bennet wobbled:We talk a lot about the Richard Spencer test, you know: Would we publish Richard Spencer in the pages of The New York Times? The answer to that is no... But the reasons we wouldn’t right now are largely because the guy is — he represents a particularly poisonous point of view. And that isn’t having those kinds of consequences. You know, it’s not a, it’s not a giant movement.Is it the poisonous point of view that disqualifies Spencer, or is it the supposedly narrow scope of his white nationalism and its lack of consequences? If Spencer’s ethnic cleansing program scored favorably in the next Gallup poll, would he then be worthy of op-ed space in The New York Times?“We’ve published Vladimir Putin,” Bennet said. “Should we not allow Vladimir Putin into our pages? It’s hard to say. It’s hard to say that that would be doing a service to our readers. But as you can see, I mean, I struggle to articulate what those boundaries are.” In an effort to elaborate on how he understands those boundaries, Bennet brought up an op-ed published about a year ago in which an Israeli settler called for Palestinian apartheid:We had a big argument over a piece by a settler. And you know, pick your issue. For some people it’s climate change, for some people it’s trans rights, for others it’s a two-state solution and the fate of the Palestinians. In this case, it was the settler saying, look, the two-state solution is dead and [it’s] time to face reality, and here’s some alternative paths for what the future would look like. And we had a real debate about whether this piece was crossing a line, because was it denying personhood to the Palestinians? Was it an act of, kind of, hate speech in a sense?To be clear, the “reality” that the column described, and that Bennet decided his audience needed to confront, is that “the presence of these Arab residents alone does not warrant a new country,” in the writer’s words. “Arabs can live in Israel, as other minorities do, with personal rights, not national rights.” One of the “alternative paths” offered was “an exchange of populations with Arab countries,” in which “Palestinians in Judea and Samaria would be offered generous compensation to emigrate voluntarily.”The opinion section in general is a case study in how essentially liberal institutions are undermined by the tools of their own liberalism. Illiberalism seeps into the hollows created by seemingly high-minded values about debate and the marketplace of ideas. The settled science about climate gets quickly unsettled by a columnist like Bret Stephens, a Bennet hire, who smuggles climate denialism onto the page by couching it in progressive-sounding language about debate, certainty and ecumenicism.The specter of Stephens hovered at the edges of the December meeting, even when he wasn’t being discussed directly. In an earlier meeting between Sulzberger and the same group of Times staffers (video of which was also viewed by HuffPost), someone asked about Stephens’ handling of climate change: “So when Bret Stephens is writing a column and there’s information in there about climate change, how does the editorial section handle that?” Sulzberger emphasized the need for columnists, who aren’t heavily edited, to “have everything buttoned up,” though he allowed that “we are not an organization that [has] fact-checkers.”In the meeting with Bennet, an employee asked how he makes sure his writers aren’t misrepresenting facts. Bennet replied:You know we do, I mean at a very basic level, we fact-check our work. So, there is a kind of layer there of having a — but the harder question is representation of fact. And that’s where we’re really, you know, are instilling rules of the road and kind of values for how we approach argumentation and hiring for people. And you know, the first-order value is intellectual honesty. And that means — and God knows we don’t succeed at this every day — but the goal is, you’re supposed to take on the hard arguments on the other side, not the easy arguments. Not the straw men, but the actual substantive, kind of toughest arguments and acknowledge when the other side has a point.Bennet was unstinting in his praise of Stephens: “I know that there was a lot of — and I experienced it — a lot of criticism and concern about him. And you guys may disagree or there may be people who do, but I just think he’s an exceptional writer and thinker.”This is one way of looking at Stephens’ work. Reading him might lead you to a different conclusion. After Stephens wrote his notorious April 2017 column in which he questioned established climate science in his sidelong way, he was forced to correct the only line containing any reference to actual science three days later.And he was just getting started. The first quarter of Stephens’ Feb. 9 defense of Woody Allen consisted of his retelling an entirely unrelated story for no apparent reason other than to remind us that someone was wrong one time. He wrote that “if Allen is in fact a pedophile, he appears to have acted on his evil fantasies exactly once,” as if that were a mitigating factor. (“Compare that to Larry Nassar’s 265 identified victims,” Stephens wrote.) He adduced to his argument a court ruling that actually undermined his framing of the case as a matter of a grownup’s childhood memories.In October, Stephens wrote about a reckoning that existed only because countless women had risked their livelihoods to expose a serial predator and alleged rapist, saying, “Of all of the dismaying and disgusting details of the Harvey Weinstein saga, none is more depressing than this: It has so few heroes.”The criticism of Stephens hasn’t just come from outsiders. On Saturday, one of The New York Times’ star reporters, Mike Isaac, tweeted the following: Isaac’s tweet has since been deleted. It’s not clear whether he deleted the tweet of his own volition or whether he was asked to do so by his editors. We do know, however, that Times opinion columnists enjoy a special set of privileges ― like speaking their minds on Twitter ― not extended to the general newsroom staff.In any case, none of Stephens’ infelicities really matter if writing and thinking are valued primarily as exercises in provocation rather than persuasion. In the December meeting, Bennet described columnists as “people who are paid to have very, very strong convictions, and to believe that they’re right.” This creates what he called the “real moral hazards in the opinion environment in which we want to, say, we want to convene lots of voices from lots of point of view.”In Bennet’s view, editorials — the unsigned pieces attributed to the Times editorial board as a whole — offer an antidote to morally or factually ambiguous pieces published on the opposite page. While the rest of the section is enacting a spirited performance of epistemological inquiry, the editorials get to carry the tablets down the mountain.I would worry and personally be concerned about saying we’re indifferent to what the right answer is, right? We don’t just want to let a thousand flowers bloom, let a thousand schools of thought contend, and we’ll just provide the platform... What the editorials allow us to do, is to say on matters of real consequence, where for one reason or another, this institution has felt a kind of historic connection, the Times is going to come down.There are right answers, sometimes, at least on matters of “real consequence.” This helps explain at least one recent bizarre move from the op-ed page. On Feb. 12, two days before the massacre in Parkland, Florida, Bennet’s section ran a piece titled “Background Checks Are Not the Answer to Gun Violence.” The author was John Lott, a man famous for distorting data to push the pro-gun agenda from which he makes his money. This would certainly seem like an astounding oversight from the paper of record.On Feb. 17, however, a Times editorial included this paragraph: “In a speech last month, [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions said undocumented immigrants are far more likely than American citizens to commit crimes, a claim he found in a paper by John Lott, the disreputable economist best known for misusing statistics to suit his own ideological ends. In this case, it appears Mr. Lott misread his own data, which came from Arizona and in fact showed the opposite of what he claimed: Undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than citizens, as the vast majority of research on the topic has found.” (Links were present in the original text.)This was, apparently, one of those matters of real consequence on which Bennet felt it was the Times’ duty to take a stance. And who better than the editorial page of The New York Times to counter the disinformation put out by the op-ed page of The New York Times.If Bennet held his December meeting in an effort to win favor with staffers, it seems to have backfired, according to some people in the room. “People were not satisfied with his answers,” one staffer who attended the meeting told HuffPost in a text message, “since his answers were equivocal bullshit that didn’t really address that the opinion section abuses fact and elevates white male conservative voices under the guise of ‘diversity of thought.’ And that he admits to making mistakes without any concern or even acknowledgement of what the consequences of those ‘mistakes’ actually are.”As for what those consequences might be, the employee cited “erosion of trust in the rest of what the NYT does, people coming to conclusions based on incorrect facts and then never seeing the correction (if there is one), and choosing to pay money and give a platform to these white dudes instead of marginalized voices who wouldn’t otherwise get their story told (and marginalizing them even more by publishing their bad takes).” A Vanity Fair piece published on Monday quoted a senior newsroom figure who said, “The newsroom feels embarrassed.”In a statement to HuffPost, a New York Times spokesperson said: “We prioritize communicating with our employees and providing open forums for them to hear updates and offer comments. Leaders throughout the organization, including James, have been doing that on a regular basis. We’re a large company and we don’t expect every employee to agree with every decision we make.”Two months or so after this meeting, the scrutiny on Bennet’s op-ed page has only heightened. Staff editor Bari Weiss, also a Bennet hire, infuriated a number of newsroom-side staffers when she wrote a tweet referring to American-born Olympic ice skater Mirai Nagasu as an immigrant, only to double down when called out on it, delete the original tweet and lie about what she’d actually said. Around the same time, Bennet announced the hiring of a new columnist, Quinn Norton, only to fire her roughly seven hours later after Twitter users discovered she’d previously boasted about her friendships with neo-Nazis. But none of this is at odds with the vision of the section as laid out in the meeting by Bennet. Provocations were made; liberal readers were riled. The world was just getting what it needed. You can read a full transcript of the meeting here.Clarification: Language has been amended to reflect that A.G. Sulzberger and Bennet’s meetings were with New York Times Company staff outside of the newsroom.

Wong - Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c26399f260000c10584fa26.png?ops=100_100,"LGBTQ rights groups are speaking out against Australia’s new deputy prime minister, who expressed homophobic views during his years as a newspaper editor. Michael McCormack was chosen by the Nationals ― the junior partner in the governing Liberal-National coalition ― to take over as party leader and deputy prime minister from Barnaby Joyce. Joyce, who had been in office for less than three months, resigned Friday after confirming he’d had an affair with a former staff member, Vicky Campion, who is pregnant. Though McCormack isn’t as high-profile as Joyce, a disturbing editorial he wrote during his time as a newspaper editor has resurfaced on social media in the wake of his accession. The 1993 article, which McCormack wrote while serving as editor for Wagga Wagga’s Daily Advertiser, appeared to blame the “sordid behavior” of gay people for the HIV/AIDS crisis. Australia voted overwhelmingly in favor of same-sex marriage last fall. Needless to say, LGBTQ rights advocates in Australia and around the world quickly condemned McCormack’s words.The Guardian points out that McCormack has apologized for the piece, which sparked several complaints to the Australian Press Council, on more than one occasion. McCormack voted in favor of same-sex marriage in Australia last year, and has said his views on the LGBTQ community have evolved in the 25 years since he wrote the piece. “I have grown and learned not only to tolerate but to accept all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, or any other trait or feature which makes each of us different and unique,” he said in August 2017. Still, one of the country’s most prominent LGBTQ activists believes McCormack needs to “walk the talk” if he wants queer voters to look beyond his hateful rhetoric. “He needs to get behind initiatives that will reduce the unacceptably high levels of LGBTI isolation, prejudice and suicide that still exist in some parts of rural Australia,” Rodney Croome, who is the spokesman for both the Tasmanian Gay and Lesbian Rights Group and Just.Equal, told the Australian Associated Press on Monday. “He needs to heal the wounds caused by the kind of prejudices he publicly expressed in the past.” "

Nelson said that the Catholic leaders made it clear that if she got married, she wouldn’t be able to continue coaching for the school.So Nelson decided to resign. “I am hurt and mostly disappointed that I will no longer be able to continue,” Nelson wrote in a statement posted on her Facebook page. “I hope you can understand that I simply cannot continue to work in an environment that refuses to support me.”Nelson, a 2008 graduate of West Catholic High, said that she “always wanted and intended to give back to the community I came from, a community my family and I have always loved and supported.” The coach helped lead her softball team to a 16-15 record, according to MLive.She added that she doesn’t believe her sexual orientation has ever hindered her ability to coach her team, but, “unfortunately, leadership does not agree.”In a Facebook post published on Sunday, West Catholic High claimed its leaders were “saddened and disappointed” by Nelson’s resignation, “especially this close to the softball season.”“When someone is living outside of Church teaching or participating in behavior not in line with Church teaching and makes it known publicly, they cannot fulfill their primary mission to lead by example,” the message read.The school insisted that it was not “judging” Nelson by enforcing Catholic teaching on same-sex marriages and said that the coach was still a “welcome and beloved member of our community.” The administrators said it was Nelson’s planned “public act of same-sex marriage” and not her “same-sex attraction” that stood in contrast to Catholic teaching. “Same-sex attraction” is a phrase commonly invoked by conservative religious groups to attack queer relationships by creating a distinction between feeling attracted to someone of the same sex and acting upon those feelings. “The teachings of the Church are written for happiness,” the statement read. “This issue is about love and wanting what is best, not necessarily in the immediate moment, but for a lifetime.”HuffPost’s requests for comment from West Catholic High were directed to the Diocese of Grand Rapids. Annalise Laumeyer, director of communications for the diocese, refused to confirm whether Nelson was a paid employee of the school or discuss how the diocese learned about the coach’s upcoming marriage. In a statement, the diocese said that its leader, Bishop David J. Walkowiak, was “grateful” to the administrators at West Catholic High School for standing by the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. “As a mission of the Catholic Church, Catholic schools are places where students come to learn and know the Church’s teachings, one of which is the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman,” the statement read. “For this reason, Catholic school administrators, teachers, or staff members that persist in public acts that are contrary to Catholic teachings disqualify themselves from the opportunity to continue in their leadership role within a Catholic school.” On Facebook, Nelson’s girlfriend, Maria Roberts, was critical of how the school treated her partner, saying that “this is not how God would treat someone.”“Your students will remember this, their parents will remember this,” Roberts wrote on Facebook. “The players will remember how you pushed away their coach, how you ripped a role model from their lives, how you made it clear that you may preach love but contradict yourself time and time again.”"

Two, that we really need to do a better job of being able to communicate what conditions and experiences our communities are facing.”Non-black politicians often try to explain issues black people are facing to them, Garza said. But it’s time for a change ― a reason for Black Futures Lab, created in partnership with Demos, Color of Change, Center for Third World Organizing, Socioanalitica Research and the Tides Foundation.Their first initiative is the Black Census Project, which the group said is the first large survey focusing on black lives in America in more than 150 years. The project aims to capture the range of issues black people are facing in their lives ― something the U.S. Census is limited in doing. Survey questions include such subjects as political attitudes and participation, organization affiliation, experiences with racism and police violence, perceptions of social movements, access to adequate health care and economic well being. “We really have a wide breadth of questions that we’re asking folks to tell us more about and the census doesn’t really do that,” Garza said. “There’s a lot of questions about what a census will be under the Trump administration and so, data is not neutral. Our data is also not neutral. We want to know about the full breadth of experiences that black folks are having, and we also are asking about our business and what it is we want to see happen in order to address the problems in our communities.”The project’s goal is 200,000 completed surveys before Aug. 1. In addition to an online survey, representatives will collect responses door to door. The Black Census Project will target 20 states, looking at urban and rural communities as well as neighborhoods with a high population of LGBTQ people, immigrants, and incarcerated people.“It’s time for a survey that really captures the experiences that black people are facing in these communities and it’s time to do that in a way that also captures the diversity of communities that black folks are living in,” Garza said. “We really want to capture the breadth and the complexity of who are communities are and we plan to use that information to influence decisions that are made about us.”"

In a meeting with executives from the aviation industry last year, the president called Dunkin a “smart guy” who “knows what’s going on.”“I have a pilot who’s a real expert,” Trump said.Dunkin was brought in for a preliminary conversation about the role.

Scott Walker (R) over his refusal to call special elections for two seats in the state legislature.In December, two Republican lawmakers ― an assemblyman and a state senator ― resigned to take jobs in the Walker administration. The governor has said he won’t call a special election for the vacant seats, leaving them to be filled in the regularly scheduled November election, in order to save the state money. The winners of those two races wouldn’t be seated until January of 2019, meaning voters in their districts will go over a year without representation.Democrats contend that Walker is delaying the vote in hopes of holding on to two GOP seats after Democrats unexpectedly won a January special election in a Wisconsin district that Donald Trump had carried handily in 2016.On Monday, the National Redistricting Foundation, an affiliate of the Eric Holder-chaired National Democratic Redistricting Committee, sued Walker on behalf of eight Wisconsin voters, saying they had a right to representation in the state legislature that the governor was blocking. The suit, filed in Dane County Circuit Court, asks a judge to order Walker to call special elections.Wisconsin law says a legislative vacancy that occurs before the second Tuesday in May of a regular election year “must be filled as promptly as possible by special election.” “Governor Walker’s improper refusal to issue writs of election ... as promptly as possible” is causing “substantial injury to Plaintiffs, who have been and will remain unrepresented,” the complaint says. Some 175,000 people are currently without their full voice in the state legislature.In January, Democrat Patty Schachtner won a special election for a state Senate seat in a district that Trump had won by 21 points in 2016. Walker said Schachtner’s victory was a ”wake-up call” for Republicans in Wisconsin.Amy Hasenberg, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the voters would get to elect new representatives this year and accused Democrats of trying to waste taxpayer money.“The Legislature will be adjourned for 2018 before these seats could be filled in special elections, and staff in these offices are working for constituents until new leaders are elected. Our decision is consistent with the law,” Hasenberg wrote in an email."

The duo is working on a television series inspired by the Me Too movement and Time’s Up initiative, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Lawrence reportedly let the news slip during a Friday appearance at The Wing, a women’s co-working space in New York City. “I wasn’t supposed to announce that but I am,” Lawrence told the crowd.HuffPost reached out to Lawrence and Sadler for comment but did not immediately hear back. Although Lawrence declined to expand on the series during her visit to The Wing, an insider told THR that the project will center around sexism in Hollywood in the wake of the Me Too movement that took the world by storm. Sadler and Lawrence reportedly looped in documentary filmmaker Stephanie Soechtig to direct the series.Both Lawrence and Sadler have been outspoken about the gender wage gap in Hollywood. In a 2015 essay for Lena Dunham’s Lenny Letter, Lawrence was candid about the pay inequity she’s faced and referenced the 2014 Sony hack in which it was revealed that the actress made less than her male co-stars in “American Hustle.” Sadler recently made waves in December when she suddenly quit her job at E! News after nearly a decade of working there. She explained on her website that she left after learning that her co-host, Jason Kennedy, “made close to double my salary for the past several years.”Two other TV series inspired by the Me Too movement recently hit the small screen. Actress Rose McGowan’s new docuseries about her life after the Me Too reckoning premiered on E! on Jan. 30.

Nassar served as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics and for several different sports teams on MSU’s campus. During this time, he sexually abused over 260 young girls and women under the guise of medical treatment. He recently received three concurrent sentences of 60 years, 40-125 years and 40-175 years in prison for child sexual abuse and child pornography. Several of Nassar’s victims say they reported the abuse to MSU coaches and trainers over the course of two decades, but their accusations were continually disregarded or swept under the rug. According to an investigative report from the Detroit News, at least 14 MSU representatives knew about Nassar’s abuse and failed to report it. According to the Education Department’s statement, the Office for Civil Rights is heading to East Lansing, Michigan, where the school is located, to join the Federal Student Aid team to begin the investigation. “I appreciated seeing acting President [John] Engler’s directive to the entire university to cooperate fully with our ― and with all ― inquiries into the university’s actions,” DeVos said. “We expect MSU’s full and complete disclosure about its actions to protect students from sexual assault.” MSU’s last president, Lou Anna K. Simon, resigned in January after 13 years in the role amid criticism that she did not do enough to stop Nassar’s abuse.In a statement to HuffPost, MSU’s vice president for communications and brand strategy, Heather Swain, said the university was notified last week of the Title IX investigation.“As we have been, MSU is cooperating fully with this and all investigations,” Swain said. “Our focus is on taking the actions that demonstrate the voices of the survivors have been heard and on creating a culture that provides a safe environment for all members of our community.” DeVos said the crimes Nassar committed are “unimaginable,” and went on to applaud the bravery of the dozens of survivors who spoke out against him. “The bravery shown by the survivors has been remarkable. My heart goes out to them as they have had to relive their horrific experiences and as they begin the long road to healing,” she said.“Every student across every campus should know that I am committed to ensuring all students have access to a learning environment free from sexual misconduct and discrimination and that all institutions that fall short will be held accountable for violations of federal law,” DeVos added.During Nassar’s sentencing hearings earlier this year, 265 survivors and family members read impact statements in court. Their statements were emotional, cathartic and powerful, taking the news cycle by storm. Many of the survivors called for investigations into MSU, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee for how poorly the organizations handled the accusations against Nassar. “I knew that he abused me. I reported it. Michigan State University had the audacity to tell me I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure,” survivor Amanda Thomashow said in her victim impact statement.
