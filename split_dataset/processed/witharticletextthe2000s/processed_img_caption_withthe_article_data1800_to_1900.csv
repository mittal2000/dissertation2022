But I don’t need a statistic to tell me what I experience nearly every single day. I am Muslim. I am Latina. And I am a woman. Each of these identities has shaped who I am – and also placed institutional and social limits on who I can become. I left South American for Virginia when I was 18 years-old. More than two decades later, I’m proud to be call Virginia my home – both my citizenship paperwork and in my heart. But despite Virginia’s iconic slogan, Virginia is not just for lovers. In fact, my beloved state is home to plenty of haters. These “haters” did not wake up on November 8, 2016 and suddenly decide to start discriminating against Latinos and other minority groups. America has a long history of oppression and racial violence – and progress towards alleviating past injustices has been slow at best. But in the past year, Donald Trump and his backers have empowered racists, xenophobes and white supremacists to come out of the shadows. He’s given them license to march down the streets of Charlottesville, brandishing torches, yelling hate-filled slogans. He’s given them a platform to vilify people of color and immigrants, and he’s used the power of his office to separate children from their parents and deprive young people of a path to citizenship in the only country they have ever called home. But the threats aren’t just in the White House, they’re here at home. The hateful lies and rhetoric in Washington have made their way to Virginia, where Republican candidate Ed Gillespie has echoed Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and white supremacist impulses. The gubernatorial candidate’s latest ad campaign – linking immigrants to gang violence – is a deliberate effort to demonize immigrants to score political points with his extremist supporters. For me, these attacks are not only morally offensive, but also deeply personal. English is not my first language, and my accent is a dead giveaway that I was not raised in this country. Perfecting my English vocabulary, pronunciation and grammar has been a long journey – and often a source of deep-seated anxiety. For example, just a few weeks ago, I gave a speech for United We Dream, advocating for the dignity and fair treatment of immigrant youth and their families. A group of white supremacist came on their bikes and one of them said that he could not understand me, heckled me and kept interrupting me to ask me where I was from and to say immigrants are criminals.I would like to run for office one day and this experience made me realize that is not going to be easy, but definitely not impossible. Situations like these make me a stronger defender of everyone’s rights. And by everyone, I mean everyone. As much as these haters would like to silence my voice – and the voices of thousands of immigrants across the Commonwealth – we must speak up louder than ever before. Because defending our rights and values starts with electing the right leaders. We have to take our struggle to the voting booth and elect leaders like Ralph Northam, Mark Herring and Justin Fairfax, who will stand firmly on the right side of history. These candidates will fight for a more inclusive Virginia and create opportunities for everyone – no matter your religion, ethnicity or country of origin. Despite what we’ve endured this year, I still believe Virginia is for lovers. This Tuesday, let’s make sure it stays that way.

I returned to work with the blessing of my physician with one important caveat ― I cannot allow my blood pressure to rise,” Mohn wrote in an email to staff. “Regretfully, the hypertension has returned to a dangerous level, and I have been instructed to take medical leave until my health returns to normal, at a minimum of four weeks.”Mohn has been handling the fallout from allegations against Michael Oreskes, NPR’s former senior vice president for news, who was accused by at least three women of sexual harassment, news first reported by The Washington Post. Two formal complaints against the editor were filed around 2015 and Mohn said Tuesday that Oreskes “was disciplined at the time for both incidents.”Other women have come forward with their own complaints in the past week, NPR reports.Oreskes, also the former editor of The New York Times’ Washington bureau, resigned his post last week.Mohn, in an interview with NPR’s Mary Louise Kelly, said he knew nothing about Oreskes’s previous behavior prior to the first formal complaint in 2015. He said the company addressed the situation immediately when it was first reported and “put him on notice that this could not occur.”“It was a terrible situation,” Mohn said. “I condemn his actions. They were unacceptable. They’re deplorable. We investigated. We did it immediately. We involved our HR department. We involved our general counsel.”But he acknowledged in his letter on Tuesday that he did not see a larger pattern or poor behavior.“In retrospect, I did not see the bigger pattern of poor judgement and unacceptable behavior,” Mohn wrote. “I am sorry, and I have learned from this.”He said the NPR board of directors was currently in the process of hiring a law firm to review the company’s “handling of this situation.”NPR COO Loren Mayor will fill in for Mohn during his absence."

Some of our colleagues were hit, though, thank God, many others managed to get out. Some were wounded by gunshots, falling glass and when they jumped from high floors.”During the attack, a special forces unit blasted a hole in the concrete wall around the compound and entered the site amid a crack of gunfire. At least one attacker was killed during the operation, while another was killed at the compound entrance.In a statement on its news agency Amaq, Islamic State claimed responsibility, without giving evidence. The group, based mainly in the eastern province of Nangarhar, has claimed a number of attacks on civilian targets in the Afghan capital.Shortly after the beginning of the attack, the Taliban’s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, issued an immediate denial of involvement.Suicide attacks have become a grimly familiar part of daily life in Kabul, now considered one of the most dangerous places in Afghanistan for civilians. But it was also the latest in a series targeting Afghan journalists and media workers.Last year a Taliban suicide bomber killed seven members of Afghanistan’s largest private television station, Tolo. In May, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on state broadcaster RTA in the eastern city of Jalalabad.Tuesday’s attack, which underlined the impression of chronic insecurity in Kabul, took place about three weeks after a series of attacks including one on a Shi’ite mosque in the city in which more than 50 people were killed.Shamshad TV halted normal programming during the attack, transmitting only a still image. But it resumed broadcasting after about two hours, saying the incident had ended and staff trapped in the building rescued by police."

It’s not conservative to expect to meet with a man without having him dangle his hotel key or ask you to sit on his lap while he has an erection.”Carlson, whose book on the issue of workplace harassment and assault was released last month, also wrote about the importance of turning outrage into action with bipartisan legislation. “I’m working with both parties to craft a bipartisan bill to take the secrecy out of sexual-harassment cases where women in the workplace have been forced to sign mandatory arbitration clauses,” she wrote. Since speaking out in June 2016 with allegations of sexual harassment against Roger Ailes (who died in May at the age of 77), Carlson has worked with Democrat Senators to testify against mandatory arbitration laws that force victims of workplace harassment or assault into closed-door settlements that very rarely go in favor of the victim, and that also force victims into silence. Carlson has been a vocal supporter of the Arbitration Fairness Act of 2017 that was introduced by Democrats back in March ― and she’s pushing to get Republicans to support the Act as well. “How ironic would it be if the Arbitration Fairness Act ended up on President Trump’s desk?” she wrote. Ultimately, Carlson emphasized the importance of women coming together ― regardless of political affiliation or professional industry ― to change the culture of pervasive sexual harassment and violence in this country. “I’m proud my case last year helped chart a course for the brave women who are now standing up and speaking out,” she wrote.“Now our challenge is to speak up together. To sustain the public’s focus on harassment, women must put aside our differences and collectively demand our basic rights. Change is possible.”Head over to Lenny Letter to read the full essay.

5,POLITICS,"Syria Vows To Sign Paris Agreement, Leaving U.S. Alone In Climate Denial",Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syria-paris-agreement_us_5a01b87fe4b0368a4e86ed4d,"Nicaragua, the other holdout, signed the deal last month in solidarity with nations already suffering from climate change.",2017-11-07,"Scott Pruitt, EPA administrator, spoke after President Trump made the statement that the United States is withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, in the Rose Garden of the White House, on June 1.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a01b9151400003001d7f381.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Syria took a break on Tuesday from its gruesome six-year civil war to announce plans to sign the Paris climate agreement, leaving the United States as the only country to reject the emissions-cutting deal. The announcement came at the 23rd Conference of the Parties in Bonn, Germany, the world’s biggest climate conference. The non-binding Paris accord, through which signatories pledge to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases over the coming decades, was brokered in 2015, when the annual conference was held in the French capital.The deal was considered historic because it was the first climate agreement to include the U.S. ― the world’s biggest historic emitter, with by far the largest per-capita carbon footprint ― and China, which currently produces the most carbon pollution on a national level. The U.S. took a lead role in shaping the deal.Only war-torn Syria and Nicaragua, which protested the agreement’s failure to impose strict demands on major polluters, refused to sign.But President Donald Trump, who rejects scientists’ warnings about climate change, announced plans to withdraw from the pact in June, insisting developing nations received more benefits and the U.S. got none. In his announcement ― which, under the terms of the deal, fully can’t go into effect until November 2020 ― Trump seemed to conflate the accord with a trade deal, demonstrating what was widely described as a poor understanding of how the Paris agreement actually works.“Like the playground bully that eventually loses all his friends, Donald Trump has isolated himself on the world stage,” Joe Ware, a spokesman for the charity Christian Aid, said in a statement. “When even Syria, with all its problems, can see the sense of a global climate agreement it really shows how ideologically wedded to climate denialism the US Republican Party has become.”In September ― the most active month on record for hurricanes in the Atlantic ― Nicaragua vowed to sign the agreement in solidarity with other nations already struggling with the effects of climate change, including more violent, less predictable storms and drought. The Central American nation made it official last month.The addition of Syria, whose strongman President Bashar Assad became de facto winner of the ongoing civil war in July as Trump ended U.S. support for rebel groups, makes his country look somewhat more stable, and offers a poetic recognition of a cause of the conflict. Beginning in 2006, Syria suffered its worst droughts in roughly 900 years, forcing as many as 1.5 million Syrians to move from the countryside to cities. The migration sowed some of the civil strife that boiled over into the pro-democracy protests that started the war. Some have called the conflict a “climate war.”Meanwhile, in the U.S., Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt last month proposed eliminating the Clean Power Plan, the only federal regulations aimed at reducing the country’s carbon footprint and bringing it in line with goals set in the Paris agreement. Pruitt also has vowed to host a red team-blue team debate on climate science, essentially giving the tiny minority of researchers who doubt overwhelming scientific evidence that global warming is man-made equal standing with scientists who accept the peer-reviewed conclusion. Burning fossil fuels, industrial farming and deforestation are rapidly increasing the amount of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, causing the planet to warm, according to 97 percent of peer-reviewed climate research. A research review published last November found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who concluded otherwise.Yet the U.S. delegation at this year’s COP 23 conference in Germany plans to advocate increased use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, and natural gas ― a major source of methane, which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide.“This discussion is a follow-up to the Administration’s success at the G20, where the United States expressed its support for helping countries meet their climate objectives through the use of cleaner and more efficient fossil fuels and other clean energy sources and technologies,” a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said in a statement to The New York Times last week. “It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone’s interest that they be efficient and clean."

Starbucks is launching an Italian café chain in the U.S., marking the first time in the brand’s history it will feature food baked onsite.Called Princi, the eatery has more than 100 menu items including Italian-style pastries, focaccia sandwiches, salads and pizzas, with all breads and baked items made in the store’s centerpiece oven. The first Princi location opened Tuesday at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Seattle, and the company has plans to expand shortly. Princi is a bakery chain with existing locations in Milan and London. In 2016, Starbucks announced it had struck a deal to bring it to the U.S., and will open Princi bakeries along with five more of its upscale Reserve locations around the world starting next month. The company said it plans to open standalone Princi bakeries around the U.S. in 2018.That means ’Bucks fiends will soon be able to enjoy wood-fired pizza, buffalo mozzarella and berry-filled tarts along with their coffee. Items are priced between $3 and $11.A couple of food bloggers who reviewed Princi’s offerings say the pizza is “beautiful” and the pastries are “flaky and buttery” in a way that makes your mouth “do a happy dance.” The spot has yet to see any Yelp feedback, though it’s surely coming. Earlier this year, Starbucks ended its “Starbucks Evenings” program, which featured beer, wine and appetizer-like bites served after 4 p.m. in some locations. The company is now starting to focus on lunch, USA Today reported in September. They’re currently offering new items like a hearty Cubano sandwich and cauliflower tabbouleh salad in select Chicago and Seattle stores, with plans to expand the menu across the U.S. in the future.This beats an egg bite any day."

That’s a rise of about 20 percent. The figures are based on final data for 2015 and provisional data for 2016.The figure for 2016′s fourth quarter topped what had been a record 19.9 overdose deaths per 100,000 people that the CDC had reported for the year’s third quarter.The number of Americans dying from drug overdoses is directly linked to the country’s opioid crisis: More than three out of five of the deaths involve an opioid, according to the CDC. Overdose deaths from opioids, whether through prescription or illicit use of the drugs, have more than quadrupled since 1999.  In raw numbers, more than 64,000 Americans died from drug overdoses last year, the CDC previously reported ― a greater number than from HIV or gun homicides in the worst years of those epidemics.President Donald Trump last month declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. But critics say Trump fell short by not declaring it a national emergency, which would have freed up billions of dollars in federal disaster relief funds. The public health emergency fund only has about $57,000 in it, according to officials.The president’s declaration could help secure federal grant money, which could be used to expand access to telemedicine services for addiction treatment and medication-based addiction treatments like buprenorphine. However, Trump’s repeated efforts to cut Medicaid benefits ― used by low-income people to get addiction treatment under the Affordable Care Act ― may hinder access to such services for vulnerable populations.Part of what’s behind the high rate of drug overdose deaths is the increased use of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, CDC experts told the New York Times. Deaths from fentanyl ― a drug 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine ― have more than doubled from 2015 to 2016. To fight the opioid epidemic, experts recommend setting up safe injection sites, which would allow drug users to consume drugs in a medically supervised environment. While such centers exist in dozens of cities across Europe and Canada, Seattle became the first city in the U.S. to approve such sites earlier this year.Other steps experts have proposed include equipping local emergency responders with Narcan, a drug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. “Death rates from opioid overdose will continue to rise until we implement a comprehensive strategy to reduce harms and expand treatment for opioid use disorder using effective medications,” Dr. Peter Friedmann, associate dean for research at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, told HuffPost in August."

15,ARTS & CULTURE,"As Trump's Scandals Mount, Filmmakers Gravitate Toward Short-Form Responses",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/short-films-in-trumps-america_us_5a006712e4b0baea263352c1,Artists are using nimble formats to comment on current events.,2017-11-07,"""Unpresidented"" is one short film made in response to Donald Trump's presidency.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a00bb4c1400002000d7f1a1.jpeg?cache=uif7lC6T82&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"In the year since Donald Trump’s election, American art has adopted barbed subtexts. Suddenly, so much of the popular culture we consume is a corollary to the social and political implications raised by the melodrama of the current administration. A Guardian headline from February: ”‘Get Out’: The First Great Paranoia Movie Of The Trump Era.” A Vanity Fair query from June: “Is ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ The Allegory Of The Trump Era?” A Washington Post proclamation from that same month: “Why Wonder Woman Is The Perfect Hero For The Trump Era.” A Variety digest from July: ”‘War For The Planet Of The Apes’ Cast On Trump Parallels: ‘It’s Unbelievable.’” An Uproxx offer from September: ”‘Battle Of The Sexes’ Directors Discuss If The Film Is Secretly About Hillary And Trump.” A Vulture summation, issued a mere six months after the inauguration: “We’re Reaching A Turning Point In Trump-Era Pop Culture.”As our president and his affiliates grow more scandal-ridden by the day, each of the aforementioned talking points remains intriguing and worthwhile. But they’re also convoluted: All of these projects were conceived long before Trump neared the White House, and most were filmed before he even clinched the Republican Party’s nomination last July. Their themes about racial inequality, gender divisions and immigration biases have been relevant for centuries, but even films and TV shows that have taken last-minute inspiration from our current political climate owe most of their conceptual ideologies to pre-Trumpian contexts. For the most part, we won’t have a clear picture of Hollywood’s artistic response to Trump until 2018 or even 2019, when the projects now in development and production come to fruition. (“American Horror Story: Cult,” which offers a flimsy parable about a country divided by post-election rifts, may be the closest we’ve come to a fictional response to the so-called Trump phenomenon. For comparison’s sake, the late-1970s Vietnam War movies “Apocalypse Now” and “The Deer Hunter” weren’t envisaged until nearly the end of the 20-year war. They opened a few years after the conflict concluded, sharpening their ability to respond to such a global tragedy.) But at least one medium has seen an immediate uptick in artists commenting on our polarizing current events: short films.“That’s where the shorts format can be most exciting, especially for documentary filmmakers,” Vimeo curator Ina Pira told HuffPost.A member of the five-person team that selects Vimeo’s coveted Staff Picks section, which can vault a video to varying degrees of internet fame, Pira has noticed that more of the platform’s recent submissions are political in nature, especially in the nonfiction and music-video realms. Some of the short videos Vimeo showcases are made in as quickly as a few months, or even a few days. Popular topics, she told HuffPost, include climate change, the aftermath of the election and Europe’s current refugee crisis.Timing is key. Unlike feature-length films, which often require two-plus years and hundreds of thousands (or millions) of dollars to make, short filmmakers can deliver commentary on current events while those events are still current, for comparatively little money. Similarly, sites like Vimeo and NoBudge, a free platform run by Brooklyn-based filmmaker Kentucker Audley, allow directors to skip the complex distribution models that only sometimes amount to widespread attention. Everyone longs for a snazzy Sundance premiere, but many of those movies struggle to find an audience beyond the insular festival circuit anyway. Instead, digital launchpads allow filmmakers to reach audiences quickly and cheaply. Audley pointed to a 14-minute fiction film called “Unpresidented” as an example of the dexterity privileged to short-form storytellers who don’t need the vast resources that most feature-length filmmakers require. “Unpresidented,” about a New Yorker’s attempt to justify his bet that Trump would win the election, premiered at last month’s New York Film Festival and screens at this week’s Nitehawk Shorts Festival in Brooklyn before launching on NoBudge by the year’s end. That’s an example of the synergy that’s become prevalent among the network of artists and curators making and supporting short-form content.Of course, not all of the political work in the short-film arena is so literal. In Audley’s eyes, stories that amplify the voices of groups most damaged by the administration’s rhetoric and policymaking can be just as potent; the word “Trump” is not required in order to resist the White House.“I don’t think you have to respond to the pinprick of President Trump for your film to resonate with a post-Trump world,” Audley said.At NoBudge, which typically houses unconventional, independently made shorts and feature films, most of the submissions Audley receives are not grounded in hard-boiled issues like those hosted on Vimeo or funded by the Tribeca Film Institute’s If/Then initiative, which issues grants for short documentaries that convey “diverse perspectives” of global proportions, according to producer Mridu Chandra. “Short films are not as culturally relevant in general as features,” Audley admitted. “I feel like people really don’t have that much exposure to short films in the mainstream.”When it comes to mainstream audience’s historic embrace of short films, Audley is right. In the early days of American moviegoing, the cost of admission included shorts and newsreels that would screen ahead of the headlining feature. Then the genre was sidelined to festivals, attended mostly by dedicated cinephiles, industry gatekeepers and high-brow types. Today, filmmakers are relying on internet platforms to foment a renewed appreciation for video pieces that run anywhere from two minutes to half an hour. Pira has noticed that comment boards on Vimeo’s topical shorts are more electrified than ever. Communities of likeminded individuals are engaging with material that finally speaks to the representation that corporate popular culture sometimes lacks, even if well-made movies like “Get Out” and shows like “The Handmaid’s Tale” are underscoring protracted social ills.Vimeo Staff Picks, especially, has become an anchor for work that finds broad recognition. “Best of Luck with the Wall,” a seven-minute project that used satellite images to sketch the overwhelming vastness of a potential fence dividing the United States and Mexico, racked up more than 1 million videos and was covered by news outlets like Salon, Splinter News and the Daily Mail. And “4.1 Miles,” a 21-minute snapshot of the European migrant crisis, landed on Vimeo and The New York Times’ website before earning an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary (Short Subject) earlier this year. “When the election happened, I think everybody’s priorities changed a little bit,” Eleanor Wilson, an Australian-born filmmaker living in New York, told HuffPost. “All of a sudden, it became a thing where it’s like, ‘Well, if I’m a person who’s putting a voice out into the world, I actually need to think about what it is that I truly want to say now.’ For me, it changed how I thought about storytelling a bit. If I’m going to go to all the trouble for making a film and finding financing, it’s either got to be extremely politically relevant or it’s gotta be a really good time.”Wilson does not have to “worry” about box-office revenue or other traditional benchmarks of cinematic success. She can deliver her work to hungry audiences with a few clicks of her keyboard. “It really opens up options for the audience when you can say, ‘Oh, this can just live online and that’s all it has to do,’” she said. “It doesn’t have to fit anybody else’s needs.”The fifth annual Nitehawk Shorts Festival will take place Nov. 7-12 in Brooklyn, New York. HuffPost is hosting a panel during the festival called “Why Shorts?”, which will be held on Nov. 9. For more on the festival, head to Nitehawk’s site."

Desiree Fairooz was scheduled to face trial for a second time next week, but a DOJ prosecutor entered a nolle prosequi filing in the case on Monday indicating the department is dismissing the charges. Fairooz, a retired children’s librarian and demonstrator affiliated with the organization Code Pink, let out a laugh during a Senate hearing back in January after Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said Sessions had a “clear and well-documented” record of “treating all Americans equally under the law.” (Sessions had faced strong opposition from civil rights organizations and was rejected as a federal judge in the 1980s over concerns about his past comments on race.)A rookie Capitol Police officer fresh out of the academy who had never made an arrest before nor covered a congressional hearing decided to take Fairooz into custody. Fairooz loudly objected. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, which prosecutes cases in both federal court and local D.C. Superior Court, pressed two charges against her.Fairooz was convicted at a jury trial in May, with members of the jury telling HuffPost that they were focused on her conduct as she was being led out of the courtroom after her arrest.“She did not get convicted for laughing. It was her actions as she was being asked to leave,” the jury foreperson told HuffPost after the verdict.But a judge tossed out the jury’s conviction in July, finding that prosecutors had improperly argued during the trial that “laughter is enough, standing alone,” to merit a conviction. D.C. Superior Court Chief Judge Robert Morin said he found it “disconcerting” that the government had explicitly argued during the trial that laughter in and of itself was enough for a guilty verdict. After Fairooz rejected a plea deal in which she would have pleaded guilty in exchange for a recommendation of time served, a prosecutor indicated at a hearing in September that the government planned to put her on trial yet again. This week, they reversed course. Fairooz said she was relieved. “The last 10 months of my life have been somewhat stressful facing trial and the possibility of jail time and a criminal conviction for a chortle so I am greatly relieved that I will not stand trial again,” Fairooz told HuffPost in a statement. “As activists, we cannot be deterred from speaking out against injustice, standing up for our constitutional rights and yes, laughing.”A spokeswoman for the attorney general declined to comment. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia said the office does not typically discuss decisions about charges and had no comment on the decision to dismiss the case against Fairooz. Taking Fairooz to trial for a second time would have put prosecutors in a bit of an uncomfortable spot. In tossing out the jury’s verdict, Judge Morin made clear that the government could not argue that laughter was enough to support a charge. That essentially meant that the government would be forced to concede as part of the case against Fairooz that Capitol Hill Police Officer Katherine Coronado was wrong to place Fairooz under arrest, but that Fairooz should face charges because she loudly objected to her wrongful arrest and made political statements as she was being escorted from the room.News of Fairooz’s prosecution went viral after it was first reported by HuffPost. The story sparked jokes by late-night comedians and attracted the attention of Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), who believed there were substantial questions about the application of the law in her case.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

After Fairooz rejected a plea deal in which she would have pleaded guilty in exchange for a recommendation of time served, a prosecutor indicated at a hearing in September that the government planned to put her on trial yet again. This week, they reversed course. Fairooz said she was relieved. “The last 10 months of my life have been somewhat stressful facing trial and the possibility of jail time and a criminal conviction for a chortle so I am greatly relieved that I will not stand trial again,” Fairooz told HuffPost in a statement. “As activists, we cannot be deterred from speaking out against injustice, standing up for our constitutional rights and yes, laughing.”A spokeswoman for the attorney general declined to comment. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia said the office does not typically discuss decisions about charges and had no comment on the decision to dismiss the case against Fairooz. Taking Fairooz to trial for a second time would have put prosecutors in a bit of an uncomfortable spot. In tossing out the jury’s verdict, Judge Morin made clear that the government could not argue that laughter was enough to support a charge. That essentially meant that the government would be forced to concede as part of the case against Fairooz that Capitol Hill Police Officer Katherine Coronado was wrong to place Fairooz under arrest, but that Fairooz should face charges because she loudly objected to her wrongful arrest and made political statements as she was being escorted from the room.News of Fairooz’s prosecution went viral after it was first reported by HuffPost. The story sparked jokes by late-night comedians and attracted the attention of Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), who believed there were substantial questions about the application of the law in her case.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

Va. ― A massive fire at a plastics recycling warehouse in Parkersburg, West Virginia, that rampaged for more than eight days is finally out. What remains of the International Import Export warehouse is 10 acres of hulking twisted metal, reminiscent of a war zone. Thick layers of ash, brick and metal hover more than head-high for several hundred yards along a semi-rural road just outside the city limits. Residents of this bustling Ohio River city of more than 30,000 people should be breathing a bit easier now that the fire is finally out ― but many don’t feel that way.“Our throats were burning,” said Jameeka Graham, 22, a lifetime Parkersburg resident. “It just smelt like it would be bad for us.”The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, a federal public health agency, reported late last week that the cough-inducing, chemical-tasting smoke that enveloped downtown and many other parts of the city was moderately high in small particles of carbon, similar to a wildfire. But the ATSDR said the towering clouds of smoke did not contain significant levels of the toxic chemicals that burning plastics can emit, such as cyanide and formaldehyde, that could have long-term health impacts.Camden Clark Medical Center, the city’s hospital, reported about 100 cases of suspected smoke inhalation during the weeklong fire. Director of Emergency Services Susan Abdella said the hospital handed out hundreds of free surgical masks after county health officials warned about about air quality conditions for anyone with respiratory ailments and people who worked outside. The hospital is also planning to follow up with free pulmonary assessments for first responders and community residents later this month. Graham said many residents who came to the west Parkersburg Mexican restaurant where she works were wearing the masks.“They had canceled every building downtown government-wise. Everybody was off work for that week,” said Graham. “So it had to be more serious than what they were saying.”On top of lingering air quality concerns, another question looms: why state regulators allowed operations to continue at multiple sites owned by the same company, despite the repeated warnings and fines for water quality and fire code violations.Stephen Mohwish, who owns a bar about three blocks north of the burn site, says he has made numerous complaints about another one of the company’s warehouses across the street, but heard nothing back from state officials. “This is what we was breathing,” said Mohwish, holding out two blackened air filters he replaced at his bar after the fire. “That’s what we was breathing all week. I think the DEP [West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection] and EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] both should have monitored the facility better than what they did.” The DEP has no record of Mohwish complaints ― or anyone else’s ― about the facilities, said West Virginia Department of Military and Public Services public information officer Lawrence Messina.But those allegations should have triggered an investigation from both the state DEP and the EPA under the Right-To-Know program, part of a federal law that provides workers and communities the right to know what chemicals are being used in their vicinity. The program requires businesses operating with hazardous substances on site to submit annual reports of their chemical stockpiles to both state and federal agencies. They are also required to alert local emergency responders.The Naik family has operated the International Import Export warehouse since 2004. Saurabd Naik of Maryland owns the parent company, SirNaik. International Import Export and another subsidiary, Polymer Alliance Services, operate several other warehouses in the Parkersburg area. Naik’s son, Sonny Naik, was in Parkersburg during the fire and attended some of the public meetings. When HuffPost finally reached him for comment on Sunday, Naik responded to questions with only “do some research,” and then hung up the phone.Messina said no hazardous chemical inventory reports have any been filed for any of the warehouses the family owns. The West Virginia DEP had inspected the IEI warehouse multiple times between 2011 and 2017. In 2015, DEP fined the owners more than $80,000 for violations to water quality under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program, a federal program the EPA oversees that regulates the discharge of pollutants into waterways. On the day the fire started, more than $60,000 of those fines had yet to be paid.Even well before then, in 2008, two Wood County volunteer fire chiefs ― one a West Virginia assistant fire marshal ― wrote a letter to the agency overseeing state fire marshals that detailed concerns about fire code violations at a different facility owned by the Naik family south of Parkersburg. They said the site was inaccessible to firefighters, citing plastics stacked so high that sprinkler systems were rendered ineffective. And they warned that conditions at the Parkersburg facility that caught fire last month raised similar concerns.The fire began at about 12:30 a.m. on Oct. 21 in the sprawling complex of aging warehouses on Camden Avenue just outside the Parkersburg city limits.According to state DEP records, thousands of tons of shredded sheet- and pellet plastics, along with rusting drums of unknown chemicals, were stored both inside and outside of the warehouse. County Commissioner President David Blair Couch arrived at the scene early Oct. 22 to find the entire structure in flames. “So I stand and look up and the smoke’s over me and I’m maybe less than a hundred yards from the flames,” said Couch. “And I don’t have a sense, I mean, of the humongousness of it. It’s hard to gauge.”Couch spent most of the next week on the site, as volunteer and paid firefighters from around the county battled the blaze. By 3 p.m. the afternoon Oct. 22, Couch says, it was clear the men and women battling the blaze weren’t making headway.“They were pouring water, approximately 6 million gallons on the first day,” said Couch. “They had the Marietta fire boat come down the Little Kanawha River behind the property and provided a pump out of the river boat and ran 10-inch hoses from the river.”But that still wasn’t enough. Couch decided it was time to call in a team of contractors from the city of Washington, Pennsylvania, about two hours away. The contractors from SPSI, a private firm that specializes in hazardous material emergency response, estimated it would take up to two weeks to put out the fire and their services would run between $65,000 and $75,000 per day. Couch hired them after the governor’s office said the state could reimburse the county for the costs. Experts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were also on site to help forecast weather conditions, which helped the county health department determine which neighborhoods the smoke would most affect. There were also three contractors working for the EPA on site taking air quality readings, as well as an EPA “sniffer” plane, which can sample air directly over a fire, taking aerial air quality readings. County commissioners also hired a private firm from Arkansas to assess long-term air quality. Eight and a half days and nearly $2 million dollars later, the fire was declared out.Couch said his anger is mostly directed at the warehouse owners, who failed to take responsibility, even while the fire was raging. Company owner Saurabd Naik was out of the country at the time, and his son only occasionally showed up at public meetings, said Couch. When he did, he seemed more concerned about the company’s liability for the costs the county was incurring to fight the fire than about the impacts to public health and safety, Couch said.“They’ve shown me nothing,” said Couch. “They haven’t walked in here with one single check, or a box of doughnuts, or ‘Here, we’re putting money in an escrow account to make the county whole.’”The West Virginia DEP has given the company until the end of the day on Monday to submit a plan for environmental cleanup of the burn site. Messina said the state DEP is not ruling out any regulatory options, including going to court, to ensure compliance with its orders and regulatory requirements, but they are focused on continuing the dialogue with the company to reach an agreement. But that doesn’t satisfy some Parkersburg residents, including Stephen Mohwish.“I would really like to see him closed down and out of this community,” said Mohwish. “I don’t like to see these chemical things being stored right in my hometown.”"

Polling suggests the race is very close.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a00b0c61d00003b007f464e.jpeg?cache=53pMxeZY1o&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In Virginia’s gubernatorial race on Tuesday, the Democratic Party has a chance to score its first major political win since President Donald Trump’s election.Many Democrats worry, however, that the party is going to blow what once seemed like a made-to-order opportunity.A victory for Democrat Ralph Northam, the current lieutenant governor, would provide the restive party a much-needed dose of optimism. But the consequences of a win by Republican Ed Gillespie, an inveterate Beltway power broker, would have reverberations far beyond Tuesday. It would signal to Republicans, once wary of Trump’s toxicity, that wielding his brand of right-wing populism is a winning strategy ― even in a state with a popular Democratic governor that Hillary Clinton carried by a 5-percentage-point margin in the 2016 presidential election.“It will be incredibly demoralizing,” said Yasmin Taeb, a Virginia Democratic National Committee member who has been volunteering for Northam’s campaign.Taeb, who organized many of the Washington-based protests against Trump’s ban on travel from majority-Muslim countries, frets that a Northam loss could dull the enthusiasm of many of the people inspired to become politically active by the president’s election.“If they feel as though they’ve been showing up since January, and it ends up not paying off on Nov. 7, I’m worried that we’ll see a lot of folks dropping off,” she said.And that could hurt Democrats in other states in the 2018 midterm elections, in which the party hopes that anti-Trump fervor will propel it to gains. If Northam loses, it will not be because of a lack of investment from state and national Democrats. His campaign had raised nearly $34 million as of the end of October, including some $7 million from the Democratic Governors Association. Gillespie, by contrast, had raised $24.5 million, of which some $10 million came from the Republican Governors Association.The DNC also spent $1.5 million to help elect Northam and other Democratic candidates in the state. The Republican National Committee has spent $5 million to boost Republicans up and down the ballot.The net result is a race where Northam and Gillespie are neck-and-neck. In RealClearPolitics’ average of major polls, Northam leads by 3.3 percentage points ― a sum within the margin of statistical error in most surveys. Rather than suggesting a clear favorite in the race, the polling underscores a high level of uncertainty ahead of Tuesday’s results. Recent surveys have shown wildly disparate figures ― one poll showed a 17-point lead for the Democrat, another an 8-point advantage for his rival. Reasons for the disparity likely include differences in methodology and in estimates of who is likely to turn out.Every statewide candidate officially runs independently in Virginia. But Northam is part of a de facto joint Democratic ticket with Justin Fairfax, running for lieutenant governor, and Attorney General Mark Herring, who is up for re-election. If elected, Fairfax, a 38-year-old attorney from the Washington suburb of Annandale, would be Virginia’s second black statewide elected official. (The first, Democrat Douglas Wilder, served as governor from 1990-1994.)As a candidate, Northam, a 58-year-old pediatric neurologist, has emphasized his all-American biography and career. Born and raised on Virginia’s rural Eastern Shore, he graduated from the Virginia Military Institute and worked as an Army doctor during Operation Desert Storm before building a successful medical practice in the Hampton Roads region of southeast Virginia.Northam has a long history as a moderate Democrat. He has admitted to voting for George W. Bush in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections ― votes he has said he regrets and attributes to his political inattentiveness at the time. As a state senator in 2009, Northam flirted with switching parties, and during his 2011 re-election bid, he described health care as a “privilege.”Northam’s past stances and initial reluctance to make the race a referendum on Trump prompted a robust primary challenge from former Rep. Tom Perriello. Perriello’s backers included Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as well as Our Revolution, the legacy organization from Sanders’ presidential campaign. Northam, who had the support of virtually every elected Democrat in Virginia, responded by revving up his anti-Trump rhetoric and tacking to the left on several economic issues. He ended up handily defeating Perriello in June.In the general election, Northam has run on a relatively mainstream Democratic platform, including protecting women’s reproductive rights, using Affordable Care Act funds to expand Medicaid in the state, continuing to restore the voting rights of felons who have completed their sentences and increasing public education funding. He has touted the state’s strong economic performance under his and Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s leadership. And he has proposed providing free tuition for two years of community college or trade school in high-demand fields like information technology and health care, so long as the people who get their degrees commit to a year of public service of some kind. Perhaps most of all, Northam has sought to appeal to widespread disdain for Trump in Virginia ― where, according to one recent poll, just 34 percent of residents approve of the job the president is doing.But at times, Northam has appeared to be straining to appease all sides of the political spectrum. He puzzled observers with an ad promising that if Trump, the man Northam once called a “narcissistic maniac,” is “helping Virginia, I’ll work with him.” And last week, he said that as governor he would sign legisation banning “sanctuary cities” ― municipalities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. His comment dismayed progressives, and prompted one group to call his stance “gutless” and “racist.”The flap shifted scarce media and activist attention to an internecine dispute in the final days before the election, and prompted hand-wringing about whether Northam was a strong candidate.“If Northam loses, the progressive left says, ‘Perriello would have won because he would have run as a progressive populist and that’s what the base of Democratic Party is yearning for right now,’” said Quentin Kidd, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia.Gillespie, 56, a former RNC chairman and longtime corporate lobbyist who grew up in New Jersey, personifies the kind of pro-business establishment Republican who is increasingly rare in national politics. As a GOP official and onetime White House aide to George W. Bush, Gillespie pushed the party to become more welcoming to people of color and backed comprehensive immigration reform that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.Right-wing populist and Trump campaign veteran Corey Stewart waged a nasty primary challenge against Gillespie fueled largely by promises to crack down on undocumented immigrants and safeguard Virginia’s Confederate monuments and heritage. Stewart even adopted a Trump-like epithet for Gillespie, deriding him as “Establishment Ed.” Gillespie ultimately prevailed, but by a shockingly close margin of just one percentage point.Gillespie responded to the near-fatal populist challenge by doing his utmost to shore up the rural right-wing base that turned out for Stewart.On the campaign trail, Gillespie has stuck to traditional, fiscally conservative Republican talking points. The heart of his platform is a proposal to cut Virginia income taxes by 10 percent across the board, one of several policies he argues will jump-start the state’s economic growth.But on the airwaves, Gillespie has launched a scorched-earth campaign to paint Northam as an enabler of sexual predators and gangs of undocumented immigrants. In ads rife with racial overtones that began in September, Gillespie argued that policies embraced by his opponent have allowed the El Salvadoran gang MS-13 to run amok in Virginia.Gillespie’s ads also have said that Northam, as governor, would try to strip Virginia of its Confederate history ― something the Republican stresses he won’t do.Given Gillespie’s decision to pander to Virginia’s white-resentment-fueled right wing, a victory for him will again show Republicans that racial fear-mongering is a winning electoral strategy, said Kidd, the political science professor.“Ironically, Republicans have criticized Democrats for two decades at least for running identity political campaigns, but Republicans ran what has by and large been an identity politics campaign with a little economic populism mixed in,” Kidd said. “If Gillespie wins it might mark another front in the culture wars in which Republicans embrace white identity politics.”Indeed, other Republican candidates across the country are attacking Democrats by tying their policies to gang violence.A Gillespie victory would almost certainly magnify that effect because it would occur in Virginia, “the place where [Trump] lost,” said Christian Dorsey, a Democrat on the Arlington County, Virginia, board of supervisors.Of course, the most concrete impact of a Republican victory would be in the Old Dominion State itself, where McAuliffe has stood as a self-described “brick wall” between Virginians and the socially conservative policies of the Republican-controlled legislature ― particularly efforts to curb women’s reproductive rights. He has vetoed more bills than any governor in Virginia’s history, stymieing legislation that would have defunded Planned Parenthood, restricted voting rights and expanded access to handguns.For Virginia Democrats, their neighboring state of North Carolina, where a Republican governor passed an infamous “bathroom bill” barring transgender residents from using the public restrooms of their choice, offers a frightening look at what life under unified GOP control could look like. (Following the election of a Democratic governor last year, the state repealed the law.)“I look at North Carolina and everything that’s happened there and I say, ‘There but by the grace of God goes Virginia,’” said Atima Omara, president of the Young Democrats of America and a DNC member.In addition, a Democratic loss at the top of the ticket would likely extinguish all hope of making major gains in the Virginia House of Delegates (no state Senate seats are on the ballot). Democrats, who recruited their largest number of House candidates in recent memory, are running in 17 GOP-held districts where Clinton won in 2016. Winning all 17 seats, though unlikely, would hand them control of the legislative chamber.Even a narrower victory for Northam than had been hoped for could limit the Democratic pickups, said Taeb, the Northam volunteer.If Democrats can pick up “6 to 8 seats, I would count it as a success,” she said.But the implications of a Gillespie win extend well beyond the single four-year term to which he would be limited. During his last year in office in 2021, after the 2020 census, Gillespie would have the power to sign legislation redrawing Virginia’s congressional and state legislative districts for another decade. And partisan gerrymandering is a Gillespie specialty. He helped oversee the GOP’s nationwide push to win control of state legislatures for the express purpose of redrawing political boundaries after the 2010 census to benefit the party. The severely gerrymandered districts that came out of that effort have handed Republicans nearly an unshakable hold on the U.S. House of Representatives and resulted in a net gain of hundreds of state legislative seats.A Democratic governor could, by contrast, veto a Virginia redistricting plan offered by the Republicans and use the “bully pulpit” to inveigh against efforts to unduly favor the GOP, Dorsey said.Omara of the Young Democrats of America remains “optimistic” that Virginia’s increasingly diverse demographics, disapproval of Trump and significantly stronger turnout in the primary bode well for Northam. But some people forget that Virginia is still a swing state that elected a Republican governor as recently as 2009, she added. “We are a good reflection of what the country looks like,” Omara said. “We are a purple state. We have to fight for every vote.”Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting."

If elected, Fairfax, a 38-year-old attorney from the Washington suburb of Annandale, would be Virginia’s second black statewide elected official. (The first, Democrat Douglas Wilder, served as governor from 1990-1994.)As a candidate, Northam, a 58-year-old pediatric neurologist, has emphasized his all-American biography and career. Born and raised on Virginia’s rural Eastern Shore, he graduated from the Virginia Military Institute and worked as an Army doctor during Operation Desert Storm before building a successful medical practice in the Hampton Roads region of southeast Virginia.Northam has a long history as a moderate Democrat. He has admitted to voting for George W. Bush in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections ― votes he has said he regrets and attributes to his political inattentiveness at the time. As a state senator in 2009, Northam flirted with switching parties, and during his 2011 re-election bid, he described health care as a “privilege.”Northam’s past stances and initial reluctance to make the race a referendum on Trump prompted a robust primary challenge from former Rep. Tom Perriello. Perriello’s backers included Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as well as Our Revolution, the legacy organization from Sanders’ presidential campaign. Northam, who had the support of virtually every elected Democrat in Virginia, responded by revving up his anti-Trump rhetoric and tacking to the left on several economic issues. He ended up handily defeating Perriello in June.In the general election, Northam has run on a relatively mainstream Democratic platform, including protecting women’s reproductive rights, using Affordable Care Act funds to expand Medicaid in the state, continuing to restore the voting rights of felons who have completed their sentences and increasing public education funding. He has touted the state’s strong economic performance under his and Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s leadership. And he has proposed providing free tuition for two years of community college or trade school in high-demand fields like information technology and health care, so long as the people who get their degrees commit to a year of public service of some kind. Perhaps most of all, Northam has sought to appeal to widespread disdain for Trump in Virginia ― where, according to one recent poll, just 34 percent of residents approve of the job the president is doing.But at times, Northam has appeared to be straining to appease all sides of the political spectrum. He puzzled observers with an ad promising that if Trump, the man Northam once called a “narcissistic maniac,” is “helping Virginia, I’ll work with him.” And last week, he said that as governor he would sign legisation banning “sanctuary cities” ― municipalities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. His comment dismayed progressives, and prompted one group to call his stance “gutless” and “racist.”The flap shifted scarce media and activist attention to an internecine dispute in the final days before the election, and prompted hand-wringing about whether Northam was a strong candidate.“If Northam loses, the progressive left says, ‘Perriello would have won because he would have run as a progressive populist and that’s what the base of Democratic Party is yearning for right now,’” said Quentin Kidd, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia.Gillespie, 56, a former RNC chairman and longtime corporate lobbyist who grew up in New Jersey, personifies the kind of pro-business establishment Republican who is increasingly rare in national politics. As a GOP official and onetime White House aide to George W. Bush, Gillespie pushed the party to become more welcoming to people of color and backed comprehensive immigration reform that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.Right-wing populist and Trump campaign veteran Corey Stewart waged a nasty primary challenge against Gillespie fueled largely by promises to crack down on undocumented immigrants and safeguard Virginia’s Confederate monuments and heritage. Stewart even adopted a Trump-like epithet for Gillespie, deriding him as “Establishment Ed.” Gillespie ultimately prevailed, but by a shockingly close margin of just one percentage point.Gillespie responded to the near-fatal populist challenge by doing his utmost to shore up the rural right-wing base that turned out for Stewart.On the campaign trail, Gillespie has stuck to traditional, fiscally conservative Republican talking points. The heart of his platform is a proposal to cut Virginia income taxes by 10 percent across the board, one of several policies he argues will jump-start the state’s economic growth.But on the airwaves, Gillespie has launched a scorched-earth campaign to paint Northam as an enabler of sexual predators and gangs of undocumented immigrants. In ads rife with racial overtones that began in September, Gillespie argued that policies embraced by his opponent have allowed the El Salvadoran gang MS-13 to run amok in Virginia.Gillespie’s ads also have said that Northam, as governor, would try to strip Virginia of its Confederate history ― something the Republican stresses he won’t do.Given Gillespie’s decision to pander to Virginia’s white-resentment-fueled right wing, a victory for him will again show Republicans that racial fear-mongering is a winning electoral strategy, said Kidd, the political science professor.“Ironically, Republicans have criticized Democrats for two decades at least for running identity political campaigns, but Republicans ran what has by and large been an identity politics campaign with a little economic populism mixed in,” Kidd said. “If Gillespie wins it might mark another front in the culture wars in which Republicans embrace white identity politics.”Indeed, other Republican candidates across the country are attacking Democrats by tying their policies to gang violence.A Gillespie victory would almost certainly magnify that effect because it would occur in Virginia, “the place where [Trump] lost,” said Christian Dorsey, a Democrat on the Arlington County, Virginia, board of supervisors.Of course, the most concrete impact of a Republican victory would be in the Old Dominion State itself, where McAuliffe has stood as a self-described “brick wall” between Virginians and the socially conservative policies of the Republican-controlled legislature ― particularly efforts to curb women’s reproductive rights. He has vetoed more bills than any governor in Virginia’s history, stymieing legislation that would have defunded Planned Parenthood, restricted voting rights and expanded access to handguns.For Virginia Democrats, their neighboring state of North Carolina, where a Republican governor passed an infamous “bathroom bill” barring transgender residents from using the public restrooms of their choice, offers a frightening look at what life under unified GOP control could look like. (Following the election of a Democratic governor last year, the state repealed the law.)“I look at North Carolina and everything that’s happened there and I say, ‘There but by the grace of God goes Virginia,’” said Atima Omara, president of the Young Democrats of America and a DNC member.In addition, a Democratic loss at the top of the ticket would likely extinguish all hope of making major gains in the Virginia House of Delegates (no state Senate seats are on the ballot). Democrats, who recruited their largest number of House candidates in recent memory, are running in 17 GOP-held districts where Clinton won in 2016. Winning all 17 seats, though unlikely, would hand them control of the legislative chamber.Even a narrower victory for Northam than had been hoped for could limit the Democratic pickups, said Taeb, the Northam volunteer.If Democrats can pick up “6 to 8 seats, I would count it as a success,” she said.But the implications of a Gillespie win extend well beyond the single four-year term to which he would be limited. During his last year in office in 2021, after the 2020 census, Gillespie would have the power to sign legislation redrawing Virginia’s congressional and state legislative districts for another decade. And partisan gerrymandering is a Gillespie specialty. He helped oversee the GOP’s nationwide push to win control of state legislatures for the express purpose of redrawing political boundaries after the 2010 census to benefit the party. The severely gerrymandered districts that came out of that effort have handed Republicans nearly an unshakable hold on the U.S. House of Representatives and resulted in a net gain of hundreds of state legislative seats.A Democratic governor could, by contrast, veto a Virginia redistricting plan offered by the Republicans and use the “bully pulpit” to inveigh against efforts to unduly favor the GOP, Dorsey said.Omara of the Young Democrats of America remains “optimistic” that Virginia’s increasingly diverse demographics, disapproval of Trump and significantly stronger turnout in the primary bode well for Northam. But some people forget that Virginia is still a swing state that elected a Republican governor as recently as 2009, she added. “We are a good reflection of what the country looks like,” Omara said. “We are a purple state. We have to fight for every vote.”Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting."
22,POLITICS,Democrats Are Terrified Of Losing Virginia's Big Election. They Should Be.,Daniel Marans and Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-terrified-of-losing-virginia-governor-race_us_5a00afe6e4b0c96530017bfd,A loss in a state won by Hillary Clinton would be a major blow for the party.,2017-11-06,Ed Gillespie survived a tougher-than-expected primary challenge to emerge as the Republican gubernatorial nominee in Virginia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a00b1681700002c017961a7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In Virginia’s gubernatorial race on Tuesday, the Democratic Party has a chance to score its first major political win since President Donald Trump’s election.Many Democrats worry, however, that the party is going to blow what once seemed like a made-to-order opportunity.A victory for Democrat Ralph Northam, the current lieutenant governor, would provide the restive party a much-needed dose of optimism. But the consequences of a win by Republican Ed Gillespie, an inveterate Beltway power broker, would have reverberations far beyond Tuesday. It would signal to Republicans, once wary of Trump’s toxicity, that wielding his brand of right-wing populism is a winning strategy ― even in a state with a popular Democratic governor that Hillary Clinton carried by a 5-percentage-point margin in the 2016 presidential election.“It will be incredibly demoralizing,” said Yasmin Taeb, a Virginia Democratic National Committee member who has been volunteering for Northam’s campaign.Taeb, who organized many of the Washington-based protests against Trump’s ban on travel from majority-Muslim countries, frets that a Northam loss could dull the enthusiasm of many of the people inspired to become politically active by the president’s election.“If they feel as though they’ve been showing up since January, and it ends up not paying off on Nov. 7, I’m worried that we’ll see a lot of folks dropping off,” she said.And that could hurt Democrats in other states in the 2018 midterm elections, in which the party hopes that anti-Trump fervor will propel it to gains. If Northam loses, it will not be because of a lack of investment from state and national Democrats. His campaign had raised nearly $34 million as of the end of October, including some $7 million from the Democratic Governors Association. Gillespie, by contrast, had raised $24.5 million, of which some $10 million came from the Republican Governors Association.The DNC also spent $1.5 million to help elect Northam and other Democratic candidates in the state. The Republican National Committee has spent $5 million to boost Republicans up and down the ballot.The net result is a race where Northam and Gillespie are neck-and-neck. In RealClearPolitics’ average of major polls, Northam leads by 3.3 percentage points ― a sum within the margin of statistical error in most surveys. Rather than suggesting a clear favorite in the race, the polling underscores a high level of uncertainty ahead of Tuesday’s results. Recent surveys have shown wildly disparate figures ― one poll showed a 17-point lead for the Democrat, another an 8-point advantage for his rival. Reasons for the disparity likely include differences in methodology and in estimates of who is likely to turn out.Every statewide candidate officially runs independently in Virginia.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a00b3d41d00001a3d7f4651.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Black civic and faith leaders in St. Louis are calling for the community to boycott a dozen local businesses months after the acquittal of the white cop who fatally shot Anthony Lamar Smith.The group No Justice No Profit announced the protest of Target, regional grocery store chain Schnucks Markets, the St. Louis Galleria (where protests have taken place in the past) and other stores Thursday during a news conference, The Associated Press reported.Rev. Dinah Tatman said that black people are subject to excessive force by police, more likely to be criminalized for minor infractions and given longer sentences. Tatman also noted several racial disparities around economic growth and voting rights that block black communities’ voices in elections. “As Main Street America enjoys social and economic prosperity, our community continues to erode, causing intense strain on our family structure and resulting in high unemployment rates and wanton incarceration of our black men,” she said during the news conference.Organizers at the conference said that they’ve named some of these businesses due to their alleged discrimination against black workers or customers. The group lists Target, which has 18 stores in the city, because of a 2013 legal dispute that allowed the company to use Rosa Parks’ name and image on its merchandise. In a statement to AP, Target said that the lawsuit “was without merit and was dismissed” and that it works hard to “demonstrate inclusivity.”Schnucks Markets, which has 60 stores in the area, is listed because of the major contributions it made to Republican candidates and for allegedly abandoning low-income communities. In a press release, the company said it was “surprised and disappointed” to be included in the boycott, saying that it has customers and employees “from across the demographic spectrum.” The boycott comes two months after a judge acquitted former St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley in the 2011 killing of Smith, a black man. The decision sparked outrage among community members, who held protests demanding racial equality. Tatum said Thursday that some “strategic” protests are planned as the holiday shopping season approaches. “We pay taxes ... We spend our dollars in other communities, other venues, and we have not received an equitable return for those monies that we have invested,” Tatman said, per the St. Louis Dispatch. “We’re now taking our money and investing in ourselves.”Watch the full press conference below."

Paul LePage (R), who vetoed five bills to extend health care to more Mainers.",2017-11-06,Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) is leading the opposition to expanding Medicaid in his state.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a009b9f1d00003b007f45f9.jpeg?cache=Yu6K2QJ7AY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Maine voters will decide at the polls Tuesday whether the Pine Tree State will join 31 states and the District of Columbia in expanding Medicaid to more low-income adults under the Affordable Care Act.If the ballot initiative ― Question 2 ― to establish the expansion passes, it would mark a major win for progressive health care activists, the state’s hospital industry and, most of all, the estimated 70,000 Mainers who would gain health coverage as a result. A vote to expand Medicaid ― known as MaineCare in the state ― also would serve as a rebuke to Gov. Paul LePage (R), who is leading the opposition to the initiative after having vetoed bipartisan Medicaid expansion bills five times since 2013.The opportunity for Maine voters to expand health care coverage to so many people ― more than the population of the state’s largest city, Portland ― stands in stark contrast to the national movement to repeal the Affordable Care Act, spearheaded by President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Congress, that would result in millions losing health benefits. Success in Maine would signal that some voters, at least, want to move in the other direction.“Too many people lack access to health care, and this provides a solution. It’ll make our health care system more fair, so it’ll increase access to people who are currently going without the health care they need,” said Robyn Merrill, executive director of Maine Equal Justice Partners, a legal aid organization based in the capital city of Augusta. Merrill also is a spokeswoman representing Mainers for Health Care, a broad coalition of organizations that won a place on the ballot for Medicaid expansion.“We can’t afford to wait any longer, and it’s already just such a shame that we’ve lost out on several billion dollars of new federal funds and the opportunity to cover thousands of people,” Merrill said. Mainers for Health Care is joined in support of the Medicaid expansion by dozens of groups, including the Maine Hospital Association, Maine Medical Association and Maine State Nurses Association, as well as the state chapters of national organizations such as the American College of Physicians and the American Nurses Association.LePage and several of his closest political allies founded a political action committee called Welfare to Work to fight the Medicaid expansion ballot initiative. The PAC didn’t respond to a request for comment sent to the contact form on its website.As written, the Affordable Care Act called for a nationwide expansion of Medicaid eligibility to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 for a single person and $33,000 for a family of four. Prior to the 2010 law, poor adults without children living at home or who didn’t have a disability mostly were excluded from Medicaid, no matter how little they earned. The federal government pays at least 90 percent of the costs of expanded Medicaid, compared to a little over half of the program’s costs for other categories of enrollees, including pregnant women, children and people with disabilities. But in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that states ― which jointly operate and finance Medicaid with the federal government ― could opt out of the expansion. Nineteen states including Maine ― all with Republican governors, GOP-majority legislatures or both ― have refused to take up the expansion.As a consequence, there are an estimated 2.5 million people ineligible for help getting health coverage ― in some cases because they’re too poor. Because Congress intended the Medicaid expansion to be national, the Affordable Care Act’s subsidies for private health insurance are only available to people who earn more than the federal poverty level, which is about $12,000. People in non-expansion states who make more than that can get coverage from the law’s health insurance exchanges. But those whose wages are less than poverty get nothing and live in what’s called the “Medicaid gap” or “coverage gap.”“We work with people and talk with people every day who fall into the coverage gap,” Merrill said. Mainers for Health Care started gathering signatures on Election Day last year to get Medicaid expansion on the ballot and obtained nearly enough that first day to meet the minimum threshold. Expansion supporters eventually collected 66,000 signatures.The original plan was to use the threat of a popular vote on Medicaid to pressure holdout legislators to support a bill to achieve the same result so that the measure could achieve a veto-proof supermajority, Merrill said. But organizers changed course and decided to press forward with the ballot initiative, partly because of the national debate on scaling back the Affordable Care Act, she said.The primary arguments expansion backers make start with the benefits of expanding coverage to low-income Mainers, but they also emphasize that the influx of federal dollars could help shore up the finances of vulnerable rural hospitals in the state and stimulate the local economy. Evidence from other expansion states indicates the policy creates all three of those effects. Other research has shown that private health insurance premiums are lower in states that expanded Medicaid because fewer people with costly health problems are in the same pool as other private insurance customers.LePage’s opposition to Medicaid expansion is mostly ideological and, as governor, he’s implemented or proposed a number of policies to actually limit the availability of Medicaid coverage and shrink the program’s rolls.Regarding the ballot initiative, LePage has warned that the state can’t afford its share of the expense. “They’re going to be getting it free from the state of Maine. But free is very expensive to you, the taxpayer,” he said during a recent interview with Presque Isle-based TV station WAGM.But LePage’s administration has used fuzzy math to promote an inflated estimate of the cost to Maine of expanding Medicaid that’s much higher than the estimate produced by the legislature’s nonpartisan budget analysts. LePage also misleadingly points to a 2002 MaineCare expansion that the state had to curtail because of cost. Unlike the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, the previous Maine effort received the regular, smaller federal contribution, not the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced federal funding.Mainers for Health Care was unaware if there has been any public polling on support for the Medicaid expansion ballot initiative. Merrill also acknowledged the effort faces a headwind because this Election Day doesn’t feature any major contests, such as for governor or Congress.“An off-year election is not ideal in terms of turnout,” Merrill said. “It’s about getting the word out to people and really working to get out the vote.”To date, Mainers for Health Care and its allies have canvassed more than 150,000 homes, are planning Election Day get-out-the-vote efforts and have been running a TV, radio and digital advertising campaign since last month."

The most blatant case was in Charlottesville, Virginia, but it frequently happens in the shadows.During the election campaign, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Teacher Tolerance project documented “an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color” and increasing “racial and ethnic tensions in the classroom.” It also reported “many students worry about being deported” as a result of Trump campaign rhetoric. The National Education Association collected and shared stories from teachers about increased incidents of bullying and anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim statements.Since his election, Trump’s efforts to ban Muslims, calls for a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, and threat to deport undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, have only served to increase fear and convince Trump supporters they are free to antagonize and intimidate others. Newsweek recently reported that “Living in Donald Trump’s America over the past year has left the nation’s youngest feeling stressed and acting hostile, especially at school.” More than half of American teachers surveyed by UCLA reported they witnessed unusually high levels of anxiety among high school students. Over 40 percent of the teachers believe it is having a negative impact on student schoolwork and attendance.Making the situation worse is when schools, despite all the hoopla about anti-bullying campaigns, become complicit in Trump-style bullying. At two Harris County,Texas high schools, families are suing because students were punished for sitting during the Pledge of Allegiance. In one suit, a student from Klein Oak High School reported that a teacher compared people who do not stand for the pledge to communists and people who “condone pedophilia.” The student claims she was disciplined by the school for her actions and bullied by other students. At Windfern High School, a student was ordered to leave the building under threat of arrest for not reciting the pledge.Protests by National Football League players “taking a knee” during the playing of the national anthem have inspired similar responses from student athletes and threats from school administrators. In Bossier Parish Louisiana, the Superintendent of Schools distributed a letter informing student athletes that they are required to stand during the national anthem as a condition of participating in extra-curricular activities. The principal of a high school in the district notified students and parents that punishment for disobeying the rule could include removal from the team. In New York, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre threatened students at its network of church-run schools with “serious disciplinary action” if they knelt during the anthem before sporting events.In the United States, students are within their legal rights not to stand during the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem as long as they are not disruptive. Since the 1940s, federal courts have ruled that reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in schools must be voluntary. In West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), the Supreme Court held that schools cannot force students to recite the Pledge and must respect the right of an individual to remain seated. The ruling followed a suit by Jehovah Witnesses who argued the pledge was a violation of their constitutionally protected freedom of religion. Ironically, the pledge was written in 1892 by socialist reformer Francis Bellamy. The phrase “under God” was added during the Eisenhower administration. In a ruling citing Barnett, a federal court in New Jersey overturned a state statute requiring students to stand during the pledge of allegiance because it required “a student to engage in what amounts to implicit expression by standing at respectful attention while the flag salute is being administered and being participated in by other students.”In 1969, in its Tinker v. Des Moines decision, the United States Supreme Court declared that students do not lose their constitutional rights “at the schoolhouse gate.” That includes the right to religious freedom and to responsible protest. According to the United States Justice Department website, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “prohibits discrimination based on religion in public primary and secondary schools, as well as public colleges and universities” and “authorizes the Attorney General to bring suit in response to a written complaint by a parent that a child is being ‘deprived by a school board of the equal protection of the laws.’”With each new tweet, Donald Trump incites hostility towards people who he disagrees with or dislikes. Unfortunately Trump and Trumpism will not be going away soon. In the mean time, students, teachers, parents, and other people of good-will will have to take the lead in keeping Trumpism out of our schools.Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8"

Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spent more than $6.8 billion to ensure that their messages reached voters. The massive price tag ensured an over-saturation of advertising in various forms of media.Despite this massive price tag for voter outreach, 43 percent of Americans did not vote in 2016, outnumbering those who voted for Clinton, Trump or a third-party candidate. That translates to around 100 million Americans who decided to sit out the election.Voter apathy in the United States is by no means a new trend. For decades now, about 90 million voters abstain from casting a ballot in the presidential elections every four years. Elections in America have not reached more than 60 percent voter turnout since 1968. The trend is even worse for midterm elections, with less than 40 percent of voters participating since 1970.Some of these numbers can surely be attributed to both voter disenfranchisement and voter suppression tactics designed to keep certain demographics from voting, but there is also truth in that general voter apathy is a problem in this country.This is especially true in local elections.The median voter age in recent mayoral elections across 50 U.S. cities was 57 years old. Studies have shown time and again that not only is voter turnout in mayoral elections older, but hardly anybody bothers to vote in these elections, averaging a low of 21 percent as of 2011.This lack of voter engagement has negative implications for vulnerable communities. It allows whiter, upper middle class, older voters who are not representative of the larger electorate to dominate turnout. It creates a dynamic in which candidates and elected officials are more beholden to special interests and high dollar donations to their campaigns, rather than accountability to the public. The results are bad representation for working-class folks and minorities through the uneven prioritization of public spending and policy.This is all unfortunate because there is no level of government more responsible in making a direct impact in our daily life than our local elected officials. The quality of schools in our community, deciding sanctuary jurisdiction status, public safety and police accountability, affordable housing, public transit, policies that criminalize drug use, job training programs and climate resiliency are among some of the many important issues determined by our local government.In our current political climate, it is especially important that local elected officials be held accountable to stand up and protect the most vulnerable in our communities. For example, local elected leaders can provide relief and security to immigrants under attack by the federal government’s deportation machine. Our local governments can make sure that immigrant families in our communities are protected from separation by curtailing penalties for minor offenses, ensuring that police officers do not act as immigration enforcement, and refusing to cooperate with unconstitutional requests by federal immigration agencies.This November, elections will be held in 59 of the 100 largest cities in the country. This includes elections for 36 mayoral offices, 31 municipal officials, 367 city council seats, 50 special district officials and a governor’s race in New Jersey and Virginia.Take the time, make sure your voice is heard and go cast your vote.Thomas Kennedy is a communications fellow for the Center for Community Change."

This year, however, the U.N. faces a new challenge: Addressing the phenomenon after U.S. President Donald Trump, leader of the planet’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, pledged to do nothing to curb emissions.The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change will deal with that question in Bonn, Germany, from Nov. 6 to Nov. 17 as countries work to firm up their commitments to adapt to a warmer world in line with 2015′s landmark Paris Climate Agreement. Scientists say the world should prevent the planet from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius beyond pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a benchmark set by the Paris accord. Meeting the target means dramatic reduction in global emissions, and the Paris pact urges signatories to craft voluntary pledges to do that.However, the agreement is not legally binding, and Trump followed through on a campaign pledge to withdraw America from what he calls the “draconian” pact in June. It is a multi-year process to do so, and the U.S. cannot leave until Nov. 4, 2020 ― the day after the next presidential election.The U.S. and Syria are now the only two nations opposed to the climate deal.The Trump administration announced last week it would actively promote fossil fuels during a presentation at the climate conference, also known as the Conference of the Parties, or COP. Delegates sent by the White House will host a talk titled “The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation,” which will tout the supposed benefits of coal, natural gas and nuclear power.A delegation of U.S. negotiators are expected to work in Bonn to help write the rulebook for the Paris agreement, but their presence will be awkward. It’s unclear if negotiators from other countries will be willing to listen to a White House, which, under Trump, would not abide by any rules that emerge.The summit will feature some U.S. star power, however. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and billionaire activist Tom Steyer are funding a pavilion to showcase climate action by U.S. cities and businesses. The federal government usually pays the $200,000 or so cost of the showcase, but declined to do so this year.“The American people and American industry are pretty much all behind doing what the Paris agreement is designed to do, and that is to cut the amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere so we will slow down and maybe even stop climate change, which has the potential to destroy the world,” Bloomberg told The New York Times last month.Environmental groups and local governments around the U.S. reacted with fury following Trump’s decision to quit the Paris deal, but pledged to do their part to combat his agenda with or without federal support. Other world leaders have vowed to move forward regardless, and in July, every member of the G20, aside from the U.S., unveiled a detailed policy to abide by the Paris pact in a clear rebuke of the White House. Trump, while a presidential candidate, notably called climate change a “hoax” manufactured by the Chinese and has long promised to end the “war” on fossil fuels. He has signed several executive orders rolling back environmental regulations on the energy industry and has promised an American future flush with “really clean coal.” But, as HuffPost’s Alexander Kaufman reports, such energy doesn’t exist. Environmental groups have long called such rebranding a bait-and-switch by the coal lobby to try and revive an industry dying not due to regulation, but rather the rapidly falling cost of cleaner energy sources.In fact, the solar industry employed far more people than the coal industry in 2016, according to numbers from the Department of Energy. Natural gas, a far cleaner fossil fuel product in terms of emissions, and oil production jobs are the two leading employers in the industry.“There is no such thing as ‘clean coal,’” Travis Nichols, a spokesman for Greenpeace, told HuffPost in March. “It’s a myth used by the industry to get taxpayer money in order to prop up a dying industry. It’s worse than pixie dust and hope, it’s coal dust and nope. Coal miners deserve a just transition, not snake oil and empty promises.”Countries gathered in Bonn already understand this. Many of the world’s biggest economies, including China and India, are on track to meet their emissions-reduction targets years earlier than expected, and both have invested heavily in renewable energy.The talks in Bonn will be relatively low key compared with prior summits, as countries work to refine guidelines and review procedures to ensure signatories are meeting their commitments. The U.N. has agreed that negotiators will need to have such a framework in place by a 2018 deadline to make sure nations are doing enough to combat climate change.“I call this is the ‘put up or shut up COP,’” Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Pacific Standard. “We had a great reaction from leaders around the world universally saying they wouldn’t follow Trump out the door on Paris. But this COP is the one where they really have to start giving meaning to that rhetoric.”"

Thank you for your cooperation. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0045de1700003101796048.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the aftermath of another horrific mass shooting, I have finally been convinced: Now is not the time to talk about gun control. Likewise, now is not the time to talk about terrorism in New York, arrests in Saudi Arabia, Larry David’s holocaust joke, or yesterday’s NFL’s upsets. Just as many Democrats favor a three-day waiting period to purchase a gun, I favor a three-day waiting period to talk about anything in the news. Since there are mass shootings every day, this has many benefits. For example, not only do we never have to talk about gun control, we never have to talk about not talking about gun control. What a relief! (I hate that conversation.) The problem with talking about something after it just happened is that in our eagerness to talk about the just-happened-thing, we discuss it. If there’s one thing that we can all agree on, it’s that we don’t need any more discussion, especially in the aftermath of something that has happened. Do you discuss a meal after you’ve eaten it? Of course not. You give yourself time to thoroughly digest and eliminate it. And even then, you wait for the stench of defecation to clear before starting a possibly contentious debate about your subpar avocado toast appetizer. It is like that with mass shootings and gun control, except that the stench never clears. Consequently, we adapt to the toxically foul odor so effectively, we become completely unaware of it until our next bout of collective diarrhea. And even then, who wants to talk about or hear about diarrhea? I don’t know about you, but when a diarrhea commercial comes on, I immediately turn it off and don’t talk about it. My point is that we can’t allow ourselves to go off half-cocked talking about things that just happened, not without politicizing them and thereby making things worse than if we hadn’t talked about them. Honestly, I fear that I am making things worse, much worse, by talking about not talking about them. So, in the interests of fostering a meaningful national dialogue, I would like to shift the conversation to not talking about not talking about not talking about things. You’re welcome. Experts agree, the main issue is mental health. If only we were mentally healthy, that would make a world of difference, believe me. I would say more about this, but sorry, now is not the time to talk about mental health. The question we must ask ourselves is: What is this the time to talk about? To properly answer this pressing question, I would have to check the news from three days ago in order to identify the stories reported that are not relevant today. Those irrelevant stories are without question ripe for exhaustive analysis and spirited debate. But sadly, in our rush to judgment, we prefer to focus on relevant things that just happened. In closing, I would like to say nothing at all. Joe Raiola is Senior Editor of MAD Magazine and Producer of the Annual John Lennon Tribute in NYC.

Johnson taught me what it meant to be gay. Marsha",2017-11-06,"<p><em>Jim Mangia with Trans leaders, St. John’s staff, and performers at this year’s Eleganza Ball. </em></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a00e86f1d000016007f470a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I was just a young man coming of age in Greenwich Village, Marsha P. Johnson taught me what it meant to be gay.Marsha was an unapologetic activist who, along with Sylvia Rivera, led the ’69 Stonewall Rebellion in New York City that gave birth to the modern LGBT movement. She and Sylvia also founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, a group providing a much-needed political voice as well as housing and support services for low-income lesbians, gay men, and trans people of color.In addition to her many sociopolitical roles, Marsha was also simply my friend. When I came out as a gay man in 1983 at 20 years old, Marsha provided a place for me to stay and a nurturing friendship which lasted for the rest of her life.Every year, she and I marched together in NYC’s Gay Pride March with the Lesbian and Gay Caucus, a group I led at the time. But by the 1980s, the gay movement had abandoned the “drag queens,” “bull-dykes” and “transvestites” that led the Stonewall Rebellion for a strategy to blend in with the heterosexual, cisgender, white society that continued to oppress us. This truth became especially evident one year when Marsha showed up to march in a gold lame dress with a gold matching hat to march ― and was told by the cisgender parade organizers to go to the back.Instead of fighting with the organizers, to the back we went ― because Marsha had a plan. As we marched along 5th Avenue, she invited everyone watching the parade to join in behind us. By the time we got to Christopher Street, tens of thousands of people were marching behind us, cheering in defiance of the parade organizers. It was this welcoming yet radical spirit that made her the leader we still recognize today.Off the streets, Marsha was the kindest person I’ve ever known, always taking time to give food to a homeless person or shelter to runaway youth. Her warmth and empathy taken in tandem with her activism is a testament to the reality that trans women of color have always led the LGBT movement ― in both community building and political work. At the time, she was rejected by a gay establishment who saw her and the people she represented as a hindrance to acceptance. But she wanted liberation ― not acceptance ― so she never backed down. That is why we loved her.And then, Marsha was killed. Her body was found in Greenwich Village in 1992. Her murder remains unsolved.Today, as we celebrate Marsha’s life, we must never forget that it was the “transvestites,” “bull-dykes” and “drag queens” who fueled the LGBT movement. Our progress didn’t happen in corporate board rooms or political backrooms. It happened on the street. And while we’ve gained a tremendous amount in the struggle for LGBT rights in America, it is on the backs of pioneers like Marsha that we stand tall today.Even as LGBT folks advance in society and have increasing access to capital and power, we must fight against the urge to be those parade organizers, forcing the most marginalized among us to the back. As the leader of a large public health center network, I have far more influence than I could have imagined as that shy 20 year old, still unsure of my own identity. I’ve certainly made mistakes by overlooking that privilege. But as members of the LGBT community, we must all stay true to our history’s roots by taking the interests and concerns of our brothers and sisters into account when mainstream society fails to do so ― just as Marsha did all those years ago.It was in honor of Marsha’s memory that I created a trans-specific health program that has grown to serve over 2,000 individuals in South Los Angeles. The Transgender Health Program (THP) at St. John’s Well Child and Family Center is led and staffed by trans people of color and serves primarily uninsured or underinsured trans people of color. We provide services like primary care, hormone therapy, and health care to everyone who walks through our doors regardless of their ability to pay, and continue to grow every year.Last week, the THP celebrated the lives and contributions of trans folks at the St. John’s TransNation festival. The week’s events included a film festival and “Eleganza,” a gala hosted by Candice Cayne and Laith Ashley that honored trailblazers in the transgender community ― namely Jazzmun Nichcala Crayton and the THP staff. In addition to special guest presenter Laverne Cox, the evening featured performances from Gia Bank, Miss Peppermint, Shea Diamond and DJ JD Sampson. Proceeds from the festival will help fund the THP’s work to continue providing primary medical, dental and behavioral health care, as well as socioeconomic, legal and advocacy support services to one of the largest populations of transgender patients in the country.Taken as a whole, TransNation was a beautiful example of trans people coming together in community, both to celebrate their identities and to show their allies and mainstream society what it really means to be liberated.Thank you, Marsha, for giving me the support I needed to live as a proud gay man today. As we move forward, we must never forget where the LGBT movement is rooted ― because for the progress we’ve made today, we all have Marsha P. Johnson to thank."

They then headed to Henry County Medical Center in Paris, Tenn.That’s where they met up with Dr. Locus, who came in dressed like The Joker who was famously played by the late actor Heath Ledger, complete with greasy green hair and a painted red mouth.For the family, his costume couldn’t have been cooler.“We couldn’t help but laugh when he walked in the room!” Justin Selph told HuffPost in an email. “My wife, being [an] open-minded woman, with a sense of humor, thought it would be hilarious to have such a unique delivery.”Dr. Locus stayed at the hospital to help throughout the afternoon but when it was determined that she was still several hours away from giving birth, he excused himself to go home to pass out Halloween candy and to change his clothes.“My wife said, ‘Aww, we had hoped that you wouldn’t change,’” Justin Selph recalled. “But we never expected him to stay in character all day and into the night.”To their delight, when Dr. Locus returned to deliver their baby named Oaklyn around 8 p.m., he remained disguised as The Joker and performed the delivery in costume.Though Brittany Selph said some people have criticized the doctor’s costume saying “that’s just not cool,” she said it made the delivery easier for her.“Of course there’s pain but to talk to him and see him down there, it kind of did take my mind off of what was going on it and gave me a little bit of a giggle there to release some stress,” she said.Her 4-year-old daughter’s experience was a tad different, however.“Mckinley, she was a little terrified, a little scared.

In light of the news, Erin has shared Instagram posts about her excitement as well as an important message about why no one should ever have to face the question, “When are you going to have kids?”On October 30, Erin wrote on Instagram that her and her husband’s journey to decide to have kids was difficult and that the many inquiries about when she was going to start a family didn’t help. “Stop asking couples when they are going to have a baby,” she wrote. “It’s always asked with the best intentions, but the raw, awful feeling of explaining never got easier.”Erin described pregnancy as an “insurmountable” fear for her and something that “felt impossible.”“I would turn out the light at the end of every single day and the weight of hopelessness made me feel pathetic: ‘Another day has passed and I’m still not brave enough,’” she wrote.She also mentioned the painful experience other couples go through of not being able to conceive and consequently coming up with various lies when they feel pressured to explain why they’re not expecting yet.“For so many couples I’ve known, there have been years of trying for a baby that never comes,” she wrote. “It’s heartbreaking for those couples and the question forces lies much of the time: ‘One day we’ll get around to it!’ or ‘We’re just enjoying being the two of us!’ Let’s help by not asking that one question.”Blogger Adele Barbaro, known as The Real Mumma online, inspired Erin’s post. In October, she described on Instagram what it was like to be under scrutiny from friends, family and acquaintances during her difficult journey to become pregnant.“They would tell me that I’m not going to be young forever or that my maternal clock was ticking,” Barbaro wrote. “And believe me, I knew it. I just didn’t need to hear it from everyone else.”Erin is about seven months along now. She and Ben are expecting a girl they plan on naming Helen after Erin’s grandmother.In an earlier Instagram post, the HGTV star wrote that she’s been reading all of the messages she’s received since announcing her pregnancy and offered hope to other couples who might be facing similar struggles that she and Ben have experienced. “It’s been so good to hear how many of you found my fear relatable and I’ve been praying that our story will be a comfort to someone in my same shoes,” she wrote.

Now it will top the list for anyone who’s just plain thirsty, too.The city will install fountains that dispense sparkling water, or fontaines d’eau pétillante, around the entire city, Conde Nast Traveler reports.The move is an expansion of an initiative that launched in 2010 with 8 fountains of bubbly water at the city’s fingertips. Now, Paris City Hall has “embarked on an ambitious-sounding scheme that will ultimately provide at least one fountain of sparkling water in every one of Paris’ 20 arrondissements,” CityLab reports. The fountains are equipped with CO2 carbonators, which give it its fizz. Shelling out effervescent water gratuitement is delightful, and also impactful. The city’s goal, CityLab explained, is to get people to drink more water and reduce the amount of plastic waste created by the amount of bottled water drank by Paris residents each year. It’s a pretty genius, and not to mention delicious, idea ― amd also painfully Parisian. That was not lost on excited social media users, who were as quick to joke about it being bougie as they were to express extreme jealousy. You can keep your humdrum regular old water fountains, other cities ― we’ll take ours with a side of carbonation. After all, we can’t think of a better, more affordable way to wash down our pain au chocolat. "
36,POLITICS,Donna Brazile Says She Faced Sexism From Top Hillary Clinton Aides,Yashar Ali,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donna-brazile-clinton-sexism_us_5a007060e4b0baea26336734,"In her new book, the former DNC chair is particularly critical of Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.",2017-11-06,"Donna Brazile was the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee during part of Hillary Clinton's run for president. Her new book, Hacks, is subtitled: ""The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a007f0817000021007960ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the sixth chapter of her new book, Hacks, former interim Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile says Hillary Clinton’s top male aides engaged in sexist behavior toward her. Brazile says it prompted her to tell the group during a contentious conference call, “Gentlemen, let’s just put our dicks out on the table and see who’s got the bigger one, because I know mine is bigger than all of yours.”Brazile’s book will be released Tuesday ― the same day some states and municipalities have critical elections. Hacks has stirred up controversy after previously published excerpts described Clinton having a deal with the Democratic Party to give her more access and power than independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Brazile putting together a contingency plan to replace Clinton as the party’s nominee with then-Vice President Joe Biden after Clinton fainted on 9/11 due to pneumonia. (Disclosure: This reporter was a co-chair of Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2008 and has supported the Clinton foundation in the past, but no longer engages in political activity.)The book is highly critical of Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook, saying, “He had the habit of nodding when you are talking, leaving you with the impression that he has listened to you, but then never seeming to follow up on what you thought you agreed on.” Brazile adds, however, that when she saw him at the DNC convention, he was “warm and treated me with respect.”The book also says all of Mook’s top aides were men: “The young men that surrounded Robby Mook ― and they were all men in his inner circle ― had mastered a cool and removed style of politics.” However, Mook’s chief of staff, campaign chief operating officer, communications director and rapid response director were women.Brazile says her relationship with Mook got so bad that she told Clinton’s chief administrative officer Charlie Baker, “Charlie, I’m about to kill Robby and it ain’t going to be pretty.”A former Clinton aide who has read the excerpts that were shared with HuffPost said, “Given that she already had to walk back her claims about a rigged nomination and was caught buying into a right-wing conspiracy about Hillary’s health, I’m not sure how much more of this book people should take seriously.” Brazile’s book describes a deal that allowed Clinton “control of the party long before she became its nominee,” according to an excerpt published by Politico. But on ABC’s “This Week,” she said there was “no evidence” the nomination was rigged for Clinton.According to the book, a big bone of contention between Brazile and Mook was Mook’s refusal to allow Brazile to hire a temporary CEO for the DNC. Brazile says she wanted to get the party back on its feet after Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned in response to Wikileaks emails revealing she was trying to sabotage Sanders. Brazile pushed to hire longtime Democratic aide Tom McMahon, she says. But a source familiar with Mook’s thinking says he thought McMahon was a good choice, and on Aug. 2, 2016, Brazile announced McMahon was joining the DNC on an interim basis.Recalling what she describes as a tension-filled conference call with Mook and his team of top aides about hiring a temporary CEO for the party, Brazile says, “I have worked with men all my life in politics and I can sense when they get to this part about not being able to deal with a woman. This is not a racial thing. This was a gender thing.”Brazile says that she interjected at one point in the conference call and said, “You know, this does not feel like a negotiation to me. This feels like power and control. Gentlemen, let’s just put our dicks out on the table and see who’s got the bigger one, because I know mine is bigger than all of yours.” A former Clinton aide confirmed Brazile made the comment, but doesn’t believe a call focused on hiring McMahon occurred.Clinton supporters have aggressively pushed back on assertions in Brazile’s book. Over 200 former Clinton campaign staffers signed an open letter saying they “do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the book.”"

Instead, the party of the people is withering. Energy on the ground is low, infighting is high. The run-up to the Virginia gubernatorial election is feeling sickeningly like the last days of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. The polls show a race tightening by the week. The most recent reliable poll, the New York Times/Siena poll, shows the Democrat, Ralph Northam, up by just three points, 43 to 40, with 17 percent undecided. There is the same sort of chasm by race and class as in the Clinton-Trump race, with non-college educated whites favoring Republican Ed Gillespie by forty points. These are people, based on social class, who should be Democrats. If the lackluster, accident-prone and risk-averse Democrat, Lieutenant Governor Northam, does pull out a narrow win, it will only be because his Republican rival Gillespie, is a longtime party hack and lobbyist, and even less convincing than Donald Trump as a populist. That, however, has not stopped Gillespie from using the Trump playbook of stirring up racial and anti-immigrant hatreds. And in the absence of a compelling economic-populist alternative, it works.Gillespie baited Northam into saying he’d sign legislation banning sanctuary cities, even though there are none in Virginia and this is a non-issue. That was sufficient to cause Democrats for America, the group founded by Howard Dean, to announce it was no longer supporting Northam. It’s hard to know which action was more perverse — Northam’s stance or DFA’s. Gillespie is also running an ad with the tagline, “You’d never take a knee — so take a stand on Election Day: Vote Gillespie.” Nice touch.Voters will only fall for this stuff if the other side is not offering anything real. But if you asked a computer to design a Democrat who is the opposite of an economic populist, it would devise a creature like Northam. The other day, pollster Stan Greenberg, who has advised the Clintons for three decades, and who recently wrote a scathing critique of the sheer incompetence of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, told the New Yorker magazine: “Look at Virginia right now. We have a candidate running as Hillary Clinton. He is running on the same kind of issues, and has the same kind of view of the world. It’s the Republicans who talk about the economy, not the Democrats.”Meanwhile over in New Jersey, the Democratic nominee, Phil Murphy, is comfortably ahead, thanks to the gift that keeps on giving, incumbent governor Chris Christie. Murphy’s opponent is Christie’s lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, who is lagging well behind. But wait ― Hillary Clinton got tarred for taking some speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. The Democrat in the New Jersey race, Murphy, comes from Goldman Sachs. So did the last New Jersey Democratic governor, Jon Corzine. These guys are actually relative liberals, but can’t we look elsewhere for Democratic candidates? Corzine, as the incumbent, was beaten by Chris Christie.In the past couple of weeks, the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, has executed a purge of leading Sanders supporters. Donna Brazile, who served as interim DNC chair after Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the Obama-era chair, was forced out, published book extracts supporting Bernie Sanders’ view that the nomination was effectively stolen by the DNC, which was supposed to be neutral, but instead supported Clinton. Maybe Brazile could have waited until after Tuesday’s elections?Oh, and one of the wealthiest and best connected Democratic lobbyists, Tony Podesta, brother of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, managed to get caught in special counsel Robert Mueller’s dragnet. Tony Podesta evidently was working with Paul Manafort on behalf of a front group for the pro-Moscow Ukrainian government in power at the time. It’s stories like this that display a bipartisan special interest swamp, and turn working people against both parties.Meanwhile, recriminations among the diverse elements of what should be the Democrats’ broad coalition are at a rolling boil. There is bitterness among feminists that deeply seeded misogyny cost Hillary Clinton the presidency. I have had arguments with numerous feminist friends to the effect that a more compelling woman candidate such as Elizabeth Warren could have defeated Donald Trump in 2016, and could win in 2020. But some of my feminist friends counter that it would be more prudent to nominate a Midwestern white guy, say Ohio Democratic senator Sherrod Brown. There has to be something perverse about feminists arguing that misogyny is so pervasive that it’s better not to nominate a female.Meanwhile, on the racial front, there is understandable bitterness among many African American Democrats that whites, even progressive whites, failed to protect blacks from deepening racism. Conversations about the need to talk about class as well as race tends to produce vituperation about white privilege.In short, the progressive side of the political spectrum is a cauldron of grievances, each understandable and legitimate in its own right. But if Democrats can’t find areas of common ground, then Trump and his imitators will keep winning.Somehow, Democrats need to nominate more compelling candidates, who can narrate the grievances of ordinary Americans in a convincing way and propose drastic remedies. Democrats need to remember the larger stakes and try to limit the infighting.Out of this mess, a leader will emerge as the Democratic standard bearer for the 2020 election. Before that nominee can take on Donald Trump, or Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans put up, he or she will need to restore some semblance of Democratic purpose and unity. Right now, that challenge seems more daunting than the election itself.Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and professor at Brandeis University’s Heller School.

After being sentenced to serve only six months in prison — which caused a public outcry, as well as petitions to recall Judge Aaron Persky — Turner was released for time served after a mere three months. He’s required to register as a sex offender, according to CNN.At Turner’s sentencing, Doe shared a powerful 12-page letter, which Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen called “the most eloquent, powerful and compelling piece of victim advocacy that I’ve seen in my 20 years as a prosecutor,” according to Palo Alto Online.In the letter, Doe talked about the severe damage the sexual assault caused her, saying that she has been “irreversibly hurt.” “You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again,” she wrote. “You knocked down both our towers, I collapsed at the same time you did. If you think I was spared, came out unscathed, that today I ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken. Nobody wins. We have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering. Your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.”Although Doe will carry the trauma of that night with her for the rest of her life, Michele Landis Dauber, who is the Frederick I. Richman professor of law at Stanford University and a family friend of Doe’s, wanted to do something positive for her. With Doe’s permission, Dauber proposed transforming the site of the sexual assault into a contemplative space. The project was approved by Stanford, and the dumpster site has now been replaced with benches and a fountain. Soon a plaque will feature a portion of Doe’s letter.“I felt that the dumpster had become a symbol of campus rape and that to leave the space without interpretation would invite fear and confusion on the part of vulnerable students,” Dauber tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “By interpreting the space as we have with a calming area and a plaque, Stanford admits that this happened here but invites a response that centers on the experience of the survivor and allows students to grapple with those events in a meaningful way.”What does Dauber hope students will take away from the site as they walk past it or sit there? “Students will have to come to their own conclusions about the events that transpired in this space. The space and the marker with the survivor’s quote on it invite them to ask what their role would have been in these events or other similar events. By locating the marker where the assault occurred, students are reminded that these events are happening just steps from the back door of their residence. It reminds them that two students intervened but that many didn’t even notice, perhaps prompting them to be more aware of what is happening around them. The location of the marker is an integral part of its meaning to me.”Alexis Lynn Kallen, a student at Stanford University and an office assistant at the WSD Handa Center for Human Rights and International Justice, supports the new site.“While many students are holding back to speak up about this memorial, I am very in favor of its construction,” Kallen tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “I think building the memorial in the form of a park was successful in serving as a reminder of the dangers of violence, but will not be too triggering to survivors or people walking by.”She adds, “Many parties happen in this area, where sexual assault often occurs, and I think it is important to remember the horrible sexual assaults that have happened and continue to happen at Stanford. It is my hope that this will be a reminder of the importance of consent and respect that we need to work towards on this campus, and the battle we are constantly fighting against campus sexual assault.”Kallen tells Yahoo Lifestyle that she also hopes the contemplative space “encourages [students] to step up and hold a higher campus standard around intolerance of sexual assault this year and in the years to follow.”"
41,CRIME,Air Force Failed To Enter Church Shooter's Domestic Violence Record In U.S. Database,Melissa Jeltsen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-church-shooting-domestic-violence-record_us_5a00d8c0e4b066c2c039ace8,"As a convicted abuser, Devin Kelley was not legally allowed to purchase firearms. He fell through the cracks.",2017-11-06,Police move flowers placed at a barricade near the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs on Monday. Gunman Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 people and wounded 20 others when he opened fire during a Sunday service at the Texas church.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a00e2d91d00001a3d7f46fd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Air Force said on Monday that it failed to record the Texas church shooter’s domestic violence conviction in a federal database that would have kept him from buying a gun.That glaring oversight allowed Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, to pass multiple background checks and legally purchase firearms. The stunning admission from the Air Force raises critical questions about coordination between the military and the federal background check system that is designed to keep guns from those who have lost the right to purchase them. On Sunday, Kelley opened fire on the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, east of San Antonio, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others. He was later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Kelley, who served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, was convicted by a general court martial on two charges of domestic assault against his wife and stepson before being released with a bad conduct discharge in 2014.Under federal law, his conviction prohibited him from buying or possessing firearms. But it appears Kelley’s domestic violence offense was never entered into the federal database that gun sellers use to check the criminal history of potential buyers.“Initial information indicates that Kelley’s domestic violence offense wasnot entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by theHolloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations,” said Ann Stefanek, Air Force spokesperson, in a statement. She later told CBS News that Kelley was “clearly a serious problem in the Air Force.”She added that the Air Force will conduct a comprehensive review to ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly.Fred Milanowski, a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent, said Tuesday that the suspect was not in any FBI database. Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said there was nothing “in our databases that precluded him from purchasing a firearm.”A spokesperson for Academy Sports + Outdoors, a sporting and hunting goods store, told HuffPost that Kelley purchased firearms at two of their locations, in 2016 and 2017. On both occasions, the sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. If his domestic violence conviction had been logged in the system, Kelley would have been flagged as prohibited from purchasing guns. Kelley used a semi-automatic Ruger AR-556, investigators said Tuesday. Police found 15 empty 30-round magazines at the scene, along with hundreds of shell casings. While in the Air Force, Kelley was found guilty of strangling his then-wife by putting his hands around her neck, as well as striking her, pulling her hair and kicking her, on multiple occasions between June 2011 and April 2012. He was also found guilty of striking a child under the age of 16 on the head and body “with a force likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm.” Don Christensen, a former chief prosecutor for the Air Force, told The New York Times that Kelley assaulted his stepson “severely enough that he fractured his skull.”He was also accused of pointing a loaded firearm at his wife, but that charge was dismissed.It appears that domestic violence was a thread through Kelley’s life.At least two ex-girlfriends told NBC that he stalked them after they ended relationships with him. His first wife filed for divorce in 2012, the same year Kelley was court-martialed for the abuse of her and her son. He was remarried in 2014.Authorities said that he had been fighting with his current wife’s family and had sent threatening texts to his mother-in-law, who sometimes worshipped at the Sutherland Springs church. Among his victims was his wife’s grandmother.“There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws,” said Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety.In some ways, Kelley’s profile is not that unusual. In the U.S., most mass shootings involve domestic violence, according to research from Everytown for Gun Safety, although many incidents do not make national news.In 54 percent of mass shootings from 2009 to 2016 ― defined as incidents in which four or more people were fatally shot, not including the perpetrator ― the gunman shot a current or former intimate partner or family member. Everytown also found that in nearly half of these cases, the killer exhibited warning signs, such as recent acts of violence, threats or violation of a protective order.The more than 20 families that lost loved ones will be compensated for funeral costs through a state crime victims compensation fund, Wilson County District Attorney Audrey Louis said Tuesday. A local funeral company has also agreed to donate caskets for all victims.“We’re grateful for that person and the service to our community,” Louis said of the donations. “People here are concerned with the initial burden, as we all are.” This article has been updated to include reports about Kelley’s previous threatening behavior, statistics on mass shootings, and details on the gunman’s weapon and ammunition."

Rand Paul was attacked at his home in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on Friday afternoon, according to a police report.Officials initially said that Paul suffered minor injuries to his face and a rib, but an aide told the Washington Post on Sunday evening that the senator suffered five broken ribs and bruises to his lungs.Rene Albert Boucher, 59, has been charged with fourth-degree assault with a minor injury, a misdemeanor, according to arrest records. He was being held Saturday afternoon at the Warren County Regional Jail in lieu of a $5,000 bond. No details were released by police on what precipitated the attack.The FBI is “involved making sure it wasn’t politically motivated,” a police spokesman told WBKO-TV. “We are working with our state and local partners to determine if there was a violation of federal law,” FBI spokesman David Habich told USA Today. It’s not known when Paul will be back on the job. “This type of injury is caused by high-velocity severe force,” Paul’s chief of staff Doug Stafford told The Washington Post. “It is not clear exactly how soon he will return to work, as the pain is considerable as is the difficulty in getting around, including flying.”Fox News reported that Boucher allegedly attacked the senator and one-time presidential candidate as Paul, 54, was mowing his lawn.A neighbor told WAVE3-TV that the two men had an ongoing feud. Boucher is a registered Democrat.According to the arrest warrant obtained by WKBO and the Bowling Green Daily News, Paul told police that his neighbor walked onto his property and tackled him from behind, forcing him to the ground. Police were called to the home shortly before 3:30 p.m. Friday.The senator’s injury did not require treatment at a hospital. The arrest warrant said that Boucher admitted to tackling Paul.“Senator Paul was blindsided and the victim of an assault,” his spokeswoman Kelsey Cooper said in a statement. “The assailant was arrested and it is now a matter for the police. Senator Paul is fine.”The Bowling Green Daily News reported that Boucher is a local anesthesiologist and pain specialist who developed a cloth vest product designed to relieve back pain.State Police Master Trooper Jeremy Hodges told The Associated Press that he couldn’t reveal any other details of the assault because of security issues. The investigation is ongoing. UPDATE: Story has been updated to describe the severity of Paul’s injuries."

Many supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) interpreted the news as confirmation that the party had treated him unfairly.“I am more committed than ever before to restoring voters’ faith in our democratic process because even the perception of impartiality or an unfair advantage undermines our ability to win,” Perez said. “That is unacceptable.”“After listening to Democrats from every wing of our party, I’ve developed a series of concrete reforms to put our principles into action and guarantee that under my watch, the new DNC will work to rebuild trust with the people we represent,” he said.The “principles” Perez plans to employ include deciding the presidential primary debate schedule well before voting in the contests begins and making transparent to the public any joint fundraising agreements the DNC makes.He also promised to support the work of the Unity Reform Commission, a panel formed in July 2016 as a compromise with delegates who backed Sanders at the Democratic National Convention.“We will work with the Unity Reform Commission to implement their collective recommendations for meaningful change in our party,” Perez said.The commission is due to recommend reforms to the nominating process by January 2018. The 21-member panel is discussing plans to make the party’s budget more transparent, diminish the role of so-called superdelegates in the nominating process, and make it easier for independents and new voters to participate in Democratic primaries and caucuses.Nomiki Konst, one of eight Sanders appointees on the commission, expressed disappointment that Perez did not explicitly address DNC budget transparency and prohibiting the committee’s voting members from having business with the organization or other conflicts of interest that could jade their ability to act impartially.“At this point, with barely any funds, compromised integrity and low trust, Chairman Perez needs to prove above and beyond that he’s willing to reform this party,” Konst said in a text message to HuffPost. “Make it transparent, accountable, inclusive and eliminate conflicts of interest that have burdened it.”"

Sessions has already testified before the committee twice under oath ― during his confirmation hearing in January and during a routine oversight hearing last month ― that he was unaware of communications between the Trump team and Russia. But according to recently unsealed court documents, former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos spoke multiple times with Russians about setting up a meeting between then-presidential candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And Papadopoulos, according to the documents. described his efforts during a meeting on March 31, 2016, that included Trump and Sessions.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said on CNN she plans to discuss summoning Sessions back before the Judiciary Committee with the panel’s chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). She declined to say whether she believed Sessions intentionally misled the committee in the past ― but said the attorney general should focus on getting his facts straight.“Maybe he has a faulty memory. So, there are a lot of excuses one can make.” Feinstein said. “But at this stage, he’s got to narrow his recollections. When he comes before the committee again, he has to be precise, and it has to be accurate,” she said.Since the unsealing on Monday of the court documents concerning Papadopoulos ― who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials during the campaign ― Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have been pushing for Sessions to explain the discrepancy between the information in them and his testimony.The attorney general has been given the chance to clarify past testimony, “yet he only continued to mislead,” Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said in a statement. “He now needs to come back before the committee, in person, under oath, to explain why he cannot seem to provide truthful, complete answers to these important and relevant questions.” “I don’t think he told me the truth,” Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) told ABC late last week. “I think that on different occasions he either has a terrible memory or he is deliberately not telling me the truth.”Lawmakers’ frustration with Sessions may be gaining bipartisan traction.“This is getting a bit old with Jeff Sessions,” Sen.

The Department of the Interior announced the decision on Thursday in a letter to withdraw immediately from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which compels oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments to governments worldwide. The United Kingdom, Canada and many European Union nations already require such disclosures, and the 15-year-old initiative is credited with establishing the foundation for reform in countries such as Ghana and the Democratic Republic of Congo. But the U.S., which joined in 2014, only finalized rules calling for disclosures in July 2016, under the Dodd-Frank reform law passed during the Great Recession. In February, Trump signed a congressional resolution to repeal the Securities and Exchange Commission regulation, essentially leaving the U.S. without a tool to enforce EITI standards. The rule would have required companies to file annual reports revealing how much they paid in taxes, royalties, licensing fees and other payments. Some firms, including BHP Billiton and Houston-based Kosmos Energy, voluntarily released tax data in recent years. The country’s top three oil companies ― Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corporation and ConocoPhillips Co. ― did not. “They want to continue operating in the murky and opaque world that Dodd-Frank was intended to change,” Daniel Kaufmann, an economist who studies corruption and serves on the global EITI board, told HuffPost by phone on Friday. “Even Russian companies are all disclosing. So the rest of the world, and the rest of the oil companies, have moved ahead.”“The U.S. ones refuse to change their old habits of operating in opacity,” he added. “That’s means tax avoidance, obviously, and it raises the risk of more corrupt deals.” The secrecy underscores the generous subsidies and tax credits afforded to the oil and gas industry. Nearly half of all untapped oil reserves in the U.S. would be unprofitable without subsidies, a study published last month in the journal Nature found. Exxon Mobil alone received $12.8 billion in subsidies and paid a tax rate of 13.6 percent over the past eight years, according to a report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. (The report did not calculate data for Chevron or ConocoPhillips.) For comparison, nurses and appraisers earning on average $60,000 per year pay an individual tax rate of about 15 percent.“If people see that Chevron and Exxon are making bank, making hand over fist extracting resources from the U.S. and not paying their fair share, people would have a problem with that,” Jana Morgan, director of the Publish What You Pay coalition that supports the EITI initiative, told HuffPost. “So they want to keep it secret.” The move came the same day House Republicans introduced a tax bill that preserves generous subsidies and tax credits for fossil fuel companies, and eliminates incentives to buy electric vehicles or use renewable energy. “We’re spending so much time in the U.S. focusing on the cost of health care and taking away money from Planned Parenthood and social welfare,” Morgan said. “We’re so focused on getting rid of those but we don’t want to get rid of corporate welfare.”In a statement to HuffPost, Chevron spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie said the company has been working to meet EITI standards. “Chevron spent a significant amount of time preparing and reconciling USEITI report data,” she said, “but not payments to the IRS, given the confidential nature of IRS data.” Exxon Mobil spokesman Scott Silvestri directed HuffPost to a January op-ed published in The Dallas Morning News that “focuses on our commitment to transparency initiatives.” ConocoPhillips did not return a call requesting comment on Friday. The American Petroleum Institute, the industry group that lobbied the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers to overturn the SEC disclosure rule, said it would “continue working with the U.S. Department of Interior in reporting revenues and disbursements and with the U.S. State Department to drive global transparency.” On a broader level, the decision to stop participating in the EITI echoes President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. As with EITI, the administration stopped implementing policies to meet the pact’s standards before formally pulling out. “The decision to pull out was of greater symbolic significance than anything else,” Matthew Stephenson, a Harvard Law School professor who writes a blog about corruption, told HuffPost by phone on Friday. “It indicated the U.S. no longer had an interest in working with, let alone leading, the international community on this issue.”"

The investigation has been overseen by one of the top prosecutors in the office, Reinhold Mueller.One of Masterson’s accusers initially filed an LAPD report in 2004 saying that she was raped in 2003 while she was “passed out” and that, when she awoke and realized Masterson was raping her, she struggled with him until he choked her and she passed out again. The case was not referred to the district attorney at the time after more than 50 members of the Church of Scientology, which both Masterson and his accuser belonged to, submitted affidavits to the LAPD denying the woman’s account.

He and his business associate Rick Gates have pleaded not guilty to the charges brought forward by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said at Manafort’s second court hearing on Thursday that she was concerned that he posed a flight risk. In a court filing on Saturday, Manafort’s lawyers assured the judge that the reason he had three passports was “mundane”: He has a primary passport, a second passport to submit with visa applications to certain foreign countries, and a third that he applied for after he lost his primary passport, which he later found.Manafort’s “frequent flyer status,” lawyer Kevin Downing wrote, “should not be over-emphasized to show a potential risk of flight when a person’s job requires extensive travel.” He said that Manafort was just a “successful domestic and international political consultant” who “traveled frequently and represented businessmen, political parties, and commercial interests around the world,” activities that were “completely” legal.“It would be odd, indeed, if he did not frequently travel, both domestically and abroad, given his clientele and the nature of his business,” Downing wrote.He also noted that Manafort has been married for almost 40 years and has two daughters and two grandchildren in the U.S. He said that his client’s primary assets are also in the United States. One of the charges that Manafort is facing relates to his alleged failure to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires lobbyists to disclose when they’re working on behalf of a foreign principal. Downing, not incorrectly, said that particular charge was “rarely pursued (or successfully prosecuted) in a criminal case.”Manafort is currently on house arrest under electronic monitoring and a $10 million unsecured bond. He’s seeking less onerous conditions of release. To guarantee his future court appearances, his attorney said Manafort would be willing to pledge a $3 million Trump Tower apartment in New York City, another $3.5 million home in New York, a $1.5 million home in Palm Beach, Florida, and a “combination of life insurance policies held in trust and/or in his or his wife’s name” and valued at approximately $4.5 million ― for a total of more than $12 million.Although Manafort has not yet reached an agreement with prosecutors over the conditions of his release, his lawyers wrote that he would agree to limit his travel to Florida, Virginia, New York and Washington, D.C. Prosecutors with Mueller’s office are expected to file their response to the Manafort filing on Sunday.On Thursday, Jackson seemed open to lifting Manafort’s house arrest but skeptical of removing his electronic monitoring.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

53,QUEER VOICES,"Kelly Clarkson Felt 'Suppressed,' Says Top Country Star's Career Changed When He Came Out","Pollo Del Mar , ContributorDrag queen on the SF social, political, editorial and fundrais...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kelly-clarkson-felt-suppressed-says-being-out-changed_us_59fd07f1e4b0d467d4c224f7,"“He’s an amazing singer, an amazing performer, but nobody could get past [his being gay].”",2017-11-04,<p>Kelly Clarkson says it has taken 15 years to be “allowed” to release new album <em>Meaning of Life.</em></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fd08cb1400002700d7ed9a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kelly Clarkson has scored a trio of Grammys, more than 100 cumulative No. 1 singles on various Billboard charts and become an icon in the music industry. Yet from the beginning, the first-ever American Idol says, record labels and executives have tried to define who she is as both a person and musician. “Honestly, you can look at my previous records and you can hear a suppressed individual,” Clarkson told Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. “I just constantly felt pushed into a box.”Throughout her career, Clarkson’s struggle for creative liberation has been tabloid fodder. She dropped Idol’s 19 Management team, then went toe-to-toe with former industry giant Clive Davis to gain greater freedom in her sound. Sometimes there were victories, she said; other times, she had to “compromise.”A deciding factor in her need to “bend” to corporate pressure was the band and team supporting her. Had she pushed back too much, she told listeners of Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ podcast, the label would “sit on” her music and prevent touring, presenting a financial burden for those with whom she has worked with for nearly a decade.“You carry this weight on you to keep everyone afloat,” Clarkson confessed. “I feel everything. It’s annoying.”The superstar recalled a conversation years ago with her equally famous mother-in-law Reba McIntyre. Though conceding she, too, feels the burden of celebrity, the country music legend told Clarkson: “You’re just a different type of personality. You take on everything.” Fortunately, it appears Clarkson’s “devastating” battle for artistic authenticity is behind her. Now signed to Atlantic Records, she dropped eighth album Meaning of Life Oct. 27. Not only does she feel it’s her best work to date, it’s also proven to be a relief.“When you are that type of person – an emotional person, in a good way – it’s really wonderful to be part of a project that’s 100-percent you, 100-percent your personality and no one is holding you back,” Clarkson said. “They’re supporting you being you,” she said of her experience with Atlantic. “Fifteen years later, this is my first time experiencing that!”Atlantic’s belief in both Clarkson – whose eleven Top 10 hits, three No. 1 singles and trio of chart-topping albums make her one of the industry’s most bankable stars – and the album are obvious. Of 14 tracks on Meaning of Life, Clarkson co-wrote four. The rest bear the sonic stamp of a veritable music industry who’s who. WATCH: Pollo Del Mar’s Track-By-Track Review of Meaning of LifeLead single “Love So Soft” alone combines powerhouses Mozella (Miley Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball”), Priscilla Renea (co-writer of Fifth Harmony’s “Worth It”) and Jesse Shatkin (Sia’s “Alive”). Elsewhere are the fingerprints of hip-hop producers The Monarchs (Nicki Minaj, Justin Bieber), Grammy nominee Mick Schultz (Jeremih’s “Birthday Sex”) and Greg Kurstin, the Grammy-winning genius behind Adele’s “Hello.”Saying she previously has “never worked with people who would allow” an album like Meaning of Life, the Texan indicated the reasons stemmed largely from industry decisions on what kind of artist she should be. However, in the interview ― recorded Oct. 11, National Coming Out Day – Clarkson related the story of Nashville-based songwriter Shane McAnally, whose sexual identity altered his path to stardom.“He’s a phenomenal writer; he’s had like a bajillion No. 1s now,” Clarkson pointed out. “Back in the day, when he was someone’s assistant somewhere, shuffling coffee around, he got, ‘You can’t make it as a country singer if they know you’re gay.’”In 1999, McAnally signed to Curb Records. After marginal success as a solo artist, he relocated to Los Angeles, where he came out. When he sought to resume his career in country music, though, the stigma of being a gay artist was off-putting to many. “It’s changing now,” Clarkson said, but at the time being out was not acceptable in country music.“He had to go a different way, and in the end, it’s worked out for him,” said Clarkson of McAnally, who channeled his considerable talents into writing hits for other.Now Shane McAnally is a multiple-time Grammy and Academy of Country Music Award-winner who has written No. 1 country singles for everyone from Kenny Chesney and Keith Urban to Miranda Lambert and former Hootie & The Blowfish frontman Darius Rucker.He was named the 2014 ACM Songwriter of the Year and won two Grammys for work on Kacey Musgraves’ breakthrough Same Trailer Different Park. He appears on-track for another blockbuster year as Sam Hunt’s “Body Like a Back Road,” written by McAnally, crossed into the Top 10 at pop radio and is the biggest country single of 2017. He is presently at work on a Broadway musical based on the TV classic “Hee Haw.”“It’s insane all the stuff he’s accomplishing,” Clarkson gushed about the man who contributed two songs to her chart-topping 2015 album Piece By Piece.“But what’s sad about that for me – as a friend who’s watching – is he could have sang all that shit himself,” she lamented. “He’s an amazing singer, an amazing performer, but nobody could get past [his being gay].”LISTEN: Party Foul Radio Interviews Kelly Clarkson"

In September, Trump threatened to “totally destroy” the rogue nation, which is home to an estimated 25 million people, if provoked.Pyongyang has made significant advancements to its internationally condemned nuclear program this year and has repeatedly claimed that it is capable of striking the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile. Kim’s regime is expected to be a key topic of discussion during Trump’s meetings in China, South Korea and Japan.As tensions rise, experts fear Trump’s response to the situation is only fanning the flames, not dousing the fire.“Trumpian rhetoric to ‘totally destroy’ North Korea is not helpful at a time when, alarmingly, the likelihood of all-out war on the Korean Peninsula has moved from remotely possible to almost palpable,” William Choong and Alexander Neill, senior fellows at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote in a report published Friday.“It is critically important for Asia-Pacific security that Trump does not fly off the handle,” they warned.On Thursday, national security adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters Trump is unlikely to moderate his remarks overseas.“The president will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously,” McMaster said. “I don’t think the president really modulates his language. I mean, have you noticed him do that? He has been very clear about that.”This is hardly surprising to Catherine Dill, a defense analyst at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, but it is “absolutely concerning.”“In my view, with North Korea ― and to some degree, also with [U.S.] allies in the region ― there is a real risk of miscalculation and unintended escalation. A lot of that could occur because of sloppy rhetoric,” she said.If Trump makes bellicose comments about Pyongyang during his travels through Asia, Dill worries possible reactions from the North Korean regime could range from moderate, such as a short-range missile test, to severe, like a longer-range missile launch that overflies Japan.She’s not optimistic that Trump’s visit to Asia will serve to improve relations with the North Korean regime. “I don’t really have any hopes,” she said with a laugh. “I think the best possible outcome is that it doesn’t lead to war.”On the other hand, Dill sees the trip as an opportunity for Trump to “reassure Japan and South Korea, and also try to have a measured, constructive conversation with China.”Due to their proximity to North Korea, American allies Tokyo and Seoul are especially vulnerable to a potential retaliatory attack by Pyongyang if it felt threatened or provoked. Trump has aggressively pressured Beijing to leverage its influence over the hermit kingdom to curb its nuclear ambitions.Jeffrey Lewis, director of Middlebury’s East Asia Nonproliferation Program, also frets that more hostile statements or tweets from Trump about North Korea could exacerbate an already-tense standoff between Washington and Pyongyang. The president’s taunts and derogatory nicknames for Kim, such as “Little Rocket Man” and other insults, “create an incentive for the North Koreans to stage provocations to show him up,” said Lewis. If the situation deteriorates into an acute crisis, such aggravating remarks from Trump could give the impression that a military strike is imminent, he added. “If that happens, my belief is the North Koreans would use their nuclear weapons first, in order to try to repel an invasion.”Lewis does not anticipate a nuclear test or missile launch by North Korea during Trump’s Asia trip but notes that “it’s possible they’ll try to upstage [Trump]” with such a provocation as a form of political messaging.“[North Korea] could totally do that. That is the kind of thing that they would do,” but they tend to scale back their missile tests during the colder months, he explained. The regime has timed several tests to coincide with politically significant events, including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to America and the eve of Independence Day in the U.S.As to whether Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric would be more damaging if issued while he’s in Asia rather than back in Washington, Lewis said, “It’s all bad.” He likened the scenarios to choosing “between plague and cholera.”"

The work of historical fiction revolves around the titular Grace Marks, a 19th-century servant accused of brutally murdering the master of her household and his mistress, a fellow housekeeper, with the help of a stablehand. The real-life crime rocked Upper Canada in 1843, hurling the Victorian community into a salacious trial that amounted to a life sentence for Marks and a hanging for her accomplice. After 30 years in prison, Grace was eventually pardoned, but her exoneration was a mere consolation prize after decades of living as a notorious woman.“Murderess is a strong word to have attached to you,” Marks says in Atwood’s book. “It has a smell to it, that word ― musky and oppressive, like dead flowers in a vase. Sometimes at night I whisper it over to myself: Murderess, murderess. It rustles, like a taffeta skirt across the floor.”Polley brought the beloved Atwoodian tale to life with the help of acclaimed “American Psycho” director Mary Harron. Together, they created a six-episode miniseries that places Marks, expertly played by Sarah Gadon, as its center of gravity. She at times appears powerless, the product of poverty and neglect forced into an unforgiving life of servitude, and at other times as a careless and deliberate enigma, driven by an internal force we’ve yet to understand. Is she a cold-blooded killer, or a unduly scorned castaway?Both Atwood and the Polley-Harron adaptation team shy away from answering that question. Instead, the new Netflix series is at its best when it sinks into the historic details that complicate Marks’ narrative. In the show’s meticulously crafted world, an echo of real 19th-century horrors, lower-class women are relegated to sexual prey, cast as the constant targets of unwanted advances and the unfortunate recipients of botched abortions. Indeed, if “Handmaid’s Tale” is the fundamentalist dystopia of our future, “Alias Grace” makes it its mission to paint a clear picture of the overlooked history that would make Gilead possible.We spoke to Harron ahead of the show’s premiere on Nov. 3. and she echoed Polley’s unnerving parallel between both hair-raising Atwood adaptations, and explained what it was like bringing the story of Grace Marks to life.What initially drew you to the adaptation of Alias Grace? Well, I hadn’t read the novel. I knew nothing about the story going in, I had no preconceptions about it. But it’s such a fantastic plot. You get totally drawn into this world. I’ve always loved ambiguity and mystery, and also a female character who suffers a lot but isn’t conventionally, like, “Oh, poor Grace.” She’s very complicated. Is she good? Is she bad? Have the things she’s suffered turned her into a murderer? All of these things. I was very drawn into the world right away.Were you a Margaret Atwood fan before this?Yeah, I’m Canadian, so of course. I was also at university in the ’70s when her first novels started coming out. Or, at least, that’s when I started discovering them. She had a big impact on feminism at the point ― of that generation. I was very affected by the stories that she was telling. But I hadn’t read her most recent stuff. So it was a real revelation. [Alias Grace] is actually my favorite Margaret Atwood novel now.The novel is based on a real crime that happened in Canada in the 1840s. Were you aware of the story of Grace Marks at all?I read a couple reviews of [Atwood’s] book when it came out, but I had never heard of [Marks]. It was very mysterious. I’ve done a lot of period drama ― my first film [“I Shot Andy Warhol”] was the 1960s, “Bettie Page” was the 1950s, “American Psycho” was the 1980s. I studied literature at university ― I’m pretty steeped in the Victorian novel ― so I always wanted to do a period drama like this. This is a very interesting take on a 19th-century story.The story revolves around perhaps one of the most enigmatic characters Margaret Atwood ever wrote. If you could give your own character description of Grace Marks, what would it be?This is important: She’s a young girl, Protestant, from Northern Ireland. She’s very competent and capable and bright. She’s the sort of person who could have run a corporation, but she’s born into a world of incredible poverty and oppression, and she suffers greatly. She’s quite puritanical, like a lot of Northern Irish Protestants. I can say that, because my family’s from there. She has love in her heart, but the question is: With all her sufferings, did they make her a better person or a worse person? With all the terrible things that she has had to go through, which way did they turn her in the end? I had this conversation with Margaret Atwood. People think that suffering makes you noble, but not always. Sometimes, a lot of suffering can turn you. It can make you vindictive and murderess. You don’t know. Yes, that’s certainly one of the intriguing aspects of the way Atwood wrote the character. You don’t necessarily know if Grace is the protagonist or the antagonist of the story. And that doesn’t really seem to be the point. There’s not a whole lot of morality to it; it’s simply an interesting character exploration.Yes. It’s a real-life story. Although there’s not a lot known about Grace, there are certain historical records and interviews with people at the time about what happened during those murders. I love real-life stories, because the behaviors are always so contradictory. It’s like ... why? Why didn’t you tell anyone? Why, when the butcher answered the door, didn’t you tell him that [James] McDermott was going to kill someone? You know? It’s funny, when Sarah Gadon and I were going through the script and making notes on the character together, we were like, “Grace, what were you thinking?” You think you know her, Grace. You think you have a line on her, but then there is some piece of the story that puts that out of whack. As with Simon [Jordan] during the drama. Simon is constantly being turned around and bewildered by her, and banging his head against the wall, because you can never quite get a handle on who she is.  During a TIFF masterclass this year, you told audiences that the key to eliciting a standout performance from your actors is “entirely casting.” What was the process like casting Sarah Gadon in the role of Grace? How did you know she was the one?I had worked with her before, six or seven years ago, on a movie called “The Moth Diaries,” in which she was playing 16 [years old], actually. I’d seen hundreds of people for the role I cast her in, and she actually recorded an audition for me on her computer, because she was filming overseas. As soon as I saw her, I thought, this girl is remarkable. When you meet her, she’s sort of an old soul, a very impressive person. And working with her, she’s very subtle. She does what I really like in actors, she does a lot of layers. She makes adjustments very quickly. Even as a young actress who hadn’t done that many movies, she could make these incredible subtle changes and imply a lot going on below the surface. And also, with Grace, you want someone who is very beautiful, but who has a mystery to them, which she has kind of effortlessly. You could really just watch her face for a long time. And with Edward [Holcroft], too. You know, there are these long scenes where they are just sitting in a room talking. You want to be able to linger on their faces.What kind of research did you do before filming ― in terms of reading up on the era and real-life crime?Margaret Atwood had recommended some books. She gave Sarah Polley a sort of book list, and I read one in particular ― a 19th-century woman’s account of traveling through Canada. That was really interesting on the condition of servant girls as sexual prey. It’s always interesting to read contemporary accounts that give the attitudes of the time. Margaret Atwood had done so much research into language. Usually I’m very bothered by period inaccuracies and dialogue anachronisms, but Margaret Atwood has done all the work. She is very authentic, not just in how people talked, but how they thought and behaved. You know, women thought in very different ways [in the 1800s]. Grace saw her life very differently than a woman today sees her life, or sees sexuality, religion, everything. But in terms of the kind of research I had to do, that was more with the production designer about getting the actual details of the world right. And for Sarah Gadon, she had to learn how to do all this housework! She had to learn how to sew and quilt. I didn’t want her faking, and she didn’t want to either. She’s quilting throughout so many of those conversations, so she had to be so good at it she could do it without looking. And it has to be completely natural. She spent weeks and months learning. Domestic labor is a whole story in that.Watching [Gadon] as Grace, you can actually see calluses on her hands.Right! I was with the makeup department and I was like, “You have to roughen her hands.” She has beautiful hands, you know. So she did some of it herself, and then we had the makeup team roughen them up, too. You spent time at Ontario’s Kingston Penitentiary, where the real Grace Marks actually spent time during her lifetime. What was it like filming there?That was another interesting thing. When I read the script, the way that they were written, the cell was a much bigger cell. But when we went on our location scout to Kingston Penitentiary, and also to penitentiary’s museum, we saw a reproduction of a prison cell from the 19th century. It was almost a 5-foot coffin, the size of a single bed. And that’s where people would spend half their lives. I was very taken by this, by this idea that [Grace] was buried alive for all these years ― all of the prisoners were. So I had to persuade everybody, because it made it much more difficult to shoot, to make the cell smaller. She could still stand up, because we made it a foot wider. I knew it would be hard to shoot, because we couldn’t get the camera inside the room, but the production designer agreed with me ― this is important and we need to make it real. The other thing that came out from that museum, which wasn’t actually in the original script or the book, was this thing called “the box,” where they’d put prisoners inside this upright coffin. There’s this scene with Grace where you see her face in a little hole in the wood and she’s screaming. We just saw that box, and I asked Sarah [Polley] to write that in. It’s horrifying. It’s medieval. I mean, the rules ... you get whipped for looking or whispering or if you laugh or smile. It was barbaric, and we wanted to show that for real. Was that difficult for Sarah Gadon to perform? Did the authentic setting bring a different kind of gravity to the script?I thought it did. It was tough on her. I stepped inside that box to see what it was like and I was like, oh my God, let me out. I wouldn’t force an actress to do it, but I think most actresses who are taking it seriously want to go there and experience some of this.One of my favorite lines from the 1996 NYT review of “Alias Grace” reads: “There’s nothing like the spectacle of female villainy brought to justice to revive the ancient, tired, apparently endless debate over whether women are by nature saintly or demonic.” This is obviously a central theme in Atwood’s book. How did you and Sarah Polley go about bringing this “debate” to light in your adaptation?Sarah Polley has a really great quote about this, about women conforming so much and playing to other people’s expectations of them. Of women playing different roles and playing different people in different circumstances. That’s what she’s referring to in those first few words of the script, when [Grace] says, “People think I’m a female demon. People think I’m a poor innocent victim. People think I’m this and that.” What is the essential woman? Victorian women, especially, have all these images put on them. I also loved the idea that one woman can be seen and get to portray a character in such different ways, without you knowing which is the real one. That allowed a much more complicated female character. One of the things I love about Margaret Atwood is that she’s never like, “Men are bad and women are good.” She’s writing about harsh social pressures and injustices that don’t always bring out the best in people. Like the relationship between Grace and Nancy [Montgomery], who are both really victims of society, both working-class girls, one of whom is pregnant and has managed to claw a little status for herself. I think Margaret Atwood has this view of women that they can become like rats in a cage ― they can turn on each other, because there’s so little safety for them. That was very truthful, about how tough social settings can bring out competitiveness and rivalries. You would like to think that women are always [supportive], but …What was it like having Margaret Atwood on set? And directing her in a cameo role?Oh, it was fun. I didn’t have to do too much directing. There was a lot of panic because the schedule had gone wrong. It was like the second day of shooting, and she was waiting around in a heavy costume in 90 degree heat for hours and hours. We were like, “Ahhhh.” But she was very good about it. And I think she was very amused, because on her trailer it said, “Difficult Woman.” That was her name in the [episode].How much, if at all, did she shape the adaptation? I don’t know, I’m not privy to that. Sarah showed her a lot of the drafts at every stage, I think. I think [Atwood’s] pretty hands off, but Sarah Polley was anxious that it be very faithful, so she ran a lot of it by her. Obviously the whole show is coming out in the wake of “Handmaid’s Tale” Season 1. If it’s possible for there to be more fandom around Margaret Atwood, now seems to be the time. Many fans saw “Handmaid’s Tale” as an overtly feminist show that inspired a lot of activism. Did you envision “Alias Grace” as an overtly feminist show?It’s feminist in the sense that it’s presenting a neglected and important piece of female history, which is the lives of female servants in a realistic way. The story of Mary Whitney happened to tens of thousands of girls. Hundreds of thousands of girls got pregnant, were raped or were seduced and abandoned, were sexual fodder for upper-class men. And that’s a really neglected part of history, you know, of what these girls’ lives were like. Sarah Polley said that “Alias Grace” is where we come from, and “Handmaid’s Tale” is where we might go. It’s important politically to know where you come from in an accurate way. The same thing is happening with how we look at slavery or the Confederacy and the Civil War. It’s important for us to dig back and say, “We have certain versions of the past, but are there other versions we need to be aware of?” In this case, there’s a somewhat idealized view of the country house, and the happy servants who love their masters and the masters who care for their servants. Is this true? No! Those servants were unbelievably exploited. Especially the young women, who were sexual prey to all the young men. They’d get pregnant, and that was the end of them. What was it like to get an abortion back then? Well, we’ll show you. It’s not even that long ago, and that’s what our society’s grown out of. We need to remind ourselves of that. I remember when I was living in London there was this idea of returning to Victorian values. Well, those are Victorian values: child labor and young women being thrown out into the streets. That’s our history. That theme seems particularly relevant in a time when a president wants to “Make America Great Again.”[Laughs] A lot of the time we want to idealize the past, and that can have a political agenda behind it. People idealize the 1950s in America for the same reason ― that was a Reagan thing. Let’s return the ’50s. Well ... segregation. In terms of women’s stories, there a lot of stories that haven’t been told and perspectives that haven’t been shown. “Alias Grace” is not necessarily as obvious a call to action [as “Handmaid’s Tale], but that doesn’t mean it’s not an important perspective.You have a history of showcasing women’s stories. You’ve made films about Valerie Solanas, Bettie Page and Anna Nicole Smith. Are there any other outré women, who might similarly challenge notions of femininity, that you’d be interested in spotlighting in a film?Right now I’m casting for this Manson girls project. The interest there is: How do these seemingly normal, hippy girls end up doing these terrible things? What was their relationship to the cult? Why did they give over their will to this crazy leader? Part of the film is set in the early ’70s, when they are in prison, and part of the story is told from the Manson ranch. People don’t really take an interest in the girls when they tell that story. They don’t really show how it happened ― how they came to do these things. How could they? How did they? What’s the story there? There was this young feminist in her early 30s who came and gave classes to the Manson girls and wrote a book about them. I’m always interested in an untold story. And not just a straightforward story of a noble struggle, but looking at quite complicated issues of female behavior. Can’t get more complicated than the Manson girls.Taking it back a bit, you refused to cast Leonardo DiCaprio in “American Psycho” in part because his fan base at the time consisted of teenagers, and because you’d already tapped Christian Bale. What was it like pushing back on studio executives at the time?Well, I got fired, so that’s what it was like. [Editor’s Note: Harron was eventually reinstated as director of “American Psycho.”] Or you could say I quit, but they fired me because I didn’t want to meet with DiCaprio and I didn’t want to cast him. I’d already said I would cast Christian, who wasn’t famous at the time. Leo was. I think everyone thought I was crazy. There were two things: I thought Leo was a great actor but he wasn’t right for it. Christian was right for it. And I would never make a film if I didn’t think the lead was right. But I also knew that if they brought on the biggest star in the world for “American Psycho,” they’d totally rewrite the script and I would lose control over the tone of it. I also thought it was totally inappropriate for this actor with a huge fan base of young girls to play this role. It just seemed wrong on so many levels. It was an advantage with Christian Bale to have someone who wasn’t as famous, because people didn’t have a lot of preconceptions. His fame didn’t get in the way.I’m very, very specific about casting and I’ve been through many casting battles. I don’t think I’ve been with a film without having a casting battle. It’s the one thing that’s make-or-break for me. I really will not do a film if I don’t think the lead is right for it. No good film was ever made if the lead was miscast. Making a film is hard enough. But Netflix was very good. They said, “You don’t have to cast stars.” And I think this will make a star out of Sarah Gadon.Has it gotten any easier over the course of your career to assert yourself in that arena and have a position of power in these casting dilemmas?No, it really hasn’t. And you’d think it would.  Last question: Why isn’t “I Shot Andy Warhol” available to stream anywhere?I just saw Christine Vachon, the producer, at the premiere of the Todd Haynes movie [“Wonderstruck”], and she said they’re looking into getting the rights back. It’s one of those things, the company that distributed it went out of business. It breaks my heart that that film isn’t available. There are all these great actors in it. Lili Taylor. Justin Theroux’s first film! I would so love to see that film back. So, we’re working on it.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. “Alias Grace” is now streaming on Netflix. "

The singer noted that he considers these harmful restrictions placed on children while raising his daughter, Luna, with Chrissy Teigen. “I see it even as I’m raising my daughter. The kinds of toys that are most likely given to girls versus the ones that are given to boys. The kinds of careers kids are steered into, even at a young age, that are seen as more feminine or more masculine,” he said, adding later, “We’re being taught very early on from movies and from the playground and all kinds of other things about how we’re supposed to interact with each other and perform our gender. We’re being indoctrinated pretty early on.”Legend also touched on his experience as a man of color, saying he feels that black men are frequently expected to be more masculine than other men.“Some of this expectation we put on ourselves, I think, to some extent,” he said. “But it’s also driven from other people, as well as from the broader phenomenon of hyper-masculinity. This manifests itself in a lot of ways that can be really harmful for us and for the people we interact with, women in particular.”The musician credited his father with teaching him to think outside of restrictive gender norms. His dad was a manufacturing worker on an assembly line (a “stereotypically manly job,” as Legend put it), but also was open about his love for fashion and being expressive.“I feel like we always felt like we had the permission to be artists,” Legend said. “It was three boys and one girl that my dad raised, and we always felt like we had the permission to be confident in doing that kind of thing.”In August, Legend talked about the same topics with Cosmopolitan and explained that men aren’t encouraged to be vocal about their feelings.″[Men] are afraid of talking about their fears and insecurities,” he said. “They’re afraid of expressing emotion beyond anger, dominance, or power, and they’re afraid of getting in touch with their feminine side.”Echoing that idea, Legend told NBC News that he encourages boys to accept their fears in order to challenge themselves and overcome them. He also advised boys who will soon become men to simply listen.“Well, I think part of it is to learn, to listen, to pay attention to other people and not only learn from books and from outside media, but also listen to your classmates,” Legend said. “Listen to women. Listen to people who are different from you and develop a sense of empathy for the things that they’re going through. I think we should all be humble and we should all listen to each other and learn from each other.”Read Legend’s interview in full on NBC News’ Think section."

By accepting a media credential, reporters agree to “refrain from focusing [coverage on] ... gun rights, political affiliations or topics of the like” to make attendees “feel comfortable” at the CMA Awards, taking place Nov. 8 at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville.The rule was set following the Las Vegas shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival last month during a Jason Aldean performance, which left almost 60 people dead and hundreds injured, according to the media guidelines release.In light of recent events, and out of respect for the artists directly or indirectly involved, please refrain from focusing your coverage of the CMA Awards Red Carpet and Backstage Media Center on the Las Vegas tragedy, gun rights, political affiliations or topics of the like. It’s vital, more so this year than in year’s past due to the sensitivities at hand, that the CMA Awards be a celebration of Country Music and the artists that make this genre so great. It’s an evening to honor the outstanding achievements in Country Music of the previous year and we want everyone to feel comfortable talking to press about this exciting time. If you are reported as straying from these guidelines, your credential will be reviewed and potentially revoked via security escort. We appreciate your cooperation in advance. If you have any concerns on your coverage plans, please reach out to the CMA Communications team in advance so we can be a great partner as we celebrate “The 51st Annual CMA Awards.” Currently, the press list includes journalists from major outlets, including ABC, NBC, The Los Angeles Times, Associated Press and USA Today. Rolling Stone spoke with Brad Paisley, who is once again set to host this year’s awards show alongside Carrie Underwood, about taking the stage after the Las Vegas massacre and how to properly handle it. “We’re not going to ignore it, but we’re not going to also dwell on that,” he said. “We have to make sure we honor those we’ve lost, but we also [have to] celebrate this music, which lives on, and do a good job having the heart we need to have on that night. And also the theme of the show this year is very much about unity and coming together as a format.”On Friday, Paisely tweeted his disapproval of the guidelines. A rep for the Country Music Association did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment."

And the travel ban, the Muslim ban, is un-American, is unacceptable.”All Dulles Area Muslim Society is one of the largest mosques in the United States. It regularly hosts political candidates, but it does not endorse them. Ed Gillespie, Northam’s Republican opponent, also stopped by to speak there this year.This week, two federal judges struck down the latest iteration of President Donald Trump’s travel ban, which restricts people from a handful of mostly Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. They said the ban appeared to be a veiled, unconstitutional attempt to bar Muslims based on their religion ― a proposal Trump explicitly called for during last year’s presidential campaign.In his brief remarks on Friday, Northam, who is a pediatrician, stressed the need to give kids a quality education and affordable health care. He also noted that he had protested against Trump’s first travel ban in February at nearby Dulles International Airport.Northam’s introductory speaker was far more blunt about the ban.Robert Maro, an activist who stood alongside the lieutenant governor and several Virginia House delegates, asked worshippers in the prayer room to raise their hands if they opposed the idea of banning Muslims coming into the U.S. A few arms went up, but most of the room stayed seated, listening or engaged in prayer.“I see people who don’t have their hands raised. Do you not oppose that?” Maro asked.“Who thinks it’s OK to lie?” he tried again.Northam was received warmly at the event, shaking hands and greeting mosque leaders who thanked him for coming. It was apparent, however, that some attendees on Friday were showing signs of election fatigue due to the steady stream of candidates who had addressed the Muslim community there in recent weeks.“They’re getting a little bit jaded, so this is an idea of waking them up,” Maro said later of his attempt to warm up the crowd. Even as he was busy denouncing Trump for his immigration-related executive actions, Northam faced questions about his own record on immigration on Friday. Democracy for America, a major national progressive group, denounced Northam’s campaign as “gutless” and “racist” this week after Northam said he would sign a bill banning so-called “sanctuary cities,” or municipalities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, should any Virginia locality pursue that status in the future.  The broadside from Democracy for America, which had never supported Northam’s campaign, unleashed an intraparty squabble that threatened his campaign’s momentum just days before Tuesday’s election.Speaking with HuffPost after the event, Northam insisted that “nothing has changed with my stance on sanctuary cities.”Northam also continued to distance himself from a controversial ad run by a Latino Democratic group that has since been taken off the air. The ad showed young children of color fleeing a white man in a pickup truck with a Confederate flag and a Gillespie bumper sticker. The Washington Post editorial board, which endorsed Northam, said the ad “had no place” in the race.“It was their choice to promote that ad. That is not an ad that I would have run,” Northam told HuffPost.Northam dodged a question, however, over whether he explicitly denounced the ad, maintaining only that he would not have made the decision to put it on air.“We’re running a positive campaign,” Northam insisted. “[Gillespie] is running a campaign that’s trying to scare people, that’s trying to promote fear mongering, the hatred and bigotry.” "

He muttered a few words, none of which were intelligible.

He happily brought the contents of his desk home in one box. Despite struggling with anxiety and depression, he always seemed sunny and had a good sense of humor about himself. I think he was just excited to have the time with us kids and more time to work on his projects around the house. From then on he woke up early and waited for the bus with my two youngest siblings. He was outside in the garage for most of the day and took walks with the dogs.During this time, my own depression and anxiety surfaced. I was trying to decide where I wanted to go in life and what I wanted my future to be like. For no particular reason, I had thoughts of suicide. I was training for a Tae Kwon Do tournament and I’d run through the woods, wondering what it would be like if a hunter just accidentally shot me.I mentioned it in passing to a few people, but that was the extent of it.Eventually my father’s decay started. He had trouble with the TV remote. He stopped driving unless it was just down to the end of the driveway. His projects went unfinished, he slept in more, he struggled with his cell phone, and developed echolalia and had more difficulty keeping up with a conversation.I still didn’t talk to him about it.He only mentioned it to me once. My mom and I weren’t getting along. I wanted to leave home, maybe go to college or in general just find my own way. She was drinking again and was always busy, since she was the only parent working.I was lifting weights in the garage and he was there at his workbench. I don’t remember exactly, but he said something about wanting me to get along with my mom and to have the security blanket he did when I was his age. With his retirement, he was getting paid to be sick and that was a lucky thing.A few years later I moved out and went to college. Every time I went home he was a different person. He was just a ghost. Sometimes he was himself, sometimes he wasn’t, but either way, it felt as though the father I once knew was gone. Sometimes I feel that we’re not aware of who we are or who others are until they’re gone, like there’s this awareness that comes with loss where you go, “oh yeah, that’s what my dad was like.”My depression and anxiety became bad enough I sought help because suicide was on my mind on a frequent basis, again for a reason I couldn’t place. Again, I never talked about him even if he was on my mind. Eventually, I found the right balance of meds, therapy and self-awareness I needed to function.In the spring of 2014, four years after my mom told me he was sick, she called me and said that they were losing the house and they were going to move him into a nursing home.I came home for a few days to help them move. Just as I had before, I reacted positively to a negative situation, much like I may have reacted negatively to a positive situation. It’s just part of depression and this hero thing I have, where when everyone else is struggling I feel like I have to be the one to act like it’s okay. I feel like I have to be strong.But I was far from okay. I was drinking to deal with the pain and when I drank I didn’t stop. One time I went out and got so wasted someone called me a cab home, but I ended up waking up on the street, wandering home and having no idea whatsoever how I got there. I didn’t even tell anyone about it. I just moved on and acted like I didn’t have a problem.As for my dad, he didn’t take well to being put in a home. He wanted to be with my mom and tried to break out, succeeding one time and attempting to walk home, ending up somewhere off the highway, probably feeling much in the manner as I did when I woke up on the sidewalk. He was trying hard to remember and hold onto brain cells, whereas I was doing anything I could to kill them, anything to forget.I got married to my first wife at the end of that semester. I had buried all my past feelings and troubles, thinking that this happy event would make it go away. My dad couldn’t be there and that broke my heart, but strangely, I was pretty happy for a while. I visited my dad a week or two after the wedding, now that he was in a new home where he was doing a bit better.It was Father’s Day, and I remember how sunny and beautiful things were outside that large Victorian home where he now lived.I walked inside to a crowded room filled with dying people, pale withered, and lost looking. I asked to see my father and they told me he was right there, that I had missed him. They told him I was there to see him and to be careful not to talk about certain people, especially my mom. Because when he thought about us, it triggered his anxiety and confusion. He wanted to be home and he never would be again. He didn’t even know where home was.“It’s me, Jimmy,” I said. “Your son.”“Oh, Jimmy, right,” he said, like an old computer loading up information.We sat down together. He looked pleased. I told him I had gotten married and showed him the ring.He was excited. “Oh. Married, will you look at that.”Then he began to ask where I was living. He knew it was close by and asked if I could take him with me. Then, almost instantly without me saying it, he knew why I couldn’t. I felt tears well up in my eyes and the same look on his face.“She just left,” he said. “But that’s okay.”He wanted to know where my mom was. because he hadn’t seen her in months and if she came back he became confused and disoriented and would want to come home with her. His pale eyes now looked a darker blue and he told me to tell him. I couldn’t. He told me he had been thinking about the pool we had, that he could go back there and just jump in. He told me he wanted to just float away, walk off into the woods and end it. But then his focus shifted and he seemed happy again. I told him I had to go and he understood why. We hugged each other for the first time in I don’t know how long. Again, he stressed that it was okay.He’s still alive, but it’s like he’s already dead and every memory and any time that I’ve seen him since that time was just a visit with a ghost. He still haunts me and I’m okay with that.Previously published as ‘My Father, The Ghost’ in James’s OTHER FATHER column at The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:How I Fought My Fears of Failure and Success by Tim ClarkOn Speaking Our #MeToo Truths by Annie Mark-WestfallWhy Young Irish Women Are Marching for Choice by Lorna O’Hara"
64,HEALTHY LIVING,Why Do We Need Separate Chicken-Pox And Shingles Vaccines?,"The Atlantic, ContributorExploring the American idea since 1857",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-do-we-need-separate-chicken-pox-and-shingles-vaccines_us_59fc790ae4b01ec0dede4152,"The two diseases may arise from the same virus, but they afflict different populations and that is key.",2017-11-03,"<p>An electron micrograph of the varicella zoster virus, which causes both chicken pox and shingles.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fc79921d000014007f415d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sarah ZhangFor most of the time that humans have walked on Earth and scratched at itchy, red rashes, there was no reason to think chicken pox and shingles are related. They look so different.Chicken pox usually strikes small children. It manifests as red bumps, eventually distributed over the whole body. In the 18th century, a German doctor dubbed chicken pox “varicella,” a diminutive of his name for smallpox or “variola,” because chicken pox seemed to be its less severe form. Shingles, on the other hand, usually affects adults, and its rashes often appear as an angry red stripe across one side of the torso. This characteristic shape led ancient Greeks to call it “herpes zoster,” or roughly “creeping belt.”It was not until the the invention of powerful microscopes in the 20th century that the two became linked. Scientists could finally see that the diseases were in fact caused by the same virus, the now awkwardly named “varicella zoster virus.”RELATED: Cowpox and the ConstitutionThe virus, it turns out, never quite leaves the human body. It lurks inside neurons even after chicken-pox symptoms have cleared. Decades later, it can reawaken as shingles and infect skin cells along a single nerve, giving rise to the distinctive red stripe. The reactivated virus can also find new human hosts, born after the last outbreak and vulnerable to chicken pox. It’s a clever evolutionary gambit — you have to give it that.On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline to prevent shingles in adults age 50 and older, but not chicken pox. The two diseases may arise from the same virus, but they afflict different populations and that is key: The immune systems of the elderly susceptible to shingles are different from the immune systems of children susceptible to chicken pox.GlaxoSmithKline’s shingles vaccine contains a lone protein isolated from the shell of the varicella zoster virus. This protein acts as an ID tag, allowing the immune system to recognize all future varicella zoster viruses it encounters.RELATED: To Make Vaccines Anywhere, Just Add WaterOn the other hand, the existing chicken-pox vaccine, aimed at children, contains a whole, live, but weakened varicella zoster virus. “Live viral vaccines tend to work better in children,” says Ann Arvin, an infectious-disease specialist at Stanford University. (Arvin has consulted for both GlaxoSmithKline and Merck, which makes the chicken-pox vaccine.) The reasons are not entirely well understood, but children have a different mix of immune cells than adults, and live viruses tend to provide better, broader immunity through life.But live viruses, even weakened in a vaccine, can pose problems for people whose immune systems are weak due to age or disease. Such vaccines could make them sick. There is an existing shingles vaccine, made by Merck — basically a super-large dose of its live chicken-pox vaccine — but it is not recommended for immunocompromised patients.It also works less well than GlaxoSmithKline’s new vaccine, which is more than 90 percent effective. “It’s a real paradigm shift because there are no vaccines that perform so extraordinarily well for people in their 70s and their 80s,” says Rafael Harpaz, an infectious-disease specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists attribute its stunning effectiveness to a new adjuvant, an additional chemical in the vaccine that primes the immune system for the viral protein. A CDC panel on Wednesday actually voted to recommend GlaxoSmithKline’s new shingles vaccine even for people who had received Merck’s old shingles vaccine.RELATED: As the Number of Unvaccinated Americans Grows, Measles and Whooping Cough Make a ComebackBut could GlaxoSmithKline’s shingles vaccine work to prevent chicken pox as well? “We don’t know that, and I’m not sure if we ever will,” says Anne Gershon, a pediatric-disease specialist at Columbia University. (Gershon has received research funding from Merck and consulted for GlaxoSmithKline.) We might never know because someone would have to test it—and given that a safe, effective chicken-pox vaccine already exists, it’s unlikely anyone will ever take the risk. A GlaxoSmithKline spokesperson confirmed the company has no plans to test its vaccine for chicken pox.Conversely, the chicken-pox vaccine does seem to offer some protection against later occurrences of shingles. The weakened varicella zoster virus strain in vaccines also lurks dormant in neurons, but it does not reawaken so easily. Kids who got chicken-pox vaccines are less likely to later get shingles than kids who naturally caught chicken pox.Why shingles flares up at all is still largely a mystery. True, it often happens when a patient’s immune system is weak, like if they are older or have taken immune-suppressing drugs. But why does it also sometimes happen in seemingly healthy people? “We are clueless, and we’re on the chase,” says Harpaz.Harpaz has questioned the conventional wisdom that stress can lead to shingles. A few years ago, he got access to a large insurance data set, in which he could identify people whose spouses had became catastrophically ill or died unexpectedly. These people, presumably, would be under a lot of psychological stress. While the surviving spouses did in fact seek mental-health treatment in higher numbers, they did not seek more treatment for shingles. He and his colleagues wrote up a paper titled, “Psychological Stress as a Trigger for Herpes Zoster: Might the Conventional Wisdom Be Wrong?” Like most articles with questions in their titles, it doesn’t provide a definitive answer. Harpaz is still on the case.This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: Death at a Penn State Fraternity, Google X and the Science of Radical Creativity"
65,POLITICS,The GOP Tax Plan Includes One Really Good Idea,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-tax-reform-stadiums_us_59fc9e2fe4b04cdbeb32fc1e,And rich sports owners will hate it.,2017-11-03,The House GOP tax reform plan proposes eliminating a provision that has encouraged state and local governments to put billions of dollars in public tax money toward new sports stadiums.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fca0c41400003001d7eca1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― For three decades, wealthy sports owners have benefited from an obscure provision in federal tax law that has encouraged state and local governments to put billions of dollars in public tax money toward the construction of lavish new sports stadiums.But if House Republicans get their way, that will no longer be the case.The House GOP tax reform plan unveiled Thursday proposes eliminating the provision, which provides a federal tax exemption on the bonds states and municipalities use to finance sports stadium construction. The exemption, through discounted interest rates on the bonds, has put federal taxpayers on the hook for financing new stadiums across the country, costing them nearly $4 billion since 2000, according to a 2012 Bloomberg analysis.Under the House GOP plan, the interest on bonds that finance the construction or renovation of any stadium used for “professional sports exhibitions, games or training” at least five days a year would be subject to federal taxes.Unlike most of the other aspects of the House GOP’s tax plan, the elimination of the stadium provision likely has bipartisan support. Republican tax leaders have included its elimination in past proposals, and former President Barack Obama sought to ax the same subsidy in each of his final two budgets.The tax exemption is a product of the last major reform effort ― the 1986 Tax Reform Act, whose authors thought it would create a disincentive for states and cities when it came to throwing public money at sports stadiums. The idea was that debt requirements tied to the bonds would keep states from raising taxes or dipping into public coffers, but the result was almost entirely the opposite: The past 30 years have seen a boom in new stadium construction, with nearly every facility receiving some form of tax subsidy from cities attracted to the idea of cheap bond investment. It is common practice for the federal government to provide tax exemptions on state and local bonds that finance public purpose projects. But so-called private activity bonds, like those used to finance stadiums, are supposed to meet certain criteria outlined in the 1986 reform plan to get the same treatment. For stadiums specifically, no more than 10 percent of their debt can be repaid with revenues created inside the facility, and no more than 10 percent of an arena’s or stadium’s use can be for private business purposes.Stadiums rarely meet those criteria, but in part because teams have manipulated revenue figures, they have continued to receive tax-exempt bonds anyway ― a practice that has amounted to a direct handout to wealthy sports owners who are the primary beneficiaries of the facilities. New stadiums and arenas, for instance, have helped double the average value of professional sports franchises across the four major American sports leagues over the past two decades, according to Bloomberg.Eliminating the exemption won’t put an end to the public financing of sports stadiums, as state and local governments could still fund them with tax money. In theory, however, repealing the exemption would increase the cost of financing stadiums for states and municipalities, perhaps limiting how much they are willing to give them.It would also remove federal taxpayers from the equation, as the U.S. government would no longer be involved in subsidizing stadium construction.The savings from eliminating the provision are relatively meager ― an estimated $200 million over the next decade, according to Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation. In an analysis of Obama’s budget proposals, the Treasury previously estimated that repealing the exemption would save $542 million.But economists and tax experts have long called for eliminating the exemption under the argument that it unnecessarily puts public money behind projects that have little public benefit. Most economic studies have found that the costs of stadiums almost always exceed the benefits they provide to taxpayers or local communities.“Perfect,” Dennis Zimmerman, a former Congressional Research Service economist who recommended the exemption’s repeal in 1996, said when Obama first proposed nixing it in 2015. “You couldn’t do it any better if you believe like I do that we should not finance these things with tax-exempt debt.”Owners and their leagues, however, may not see it that way. Federal records show that Major League Baseball, for instance, has spent nearly $1 million lobbying Congress this year, including on “issues related to tax reform” and “issues related to stadium construction.” The NFL, meanwhile, has spent nearly $600,000 total lobbying Congress, with tax reform-related issues a part of its focus as well.Neither league immediately responded to requests for comment about their position on the stadium provision or whether their tax-related lobbying had concerned that specific proposal. Lobbying records show that neither the National Basketball Association nor the National Hockey League have lobbied Congress on tax-related issues this year."
66,POLITICS,"Progressive Group Calls Ralph Northam 'Racist,' Sparking Intra-Party Feud Ahead Of Big Election",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dfa-ralph-northam-virginia-governors-race_us_59fc9562e4b0415a420b7623,The Democratic candidate for Virginia governor said he would ban so-called “sanctuary cities” if one arose in the state.,2017-11-03,"Ralph Northam, Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia, has struggled to allay progressive skepticism throughout his campaign.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fc97521700002100795c47.jpeg?cache=fddblPnV0J&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A major national progressive group on Thursday denounced Ralph Northam, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, as “gutless” and “racist” for his remarks on immigration ― plunging Democrats into a bitter internecine squabble ahead of statewide elections on Tuesday.In a Wednesday interview with Norfolk, Virginia, TV news channel WAVY, Northam said he would sign a bill banning so-called “sanctuary cities,” or municipalities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, should any Virginia locality pursue that status in the future.Northam’s opponent, Republican Ed Gillespie, has run a series of misleading ads attacking Northam for a vote as lieutenant governor blocking a bill that would have preemptively banned municipalities from adopting these limits ― though Gillespie himself has acknowledged that no sanctuary cities exist in Virginia as of yet.Speaking to reporters Wednesday night after an event with Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, Northam claimed that he simply opposed preemptively banning sanctuary cities, and that his comments to WAVY were “what I’ve been saying all along.”The explanation was not enough, however, to assuage Democracy For America, a left-leaning online activism organization based in Burlington, Vermont. In response to what DFA called Northam’s “backtrack on his commitment to standing up for immigrant families,” the group declared that it would end “any work to directly aid” his campaign.“After seeing Northam play directly into the hands of Republicans’ racist anti-immigrant rhetoric on sanctuary cities, we refuse to be silent any longer and even remotely complicit in the disastrous, racist, and voter-turnout-depressing campaign Ralph Northam appears intent on running,” DFA executive director Charles Chamberlain said in a statement.DFA’s criticism of Northam is largely symbolic. The organization never contributed money to Northam directly; it has not even endorsed him. And according to Chamberlain, DFA had already removed Northam from its members’ get-out-the-vote call lists in October, following the campaign’s removal of Justin Fairfax, Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor in Virginia, from some campaign literature at the behest of a labor union that had a policy dispute with Fairfax. The decision drew criticism from African-American and progressive groups angry that the campaign had marginalized Fairfax, who, if elected, would be just the second black statewide elected official in Virginia’s history.But DFA’s decision to blast Northam days ahead of the election nonetheless reflects the challenge the moderate lieutenant governor faces in shoring up his base ― and previews the intraparty sniping that is likely to take place if Northam loses. Some progressive activists were clearly pleased with DFA for taking a stand against Northam’s backtracking.A spokesman for Ellison declined to comment on the situation. A spokesman for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.For the most part, though, Democrats expressed their frustration with DFA for seemingly making the perfect the enemy of the good so soon before a high-stakes election.Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee who founded DFA, called the group’s announcement “incredibly stupid.”Dean, who has cultivated a more moderate record as a Washington insider in the years since his insurgent 2004 presidential run, formally ended his affiliation with DFA when he began exploring the possibility of another bid to run the DNC in November 2016. Dean had long since broken with the organization on key political questions. For example, he backed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential primary, despite DFA’s endorsement of Sanders. In a tweet Friday morning, Dean claimed that he had “cut his ties” with DFA not “over Bernie, who has been a positive influence,” but because he “saw stuff like the Northam statement.”Dean did not immediately respond to an email request to elaborate on his comments.HuffPost reached out to a number of national and state-based progressive groups to see if they were following DFA’s lead. None of them said they were.Nebraska Democratic Party Chairwoman Jane Kleeb, who dealt with similar criticism from national groups when pushing the campaign of an anti-abortion rights Omaha mayoral candidate in April, called DFA’s announcement “deplorable.”“I don’t come into your house, DFA, and tell you how to run your organization, so you should stay out of the partisan political lane as well,” she said.Addressing DFA’s continued support of Fairfax’s bid for lieutenant governor, Kleeb argued that “Fairfax and Northam are a team, and they need to be a team in the governor’s house in Virginia in order to lift up working-family policies again.”John O’Neill, a spokesman for the Virginia Education Association, a teachers union backing Northam, called DFA’s statement “regrettable” and said the union’s strategy “isn’t changing at all.”Anna Scholl, executive director of Progress Virginia, said her organization was “obviously disappointed in Dr. Northam’s comments.” But, she said, “it’s clear that there is only one person running a racist campaign for the governor’s mansion, and that person is Ed Gillespie.”Gillespie’s “racist attacks on Latino communities and now former felons are beyond the pale,” Scholl said, referring to Gillespie’s slamming Northam for restoring the voting rights of former felons.Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Campaign Change Committee, which has devoted much of its resources to turning out voters for Justin Fairfax and liberal House of Delegates candidates, nonetheless encouraged progressive Virginians to vote for Northam in a Thursday statement ― and stood by his remarks on Friday after DFA’s announcement.“Ralph Northam is not known as a progressive hero, but he is the Democratic nominee who needs to win in order to stand for the broader proposition that racism and going low will not be rewarded by voters,” Green said.Virginia-based immigration rights activists defended Northam’s bona fides as a supporter of immigration reform and fair treatment of undocumented immigrants. “Lt. Governor Northam has always fought for the Commonwealth to have immigration policies that are fair and compassionate,” Virginia Del. Alfonso Lopez (D) said in a statement released by the Northam campaign. Lopez noted that Northam opposes allowing law enforcement to hold undocumented immigrants longer than dictated by a warrant or judge’s order, and wants to ensure they can report crimes to the police without fear of repercussions.“Most importantly, he knows the difference between real legislation and ‘dog whistle’ policies crafted only to instill fear and create division,” Lopez said. “He hasn’t changed his positions ― he has always been consistent. And he has always been a consistent friend to the Latino and New American communities.”Gustavo Torres, president of the regional immigrant rights group CASA in Action, said in a statement that CASA remains “proud to support Ralph Northam.”  Our Revolution, the legacy organization for Sanders’ campaign, and the Working Families Party, a progressive Democratic faction, have each declined to make an endorsement in the Virginia race. Both groups declined to comment for this article.DFA’s Chamberlain acknowledged in an interview with HuffPost that there would be groups that disagree with DFA’s strategy. He insisted their goal was to get the Northam campaign to shift gears, not to discourage people from voting for him. DFA tried to communicate that message to the campaign privately for weeks before taking the criticism public, he said.“The bottom line is that we’re not looking to have all the support for Northam go out the door,” Chamberlain said. “We are trying to save the campaign. They have five days to course correct and make sure the Democratic base turns out to vote.”The statement from Lopez put out by the Northam campaign is “a good sign that they are” correcting their actions, Chamberlain added.It’s not clear whether the public Democratic Party spat will sway voters on Election Day. But it’s certainly not the narrative of unity that the party wanted to broadcast ahead of such a crucial election.The Republican National Committee gleefully highlighted the division as evidence of a Democratic “circular firing squad.”Northam’s “liberal base is calling him racist,” RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens wrote in an email to reporters. The incident came on the heels of a revelation earlier on Thursday that had already stoked simmering tensions between the progressive and establishment wings of the party. Donna Brazile, a former interim DNC chair and longtime party operative, published an explosive excerpt from a forthcoming book in which she revealed that the DNC had agreed to a joint fundraising agreement with Clinton in August 2015, months before she had locked up the nomination. The details were enough for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to confirm that she believed the primary process was rigged in Clinton’s favor.Earlier this week, the Latino Victory Fund also received criticism for a video ad promoting Northam that showed young children of color fleeing a white man in a pickup truck with a Confederate flag and an Ed Gillespie bumper sticker. LVF yanked the ad, but not before Northam had to answer for it. A campaign spokesman said that “Ralph Northam would not have run this ad.”Northam leads Gillespie by 3.5 percentage points, according to RealClearPolitics’ average of major polls. But several polls have shown Gillespie ahead, prompting Democratic fears that the party could lose a key battle in a state that Clinton won by 5 points in November.Amanda Terkel contributed reporting."

Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, announced Thursday that he would not seek re-election in 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fba6451700002100795af0.jpeg?cache=DGO0bHcJPs&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — A crowded field of Texas Democrats vying to unseat one of Washington’s most steadfast deniers of climate science got a welcome shock Thursday when Rep. Lamar Smith announced he would not seek re-election. Smith, chair of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, was first elected to serve Texas’ 21st Congressional District in 1986 and is the 14th-longest-serving member of the current U.S. House. The San Antonio native has a long and colorful history of dismissing the threat of climate change, recently going so far as to say that pumping the atmosphere full of carbon dioxide is “beneficial.”“It’s great news for the climate,” Derrick Crowe, a 37-year-old climate activist and progressive organizer who announced his candidacy in April, told HuffPost. “You have the climate change denier-in-chief in Congress retiring. That’s going to mean that we can replace that with progressive values and make a huge difference.”Smith, an early and loyal supporter of President Donald Trump, has received more than $750,000 from the oil and gas industry over his 30-year career. In his five years as chairman of the science committee, he has worked to defund climate research and harassed federal climate scientists, whom he has accused of playing “fast and loose” with data. He has also repeatedly sprinted to defend the fossil fuel industry, namely Exxon Mobil Corp., from investigations into their records on climate change. And he has used his power to push his anti-science agenda, stacking science committee hearings with coal and chemical lobbyists and climate skeptics.Democratic candidates lined up to challenge the 16-term House incumbent in 2018. Joseph Kopser, an aerospace engineer and Army veteran from Austin, told HuffPost that when it comes to the fight to mitigate climate change, Smith’s departure will be “good for all Texans.” He pointed to the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey in Houston, which climatologists say were made worse by climate change, and the scanty peach crop this year in the state. Although Kopser welcomed the congressman’s announcement — “We have accomplished our campaign’s first goal to #RetireLamarSmith,” he said in a written statement — he says it’s important that people stay engaged, as Smith remains a powerful force in Washington. In a statement Thursday, Smith said that “there is still much to do. There is legislation to enact, dozens of hearings to hold and hundreds of votes to cast.”Smith’s departure — he’s the 20th Republican in the House to either resign this year or reject a bid for re-election in 2018 — sets the stage for what will likely prove to be a crowded and spirited primary.Elliott McFadden, a progressive activist from Austin also running on the Democratic ticket, called on fellow Democrats to stay focused on winning Smith’s seat, which he said “will be a critical part of gaining back control of the U.S. House next year.”“We cannot swap one out of touch, corporate backed politician for another,” he said in a statement Thursday. “We need real representation in Central Texas.”Crowe, Kopser and McFadden all said they think Smith felt the pressure and opted to get out instead of losing the race. “He did see us coming,” said Kopser, who outraised Smith in the third quarter and has more than $200,000 cash on hand. “I think at the end of the day he did the math.” “Lamar Smith was an out of touch career politician who saw the writing on the wall, and threw in the towel in TX-21,” McFadded said in a statement.The district, which includes parts of Austin and San Antonio and stretches west into the Texas Hill Country, has been heavily gerrymandered to favor the GOP.Smith is among a trio of Republicans that nonprofit political action committee 314 Action has targeted for their anti-science views. And in Texas, a group of Democratic organizers has been working to support progressive candidates capable of ousting Smith. According to election data from the Daily Kos, Trump won the predominantly GOP district by just 10 points in 2016, compared with 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s nearly 22-point margin of victory.Crowe expects both the March 6 primary and Nov. 6 general election to be hard-fought. But Smith stepping down, he said, “shows that the pressure was real, that the shift was happening and that we’re about to take Congress.”"

69,WOMEN,Notre Dame Just Decided To Cut Birth Control Coverage For Students And Employees,Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/notre-dame-birth-control-contraception_us_59fbc300e4b01b4740497237,The Catholic university is one of the first high-profile employers to take advantage of a recent Trump administration rule.,2017-11-03,The University of Notre Dame has fought against the contraceptive mandate for years. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fc780a1700002c01795be6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Less than a month after the Trump administration rolled back an Obama-era rule guaranteeing contraceptive coverage at no cost to women, the University of Notre Dame has announced its plans to stop covering birth control for all of its students and employees.The Catholic university is one of the first high-profile employers to take advantage of the rule change, which allows any company claiming to have religious or moral objections to refuse to offer contraceptive coverage in its health insurance plans.Previously, Notre Dame provided contraceptive coverage through a third-party service, an “accommodation” the Affordable Care Act made available to nonprofit religious groups. The university did not actually have to arrange — or pay for — contraceptive coverage for students and faculty, but nonetheless made it available to women enrolled in its health insurance plans at no cost to them. Notre Dame was one of several religious groups that sued to try to get out of the federal mandate. In emails sent to students and faculty last week, the university explained that it would stop covering birth control for employees on Jan. 1 of next year, and for students after Aug. 15.By way of explanation, an email to Aetna student health plan enrollees said the school “honors the moral teachings of the Catholic Church.” A second email to faculty and staff explained that the medical plan will continue to allow prescriptions for birth control for “medical necessity,” as demonstrated by a doctor.A spokesperson for the university shared the emails with HuffPost, but declined to comment further.Students say Notre Dame has made it challenging to get birth control in other ways. The Walgreens-managed pharmacy on campus does not provide birth control unless students demonstrated a medical need outside of pregnancy prevention, even for students who do not have insurance through the university.“I use the campus pharmacy to refill prescriptions and when I first got here, I didn’t know [I could only get a refill] if I had a doctor’s note,” Emily Garrett, 21, a senior from New York, told HuffPost. “I was very surprised. I was raised in a Catholic household, but I never knew that the policies at Notre Dame were so restrictive of women’s health care.”The university’s decision to drop birth control coverage has been harshly criticized by reproductive health organizations like Planned Parenthood. On Tuesday, the National Women’s Law Center filed a complaint against the Trump administration’s interim final rules on behalf of five women in Indiana, including three University of Notre Dame students.“The idea here is that your employer can tell you how to use your insurance plan ... it’s not really that different from them telling you how to use your salary,” Adam Sonfield, senior policy manager with the reproductive health policy and advocacy organization Guttmacher Institute, told HuffPost. “For employers and employees, this is an earned benefit. And your employer should have no say.” Sonfield said health policy experts would be watching with great interest to see how many employers would take advantage of the new exemption, which should start to become clear this month. October is when many organizations offer open insurance enrollment for next year’s employer-based health care plans.On the University of Notre Dame campus, the mood is mixed, students say. There has been some organized pushback. After the Trump administration changes were announced, graduate students organized a demonstration on campus they called the “March for Reproductive Freedom.”But senior Molly Burton, 21, told HuffPost that she worries some students are being complacent about the changes because they are on private insurance plans through their parents. Others, she said, are not surprised by the decision given the university has fought against the Obamacare mandate for years. Burton said that she loves Notre Dame and is proud to be a Notre Dame student, but she is upset with what she sees as unnecessary meddling in women’s health.“I think people are frustrated,” she said, “with this continued attempt at denying us basic health care.”"
70,POLITICS,Twitter Should Purge Trump’s Account Of Millions Of Fake Followers,"Robert Stribley, ContributorWriter, Brooklyn",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/purge-trumps-bots_us_59fc653ce4b09afdf01c4204,"More than 300,000 follow only Trump on Twitter.",2017-11-03,<p>A tumblr message asks users to confirm their account status</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fc6a0a1d000016007f412b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Daily Dot reported recently on something many of us have suspected for months: Donald Trump’s infamous and sadly influential Twitter account is propped up by an army of fake followers and bots. The Dot shared data from SocialRank indicating that some 13 million of Trump’s followers may be of the fake variety. Or at least they’re inactive accounts. That’s nearly a third of his followers. A quarter of his followers have never tweeted. Not once. More than 300,000 follow only Trump on Twitter. Suspicious much?And The Daily Dot goes on to provide more data indicating that Trump’s account is likely being buttressed by bots and fake followers.Twitter would be entirely within their rights to purge these Trump bot and ghost followers. Of course, they’d be within their rights to purge any unused accounts from their platform after a given time. So they should do it.Other social media platforms do this. You’ve likely been prompted by emails from companies like Tumblr to see if you’re still using a seemingly inactive account. Those handles are then released back into the wild. Tumblr even allows users to claim a new handle later and to restore their dormant content.So Twitter could justify this move entirely as a non-targeted policy to free up unused Twitter handles just as many other social media platforms already do. This house cleaning need not be construed as singling out Donald Trump (even if he did inspire it), but as a way to scrub an effective but increasingly grungy platform, regardless of who the account or the followers belong to. It’s simply separating the wheat from the chaff.A technical aside? I’m guessing purging such accounts by the millions would increase the overall speed and performance of the platform, too. Someone with better development chops than me can keep me honest on that point.Perhaps the most important reason for this purge is to pre-emptively disarm any bots among Trump’s followers, which have been placed there to disseminate disinformation and create confusion when triggered at key moments. (We know these exist.) Within the last week or so, some have noticed what they believe to be a massive increase of bots following Trump’s account. Could this be someone preparing to sew confusion in the wake of any findings and indictments by the Mueller investigation? Whatever the purpose of these bots, if they can be manipulated in concert to act this way — as tools of disinformation, propaganda and confusion — it’s difficult to see why Twitter should maintain their presence.Regardless of who these bots belong to or which account they’re following, they arguably already breech Twitter’s policies or “automation rules,” specifically on not misleading users and how to respond to tweets via automation appropriately. Twitter would be well within their rights to strengthen and clarify these guidelines to justify removing organized bot armies used to spread misinformation in the form of political propaganda and to apply those guidelines so they reduce such activity by individuals and groups without discrimination across the political spectrum.Furthermore, Twitter could justify targeting prominent accounts like Trump’s simply to ensure accurate follower counts. This seems like a valid objective — especially where noteworthy accounts and public figures are concerned — because it addresses aspirational principles we should particularly value in such accounts, such as accuracy, authenticity, integrity and transparency. Where someone of Trump’s stature is concerned, isn’t an accurate presentation of his real follower count a public good? Don’t we deserve and shouldn’t we value a more accurate measure of his real support?Finally, this change would also undermine many users’ common attempts to game the system and draw attention to themselves by artificially inflating their accounts for marketing purposes. (Or ego purposes.) After all, if you’re free to buy Twitter followers, why shouldn’t Twitter have the ability to rebalance the system as often as possible and even to undermine the dynamics that populate its system with dreck?Purge away, I say.A version of this piece also appears on Medium.comFollow Robert Stribley on Twitter."

The same tactic was used for a rock climbing gym opened in September by a group of young engineers who, like Hodge, spend their weekdays working at Cummins Inc., the diesel engine company that is the city’s largest employer.“There’s not that much to do here for the young people,” said Juan Valencia, a 25-year-old Colombian immigrant who is one of the founders of the climbing gym. “We think this will help.”Before the gym opened, aficionados had to drive an hour north to Indianapolis or south to Louisville, Kentucky, for an indoor climbing wall.As the economy improves and millennials move around the country in search of jobs, some are finding themselves far from the youth culture they learned to expect from city life in other parts of the country. But the tradeoff can be a less burdensome cost of living, a more tightknit community, and a chance to make new towns their own.A Stateline analysis of census data showed the Columbus metro area at the top of a list of cities that have attracted young, educated people from out of state, yet are still relatively affordable.There are other areas whose young, educated populations are growing nearly as fast as some of the most famous youth magnets like Silicon Valley; Austin, Texas; and Nashville, Tennessee — but with more affordable housing. They include Midland, Michigan; Bloomington, Illinois; Idaho Falls, Idaho; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Bismarck, North Dakota; Morgantown, West Virginia; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Blacksburg, Virginia; and Rochester, Minnesota.In Columbus, the number of people ages 25 to 34 with a college degree has increased 62 percent since 2010, yet less than 20 percent of a typical household’s income goes to housing.Cummins has been on a hiring spree, and other young people have gravitated to the city’s small town feel.This Columbus has some buzz, if not as much as the Ohio city of the same name. A new movie, “Columbus,” has drawn fresh attention to the city’s quirky modernist architecture, which Cummins has supported, through a foundation, by subsidizing the design of public buildings by world class architects for 60 years. Columbus is also the hometown of Vice President Mike Pence.That ‘It’ FactorAn October analysis by ATTOM Data Solutions, which collects real estate data, counted Denver, Austin and Nashville among the “meat and potatoes” markets with looming affordability crises because home prices are rising faster than wages. The firm blames refugees from high-cost states and investors who buy up rental properties.Still-affordable cities like Columbus “may be attracting young people but they don’t have that ‘it’ factor yet, like an Austin or a Nashville or an Asheville [North Carolina],” said Daren Blomquist, an ATTOM vice president.For the youth culture to continue to evolve, more artists may need to join engineers in starting businesses, Blomquist said. “They need a critical mass of creative types doing their thing in these towns, and those people might not be there yet.”Jonathan Nesci, who designs metal furniture using some of the metal shops that serve Cummins, may fit the bill. He visited Columbus from Chicago in 2014 to work on the annual Exhibit Columbus project, which places temporary art installations in town to complement some of the architectural landmarks. (One of this year’s highlights is an installation of large timber discs intended to encourage people to circulate around a Henry Moore sculpture that sits in front of a public library designed by I.M. Pei.)At 33, Nesci decided to move here with his wife and two children. His rent is less than what he paid in Chicago, and his home has more than twice the space.“We could live anywhere. But almost as soon as I saw it I knew this was the place for us,” Nesci said. “The architecture is a huge factor, and the city’s support for it, the way that the city has embraced design.” Just attracting more young people is a major accomplishment for cities, said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank, but they may not remain affordable.“As these ‘real America’ towns become more attractive to today’s upwardly mobile youth, they should come to expect a rise in housing prices along with more upscale millennial amenities,” Frey said.In Columbus, there’s a downtown ice cream parlor with an old-fashioned soda fountain and bow-tie-clad servers. But the area has become more lively in recent years: There are cavernous bars with live music, a microbrewery that serves “Diesel Oil Stout” in homage to Cummins, new white-tablecloth restaurants — and it can be hard to find a parking space at night.Houses in the Columbus area typically cost less than $150,000, which is lower than the median value in two-thirds of the nation’s metro areas. But the influx of young professionals has started to put pressure on prices. The median rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $750, in the top 27 percent of metro areas, according to 2016 data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Young newcomers described rents between $850 and $1,200 in the coveted downtown area near the Cummins headquarters.Kyle Hendricks, 33, said he feels fortunate to have a one-bedroom apartment for $600 a month about a mile from downtown. Before moving here four years ago from Los Angeles, he said he was paying $1,000 a month for “literally a single room in a house.”Continued affordability may depend on how quickly housing can be made available to new residents, said Deirdre Pfeiffer, an associate professor and urban planning expert at Arizona State University who has studied the migration of millennials.“Places where the housing market is slow to respond, or government is more restrictive in terms of zoning, will have greater affordability issues,” Pfeiffer said. Hundreds of apartments are under construction in Columbus, according to Cindy Frey, president of the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce, with some set aside for low- and moderate-income residents that will rent for less than $400 a month.Knowledge WorkersCummins has a large and growing need for engineers, said John Burnett, a former Cummins recruiter who now runs an educational nonprofit in the region. Engine manufacturing was once a manual, blue-collar task, Burnett said, but many of today’s jobs require computer programming and other engineering skills.“People say we’re a manufacturing town, but the work that goes on now is very different. These are knowledge workers,” Burnett said. “There are a lot of engineers and other professional young people coming to the community because they possess that knowledge.”Many of the young professionals who work in Columbus have come from out of state, or from abroad. Burnett’s Community Education Coalition is working with local high schools and colleges to get more locals a share in Cummins’ success.Welders, technicians and equipment repair specialists can make annual salaries of $50,000 to $80,000 with two years or less of college training, he said, and the coalition is getting those courses into local community colleges and helping high schools prepare students for them.“We don’t want to create a bifurcated society like you see in some other cities, where you have a lot of smart young people moving in but you’re not paying sufficient attention to the people who are here,” Burnett said.Coming Back HomeThe relatively new youth culture in Columbus has even drawn some native sons and daughters back home from bigger cities.Jessie DeWeese, an attorney in her 20s who has lived in Chicago and Cleveland, had job offers in several cities but opted to move back to her hometown about 18 months ago.“As soon as I arrived, just random acquaintances were saying, ‘Oh, you want to practice law? Go talk to so-and-so.’ And now I have a job,” DeWeese said. “When you’re in the big city, people didn’t care about each other that much. Here everyone holds each other up and cares about the city.”Tyler Hodge, the coffee shop owner, is a Tennessee transplant who’s lived in Florida, Washington, D.C., and Brazil. Columbus, he said, has “really been a draw of young talent into an area that wouldn’t ordinarily be sought after — in the middle of the Midwest, surrounded by cornfields and soybeans.”Hendricks, who like DeWeese moved back here to his hometown four years ago, said the change in Columbus has been radical, as more young people have moved in, but it has yet to evolve into a real youth culture.“Growing up here, the diversity was not here, the young college-educated folks weren’t here except for engineers,” said Hendricks, a United Way marketing coordinator who is on a committee of young people lobbying city officials for a skate park.“It’s still not really set up for that 25-to-34 age group yet,” he said. “It’s more like 35 to 50.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"
72,MEDIA,Publisher Of The New Republic Resigns Amid Harassment Allegations,Jason Cherkis and Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hamilton-fish-new-republic-resigns_us_59fccfc8e4b04cdbeb333476,The magazine says it will continue its investigation into Hamilton Fish's conduct toward female staffers.,2017-11-03,"Hamilton Fish, the president and publisher of The New Republic, resigned on Friday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fcd09b1700002100795cf4.jpeg?cache=HshXOv2PRF&ops=crop_0_137_1984_1586%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Hamilton Fish, president and publisher of The New Republic, resigned from the magazine Friday, following allegations that he had mistreated female employees.Win McCormack, the owner of The New Republic, made the announcement in a memo to staff, noting that the investigation into Fish’s conduct would continue. “This won’t mean an end to the inquiry we’ve commissioned, as we want to understand everyone’s experiences in full, both on their own terms and for the purposes of looking ahead,” McCormack wrote. “If you happen not yet to receive the investigator’s contact details, with our invitation to connect with her, you should expect to today.”J.J. Gould, the editor of The New Republic, declined to comment for this article. Fish and McCormack did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In a letter to McCormack, Fish acknowledged complaints from employees that his presence in the office “had led them to feel uncomfortable at the New Republic.”“Women have longstanding and profound concerns with respect to their treatment in the workplace. Many men have a lot to learn in this regard. I know I do, and I hope for and encourage that new direction,” Fish wrote in his resignation letter to McCormack, which was obtained by The New York Times. “Still, it’s my sense that our office culture has been harmed, and the best way for me to help the organization move past this is by withdrawing.”Fish’s resignation comes about a week after female staffers at the magazine presented management with a complaint, detailing their grievances with the publisher. On Monday, HuffPost published an expose into Fish’s conduct, revealing allegations about his behavior toward female employees dating back a decade. Fish denied that the various incidents described in the piece took place. In one such incident, Fish allegedly grabbed a female employee by the neck, leaving red marks. At the time, he was president of The Nation Institute, a nonprofit organization that funds progressive journalism. Fish told HuffPost that the neck-grabbing incident did not happen as described, but he did not offer his own version of events. Female staffers at The Nation Institute also described Fish as consistently undermining them, making sexually suggestive jokes and assigning them menial tasks. He thought of The Nation Institute as his “personal domain,” one staffer told HuffPost.Because there was no parental leave policy in place when Fish ran the institute, it was up to him to decide how much time to grant new parents. This could lead to “awkward” negotiations, one staffer recalled. Fish would often wait until the last minute to grant parental leave, another staffer said. Several women said Fish would often joke that employees’ babies were his because The Nation Institute was paying for the health insurance. When Fish was named TNR publisher in February 2016, Nation Institute staffers mobilized to warn their TNR colleagues about their new boss. One current TNR staffer emailed Katrina vanden Heuvel, the editor and publisher of The Nation magazine, and asked her to tell McCormack about the circumstances under which Fish had left the institute. (Vanden Heuvel did not respond to requests for comment.)TNR staffers were wary around Fish from the start of his tenure, several current and former staffers told HuffPost. Several staffers observed that he kept a lower profile at TNR ― but they say some worrisome behavior surfaced while he was at the magazine. Fish would approach women from behind and put his hands on their shoulders, sometimes massaging them, according to two people who worked with him at TNR. One staffer said she felt that Fish “disrespected and looked down upon” her when she brought up problems with him. McCormack had announced an internal investigation into Fish’s conduct on Sunday, shortly after receiving the complaint, signed by editorial staffers.“I’m impressed with the speed in which the situation was handled from the surfacing of the allegations to the resignation,” a current New Republic staffer told HuffPost in an email Friday. “I think John [Gould] and Win did right by us. Mostly I’m just relieved that we can get back to focusing on our work and our publication ― which happens to be written mostly by smart, badass women.”Read the full memo from Win McCormack to TNR staffers:This article has been updated to include comments from a TNR staffer."
