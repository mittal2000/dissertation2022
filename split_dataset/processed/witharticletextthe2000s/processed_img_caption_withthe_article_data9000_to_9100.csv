1,ARTS & CULTURE,The Revolutionary Street Art Project That Inspired Banksy And Empowered A City's Youth,Lee Moran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-nation-bristol-banksy-graffiti-street-art_us_590b2ebee4b02655f844ce96,"John Nation's “Aerosol Art"" initiative in Bristol, England, gave rise to a number of defining artists -- but also almost cost him his freedom.",2017-06-14,"John Nation's ""Aerosol Art Project"" at the Barton Hill Youth Centre in Bristol, England, spawned an entire generation of street artists -- including Banksy.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5936a5ee19000036003e4b21.jpeg?cache=95DnEdJJ58&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"John Nation just wanted to give teenagers in Bristol, southwest England, a safe place to spray-paint without fear of arrest and prosecution.Little did the then 21-year-old youth worker know back in 1984 that his “Aerosol Art Project” at the Barton Hill Youth Center would go some way to shaping British and global street art over the coming years and decades.It spawned an entire generation of influential and genre-defining artists ― including Banksy. But as Nation, now 54, told HuffPost in a wide-ranging interview, the initiative also almost ended up costing him his job, his reputation and his liberty.Nation was just 18-years-old when, in 1981, he became an outreach worker at the youth center in his home neighborhood of Barton Hill. “We helped kids deal with the nitty gritty of life [...] providing sexual health awareness, talking about drugs, that kind of thing,” he told HuffPost. A trip to Amsterdam in 1982 sparked an interest in graffiti, which he saw adorning the Dutch capital’s streets. “I started reading whatever material I could.”Coincidentally, some of the 14 to 19-year-olds attending the center were also becoming interested in the art form. Inspired by movies such as “Wild Style” and “Beat Street” and the painting of Bristol’s earliest-recognized graffiti artist 3D (a.k.a. Robert Del Naja from Massive Attack), Nation said they’d spend hours copying outlines of the work featured in the seminal book “Subway Art.”When one teen returned from New York City with photographs of the graffiti he’d seen, Nation allowed the teen and his friends to paint the club’s front wall.“Barton Hill was rough,” Nation said. “At that time the club was very territorial, seen as right wing, predominantly white and very hostile to outsiders.” Its exterior walls, he said, were mainly daubed with anti-authority slogans such as “No Police State in Barton Hill” or ones promoting the far-right movement, the National Front.“These guys produced a piece that was so vibrant,” Nation said. “It helped break down some barriers. Lots of these guys listened to hip hop, reggae and black-inspired music. Lots of the artists they looked up to were black, hispanic and Puerto Rican, but they were in a predominantly white area. Being involved in graffiti opened their eyes and helped to lower their prejudices.”Inspired by what the teens had produced, Nation sought permission from his employers at the now-defunct Avon County Council authority to set up the “Barton Hill Aerosol Art Project” — a place he envisioned would let the youngsters, some of whom were only a bit younger than him, to “express themselves freely and legally” on the center’s walls instead of tagging or painting unauthorized spots on public or private property which could lead to their arrest.Cheo and Inkie were among the first generation of budding street artists to attend the center, which had the added appeal of being the only one in the city with an indoor skate ramp. Before long, the artists covered most of the building with their work.“Once word got out that it was a safe environment to paint and look at books and photographs and watch films about graffiti, then people from across the city started coming,” Nation said. “Once you had that one group of people give it their seal of approval, others saw it was safe and followed suit.”At its peak, more than 40 youngsters regularly attended the project. Graffiti writers from across the U.K. also visited, and it inspired other authorities from around the country to launch similar initiatives. “It was a great atmosphere, very expressive, very creative,” Nation added. “There was never any bad vibes or competition, none of that element. It was all about being a crew and a togetherness and I still think that’s true to all the guys who still know each other and paint now.”Not everyone was in favor of the project, however. Unbeknownst to Nation, from 1988 to 1989 the British Transport Police surveilled the center and several of its artists as part of a city-wide investigation into graffiti tagging and criminal behavior.John NationOperation Anderson sought to profile graffiti artists suspected of criminal damage and culminated with a series of raids on properties across the region. Police arrested dozens of people, including Nation. Officers searched his home and the center. “Bearing in mind that I was running an aerosol art project, there was no way there wasn’t going to be any material at the center,” he said. “It was like an Aladdin’s Cave for them.”Police seized a “massive stash of paint” Nation had procured from the project’s sponsors and his treasured 5,000-plus snaps of graffiti he’d either taken himself or been sent by writers from around the world. Nation believes police thought the club was “some kind of ‘Axis of Evil’ that was the main meeting point for all of Bristol’s illegal graffiti writers and a place where other writers from across the country would come.” “It wasn’t that at all though,” he said, although he acknowledges some of the artists were painting on unauthorized spots on their own. As was revealed in the BBC documentary “Drawing The Line,” (above), police matched tags on the artwork in the club to tags on illegal works across the city. They charged several artists with criminal damage. Nation himself was charged with suspicion of conspiracy to incite individuals to commit criminal damage. “Their main case against me was that the photos and books I had, if shown to a young person of impressional age, would incite them to go out and commit criminal damage,” Nation said. “They also said I was covering up for the young people and I was duty bound to divulge information on them. But I didn’t assist them whatsoever. I answered ‘no comment’ to pretty much everything.”Several artists were found guilty of criminal damage and received fines. Nation’s charge, however, was dropped on the day his trial was due to begin after prosecutors offered no evidence of incitement. Nation says he then consciously used the subsequent press coverage to promote his project’s work and to argue that without a place to legally paint, “the illegal culture of the art form just gets reinforced.”Following the police raids, Nation says many of those involved in the city’s street art scene went “underground for a while.” “It was like they were regrouping,” he said. “Many of the guys arrested took a break, lessened their illegal activities, and some decided painting legally was the only way.”Nation says the publicity did inspire, however, a new generation of artists to begin visiting the project ― with one of them being Banksy.“As a young boy, he’d come to the center and watch people paint. He was heavily into hip hop culture, graffiti, and Barton Hill was where it was happening. Every weekend there was fresh work going up on the walls and people would exchange ideas,” Nation said. “He says he called it his religious pilgrimage every weekend to go. Many of these guys had their own crazy, little dreams and he said what Barton Hill showed him was very powerful, that you could go on to follow those dreams.”At that time, Nation says Banksy (who despite multiple attempts and theories has never been officially identified), wasn’t producing the political or social commentary pieces that he’s since become globally famous for. As part of a crew with some slightly older teens, Nation says he was “into graffiti and letterforms and writing.” He also didn’t stand out “as one of the graffiti writers you’d call a ‘top boy,’” nor was he using his “Banksy” moniker either, says Nation. “The Banksy thing came later.”Nation claims Banksy is “without doubt” the biggest contemporary artist in the world right now, but admits he didn’t foresee his rise to prominence during his early days of painting at the center. Instead, he believes Banksy truly began to make his mark when he changed his style and began using stencils.“Not only could he paint quicker, he could paint more locations and produce more work. He started off with quite crude stencil work, like the rats, then he started progressing to more clean work, more sharper,” Nation said.“These smaller stencils started appearing across the city and for me, it’s once he made that conscious decision to change the style of what he was painting and the content of what he was painting when he exploded,” he added.Banksy himself admits in his book “Wall and Piece” that his switch in style came when aged 18 transport police chased him through a thorny bush after spotting him painting “LATE AGAIN” on the side of a train.“The rest of my mates made it to the car and disappeared so I spent over an hour hidden under a dumper truck with engine oil leaking all over me,” he wrote. “As I lay there listening to the cops on the tracks I realized I had to cut my painting time in half or give up altogether. I was staring straight up at the stenciled plate on the bottom of a fuel tank when I realized I could just copy that style and make each letter three feet high.”Nation said that change led Banksy to “strike an accord with first and foremost the Bristol public, and then the British public.” “Lots of people who wouldn’t be into street art could relate to the simplicity and the fun and the characters he was painting. As he’s become more mature, the images and message have become more hard-hitting — he’s a clever guy.” Nation does question how Banksy creates some of his works, such as the “Brexit” piece (above) that he unveiled in Dover, southeast England, in May as a commentary on the U.K.’s referendum vote to leave the European Union.“Yes he painted it, but he’s got to have a team of people that set up the scaffold and he must have approached the people who own the property before that,” Nation said. “You can’t just rock up and set up a scaffold on the side of someone’s property without there being no questions asked. It’s a huge wall. It’s massive.”With so much history between Nation and Banksy, one may assume the pair remain close and in touch. When faced with the suggestion, however, Nation responded with a stony silence before changing the subject.While the legacy of the Barton Hill Youth Center often focuses on Banksy, many of the center’s other alum have also gone on to enjoy hugely successful careers. Jody Thomas, who in April gave HuffPost a helping hand in unveiling its new logo (below), has painted and exhibited his signature photo-realistic style around the world:But for him, it also all began at the center, which he first attended when he was just 15 years old after being encouraged by a school friend who’d described Nation to him as “outspoken, politically militant and not one to suffer fools.” “It felt like I was being led to meet the leader of a despotic cult,” Thomas told HuffPost, adding that Nation “didn’t disappoint” when he finally met him. “He immediately went through my school folder of work based around the comic art of 2,000 A.D. and classical painting and drawings,” he said. “I think he saw in me the opportunity to add a different artistic dimension to the club’s repertoire and left me to recreate on the walls of the club what I had on paper.”Jody ThomasThomas credits Nation as being at “the forefront” of the street art movement at that time. “His energy and personality has garnered him an amount of respect amongst Bristolians on the level of any rock star or public figure,” he said. “For me, he is the ‘Darwin’ of street art in the U.K. and gave me a opportunity to express the art that spoke to me all those years ago.”The admiration is mutual. Nation still remembers the day that Thomas first brought in his work which was “totally different” to what was being produced in the club at the time. “I thought to myself, ‘fucking hell, this is amazing. He’s 15 and painting like this?’ I thought, ‘this boy is going to go far,’” Nation said.“At first he wasn’t accepted as much by the graffiti lads. Jody was into indie music and a lot of that music had dark imagery on its album sleeves,” he added. “He embraced that kind of artwork. He painted small pieces, then he painted these two black and white heads (below) and that was it. I have a lot of time for him. He didn’t stick to what everyone else was doing. He just wanted to be an artist and express his talents.”Inkie, a.k.a. Tom Bingle, also emerged from the center. He’s since worked as a head of design at SEGA and hosted his own shows across the globe. Recently, he painted alongside Shepard Fairey, the artist behind the “Hope” poster that came to define former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign.For Inkie, Nation’s project acted as a vital “central hub” for the city’s graffiti artists in the pre-internet era of the late ‘80s to mid-90s. “Without this center and John’s support of our artwork, Bristol would not have had the scene it maintains today,” he told HuffPost.By 1991, however, Nation had become disillusioned with the restraints he felt the authority was putting on him and quit.“I was seen as being quite outspoken, left wing and a bit of a socialist,” he said. “But I’m proud of what I did back then. And the fact that people still talk about then and what I achieved for me is justification for what I did do.”Nation went on to forge a successful career in promoting dance music events across the U.K. and the NASS action sports and music show in Somerset. With the explosion in the popularity of street art, which he puts principally down to the rise of the internet and social media, he’s since come full circle ― and now gives regular tours of Bristol’s scene via the WhereTheWall tour.“People from all over the world come, and no one tour is the same. Street art is here today, gone tomorrow. The art form is transient,” he said.In April, Nation curated his first ever solo show, “Graffiti Nation,” at Bristol’s Upfest gallery, the home of Europe’s largest live street art festival.He also worked with Inkie on the “See No Evil” art exhibition in 2011 and 2012, and remains a fierce advocate for spaces where artists can legally paint. He’s also set to feature in another BBC documentary, which will analyze the U.K. street art scene in the decades since Operation Anderson.Nation’s pedigree, knowledge and influence of street art and the genres that umbrella term encompasses have seen him nicknamed the “Godfather” of the Bristol (and increasingly British) scene. But it’s a label that doesn’t sit well with him.“I look back and I feel that all those years ago I was vilified and I could have possibly lost my job,” he said. “Then two years ago I’m being used as the face of Bristol tourism as someone who represents it as a progressive, cultural city. Who would have thought it?”“I get called the ‘Godfather,’ but I’m not. I just had a faith and a belief in these young people when no one else would give them the time of day,” he added. “I’m just lucky enough that i’ve been involved in the graffiti scene and seen it emerge. Bristol is not what it is because of me, far from it. I’m just one cog in the wheel, just like Banksy and all the others.”Check out John Nation’s Instagram, Facebook and the tour website for WhereTheWall."

3,POLITICS,Trump Tells Mayor Of Sinking U.S. Island Not To Worry About Climate Change,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tangier-island-mayor-climate-change_us_59406a8ce4b09ad4fbe3fa03,Scientists predict rising seas will soon swamp Virginia's Tangier Island. The president doesn't seem to believe it.,2017-06-14,"Mayor and waterman James Eskridge sets out to check his crab traps during the early morning in Tangier, Virginia, May 16, 2017, where climate change and rising sea levels threaten the inhabitants of the slowly sinking island.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59407dfd1d00002900cc2d27.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump, apparently confirming his disregard for the risks of global climate change, reportedly told the mayor of a small Chesapeake Bay island that could soon disappear to erosion and rising seas that there’s no cause for concern. Trump phoned James “Ooker” Eskridge, the mayor of Tangier, Virginia, on Monday, a few days after CNN aired a story about the impacts of climate change on the island in the middle of the bay, The Daily Times in Salisbury, Maryland, reports.Trump “said not to worry about sea-level rise,” Eskridge told the newspaper. “He said, ‘Your island has been there for hundreds of years, and I believe your island will be there for hundreds more.’”It’s a bold claim, even for a longtime climate-change nonbeliever who has dismissed the phenomenon as “bullshit” and a Chinese “hoax.”Since 1850, nearly 70 percent of Tangier’s landmass has been lost, according to a 2015 study by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers scientists. Those scientists predict that in as little as 25 years, erosion and rising seas will sink much of the remaining land, forcing residents to abandon their island homes.Today, the historic crabbing community is home to about 450 people. The population is overwhelmingly Republican, with roughly 87 percent of island residents who cast a ballot in the 2016 election voting for Trump.CNN highlighted the voting numbers in its report, likely triggering Trump to reach out to the mayor. Eskridge told The Daily Times that after introducing himself, Trump said, “You’ve got one heck of an island there,” and “I’ve just got to talk to that guy.” The mayor said he responded by telling Trump just how much island residents appreciate him. “This is a Trump island; we really love you down here,” Eskridge said he told the president. Trump also reportedly urged Eskridge not to worry about the negative response from the CNN report. Eskridge acknowledged to CNN the threat climate change poses to the island’s future, saying, “We’re running out of land to give up.” But he puts his trust in Trump, and said the island would welcome any assistance the president might provide. “They talk about a wall, we’ll take a wall,” Eskridge said. “We’d like to have a wall all the way around Tangier. We’d love a wall.”Since taking office, Trump has worked to derail America’s actions to combat climate change, promised to revive America’s dying coal industry, and moved to open now-protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to drilling. He has proposed sweeping cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and other scientific agencies."

The two leaders met for a working dinner before together attending a France vs England friendly soccer match at the Stade de France stadium in Paris.Macron’s comments that it was not too late for Britain to remain inside the EU came as May faces a tug-of-war within her own party over her Brexit strategy following a disastrous snap election which she called.Before the election May had proposed a clean break from the EU, involving a withdrawal from Europe’s single market, but now weakened with a minority government, some in her party are calling for a more business-friendly approach.After meeting May for the first time during the French presidential campaign last February, Macronhad said the British prime minister should not expect any favors from the European Union during Brexit talks.He told reporters outside 10 Downing Street at the time that “an exit is an exit.”On Tuesday, May and Macron also said they had agreed on an action plan on counter-terrorism. Both countries have been hit by deadly Islamist militant attacks in recent months.Macron said Internet companies would be asked to do more to remove content promoting terrorism, access to encrypted content on online messaging systems would be widened, and co-operation with the United States on online content would be improved.(Additional reporting by Marine Pennetier; Writing by Bate Felix; Editing by Richard Lough)"

Proponents of the ban argue that face coverings interfere with communication between teachers and students.“These clothes prevent good communication, which is important for students to receive a good education,” said Torbjorn Roe Isaksen, the country’s minister of education and research, in a statement.Norway is home to roughly 150,000 Muslims, according to country data. Muslims make up less than three percent of the country’s population of more than 5 million.There has been increasing debate surrounding face veils in Europe as Muslim and refugee populations grow and politicians argue in favor of assimilation over religious freedom. Austria recently banned full face veils, including the niqab and burka, in public places including courts and schools. France and Belgium also have laws prohibiting facial coverings in public.Linda Noor, who directs the Minotenk think tank on minority issues, argues Norway’s proposed ban is superfluous given that few Muslims in Norway wear full face veils.“There are very, very few who use the niqab, so this is a marginal problem in the integration context,” she told national broadcaster NRK. “Therefore, I believe the proposal is not necessary.”"

President Donald Trump directed the State Department to secure Warmbier’s release, Tillerson added.Warmbier left North Korea in a Medivac flight because he has been in a coma since March 2016, his family said in a statement. Intelligence reports suggested that he had been beaten so badly while in custody that there were fears he had died, a U.S. intelligence official told The New York Times.The announcement of Warmbier’s release overlaps with former NBA player Dennis Rodman’s arrival in North Korea.Thomas A. Shannon Jr., the undersecretary of state for political affairs, said earlier this week that Rodman was not acting in any official capacity on his visit. Rodman backed Trump’s presidential campaign and twice appeared on his “Celebrity Apprentice” TV show.Warmbier was a 21-year-old junior at the University of Virginia and on a group tour to North Korea when two guards apprehended him at Pyongyang International Airport. He was accused of “perpetrating a hostile act against the DPRK” and sentenced to 15 years in prison with hard labor. His plight came to international attention six weeks later, when he was shown giving a tearful confession in a North Korean courtroom, claiming he had stolen propaganda signage from his hotel.“Please, people in the government of the DPR Korea, I beg that you see how I was used and manipulated,” he said. “I have made the single worst decision of my life.”North Korea often releases detained U.S. citizens only partway into their long and harsh jail sentences. Pyongyang released three U.S. prisoners in late 2014 who had been sentenced to hard labor, including missionary Kenneth Bae, who was two years into a 15-year prison term.North Korea is believed to still hold at least two U.S. citizens ― Tony Kim, who had been in the country teaching at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, and Kim Dong-chul, an American businessman imprisoned on charges of espionage.Washington and Pyongyang haven’t had a diplomatic relationship since the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953, and relations have only worsened since the inward-facing regime began working on its nuclear capabilities. Trump has repeatedly stated his intention to deal with the threat, even stating in April that a “major, major conflict” could arise. Yet there’s also hope that Trump’s overtures to China present a unique opening for some U.S.-North Korean diplomacy.This is a developing story.

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-testimony-james-comey-fbi_us_59400650e4b0e84514ee8006,The attorney general disputed the testimony of former FBI Director James Comey on concerns over Trump conduct.,2017-06-13,Attorney General Jeff Sessions takes a sip of water as he prepares to testify to a Senate committee Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594038fc1d00000a28cc2bd9.jpeg?cache=1PQcWSyen4&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday disputed the sworn testimony of former FBI Director James Comey, who said last week that Sessions “did not reply” when Comey raised concerns that President Donald Trump was violating rules limiting contacts between the Justice Department and the White House.Sessions, testifying before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, also said that direct discussions between Comey and Trump would only be problematic if they had talked about ongoing investigations.“There’s nothing wrong with the president having a communication with the FBI director,” Sessions said.Comey, in his testimony before the same panel last week, said he spoke with Sessions about Trump’s conduct when the president spoke with him alone in the Oval Office after asking Sessions to leave.“I told the AG that what had just happened ― him being asked to leave while the FBI director, who reports to the AG, remained behind ― was inappropriate and should never happen,” Comey said.But Sessions said Tuesday that he agreed that “the FBI and Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow department policies regarding appropriate contacts with the White House.”Sessions recalled leaving Comey and Trump alone in the Oval Office. But he said the fact that Comey and Trump were alone was “not problematic,” by itself, Sessions said.Sessions’ testimony suggested that it would be on Comey to shut down inappropriate discussions with Trump. Sessions did not say he committed to raising the issue with Trump or making sure the president was aware of the rules around communications between Trump and DOJ. Sessions said he “encouraged” Comey to follow the “well-established rules governing any communications with the White House about ongoing investigations.”“The rules apply to the Department of Justice, so it’s the duty of the FBI agent to say, ‘Mr. President, I can’t talk about that.’ That’s the way that should work,” Sessions said.A Justice Department spokesman confirmed to HuffPost this week that former Attorney General Eric Holder’s 2009 memo on contacts between the White House and the Justice Department is still in effect. The memo says such conversations about pending criminal investigations should involve only the attorney general or deputy attorney general or their designated subordinates.Sessions went on the offensive in his testimony, saying he would not be intimidated by the “false attacks,” innuendo and leaks about the Russia investigation that he implied were part of an effort to derail the Trump administration agenda.Sessions recused himself from the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and questions of collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel on Russia issues last month. Amid reports that Trump had considered getting rid Mueller, Rosenstein testified earlier on Tuesday that he would not obey an order unless he determined it was lawful and appropriate.Sessions, a longtime senator from Alabama before becoming part of Trump’s cabinet this year, was clearly irritated by suggestions that he was in any way involved in a Russian effort to interfere with the 2016 election.“I was your colleague in this body for 20 years, and the suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie,” he said.Sessions defended his role in Trump’s decision to fire Comey firing in early May. He said it was “absurd” to suggest that his recusal from the Russia probe would render him “unable to manage the leadership of the various Department of Justice law enforcement components that conduct thousands of investigations.”This article has been updated with additional testimony from Sessions.

He called for an ""urgent investigation"" into his company's culture earlier this year after a former engineer made allegations of sexual harassment.

At the report’s recommendation, an independent board member has also joined Uber’s board to aid with company oversight.One section calls for a “reformulation” of Uber’s cultural values to emphasize inclusivity and positive behaviors like “mutual respect.” These values would ideally replace its current ones ― including “Let Builders Build” and “Always Be Hustlin’” ― which the report concludes have “been used to justify poor behavior.”In addition to such recommendations as having more trainings, improving the human resources and complaint processes, introducing a better system for record-keeping and boosting diversity, the report made clear, actionable suggestions for employee practices.In particular:Prohibiting intimate or otherwise romantic relationships between employees in a chain of command.Former Attorney General Eric Holder and colleague Tammy Albarrán, who led the investigation, presented the full report to the board Sunday. Its members voted unanimously to adopt all of the report’s recommendations.Uber commissioned the report in February, after a former engineer named Susan Fowler recounted her nightmarish experiences at the company ― including being propositioned for sex by a male manager ― in a scathing 3,000-word blog post.Fowler said the human resources department at Uber punished her for alerting the company to the overt, repeated instances of sexual harassment, telling her to either find a new work team or accept negative performance reviews in the future.Kalanick responded to Fowler’s blog by calling for an “urgent investigation.” “We seek to make Uber a just workplace FOR EVERYONE,” he wrote in a statement sent to HuffPost at the time, “and there can be absolutely no place for this kind of behavior at Uber ― and anyone who behaves this way or thinks this is OK will be fired.”Chief Human Resources Officer Liane Hornsey pledged on Tuesday to implement the report’s findings, but acknowledged that “change does not happen overnight.”“Implementing these recommendations will improve our culture, promote fairness and accountability, and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated,” Hornsey said in a statement. “While change does not happen overnight, we’re committed to rebuilding trust with our employees, riders and drivers.”The report was originally expected at the end of April, but the deadline was extended through May as Holder said he required more time to interview everyone involved.A subcommittee of Uber board members, including former HuffPost editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington, have received weekly updates throughout the process. “Change doesn’t usually happen without a catalyst,” Huffington wrote in February, explaining the need for an inquiry. “I hope that by taking the time to understand what’s gone wrong and fixing it we can not only make Uber better but also contribute to improvements for women across the industry.”Fowler’s blog post was among the first revelations in what ultimately would become a long string of damaging news stories for Uber.Since February, the company has found itself entangled in a potentially disastrous lawsuit brought by rival Waymo concerning allegedly stolen technology; a criminal probe over software it built to evade authorities; the departure of numerous high-profile executives (including both its communications head and president); and controversy after a video of Kalanick cursing out an Uber driver went viral."

The Iran bill is due come up for a vote as soon as this week.Besides the provision setting up a process for Congress to review changes in sanctions, the measure would put into law sanctions previously established via presidential executive order, including some on certain Russian energy projects and debt financing in some industries.It would impose new sanctions on Russians found to be guilty of human rights abuses, supplying weapons to Syria’s government and conduct cyber attacks on behalf of Russia’s government, among others.The measure also would allow new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways.The legislation is backed by both Republicans and Democrats, and is expected to easily pass the Senate.It was introduced amid an intense focus in the U.S. capital on relations with Russia, and investigations by the Department of Justice and congressional committees of whether Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. elections to help elect Republican President Donald Trump, and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow as it sought to influence the election.To become law, the legislation would have to pass the House of Representatives and be signed into law by Trump. If Trump objected, some of its backers said they expected enough congressional support to override a veto.“These additional sanctions will ... send a powerful and bipartisan statement to Russia and any other country who might try to interfere in our elections that they will be punished,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.Russia has denied attempting to interfere in the U.S election, and Trump has dismissed any talk of collusion.The measure also authorizes “robust assistance” to strengthen democratic institutions and counter disinformation in European countries that might be targeted by what the legislation’s sponsors described as Russian aggression.In December, the final full month of President Barack Obama’s administration, Washington sanctioned Russian businessmen and companies for Moscow’s role in Ukraine via executive order."

The program is now called simply the Tribal Resilience Program and has a mission statement noticeably less science-forward.“The BIA Tribal Resilience Program provides federal-wide resources to Tribes to build capacity and resilience through leadership engagement, delivery of data and tools, training and tribal capacity building,” the site now reads.An archive of the webpage from May 13 shows the word “climate” appearing on the page 61 times. The new page lists the word once, in a website header. The move is not a surprising one for the department, now under the stewardship of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.It has made several moves to limit or eliminate mentions of climate change from its vast array of URLs since the inauguration of President Donald Trump. The DOI’s main landing page on climate change previously listed the agency’s vast efforts to combat climate change and pointed to a host of troubling effects related to the issue. In April, however, the page was scrubbed of all such information and the term climate change now appears only once.The agency has also removed images of melting glaciers and wildfires ― both linked to climate change ― and replaced a landing page photo of a family visiting a national park with one of a giant pile of coal.DOI’s Bureau of Indian Affairs is tasked with serving and protecting the country’s 567 federally recognized tribes. But as BuzzFeed notes, the Trump administration’s proposed budget for 2018 would eliminate $9.9 million in funding for Tribal Climate Resilience Awards.Those proposals have prompted severe backlash among some Native American communities, who have called on Congress to restore funding to climate and welfare programs, PBS Newshour reported.The Trump administration has worked quickly to reverse almost every major environmental effort that former President Barack Obama had made. Most recently, Trump announced the United States would pull out of the landmark Paris climate accord and he tweeted his support Monday for a new coal mine in Pennsylvania.In March, Zinke ordered the DOI to conduct a “reexamination of the mitigation and climate change policies and guidance across the Department of the Interior in order to better balance conservation strategies and policies with the equally legitimate need of creating jobs for hardworking American families.”"

Gov. Ralph Northam in the race for governor.,2017-06-13,"Tom Perriello, left, shakes hands with Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam at the start of their first head-to-head debate in Fairfax, Virginia on April 29.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593fa8ba1d00002900cc2a16.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Virginia Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam squares off against progressive favorite Tom Perriello on Tuesday in the state’s highly competitive Democratic gubernatorial primary, where the left flank of the party hopes national momentum will carry it to a win.Thanks to Virginia’s status as one of two states with gubernatorial races this year (the other is New Jersey), the primary has attracted historic levels of attention and resources from Democrats eager to land a blow against President Donald Trump.Northam, a 57-year-old pediatric neurologist, had locked up the support of virtually every major elected official in Virginia and was poised to cruise to the nomination until Perriello, a 42-year-old former diplomat and one-term congressman, announced his run in January.Thanks to the endorsements of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the country’s leading progressive politicians, and firm stances on several controversial issues, Perriello has excited the state’s younger and more liberal voters, erasing virtually all of Northam’s lead in the polls.As a result, many progressives view the race as a crucial test of whether a more liberal candidate can prevail in a state where moderate Democrats have long ruled the roost. “This primary is really about what foot the Democratic Party in Virginia is going to lean on,” said Quentin Kidd, a Virginia politics expert at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia. “It’s leaned on the right foot for a decade and a half since Mark Warner evolved this model of a Democrat who can win statewide in Virginia. If Perriello wins it means it will lean slightly to the left foot.”Kidd uses the word “lean,” because he doesn’t think the shift would be “any more dramatic” than a pivot to the left.Nowhere is the potential shift more significant, however, than in the state government’s posture toward Dominion Energy, Virginia’s influential power monopoly.Perriello has refused to accept contributions from Dominion and opposes construction of the Atlantic Coastal pipeline, which the company is planning to construct across the state. Northam has declined to take a comparable stance against the natural gas pipeline, favoring tight regulation instead.In the end, approval of the pipeline is a matter for federal regulators, but Dominion clearly views Perriello’s vocal opposition as a major threat. The company has mobilized tens of thousands of its employees, retirees and shareholders to campaign in the gubernatorial primaries, using thinly veiled language that makes clear they prefer Northam.“If Northam wins tomorrow, you won’t hear much about Dominion any more, because Northam wouldn’t make that an issue,” Kidd predicted.When Perriello got into the race, he immediately began to nationalize the contest, claiming he was inspired to run by Trump’s election ― and pitching himself as a bulwark against the effects of the president’s policies for Virginia.“What people want to see right now is that willingness to stand up to Trump and limit those really unconscionable and unconstitutional moves and also have a positive vision,” he told HuffPost in March.Northam emphasizes his legislative experience in Virginia’s capitol, but has also incorporated Trump, who he dubbed a “narcissistic maniac,” into his stump speeches. “Whatever you call him, we’re not letting him bring his hate into Virginia,” Northam concludes in one of his television advertisements.He has also gone toe to toe with Perriello on some of his bolder economic proposals, embracing the $15 minimum wage and putting forward his own free community college plan ― albeit one that, unlike his opponent’s, requires community service. For some progressive activist supporters of Perriello, however, his early involvement in the anti-Trump resistance won them over. Perriello’s presence at Dulles Airport to protest Trump’s first travel ban in January and participation in subsequent rallies against the executive order made an impression on Virginia Democratic National Committee member Yasmine Taeb, who is now a vocal supporter of his.“He has been very committed to running a grassroots, bottom-to-top campaign,” said Taeb, who lobbies on civil liberties issues for a Washington-based liberal nonprofit. “He looks to us for guidance, not the other way around.”Taeb, like many of Perriello’s most enthusiastic supporters, backed Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.For several reasons though, Sanders’ insurgent challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is not an apt parallel for the Perriello-Northam matchup.Perriello spent years ensconced in the Democratic Party firmament, including as head of the Center for American Progress Action Fund. And the bid of Sanders acolyte Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), to chair the Democratic National Committee was actively combatted by former President Barack Obama and his aides. But Perriello has attracted the endorsements of more than 30 Obama White House veterans, including close the former president’s confidante Valerie Jarrett. (Northam appealed to former Attorney General Eric Holder to ask Obama not to intervene in the race himself, according to The New York Times.)Perriello, a Charlottesville native, became a darling of national Democrats during his time in Congress in 2009-10 for voting enthusiastically for the stimulus package and the Affordable Care Act, in spite of his conservative district, which included a large swath of rural Southside Virginia.Obama campaigned for him in his 2010 reelection bid, which Perriello has publicized heavily in his current campaign ads. That anger over the ACA ultimately cost Perriello his seat only improved his standing in the party.But Perriello’s time in Congress was also marked by attempts to triangulate on hot-button social issues. He earned an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association during his 2010 reelection campaign and received a $6,000 donation from the influential group based in Fairfax, Virginia.More troubling still for some progressives was Perriello’s vote for the Stupak-Pitts Amendment to the ACA, which would have denied federal funding from the new law to any health insurance plans that cover abortions.Perriello has since dubbed the NRA a “nut-job extremist organization” and embraced greater gun safety regulations.He has also expressed “regret” for his vote for Stupak-Pitts, claiming he was honoring a promise to constituents to ensure the ACA complied with the Hyde Amendment, a law barring federal funding of abortions. Now the former congressman has embraced the complete abortion rights agenda and is proposing enshrining a woman’s right to an abortion in Virginia’s state constitution as a backstop against a Supreme Court ruling that overturns federal protections for the procedure.But some reproductive rights activists still do not trust Perriello, claiming he has yet to be tested by a vote on the matter since his change of heart. Revelations that in 2004, Periello, a practicing Catholic, co-founded Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, a social justice group that has compared abortion to torture and war have only heightened advocates’ suspicions. The Perriello campaign claims he has nonetheless always been pro-abortion rights. Northam, by contrast, has a record of only ever supporting abortion rights, and played a key role in the fight to kill the trans-vaginal ultrasound bill as a state senator in 2012. NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia cited Northam’s record in its statement endorsing him. “This is about trust. I know exactly who Ralph Northam is, and I know exactly what Northam will do as governor. He will not stick his fingers up in the air to see which way the political wind is blowing,” said Erin Matson, a Virginia-based reproductive rights activist who supports Northam.For Matson, the primary is a test of the Democratic Party’s commitment to abortion rights at a time when top lawmakers ranging from Sanders to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have loudly proclaimed that Democrats who oppose abortion are welcome in the party.“It is really disturbing to see this play out in Virginia, where the candidate who is considered more progressive has a murky history on abortion rights and Bernie is saying it is an optional part of being progressive,” Matson said. In a further twist of the race’s complicated narrative though, Northam has admitted to voting twice for former President George W. Bush, who appointed two anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court. In 2011, he also called health care a “privilege.” (He claims he was not following politics closely during the Bush years, and now considers health care a “right.”)On other issues, like overturning Virginia’s status as a right-to-work state, which Perriello supports, but Northam has demurred on, the contrast between the two candidates is clearer.One way or another, Perriello’s chances of winning depend on expanding the electorate, since he enjoys the greatest advantages among young people, new voters and Democrats in Southside and Southwestern Virginia who have not voted regularly in primaries, according to Kidd of Christopher Newport University.Northam’s support is concentrated in more reliable Democratic constituencies, including older Democrats and black voters, particularly in central and Southeast Virginia, Kidd added. The key battleground, he said, is in the Washington suburbs of Northern Virginia, where Perriello has been campaigning most heavily in the final weeks. “There was this pent up energy in the electorate for an alternative to Northam that Perriello tapped into. And that pent up energy has the capacity to surprise people, if the expanded electorate turns out,” Kidd concluded. “That’s the key.”"

Those forces are expected to be largely comprised of trainers to support Afghan forces, as well as air crews.Deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters.Some U.S. officials have questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and more than 17,000 wounded since the war began in 2001.Any increase of several thousand troops would leave American forces in Afghanistan well below their 2011 peak of more than 100,000 troops.The Afghan government was assessed by the U.S. military to control or influence just 59.7 percent of Afghanistan’s 407 districts as of Feb. 20, a nearly 11 percentage-point decrease from the same time in 2016, according to data released by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.A truck bomb explosion in Kabul last month killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since the Taliban were ousted in 2001 by a NATO-led coalition after ruling the country for five years.On Saturday, three U.S. soldiers were killed when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them in eastern Afghanistan.The broader regional U.S. strategy for Afghanistan remains unclear. Mattis promised on Tuesday to brief lawmakers on a new war strategy by mid-July that is widely expected to call for thousands more U.S. troops.Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, pressed Mattis on the deteriorating situation during the Tuesday hearing, saying the United States had an urgent need for “a change in strategy, and an increase in resources if we are to turn the situation around.”“We recognize the need for urgency,” Mattis said.

18,POLITICS,Trump's War To 'Annihilate' ISIS Is Raising Civilian Casualties,David Wood,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-isis-civilian-casualties_us_5939a2dfe4b0c5a35c9d76e5,"In a sharp reversal, the U.S. has started prioritizing battlefield gains over civilian safety.",2017-06-13,"Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis speaks during a press briefing at the Pentagon, May 19, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5939a6251d00002900cc1eee.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Overturning more than a decade of careful “hearts and minds” military operations, the United States has signaled that the major U.S.-backed combat offensives against ISIS in Iraq and Syria should proceed regardless of the cost to civilians.Under orders to “annihilate” the extremist group that calls itself the Islamic State, the Defense Department is unleashing airstrikes, long-range artillery and rocket fire against ISIS-held neighborhoods in Raqqa, Syria, where civilians have been told by U.S.-backed militias to shelter in place. Meanwhile, airstrikes continue against ISIS positions in the Iraqi city of Mosul.Until now, U.S. military forces operating across the region have taken extreme care to avoid causing harm to noncombatants. Under the counterinsurgency doctrine devised in 2006 and implemented in Iraq and Afghanistan under the direction of then-Gens. David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal, protection of civilians took precedence over battlefield progress.Those two senior field commanders prioritized civilian safety not just to comply with international law and American moral standards, but because doing so helped shore up the support of the local population against extremists. The unintentional killing of civilians, Petraeus and McChrystal pointed out, leads to local anger and resentment, undermining the legitimacy of the U.S. war effort and producing new extremist recruits.“You can’t keep ’em on your side if you’re killing ’em,” explained a retired four-star combat commander.The new guidance from Washington turns that upside down, setting battlefield success as a higher priority than the avoidance of civilian casualties.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on June 5 that the new emphasis on killing, and the resulting rise in civilian casualties, are not because of any directive from President Donald Trump to loosen the rules on airstrikes. Rather, he said, it’s a new combat strategy that grew out of Trump’s demand for an “accelerated” war against ISIS extremists that sets the goal of “annihilating” ISIS fighters. Instead of “shoving them from one town to another and then falling back,” Mattis said, the U.S. and its allies are pushing to kill extremists and prevent them from slipping away to the West.“We have changed not one bit of our rules of engagement,” he insisted during a press conference in Sydney. “We have relented not one bit in terms of trying to do everything humanly possible to protect the innocent on the battlefield... but at the same time, we’re going to have to take that [ISIS] caliphate down, or the attacks that you’ve seen going on around the world that you all have reported on will continue.”“The enemy,” Mattis said, “has got to be taken out by military means where they are powerful enough to cause these attacks on others, and we can’t sit idly by and let them hold it.”Speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on May 28, Mattis allowed that “civilian casualties are a fact of life in this sort of situation.”In practical terms, the shift means that the U.S. target engagement officers who receive airstrike requests have greater authority to grant them without approval from higher headquarters. It also means they have more flexibility to determine when the likelihood of causing civilian casualties is outweighed by the value of attacking specific targets. Those are subjective judgments usually made in consultation with a military lawyer.Extremists fighting for ISIS have no such qualms, of course, and have slaughtered untold numbers of civilians across Iraq and Syria. Last week, advancing forces in west Mosul discovered the bodies of 163 men, women and children. They’d been shot by ISIS as they were fleeing, according to U.S. spokesman Col. Ryan Dillon.Russian jets have pulverized parts of Syrian cities, and the Syrian regime, among other atrocities, has dropped more than 12,000 barrel bombs on dense urban neighborhoods.The death toll in Syria alone has already exceeded 400,000 people through the end of 2016, and thousands of civilians are still at risk in the bloody doorway-to-doorway fighting against ISIS positions in Mosul and into Raqqa, the erstwhile ISIS capital in Syria. U.S. aircraft have dropped at least 84,296 munitions on largely dense urban areas since the war against ISIS began in August 2014, according to Defense Department data through May 31.Last month, the number of munitions the U.S. dropped on targets in Iraq and Syria jumped by more than 1,000 over April’s total, rising from 3,274 to 4,374 dropped in May. Those numbers don’t include rockets and artillery shells fired by U.S. forces.In addition to airstrikes, the United States is firing long-range 155 mm howitzers into neighborhoods held by extremists. Each shell detonates in a fireball, shooting out nearly 2,000 red-hot steel fragments. Apache helicopter gunships are working over enemy positions, as are HIMARS multiple rocket launchers. The HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, can fire the MGM-140B rocket, which is particularly dangerous for civilians. When the rocket detonates, it sprays out 274 spherical anti-personnel grenades, each of which has a killing radius of 50 feet when it explodes.Civilians are suffering.Since 2014, the U.S. Central Command said this month, its investigations into reports of civilian casualties determined it “more likely than not” that coalition airstrikes have killed at least 484 civilians. Independent investigations by organizations such as Airwars have documented that at least 3,817 civilians were actually killed by coalition airstrikes during that period.Civilians will increasingly be at risk as Iraqi security forces, accompanied by U.S. combat advisers and backed by U.S. and allied airstrikes, push deeper into Mosul, where ISIS fighters are holding out in a maze of booby-trapped houses and cars and narrow alleyways barricaded with barbed wire and studded with improvised bombs. The danger to civilians was clear in a March 17 U.S. airstrike that killed men, women and children sheltering on the first floor and basement of a house in the al-Jadidah district of Mosul, on the forward edge of advancing Iraqi government troops clashing with dug-in ISIS fighters.A U.S. aircraft dropped a 500-pound guided bomb on the house, intended to kill two snipers reported on the rooftop. The resulting fireball and concussive blast reached deep into the structure, collapsing walls and floors of reinforced concrete and roaring down into the darkness, where the civilians had hoped they’d be safe. In the moments before slabs of concrete began to fall, the pressure wave would have burst lungs, ears canals and intestines, leaving people in suffocating shock. Kidneys, bladders and livers would have been sheared away by the blast wave, and arms and legs severed as the fireball flash-charred skin and bone. The blast would have thrown bodies against the walls, smashing ribs and skulls. Mercifully, perhaps, survivors would then have been crushed beneath the collapsing rubble.Eyewitnesses reported that children were heard crying from the wreckage. In the days it took rescuers to dig into the basement, their cries went silent.Eventually, the bodies of 278 civilians were excavated, some of them children, according to Iraqi civil defense officials. U.S. officials said only 105 civilians had died in the airstrike. After an investigation, the Defense Department denied responsibility, saying the building was leveled not by the American bomb, but by a secondary detonation of an ISIS explosives cache set off by the airstrike.This week, U.S.-backed Syrian forces led by Kurdish fighters began the final assault into Raqqa, where an estimated 3,000 ISIS fighters are dug in among 200,000 civilians trapped in the city. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an independent group, reported that U.S. and allied warplanes were bombing suspected ISIS snipers and other targets. On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command reported it had conducted 29 airstrikes in Syria, including 22 against targets in Raqqa, and eight in northern Iraq. There’s a reason the protection of war-zone civilians has been considered a vital part of ground combat operations, according to veteran commanders. “If a foreign force inflicts civilian casualties in an area that is contested but swaying toward the other side, that external force pays a significant penalty in local support,” said retired Army Col. Christopher Kolenda, who led an airborne regiment in eastern Afghanistan in 2007-2008 and later served as a senior strategist for McChrystal.In his experience, Kolenda told HuffPost, “We’re at risk of losing if we don’t maintain the protection of civilians.”"
19,BUSINESS,Travis Kalanick Takes Leaves Of Absence From Post As Uber CEO,Ryan Grenoble and Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travis-kalanick-leave-uber_us_58b86704e4b0a8ded67b476c,The executive's mother died in a boating accident last month.,2017-06-13,"Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick speaks in London on Oct. 3, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b868131a00003700f4141f.jpeg?ops=crop_0_82_4000_2406%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Travis Kalanick will take a leave of absence from his post as CEO of Uber, he said on Tuesday. The move comes after months of scrutiny into Uber’s workplace culture and criticism of Kalanick’s leadership, and also his mother’s death late last month.In an email provided to HuffPost, Kalanick wrote that he was taking the time off to grieve for his mother and did not indicate when he’d return. “For Uber 2.0 to succeed there is nothing more important than dedicating my time to building out the leadership team,” he wrote. “But if we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve.”Read Kalanick’s full email below.A report about the company’s practices, also made public on Tuesday, suggests that Uber “review and reallocate the responsibilities” Kalanick had. Uber hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to conduct an investigation following allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment in the workplace. The report called on the company’s board of directors to “evaluate the extent to which some of the responsibilities that Mr. Kalanick has historically possessed should be shared or given outright to other members of senior management.”Kalanick said in his email that his leadership team would be running the company while he is gone. He has limited his public comments since his mother was killed and his father injured in a boating accident in May.Tuesday’s report makes sweeping recommendations to improve Uber’s internal structure, from calling for more accountability for senior leaders to suggesting the company rewrite its policy to prohibit romantic relationships between managers and their reports.Uber’s board of directors unanimously accepted the report’s recommendations at a Sunday meeting. Implementing them will “ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated,” an Uber spokeswoman said in a statement.The board had also discussed a leadership shakeup ― including a leave of absence for Kalanick ― amid a period of intense turbulence for the ride-hailing company and a time of personal tragedy for the embattled executive. Kalanick founded Uber in 2009 as a scrappy startup that eventually grew into a taxi-killing behemoth valued at nearly $70 billion. But the 40-year-old has also faced torrents of criticism over Uber’s toxic workplace environment and his personal behavior.In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote a tell-all blog post about the company’s sexist culture that went viral. Fowler described being solicited for sex by a male manager, discriminated against by management and stonewalled by human resources for reporting the conduct of male employees there.In response to the allegations, Kalanick tapped Holder to lead an investigation into Uber’s practices with help from board member and former HuffPost Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington. Uber also hired a separate law firm, Perkins Coie, to specifically investigate sexual harassment and other workplace complaints by Fowler and other individuals.After Fowler’s allegations became public, two of Uber’s earliest investors, Mitch and Freada Kapor, spoke out and urged the company to switch gears.“Uber’s outsize success in terms of growth of market share, revenues and valuation are impressive, but can never excuse a culture plagued by disrespect, exclusionary cliques, lack of diversity, and tolerance for bullying and harassment of every form,” the two wrote in February.“Uber has had countless opportunities to do the right thing ,” they added. “We feel we have hit a dead end.”In another sign of faltering confidence within the company, Uber President Jeff Jones abruptly quit after just six months on the job in March, saying his “beliefs and approach to leadership” were apparently incompatible with Uber’s. In June, Perkins Coie’s investigation prompted Uber to fire 20 employees. The law firm looked at 215 claims about discrimination, sexual harassment, bullying and unprofessional behavior. One hundred claims resulted in no action; 31 required employees to receive additional training; seven prompted written warnings; and 57 remained under review. “Culture changes have been well underway at the company for months now,” an Uber spokeswoman told HuffPost after the firings. “Moving forward, we’re more committed than ever to turning the page. We want to change.”The company hired three high-level female leaders to address its management issues, serve as an independent voice on the board and help repair the company’s public image. But one of the biggest threats to the company’s brand has been Kalanick himself.In June, Recode published an email Kalanick wrote to employees in 2013 ahead of a company-wide celebration. The email contained profanities, laid out rules for having sex with fellow employees and warned of a “$200 puke charge.”Earlier this year, Kalanick was widely criticized after he was caught on tape berating an Uber driver. The video shows Kalanick discussing the company’s fare structure with Uber “black car” driver Fawzi Kamel at the end of a ride. Kamel, who purchased a nicer car to drive for the upscale “black” service, tells Kalanick he “lost $97,000 because of you. I’m bankrupt because of you.”In response, Kalanick fires back, “You know what? Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own shit. They blame everything in their life on somebody else.” “Good luck,” Kalanick adds, sarcastically, before slamming the door.Kalanick acknowledged that he needed help in an apology he wrote to employees after the video surfaced.“It’s clear this video is a reflection of me ― and the criticism we’ve received is a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,” he wrote. “This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.” Uber has also struggled with issues beyond its corporate culture. In January, Uber faced backlash for appearing to break a New York City taxi picket line formed in solidarity with protests over President Donald Trump’s travel ban. The hashtag #DeleteUber went viral and more than 200,000 people deleted the Uber app from their phones. The protest was only quelled once Kalanick announced he’d resign from Trump’s economic advisory council.The company is also fighting a lawsuit to continue its self-driving car program. Meanwhile, Uber competitor Lyft has continued to pick up steam. Read Kalanick’s full email announcing his leave here: Team,"
20,POLITICS,Trump's Personal Attorney Reportedly Bragged About Getting Rid Of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara,"Jesse Eisinger and Justin Elliott, ProPublica",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-fired-preet-bharara_us_593fe341e4b0b13f2c6dd665,"At the time of Bharara’s firing, his office was conducting an investigation into Trump’s secretary of health and human services, Tom Price.",2017-06-13,"Trump's personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, speaks to the news media after the congressional testimony of former FBI Director James Comey, at the National Press Club in Washington, U.S. June 8, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593fe4771600002100115dcc.jpeg?cache=wkt6QMTzMN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Marc Kasowitz, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer in the Russia investigation, has boasted to friends and colleagues that he played a central role in the firing of Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, according to four people familiar with the conversations.Kasowitz told Trump, “This guy is going to get you,” according to a person familiar with Kasowitz’s account.Those who know Kasowitz say he is sometimes prone to exaggerating when regaling them with his exploits. But if true, his assertion adds to the mystery surrounding the motive and timing of Bharara’s firing.New presidents typically ask U.S. attorneys to resign and have the power to fire them. But Trump asked Bharara to stay in his job when they met in November at Trump Tower, as Bharara announced after the meeting.In early March, Trump reversed himself. He asked all the remaining U.S. attorneys to resign, including Bharara. Bharara, a telegenic prosecutor with a history of taking on powerful politicians, refused and was fired March 11.As ProPublica previously reported, at the time of Bharara’s firing the Southern District was conducting an investigation into Trump’s secretary of the health and human services, Tom Price.Kasowitz and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.Kasowitz became a nationally recognized figure last week, after he acted as Trump’s designated spokesman to respond to former FBI Director James Comey’s landmark Senate testimony.Kasowitz’s claimed role in the Bharara firing appears to be a sign that the New York lawyer has been inserting himself into matters of governance and not just advising the president on personal legal matters.Kasowitz has also said in private conversations that Trump asked him to be attorney general, according to four people familiar with the matter. Kasowitz said he turned down the role. Ultimately, Trump decided to give the position to then-Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions.The Southern District of New York conducts some of the highest profile corporate investigations in the country. According to news reports, it is currently probing Fox News over payments made to settle sexual harassment charges against the network’s former chairman, the late Roger Ailes. The office is also looking into Russian money-laundering allegations at Deutsche Bank, Trump’s principal private lender.Kasowitz has represented Trump over the years on matters including his failed libel lawsuit against a journalist, the Trump University case, and then-candidate Trump’s response to allegations of sexual assault by multiple women last year. Trump retained him to be his personal attorney in the Russia investigation last month.The New York Times reported Sunday that Kasowitz has advised White House staffers about whether they need personal attorneys, raising conflict of interest questions.Trump has also turned to Kasowitz’s firm to fill jobs in the administration. David Friedman, a former name partner of the firm, is now ambassador to Israel. Trump considered former senator and Kasowitz Senior Counsel Joseph Lieberman to replace Comey.One of the names floated to replace Bharara is Edward McNally, a partner at Kasowitz’s law firm. More than three months after Bharara was fired, Trump has not nominated anyone to fill the Southern District job or most of the other U.S. attorney positions.Bharara’s firing on March 11 came two months before the firing of Comey, head of the FBI. Critics charge that Trump obstructed justice in forcing Comey out.Comey testified last week that Trump had tried to “create some sort of patronage relationship.” Bharara said in a television interview Sunday that Trump had attempted something similar with him: Comey’s testimony “felt a little bit like déjà vu.”Robert Faturechi contributed reporting to this story."

His parents and daughter greeted him as he was processed out of Allen Correctional Center in Kinder, Louisiana. The American Civil Liberties Union provided a few photos of the reunion to HuffPost.PREVIOUSLY:A Louisiana man sentenced in 2013 to 20 years behind bars for a marijuana possession charge is set to be released from prison in the coming days after a successful appeal in state court.In August 2011, a New Orleans police officer pulled over a vehicle for a broken tail light and found Corey Ladd, now 31, with a half-ounce of marijuana. It was Ladd’s third arrest for marijuana possession, making it a felony in Louisiana. He also had two other felony drug convictions ― one for possession of LSD, another for a single pill of hydrocodone.Because of his record, Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro chose to prosecute Ladd under the state’s habitual offender law, which allows judges to mete out lengthy prison sentences for nonviolent offenses often involving drugs.After a jury found Ladd guilty in 2013, Judge Karen Herman sentenced him to “20 years hard labor at the Department of Corrections.” Following an appeal, Herman in 2015 reduced Ladd’s sentence to 17 years.But Ladd’s attorney, Kenneth Hardin of the Orleans Public Defenders, appealed again, and last year a panel of state judges ruled that the “sheer harshness” of Ladd’s sentence “shocks the conscience.”Ladd was back in Herman’s courtroom last week hoping for a more substantial reprieve. Some key factors had changed since his last hearing. In a move that lowered the maximum potential sentence, the district attorney’s office agreed to take Ladd’s conviction under the habitual offender law “off the table,” citing a 2015 state law that relaxed penalties for marijuana possession.Although Herman still could have sentenced Ladd to up to 20 years under previous guidelines for a third-time marijuana possession offense, she opted for lenience, commending Ladd for his good behavior and dedication to drug treatment programs in prison. She reduced Ladd’s sentence to 10 years, gave him the benefit of “good time” served and placed him on parole for the remainder of his sentence.“I want you to have every opportunity to be able to hold your child and help your parents,” said Herman. “I want you to see your daughter walk down the aisle.”Ladd, whose girlfriend was eight months pregnant at the time of his 2011 arrest, has never seen Charlee, his 5-year-old daughter, as a free man.“Corey’s never held his daughter outside of prison walls,” Hardin said in an interview with HuffPost. “Her first day of school is in August and now he’s going to get to walk her there.”Ladd hadn’t been able to see his family in more than a year, after he was moved to a correctional facility more than three hours away from where they live, Lisa Ladd, Corey’s mother, told HuffPost.“It’s one thing to talk on the phone or see a picture online, but to get an actual hug, to feel that beating heart, those are the things that you need in life,” she said.Now that Ladd is getting out, he’s planning to give back to others who find themselves in similar situations, his mother said.“He realizes that there are still people [in prison] who need what he got,” she said. “Even if the attention that he was receiving didn’t help him, it had to help someone. It was always much bigger than Corey.”Civil rights groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch had been keeping a close eye on Ladd’s legal battle. In a jointly authored report last year in favor of decriminalizing drug possession and use, the organizations noted that Ladd was just one of the nearly 140,000 people behind bars for possession on any given day in the U.S. That population is constantly fed by the 1.25 million drug possession arrests police make each year, which have had no measurable effect on drug usage rates, according to the report. Ladd’s case is also the latest to challenge Louisiana’s pattern of harsh sentencing for nonviolent drug offenses, and specifically those involving small amounts of marijuana in Orleans Parish.Last year, the Orleans district attorney’s office agreed to re-sentence Bernard Noble, a father of seven serving 13-and-a-half years without the possibility of parole for possessing the equivalent of two joints of marijuana. Like Ladd, he was prosecuted under Louisiana’s habitual offender law.In December, Noble received a reduced sentence of eight years, of which he’s now served more than six. His attorneys are hopeful he’ll be released earlier on parole.Gary Howard was not so fortunate. Last month, the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld his conviction for possession of 18 grams marijuana with intent to distribute, which drew him an 18-year prison sentence under the habitual offender law.The decision drew a blistering dissent from Louisiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Bernette Johnson, who cited “rapidly relaxing social attitudes” toward marijuana in arguing that Howard should have faced prosecution for possession alone.In her opinion, Johnson noted that it would cost the state about $23,000 annually to incarcerate Howard ― and about $400,000 over the course of his entire sentence.“Imprisoning [the] defendant for this extreme length of time ... provides little societal value and only serves to further burden our financially strapped state and its taxpayers,” she wrote.Lawmakers took this sort of fiscal equation into account during a recent push to overhaul the state’s criminal justice system. Earlier this month, the state legislature passed a package of criminal justice reform bills intended to drive down Louisiana’s incarceration rate, which has been ranked the highest in the world. The measures are predicted to lower the prison population by 10 percent and save $78 million over the next 10 years.Hardin said that as cases like Ladd’s have made headlines across the state, Louisianans have started to make clear they’re “fed up” with courts throwing away lives and money because of small-time, nonviolent drug offenses.“Even the most conservative person was outraged by” Ladd’s sentencing, he said. “If people don’t care about the human aspect of it, they care about the money and the taxpayer result of it.” "

San Francisco and Seattle have passed sugary drink taxes that will go into effect Jan. 1 to improve education, public health and other quality-of-life factors. So as of the start of 2018, more than 9 million Americans will live in communities where sugary drink taxes are reducing consumption of unhealthy beverages.Faithful readers of this column know that this is a subject I’m passionate about. Last year, I dedicated a column to Philadelphia’s sugary drink tax, and another calling out the beverage industry, also known as Big Soda. I also wrote a column before the (successful!) votes on sugary drink taxes in Oakland, San Francisco and Albany, California.I’m proud of the American Heart Association’s efforts in helping turn this into a coast-to-coast movement. I’m also grateful to the many other people and organizations who’ve made this a priority, especially former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his team. We are committed to assisting the Partnership for Healthy Cities initiative, which seeks to advance the idea that when mayors and local leaders help their citizens live healthier and safer lives, cities become more prosperous, and which also has a particular focus on reducing sugary drink consumption.The concept behind the sugary drink tax is simple. Since we know these products help fuel heart disease, obesity, diabetes other health crises, distributors must give back some profits for good use.Berkeley became the first U.S. city to adopt such a plan in 2014. Recent as that is, it’s long enough for some quality analysis.The short answer: It’s worked great.A longer answer was published in April in the scientific journal PLOS Medicine. It includes the following details:Sugary drink sales declined by 10 percent in the first year.“These findings confirm that sugary drink taxes make health and economic sense at a time when obesity and diabetes epidemics are sweeping the country, and when health care spending is threatened,” one of the study’s co-authors, Dr. Lynn Silver of the Public Health Institute, wrote in an opinion piece published this month in The Hill.There’s another practical layer to this.I interact with many nutrition experts. Whenever the conversation turns to diet, the line I hear time and again is, “Don’t drink your calories.” This logic makes sense for individuals, and for an entire city or county.Or country.In 2016, the United Kingdom followed Mexico in passing a national sugary drink tax. While the UK plan doesn’t go into effect until Jan. 1, it’s already paying dividends.The UK tax is uniquely focused on amount of sugar in a product, as opposed to ounces, which further encourages drink makers to change their product content to cut down on the sweet stuff. While that may mean less revenue from the soda tax – a disappointment, perhaps, to the accountants – it represents an added benefit for public health. After all, tax receipts are secondary to the goal of good health through healthier beverage choices.It’s exactly what the AHA and our partners in this fight are seeking.Our aim is improving the health of all Americans, and we believe anything that leads to fewer sugary drinks being consumed is a step in the right direction. If that obstacle comes in the form of a tax that in turn benefits the community, that’s a great thing. Reformulated drinks would be, too."

That exact same strategy seems to be in full effect everywhere you look. Only this time, the ‘invading enemy’ are the fake news media, the whiny liberals, the climate change hoaxers, the lying leakers, the leaders of pretty much every civilized nation on earth, women, gays, the poor, the middle class, the upper-middle class, the educated, Mexicans, Muslims, illegal immigrants, legal immigrants, those who prefer democracy over an Oligarchy, those who oppose sharing classified info with Russia, those who oppose the idea of his family profiting off the presidency, and basically, anyone who dares disagree with him.No matter the face Trump and his supporters share with the public, there’s little doubt they know the walls are closing in. Whether his eventual demise will come through impeachment for any of the litany of offenses already committed, or be orchestrated behind the scenes so as to help The Orange One and the fast-sinking ship that is the Republican party save whatever face they have left, is irrelevant. There’s no way on earth this lunatic’s going to last four years. The problem is, what if he lasts two? Or, even one?It’s only been a few months, and the damage being done to the fabric of our democracy on a daily basis is staggering. He’s ruining decades of mainly positive relations with our allies in a single afternoon, laying waste to our nation’s institutions with a stroke of a pen, promoting hate speech and division by legitimizing the alt right, and dismantling vital agencies of government/industry oversight, overnight.What Trump is doing each day is on par with what many leaders and emperors did when they knew their days were numbered. They trashed the place. In that respect, Trump has a lot in common with ISIS. They’re both leveling the countries they occupy. He and his Cabinet are like the bulls of Pamplona running through Tiffany’s at full speed. Every day. All day. And, at present, it doesn’t seem like anyone’s going to stop them anytime soon. Forget about the 2018 November elections. That’s nearly a year and a half away and it’s a ridiculously passive stance to take against a guy who could very easy drag us into a nuclear war over a comment about his hair or an unreturned phone call.Every minute we allow this lunatic to remain in power means more basic protections lost (be it loosening the reigns/definitions of laws that guard against discriminatory behavior, protection of the environment, defunding of Planned Parenthood, etc.), more transfer of power to the corporations and the banks, more tax breaks for the rich, more taxes for the middle class, civil rights trampled on, more looting of our resources - and other countries’ resources - for his own personal gain, etc.There should be a clock in Times Square next to the national debt that shows how many more people will suffer every second due to Trump’s reign of terror.Thank The Lord for the Russia investigation, or it would be twice as bad. Imagine if the Epic Ego had nothing to focus on but repealing toxic waste acts, trying to ban Muslims, firing FBI Directors, Attorneys General, and U.S. Attorneys for not playing ball, giving government contracts to his buddies, and doing away with every agency/position that oversees corruption, pollution, financial crimes, etc. etc.?Whether he’s destroying the country’s educational system by appointing a comically unprepared, bible-clutching grizzly hater, appointing an ignorant climate denier to head the EPA, allowing a soulless, Goldman Sachs billionaire to keep watch over our nation’s piggy bank, putting an Exxon exec. in charge of U.S. diplomacy, trying his best to get us kicked out of NATO, cozying up to our known enemies, selling arms to the supporters of 9/11, even attempting to let the airlines monitor themselves (that’s like letting mice store the cheese), it’s just another day in the Trump White House.Imagine where we’ll be this time next year. Considering he just forced a room full of his cabinet to kiss his ass, which, to a man, they happily did, it’s quite possible one year from now it may be illegal to write articles like this.Someone call the girls of Consolidated, Inc., as they were able to dispose of a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical, bigot in less than a month."

While the Clery Act is perhaps best known for requiring institutions of higher education to report crime statistics, it also contains requirements addressing sexual violence and emergency management among other things. The law, originally enacted in 1990 as an amendment to Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, is named in memory of student Jeanne Clery, who was raped and murdered at Lehigh University on April 5, 1986.The Inflation Adjustment Act, also enacted in 1990, requires periodic adjustments of federal civil monetary penalties (CMPs), or fines. As noted by ED in the Federal Register notice about the increase, the Act “provides for the regular evaluation of CMPs to ensure that they continue to maintain their deterrent value.” Clery Act fines were originally $25,000 and were previously adjusted for inflation to $27,500; $35,000; and $53,907. The current $54,789 fine applies to any violation occurring after Nov. 2, 2015 and assessed after April 20, 2017.The largest Clery Act fine imposed to date was $2,397,000 in 2016 against Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) after extensive violations were uncovered in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal. Penn State announced on November 25, 2016 that they would not contest the fine. The second largest imposed fine was $350,000 against Eastern Michigan University in 2008.In addition to requiring colleges and universities to disclose campus crime statistics, the Clery Act also requires policies to address sexual violence, including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking, and to handle emergency situations such as active shooters. The sexual violence provisions were first added in a 1992 amendment and expanded by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act in 2013, and the emergency management requirements were added in 2008 after mass shootings at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University."

That May Depend On Your Gut Bacteria.,"Popular Science, ContributorPopular Science brings its readers amazing innovations and dis...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-whole-wheat-bread-better-than-white-that-may-depend_us_59403d64e4b0d99b4c920f4d,There’s no such thing as one-size-fits-all nutrition.,2017-06-13,<p>Whether your blood sugar spikes after eating whole wheat or white bread depends on the microbes in your gut.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59403d8f1d00001700cc2bed.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kendra Pierre-LouisWhether your blood sugar spikes after eating whole wheat or white bread depends on the microbes in your gut.“One of the reasons we focused on bread is that it’s one of the most heavily consumed foods worldwide,” says study author Eran Elinav, an immunology researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science. “It amounts to somewhere between 10 percent to 40 percent of our daily caloric content. And as such there are many myths about good bread and bad bread. A whole culture has developed around it, but when you look in the [scientific] literature there’s really very little proof.”Along with Elinav, researchers at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Tel Aviv University spent two weeks feeding 20 study participants 6 meals of bread a day. In the first week, 10 participants received 3 meals a day of white bread along with 3 meals a day of white bread plus butter. An additional 10 participants were fed the same pattern of meals, but instead of white bread they got whole wheat sourdough bread. This was followed by a two-week washout period, so the participants could reset their guts, followed by a week where they flipped roles. Those who’d been giving a week of white bread were given a week of whole wheat sourdough, and those who had spent a week imbibing on sourdough switched to white. Throughout the two weeks of bread eating, the researchers measured the participants’ glycemic responses.Glycemic response is a measure of how the body’s blood sugar responds after we eat a meal. While all foods cause some increase in blood sugar, some foods can cause our blood sugar to spike to unhealthy levels, while others cause a more modest increase. In general, a high glycemic response is considered bad because it’s linked to the development of insulin resistance — a precursor to Type II diabetes. Diabetes, apart from being a problematic disease in its own right, is also linked to the development of heart disease and stroke. In general, it’s assumed that highly processed and refined foods, like white bread, cause a higher glycemic response than less processed whole wheat breads.But when Elinav’s team looked at the data in aggregate, that isn’t what they found. Neither bread was better than the other — both elicited a similar glycemic response, when you averaged out the entire study group. A closer look at the data revealed something curious, however: the data sets were showing different glycemic responses for different breads, but they were cancelling each other out.“We discovered that roughly half the people in our study who consumed an industrialized white bread that you can purchase at your local supermarket had a favorable response to that bread as compared to our very fancy whole wheat sourdough bread, which was made in the best bakery in Tel Aviv,” says Elinav. “The other half of people featured an exact opposite response.”In other words, from the perspective of blood sugar, there isn’t an inherently good bread or bad bread. Rather, there’s a bread that’s good for you, and that same exact bread might be bad for your friend. What’s healthy, it turns out, depends on the person.Perhaps most intriguingly, Elinav and his team found that they could predict which type of bread would most likely trigger a high insulin reaction for each participant based on samples of their gut microbiomes.Our bodies play host to a broad community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses that help to make us who we are. Although we tend to think of microbes as being harmful, these microbes play a crucial role in maintaining our health and wellbeing. Though research on the subject is still very much at its early stage, the microbes in our gut (which encompasses the full length of our digestive tract, including stomach and intestines), play a crucial role in digestion, obesity, and perhaps even in maintaining our mood.In an earlier study, Elinav and his team were able to create an algorithm that would predict how a person would respond to food — that is, whether or not it would trigger a high or low glycemic response — based on the person’s lifestyle, medical background, and the composition and function of their microbiome. By taking microbiome samples of participants in this study and plugging them into the algorithm, Elinav and his colleagues were able to determine that the algorithm matched the data. Based just on the data they plugged in, they could predict who would fare better eating white bread, versus eating the whole wheat sourdough bread.Before you start chowing down on white bread by the bagful, it’s important to note that there are some limits to the study. For starters, the sample size was small, though its experimental (rather than observational) design does work in its favor. But Elinav was mostly focused on glycemic response, not overall nutrition. Industrialized bread has a bad reputation for more than just the potential glycemic response: it’s also lower in nutrients. Whole wheat breads tend to have more fiber and vitamins, including magnesium, zinc, and folic acid. A lot of the patients Elinav studies tend to have diabetes or pre-diabetes, so focusing on health risks related to blood sugar made sense. But for most of us, there are other things to consider at mealtime.Additionally, the study doesn’t explain the differences in the participants’ microbiomes, or the mechanisms by which these differences came about — or how they might help or hurt bread digestion. It only acknowledges that there is some difference between the microbes in a wheat-loving body and one that does better on white bread.In other words, like most nutrition studies, this shouldn’t change what’s on your plate.

31,SCIENCE,Is Whole Wheat Bread Better Than White? That May Depend On Your Gut Bacteria.,"Popular Science, ContributorPopular Science brings its readers amazing innovations and dis...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-whole-wheat-bread-better-than-white-that-may-depend_us_59403d64e4b0d99b4c920f4d,There’s no such thing as one-size-fits-all nutrition.,2017-06-13,<p>One size fits all nutrition may be a thing of the past.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59403dda1600002700115f52.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kendra Pierre-LouisWhether your blood sugar spikes after eating whole wheat or white bread depends on the microbes in your gut.“One of the reasons we focused on bread is that it’s one of the most heavily consumed foods worldwide,” says study author Eran Elinav, an immunology researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science. “It amounts to somewhere between 10 percent to 40 percent of our daily caloric content. And as such there are many myths about good bread and bad bread. A whole culture has developed around it, but when you look in the [scientific] literature there’s really very little proof.”Along with Elinav, researchers at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Tel Aviv University spent two weeks feeding 20 study participants 6 meals of bread a day. In the first week, 10 participants received 3 meals a day of white bread along with 3 meals a day of white bread plus butter. An additional 10 participants were fed the same pattern of meals, but instead of white bread they got whole wheat sourdough bread. This was followed by a two-week washout period, so the participants could reset their guts, followed by a week where they flipped roles. Those who’d been giving a week of white bread were given a week of whole wheat sourdough, and those who had spent a week imbibing on sourdough switched to white. Throughout the two weeks of bread eating, the researchers measured the participants’ glycemic responses.Glycemic response is a measure of how the body’s blood sugar responds after we eat a meal. While all foods cause some increase in blood sugar, some foods can cause our blood sugar to spike to unhealthy levels, while others cause a more modest increase. In general, a high glycemic response is considered bad because it’s linked to the development of insulin resistance — a precursor to Type II diabetes. Diabetes, apart from being a problematic disease in its own right, is also linked to the development of heart disease and stroke. In general, it’s assumed that highly processed and refined foods, like white bread, cause a higher glycemic response than less processed whole wheat breads.But when Elinav’s team looked at the data in aggregate, that isn’t what they found. Neither bread was better than the other — both elicited a similar glycemic response, when you averaged out the entire study group. A closer look at the data revealed something curious, however: the data sets were showing different glycemic responses for different breads, but they were cancelling each other out.“We discovered that roughly half the people in our study who consumed an industrialized white bread that you can purchase at your local supermarket had a favorable response to that bread as compared to our very fancy whole wheat sourdough bread, which was made in the best bakery in Tel Aviv,” says Elinav. “The other half of people featured an exact opposite response.”In other words, from the perspective of blood sugar, there isn’t an inherently good bread or bad bread. Rather, there’s a bread that’s good for you, and that same exact bread might be bad for your friend. What’s healthy, it turns out, depends on the person.Perhaps most intriguingly, Elinav and his team found that they could predict which type of bread would most likely trigger a high insulin reaction for each participant based on samples of their gut microbiomes.Our bodies play host to a broad community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses that help to make us who we are. Although we tend to think of microbes as being harmful, these microbes play a crucial role in maintaining our health and wellbeing. Though research on the subject is still very much at its early stage, the microbes in our gut (which encompasses the full length of our digestive tract, including stomach and intestines), play a crucial role in digestion, obesity, and perhaps even in maintaining our mood.In an earlier study, Elinav and his team were able to create an algorithm that would predict how a person would respond to food — that is, whether or not it would trigger a high or low glycemic response — based on the person’s lifestyle, medical background, and the composition and function of their microbiome. By taking microbiome samples of participants in this study and plugging them into the algorithm, Elinav and his colleagues were able to determine that the algorithm matched the data. Based just on the data they plugged in, they could predict who would fare better eating white bread, versus eating the whole wheat sourdough bread.Before you start chowing down on white bread by the bagful, it’s important to note that there are some limits to the study. For starters, the sample size was small, though its experimental (rather than observational) design does work in its favor. But Elinav was mostly focused on glycemic response, not overall nutrition. Industrialized bread has a bad reputation for more than just the potential glycemic response: it’s also lower in nutrients. Whole wheat breads tend to have more fiber and vitamins, including magnesium, zinc, and folic acid. A lot of the patients Elinav studies tend to have diabetes or pre-diabetes, so focusing on health risks related to blood sugar made sense. But for most of us, there are other things to consider at mealtime.Additionally, the study doesn’t explain the differences in the participants’ microbiomes, or the mechanisms by which these differences came about — or how they might help or hurt bread digestion. It only acknowledges that there is some difference between the microbes in a wheat-loving body and one that does better on white bread.In other words, like most nutrition studies, this shouldn’t change what’s on your plate. Don’t move away from a diet of whole foods to one of more processed foods. What the study does suggest, however, is that if you are diabetic or pre-diabetic and notice that certain nutrient-rich foods causes your sugar levels to spike, you might be better off avoiding them and finding other, also nutrient-rich foods that don’t send your sugar levels soaring.If enough studies like this one emerge, our growing knowledge of the microbiome could change the way nutrition is studied — and eventually, when there’s enough information, change nutritional guidelines as well. But as exciting as this research is, we’re not there yet.One of the things Elinav’s team is doing is taking people with pre-diabetes — that is, people who don’t have diabetes yet but have many of the precursor signs — and trying to personalize their diet, tweaking their nutrition in a way intended to prevent them from getting diabetes. But that research is still in progress.“I think this new approach, this new paradigm or way of thinking about nutrition, really flips the nutritional world on its head,” says Elinav. “It opens up some really big and exciting questions.”This article originally appeared on Popular Science."

These small varieties are often reasonably good early in the season – or even altogether out of season when bought from a careful grower. So we scooped up about 3/4 pound (340 g) before continuing to scan the rest of the market for signs of summer. There weren’t many compared with what we’ll see in a few weeks, but we bought good, sweet spring onions and other alliums; juicy little turnips; a big bunch of mint; and a pile of imperfect but irresistible peas. It was the tomatoes that we wanted for dinner, but in what form we did not know. It all became clear when we peered into the iced trays at the fish stand and saw two boneless portions of bluefish, one of our springtime favorites because of its soft but not texture-free flesh and its rich flavor. Obviously, we’d have bluefish with tomatoes and mint, details to be announced. When I got the tomatoes home I found their texture to be just about perfect: juicy, with moist flesh – not a trace of cottoniness. But, not surprisingly given the early season, they lacked flavor; they tasted okay but would need a boost. Often, I provide that boost by halving the tomatoes and letting them stand for a while with salt and a touch of something acidic: vinegar or lemon juice depending on the dish. This time, I decided to take a different route and add a new flavor (and aroma), that of charring: always appealing on an outdoor grill, so why not in an urban kitchen?A few minutes before cooking the fish, I rough-chopped a handful of mint leaves in the food processor, then tossed the whole tomatoes (previously rinsed and well drained and dried) with just enough olive oil to make them glisten: a generous teaspoonful is all that was needed. I heated a heavy 10-inch (25-cm) frying pan over high heat for a good minute, then added the tomatoes (the 12 ounces made a perfect single layer in the pan) and left them untouched for 90 seconds before peeking at one to see if its skin had begun to char and blister. It had, but the tomatoes needed another half a minute before I tossed them in the pan to turn them over – or rather, to turn some of them over: I was not about to flip them individually with tongs, which meant that some were more charred than others. That’s fine by me. Once tossed, let them griddle for another minute or so. Some may split open; that doesn’t matter one way or the other, so long as the juices don’t interfere with the charring.I slid the tomatoes into the food processor with the chopped mint, added some salt and pulsed three or four times to roughly chop the tomatoes. Now, I cooked the bluefish: Dry the fillets with paper towels, sprinkle with salt, and fry, skin-side down, for around two and a half minutes over medium-high heat with oil. That should brown the skin. Turn them over, lower the heat to medium, and add all the chopped tomatoes, which are now, in effect, tomato sauce. Simmer for another two or three minutes; you are both deglazing the pan and braising the bluefish. Poke the fish with a thin skewer (or cake tester); it should be very tender, and if it isn’t let it go for another half minute and try again. Bluefish is delicious when cooked thoroughly; I wouldn’t go for medium-rare here.Use a spatula to move the fish to warmed plates; taste the tomato mixture in the skillet and adjust it with salt if necessary, then spoon it over and around the fish. You could add a spritz of lemon juice, but I found it unnecessary: this is more about savoriness than acidity, and the fish has given some of its flavor to the sauce, so there is plenty going on. We ate ours with couscous, and I can’t really think of a better accompaniment than that.The charring – which was palpable but not extreme – did its job and heightened the interest of a batch of early-season tomatoes that might have been blah without it. It will be worth using this technique with tiny top-flight high-summer tomatoes too."

This man has claimed that 9/11 was a government hoax and Hillary Clinton was linked to child pornography trafficking operating out of a DC pizza parlor. That false news is ludicrous. But the harm he has inflicted on the loved ones of the Sandy Hook massacre by claiming it was a hoax is despicable.I can’t imagine what sort of person would inflict such cruelty on the families of the 20 young children and six adults gunned down in 2012 by Adam Lanza at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. To give him a platform on national television this Sunday, Father’s Day, is cruel. What do Kelly and NBC think will be accomplished by airing this interview?I support Sandy Hook Promise and am totally behind its mission to “prevent gun-related deaths due to crime, suicide and accidental discharge so that no other parent experiences the senseless, horrific loss of their child.” The group is led by several family members whose loved ones were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School and other professionals dedicated to the cause of reducing gun deaths in America.Today, I received an email from Nicole Hockley, mother of first grader Dylan who was slaughtered at Sandy Hook. In it, she described the pain of missing her beloved child. “Now, all I have is a little box with his baby teeth and a lock of his hair sitting beside an urn of ashes.”Alex Jones not only contends the shooting never happened, thus denying the existence of the 26 people who died there. He also stokes the flames of hatred among his followers who harass grieving families with hate mail and threats. It’s hard to understand what motivates him to take such an odious position other than the fear that this incident would be the final straw for the NRA and gun lobby. Unfortunately, no gun safety legislation followed Newtown and many other horrific mass shootings after that. Nevertheless, he persists as innocents continue to fall victim to our obsession with guns and gun violence.Just yesterday, a father in Hobart, Indiana decided to teach his two boys about how dangerous guns can be by pointing an unloaded gun at them. Then, he put the bullets back in the gun, and forgot he had done so when his 9-year-old daughter entered the room. To finish the lesson, he pointed the gun at her and shot her in the head, killing her.And then there are the victims of random gun violence. Over Memorial Day weekend in Chicago, six people were killed and at least 37 others people were wounded. In two days in February, three Chicago children were shot to death. Kanari Gentry-Bowers, 12, Lavontay White Jr., 2, and Takiya Holmes, 11, died after being hit by gunfire meant for someone else.Jones and Kelly each have three children. I’m sure they would be heartbroken if anything happened to them. Can they even imagine the pain of losing a child? I know I can’t. So why subject the parents of the twenty children killed at Sandy Hook to an interview with someone who denies their children’s very existence? Is it really worth the potential ratings the notoriety of Jones might attract?I am still hoping NBC comes to its senses and decides not to air this interview.I invite you to join my Facebook community, sign up for my newsletter, visit my website, and check out my book."

This recognition can take on many forms, whether it be faith leaders speaking out about anti-LGBTQ violence, a student implementing a Gay Straight Alliance program in their school, or a teenager sharing a story of coming out to a family member.No matter what #HonorThemWithAction means to you, Equality Florida is encouraging people to conceptualize ways to change hearts and minds when it comes the LGBTQ experience ― as well as confronting anti-LGBTQ sentiment head on ― as a testament to the lives lost one year ago.“We have an obligation to each other – we’re supposed to look out for each other,” Equality Florida Executive Director Nadine Smith told HuffPost. “And that spirit has continued. Part of our message with ‘Honor Them With Action’ is to say, ‘we have to do more than remember the lives taken and damaged by this brutality.’ We have to make it the message and make the world a different place where this kind of horror can’t unfold – isn’t being fed by hatred. And so those are the words that we use in fighting what we do – how are we making the world different?”In the wake of the Pulse tragedy, Equality Florida was one of the most active non-profits leading the charge to support Pulse victims and their families by raising over $9 million via a GoFundMe campaign.People and organizations wanting to contribute to the #HonorThemWithAction campaign can do so by using the hashtag #HonorThemWithAction on social media to share individual stories or raise awareness about work surrounding the dismantling of anti-LGBTQ prejudice and bigotry.Equality Florida would also like to keep track of all individuals and organizations taking part in #HonorThemWithAction by having them sign up here.“There have been ways large and small where people have been shaken ― sometimes shaken awake ― by what’s happened in Orlando,” Smith continued. “It’s our job to make sure that deep and lasting change is the ultimate memorial.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593b089716000021001155b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Asians may be receiving unfair treatment when it comes to the U.S. government’s spying cases, a study says.A recently released report on economic espionage shows that the minority group is more likely to be charged with the crime than any other ethnic group. And they’re also found innocent at a rate two times higher than individuals from any other race.Though the findings, published by nonpartisan Chinese-American organization Committee of 100, aren’t conclusive, experts say they’re important to acknowledge. The results further confirm that the minority group has yet to be seen as “American,” the group’s chairman Frank Wu explained to HuffPost in an email. “I have seen from case after case after case ... that people continue to mistake us [Asian-Americans] for foreigners no matter how hard we assimilate and show our loyalty,” he said. The research, conducted by scholar Andrew Kim of South Texas College of Law, examined a random sample of cases from 1997 to 2015 that were charged under the Economic Espionage Act. The legislation was passed to prevent foreign governments from stealing trade secrets. Kim’s data shows that 62 percent of defendants charged since 2009 have been of Asian descent, with the number of those with Chinese heritage tripling. Moreover, the intended beneficiaries of the alleged espionage were actually American entities in half the cases, while a third of the them involved Chinese entities. When looking at the outcomes of these cases, Kim found that one in five were never proven guilty of spying or any other serious crime. But when they were convicted, those with Asian-sounding names were given sentences twice as long than those with Western-sounding names. Wu told HuffPost that while the report may be new, the results aren’t surprising. Today, China is perceived as an economic threat and though Asian-Americans aren’t representative of Asia, they are unfortunately seen as such and could be targeted because of these perceptions. Referencing the “perpetual foreigner stereotype,” Wu added that even third generation Asian-Americans, are still mistaken as those from other countries. “There is anxiety that China will overtake America, whether in military, economic, political, or cultural terms,” Wu said. “That affects Chinese Americans, inevitably. We’re seen as representatives, potentially agents, of a rival power. So global politics affect domestic civil rights.” The report comes on the heels of Professor Xiaoxing Xi’s lawsuit against the FBI agents who investigated him for espionage. Back in 2015, agents stormed Xi’s home, rounded his family up at gunpoint, and arrested the professor, his daughter Joyce wrote in an op-ed. Charges were dropped abruptly against the wrongfully-prosecuted professor, but the incident had already affected his job. It also caused his family “trauma and paranoia from FBI surveillance,” among other consequences, Joyce said. Though there has no doubt been defendants of Asian descent who have been guilty of stealing trade secrets, Xi is one of many innocent Asian-Americans who have been accused of spying for foreign governments. Wu says the study is further proof that there’s more work to do to eliminate racial bias in these cases. And it starts with admitting that there is discrimination involved as well as mobilizing Asian-Americans to advocate for themselves. “This is real evidence. It reflects attitudes. This isn’t the result of random chance,” he said of the study’s significance. “The remedy won’t come about automatically. We have to stand up and speak out.”"

A New York production has sparked controversy over its portrayal of Caesar. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593e94351600002100115a06.jpeg?cache=YWXRAMWoFd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A 400-year-old play by an underground playwright named William Shakespeare is making headlines this week after The Public Theater’s recent production of “Julius Caesar” angered some viewers (and hence corporate sponsors) by portraying the Roman ruler with a curious likeness to President Donald Trump.Spoiler alert: The Trump-Caesar resemblance is causing tension because, as any Shakespeare or “Mean Girls” devotee knows, Caesar is assassinated in the course of the play. Or, as Fox & Friends reported, “President Trump [is] brutally stabbed to death by women and minorities.” Of course, Shakespeare did not pen his bloody death sequence with Trump in mind. Nevertheless, artistic director Oskar Eustis’ decision to stage the killing of a mercurial, blonde-haired ruler in an ill-fitting suit and too-long red tie has drawn criticism from some viewers, various right-wing media outlets and Donald Trump Jr.Delta Airlines and Bank of America responded to the firestorm by withdrawing financial support from the production, which is currently running at Central Park’s Delacorte Theater as part of New York’s famed Shakespeare in the Park festival.Delta released a statement condemning the performance’s “graphic staging,” describing the show’s artistic and creative direction as having “crossed the line on the standards of good taste.” A spokeswoman for Bank of America similarly lamented that “The Public Theater chose to present ‘Julius Caesar’ in a way that was intended to provoke and offend.” American Express also tweeted that the company does not “condone the interpretation of the Julius Caesar play” despite its continued sponsorship of The Public Theater’s other endeavors.As corporations severed ties to the show, theater buffs and high school English honors students were quick to call out the absurdity of the denunciations ― not only because of a little thing called freedom of speech, but because many don’t quite seem to recall what the whole message of “Julius Caesar” actually is. Yes, Eustis’ production of “Julius Caesar” features, in no subtle terms, a Trumpian ruler being stabbed to death by senators, ostensibly, for the good of their nation. But the remainder of the play hashes out how this decision to off a tyrannical ruler in such an undemocratic manner yields nothing but disaster. As New York Times’ Jesse Green wrote in his review of the show: “Even a cursory reading of the play, the kind that many American teenagers give it in high school, is enough to show that it does not advocate assassination. Shakespeare portrays the killing of Caesar by seven of his fellow senators as an unmitigated disaster for Rome, no matter how patriotic the intentions.”For those whose memories have faded a bit since 11th grade, a brief refresher: “Julius Caesar” tells the tale of a demagogue ruling the Roman republic in 44 B.C. A conspiracy grows against the ruler, a man senators feel has grown tyrannical and threatens the future of the nation. In the famed Act 3, Scene 1, Caesar is killed by his fellow statesmen under the guise of patriotism. Yet the decision to kill Caesar ends up shattering Rome’s democracy, rather than saving it. The play, then, warns viewers against violent reactions to despotic rule. As Eustis wrote in a note regarding the show: “’Julius Caesar’ can be read as a warning parable to those who try to fight for democracy by undemocratic means. To fight the tyrant does not mean imitating him.”To suggest the production advocates for or excuses violence in any way is just false. If anything, the play suggests the very opposite, advising against the power-hungriness both Caesar and his opponents embody. If the advice is not heeded, as Gregg Henry, the actor playing Caesar at The Public, warned cheekily in an interview with Backstage: “You can end up losing democracy for like, 2,000 years.”For some viewers, however, the message of Shakespeare’s words has faded into the background, overshadowed by the visceral power of a Trump-like actor’s white shirt stained with fake blood making its rounds across social media.One named Laura Shaeffer expressed her disgust in an interview with Mediaite. “To be honest I thought it was shocking and distasteful,” she said. “If this had happened to any other president — even as recently as Barack Obama or George W. Bush — it would not have flown. People would have been horrified.”Fair enough, except past productions have featured Caesar in the guise of both presidents listed above, among others.In a 2013 review of “Julius Caesar” at Minneapolis St. Paul’s Guthrie Theater, a critic for Mpls St Paul Magazine described the value of casting Caesar as a “tall, lanky black man,” despite the resemblance being “too obvious.”“Like Caesar, Obama rose to power on a tide of public goodwill,” the piece reads, “like Caesar, there were many in government who doubted Obama’s leadership abilities; and now that Obama’s first term has failed to live up to the messianic hype, there are plenty of people who — for the good of the country, you understand, not their own glory — want to take Obama down.”So, this whole cast-a-Shakespearian-tale-in-modern-day-light thing is nothing new. It’s actually, a centuries-old practice. And Trump isn’t being forced to endure anything to which previous American presidents haven’t already been subjected. For eons, political leaders have been accused of greed, egotism and a lust for power. Democracy, as a result, can feel fragile ― if not under siege. Art exists in times like these to illuminate the patterns between past and present while untangling the particulars that distinguish each. It can stir provocation, yes, but also reflection, dissent and enlightenment. The theater is often viewed as a space for pushing boundaries and critical thinking. In this production, despite the bloodshed onstage, no real person leaves wounded or endangered; audiences are not encouraged to wreck havoc on any American politician. (In fact, quite the opposite.) To suggest the staging of one of the most esteemed dramas of all time is “political speech” targeted directly and uniquely at Trump not only ignores the play’s message, but its history, too. As one seemingly incredulous viewer said in a video interview with Inside Edition: “It’s not really the president, it’s theater. Everyone knows it’s theater.” Julius Caesar is slated to run at Central Park’s Delacorte Theater until June 18 as part of New York’s Shakespeare in the Park festival. Tickets are free.Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."

Luckily, we do not live in a dictatorship.”Some community members aren’t happy with the mayor’s decision. Teton County Commissioner Paul Vogelheim, who also chairs the county’s Republican Party, called the move “totally disrespectful,” and said portraits of U.S. presidents have hung in the town hall since at least the 1980s.Vogelheim told HuffPost he’s concerned the mayor’s action is bringing “ugly, national partisan politics” into Jackson, a popular tourist destination located about five miles from Grand Teton National Park.“It has fanned this fire of divisiveness among friends and neighbors,” Vogelheim said. “It’s unfortunate.”Trump walloped Democrat Hillary Clinton in carrying Wyoming’s three electoral votes last November; he won close to 69 percent of the statewide vote while she got about 22 percent. But she dominated in Teton County, which includes Jackson, getting about 58 percent of the vote there to about 31 percent for Trump. It was the only Wyoming county she won. Councilman Jim Stanford said hanging portraits of the president and vice president in town hall isn’t a longstanding tradition, and only began in the early 2000s.Stanford said someone ― without the council’s permission ― first hung photographs of former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney, likely to honor Cheney’s Wyoming roots. Those were then replaced by portraits of their successors, Barack Obama and Joe Biden. “I’ve always found it a bit strange to have a portrait of the ‘supreme leader’ hanging in the town hall,” Stanford said. “We should be able to show up to a town meeting to work on town business without having to see the snarling mug of Donald Trump.” It was Stanford who suggested replacing the Trump and Pence portraits with an image of Chief Washakie, the leader of the local Shoshone Tribe in the mid-1800s.Washakie, who remains a well-known figure among many Jackson residents, brokered peace treaties and settlement deals between his tribe and the U.S. government. He became the only Native American chief to be given a full military funeral upon his death in 1900.“It’s a way to honor our native history,” Stanford said. “I think it’s an improvement.”Like Muldoon and Stanford, Vogelheim said he is “struggling” with some of Trump’s political stances, including on environmental issues and conservation measures.“Our current president is causing everyone to become activists in different ways,” he said. “But it’s a matter of how to channel your energy.”Vogelheim said the town council could vote to override the mayor’s decision and that he hopes a petition Republican Party activists are circulating will encourage it to do so.Muldoon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.“There’s no reason that [Washakie’s] picture can’t be hanging, too” Vogelheim said. “But let’s put the president and the vice president’s pictures back up.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593e94852200003d00c6d84c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jason Isbell is the kind of guy who would rather put his awards in an inconspicuous place than out in the open. But the singer-songwriter, who took home two Grammys in 2016, actually has his gramophone trophies prominently displayed in the parlor of his Nashville home. “My wife made me put them on the mantle. I probably would have put them somewhere where they weren’t so obvious but my wife says you gotta put them out where everybody can see them,” Isbell told HuffPost. Isbell’s wife, singer-songwriter and violinist Amanda Shires, is clearly proud of her husband of four years. She’s also one of his frequent musical collaborators, even lending a hand on his new album with the 400 Unit, called “The Nashville Sound,” due out Friday. “She’s a big help. Most songwriters don’t have any type of editor. You’re pretty much on your own. You either co-write with people or you live and die by your own tastes,” he said. “And I’ve been lucky enough to have her around. She’s very educated in how words work. She just finished her master’s in poetry from the University of the South.”With his wife’s help, Isbell says that he’s able to get outside of his own head. When he does get inside his own head, though, Isbell is focused. After all, he’s been writing music for years ― both with Drive-By Truckers and on his solo records, the first of which came out in 2007. For Isbell, most of the songwriting happens at home. But with “The Nashville Sound,” he also spent time writing music “in some version of traveling, whether on the road or driving around in the car or on an airplane.” He said, “I try to take it any way I can get it. Whenever I’m able to work and get a few minutes to myself, I try to work.”Sometimes the lyrics are directly autobiographical, while other times he writes about observations or stories from friends. No matter what, he’s part of each track in some way. “It’s a record of events. I try to use albums as a documentation. It’s a chronicle in some ways. It’s always going to have me in there,” he said. “That doesn’t mean I’m always the first-person narrator.”Isbell is no stranger to spending a lot of time honing his craft, with his interest in music starting at a young age.“I was fortunate enough to be born into a family that was very musical and very close in lieu of childcare. I spent my days with my grandparents,” he said. “My grandfather taught me how to play instruments and that’s really the thing that started me on this particular path.”The 38-year-old singer-songwriter will start road-testing the new songs on tour this summer, with dates lined up from June through November. These days, with his recent success, life on the road is a bit more comfortable. “We’re traveling in a way that affords us a lot of rest, comparatively, compared to when we were in a van, driving seven or eight hours a day,” he said. “That’s hard to play a good show every night when you’re exhausted like that.” The concert set list will feature a mix of new songs and old. When asked if he has a favorite track to play live, Isbell was hard-pressed to pick one.“I like them all honestly. It’s hard to say. If I start getting anywhere near getting tired of a song I’ll drop it out of the list for a few months … ‘Cover Me Up’ really works live and it’s kind of the ace in the hole of me. It’s a slow song. It’s long. It’s a ballad. It’s one of those that if comes off correctly, which it almost always does, it stops the room. It’s nice to have a song like that. Like you know if everything’s going to shit I’m going to play this song.” Going on the road will be a bit different this time as Isbell ― a recent first-time dad ― will likely bring his 1-year-old daughter, Mercy Rose, on tour. “She’s easy …. Its nice to have an end game, to have this final purpose and it really kind of makes you feel like, ‘If I can serve this purpose, it will guide me to everything else.’” His daughter, meanwhile, is also intrigued by those two Grammys on the mantle. “The baby really likes to play with them, so they’re kind of smudged,” Isbell said.Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit debut “The Nashville Sound” on June 16.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) waves to the crowd alongside his wife Jane after his speech at The People's Summit in Chicago on Saturday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593edcc82200002d00c6d990.jpeg?cache=By3oQ60EwP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CHICAGO ― After Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) finished his speech to a packed theater of his supporters on Saturday night, he took time to answer a few pre-taped questions from activists.They wanted to know Sanders’ advice for talking to kids about climate change, overcoming Republican gerrymandering in the South ― and how to deal with losing elections, something a questioner comically noted Sanders knew a thing or two about from his early years in politics. “To those people who are losing right now, I’m sure they’d like to hear what got you through those dark times of losing over and over and over again. ... What got you through in those dark times?” television actor Kendrick Sampson asked, affectionately teasing Sanders.“Thank you very much, Kendrick,” Sander deadpanned, eliciting laughs from the audience. “Kendrick makes a good point: Don’t get locked into a moment, because things change and sometimes they change very, very rapidly.”Sanders went on to recount how he lost several campaigns for governor and senator before finally securing a post as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, then after two attempts, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Most recently, he won re-election to the Senate in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote.“The point is really that persistence is extremely important,” he concluded. It was a light-hearted exchange, but it summed up the political philosophy Sanders has sought to impress upon the grassroots movement that he built over the course of his ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign. Organize people around an unabashedly progressive political platform and eventually, you will win the power you need to implement it, Sanders maintains. The more than 4,000 Sanders followers that gathered this weekend to talk strategy, commiserate and hear from the country’s progressive rock stars at the second annual People’s Summit conference in Chicago were largely ready to accept Sanders’ vision of a long slog toward progress ― and his insistence that the best vehicle for the electoral component of those efforts remains the Democratic Party.In fact, one Sanders fan in attendance appeared to be taking his advice about persistence quite seriously. Moments after Sanders spoke, Rob Quist, the Montana Democrat who lost his special House election on May 25, informed HuffPost that he was taking a hard look at running again in 2018. It helped Sanders’ case that the conference began hours after U.K. left-wing Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn shocked the world with unexpected gains in the British election that deprived the Conservative Party of a majority. In his speech on Saturday night, Sanders encouraged his supporters to view Corbyn’s win as an affirmation of the progressive long game in the United States.“I want to tell you what you already know ― that the movement for economic, racial and environmental justice is not just growing here in the U.S. It is growing worldwide,” Sanders declared. Judging by the cheers that followed, the audience didn’t need much convincing. In the United States, the Sanders movement has met with less success in some of its earliest electoral tests since the November election. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a top Sanders ally, lost his bid to chair the Democratic National Committee. The two Sanders supporters who have run in special congressional elections ― Quist in Montana, and before that, James Thompson in Kansas ― were narrowly defeated, albeit in districts long held by Republicans.A recent Berniecrat effort to take over the California Democratic Party was similarly disappointing. Although Sanders activists mobilized en masse to win delegate spots to the state convention, their preferred candidate for chair, Kimberly Ellis, lost by a handful of votes to establishment favorite Eric Bauman. (Ellis and her backers are calling for an independent audit of the votes, alleging there were irregularities in the way proxy votes were counted.)“It’s not gonna be a sudden change. Some change happens fast; some change happens slow,” said Dan Gordon, a 34-year-old Los Angeles-based voice-over actor and Berniecrat delegate to the California Democratic Party convention.Speakers and attendees at the People’s Summit instead celebrated the victories of a number of state and local lawmakers in the Sanders mold, including Democratic district attorney nominee Larry Krasner in Philadelphia; Mayor Chokwe Lumumba of Jackson, Mississippi; and New York State Assemblywoman Christine Pellegrino. Other points of pride were the majority support for a $15 minimum wage among congressional Democrats, and the small but growing consensus in the party behind single-payer health insurance, a version of which the California state Senate recently passed.In keeping with the ground-up theme, parts of the People’s Summit functioned like a boot camp for activists looking to bring the Sanders revolution to their small towns and cities, one candidate or issue referendum at a time. Between speeches, panel discussions and at least one blowout dance party, there were “classes” taught by Sanders campaign veterans and successful progressive elected officials on tactics like digital organizing, nonviolent direct action and “transforming” the Democratic Party. “People are organizing all over the country right now ... and we are developing the action plan,” said Winnie Wong, a co-founder of the People for Bernie and a top conference organizer. “So we are occupying the position now of a sort of CENTCOM dashboard of the people who are giving calls to actions for people to plug into.”Danielle Kyle, a 19-year-old political science student at Western Illinois University who convinced her once-moderate mother to join her at the summit, said a workshop on “building progressive power in rural America” was especially helpful.A native of the Chicago suburbs, Kyle plans to stick around in rural Macomb, Illinois, after graduation and is considering a run for city council there in 2019.“I got a lot of different perspectives from people in West Virginia, people in rural Wyoming that I didn’t know,” she said of the class on rural organizing. “They told me that I’m not their urban savior. I shouldn’t go in there and fix things for them.”The left-wing confab in Chicago’s McCormick Place boasted attendees from all 50 states and a smattering of like-minded activists from Norway and Spain.Given the limited number of spots allotted for general registration, conference organizers considered people’s race, gender and motivation for coming when deciding who to admit.They also developed an elaborate system to ensure that financial need was not a barrier to participation. The labor union and influential Sanders backer National Nurses United covered the cost of the building rental, staff and amenities of the conference itself, including customized banners and swag, a mobile app for scheduling updates, three square meals for everyone and a handful of shopping-mall-style photo stations for goofy group pictures. Conference attendees were allowed to contribute to the costs of transportation and lodging on a sliding scale, with wealthier participants subsidizing busing and dorm-style accommodations for lower income activists to the tune of $220,000.“This is a representation of a democratizing movement. Having people here who could not afford to be here I think was very important,” Wong said, likening it to a real-life incarnation of the type of socialism she and her peers want to see on a national scale. For all of the conference’s discussion of ― and attempts to embody ― idealistic policies, however, the focus was overwhelmingly on issue-based organizing and taking over the Democratic Party to push it to the left, rather than rallying behind third-party efforts. At the same time, the Berniecrats’ vision for the party and plan for taking back power is strikingly different from that of their mainstream Democratic peers. Unlike on Capitol Hill and the talk shows of MSNBC, there was little interest in the investigation into ties between the Russian government and campaign associates of President Donald Trump. Some participants openly expressed doubt about the evidence of Russian influence in the election or welcomed the leaked Democratic National Committee emails for exposing the DNC staff’s bias toward former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Others simply argued that focusing disproportionately on Trump’s foibles would be no more successful now than it was during Clinton’s losing campaign.“They’re definitely still stuck in the idea that Trump’s gonna be thrown out of office. So they’re yet to take the steps forward in trying to move their own policies,” said Antonio Rodriguez, a 23-year-old psychology student at the University of Illinois, Chicago.A key part of the Berniecrats’ disagreement with other Democrats is their belief that the party’s embrace of business-friendly “neoliberal” policies since the 1990s led to an exodus of working people of all races from the party and laid the seeds for someone like Trump, who frequently relies on racist rhetoric, to pit the increasingly disenchanted working classes against one another.The only answer, attendees maintained, was to mobilize voters around class, and direct their anger toward the corporations and ultra-rich people blocking more equitable policies.Nick Martin, a 28-year-old liberal Mennonite activist sporting a Carhartt camouflage hat, claimed that his organization, Lancaster Stands Up, was using the tactic to recruit Trump supporters to a fight against a natural gas pipeline in the area.“We find that organizing people around the issues and having a narrative that talks about who the real enemy is as the billionaires, the ruling class, cuts across false divisions,” he said. Not everyone at the People’s Summit was still willing to work within the bounds of the Democratic Party though. There were dozens of people advertising their affiliation with “Draft Bernie for a People’s Party,” a new movement asking Sanders to start his own political party.At times the “Draft Bernie” partisans’ scorn for Democrats led them to turn on Sanders himself, booing Sanders’ calls for reforming the Democratic Party during his speech on Saturday night.Rod Brana, a 61-year-old architect from Washington, D.C., admitted to being one of the people who jeered, describing it as an almost involuntary bodily impulse. (His son Nick, a former junior staff member on the Sanders campaign, started the “Draft Bernie” initiative.)“It just comes out,” Brana said of the boos.The local and state-level wins Sanders highlighted paled in comparison to higher-profile failures to infiltrate the party, according to Brana ― especially Ellison’s defeat in the race for DNC chair and the results of the recent California Democratic Party chair election. “Kudos and congratulations to all the achievements, but it’s going too slow and there are limits to how much we can achieve as progressives within the Democratic Party,” he said.The People’s Summit organizers were tolerant of dissenting views about the Democratic Party, including by welcoming the Green Party to set up a booth in the exhibit hall.In private conversations though, leading figures in the Berniecrat orbit fretted about third-party advocates’ lack of pragmatism, emphasizing the basic barriers third parties face in getting on the ballot in 50 states.Claire Sandberg, a former senior organizer on the Sanders campaign who had just returned from advising Corbyn in the U.K., also lamented the impulse to view leaving the Democratic Party as a panacea.“They’re missing the fact that there is no shortcut to building a broad social consensus in favor of the policies that we need,” she said. “We’re actually in a battle for the common sense of America and we can’t do an end-run around that by starting a new formation and getting in the back door.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Other points of pride were the majority support for a $15 minimum wage among congressional Democrats, and the small but growing consensus in the party behind single-payer health insurance, a version of which the California state Senate recently passed.In keeping with the ground-up theme, parts of the People’s Summit functioned like a boot camp for activists looking to bring the Sanders revolution to their small towns and cities, one candidate or issue referendum at a time. Between speeches, panel discussions and at least one blowout dance party, there were “classes” taught by Sanders campaign veterans and successful progressive elected officials on tactics like digital organizing, nonviolent direct action and “transforming” the Democratic Party. “People are organizing all over the country right now ... and we are developing the action plan,” said Winnie Wong, a co-founder of the People for Bernie and a top conference organizer. “So we are occupying the position now of a sort of CENTCOM dashboard of the people who are giving calls to actions for people to plug into.”Danielle Kyle, a 19-year-old political science student at Western Illinois University who convinced her once-moderate mother to join her at the summit, said a workshop on “building progressive power in rural America” was especially helpful.A native of the Chicago suburbs, Kyle plans to stick around in rural Macomb, Illinois, after graduation and is considering a run for city council there in 2019.“I got a lot of different perspectives from people in West Virginia, people in rural Wyoming that I didn’t know,” she said of the class on rural organizing. “They told me that I’m not their urban savior. I shouldn’t go in there and fix things for them.”The left-wing confab in Chicago’s McCormick Place boasted attendees from all 50 states and a smattering of like-minded activists from Norway and Spain.Given the limited number of spots allotted for general registration, conference organizers considered people’s race, gender and motivation for coming when deciding who to admit.They also developed an elaborate system to ensure that financial need was not a barrier to participation. The labor union and influential Sanders backer National Nurses United covered the cost of the building rental, staff and amenities of the conference itself, including customized banners and swag, a mobile app for scheduling updates, three square meals for everyone and a handful of shopping-mall-style photo stations for goofy group pictures. Conference attendees were allowed to contribute to the costs of transportation and lodging on a sliding scale, with wealthier participants subsidizing busing and dorm-style accommodations for lower income activists to the tune of $220,000.“This is a representation of a democratizing movement. Having people here who could not afford to be here I think was very important,” Wong said, likening it to a real-life incarnation of the type of socialism she and her peers want to see on a national scale. For all of the conference’s discussion of ― and attempts to embody ― idealistic policies, however, the focus was overwhelmingly on issue-based organizing and taking over the Democratic Party to push it to the left, rather than rallying behind third-party efforts. At the same time, the Berniecrats’ vision for the party and plan for taking back power is strikingly different from that of their mainstream Democratic peers. Unlike on Capitol Hill and the talk shows of MSNBC, there was little interest in the investigation into ties between the Russian government and campaign associates of President Donald Trump. Some participants openly expressed doubt about the evidence of Russian influence in the election or welcomed the leaked Democratic National Committee emails for exposing the DNC staff’s bias toward former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Others simply argued that focusing disproportionately on Trump’s foibles would be no more successful now than it was during Clinton’s losing campaign.“They’re definitely still stuck in the idea that Trump’s gonna be thrown out of office. So they’re yet to take the steps forward in trying to move their own policies,” said Antonio Rodriguez, a 23-year-old psychology student at the University of Illinois, Chicago.A key part of the Berniecrats’ disagreement with other Democrats is their belief that the party’s embrace of business-friendly “neoliberal” policies since the 1990s led to an exodus of working people of all races from the party and laid the seeds for someone like Trump, who frequently relies on racist rhetoric, to pit the increasingly disenchanted working classes against one another.The only answer, attendees maintained, was to mobilize voters around class, and direct their anger toward the corporations and ultra-rich people blocking more equitable policies.Nick Martin, a 28-year-old liberal Mennonite activist sporting a Carhartt camouflage hat, claimed that his organization, Lancaster Stands Up, was using the tactic to recruit Trump supporters to a fight against a natural gas pipeline in the area.“We find that organizing people around the issues and having a narrative that talks about who the real enemy is as the billionaires, the ruling class, cuts across false divisions,” he said. Not everyone at the People’s Summit was still willing to work within the bounds of the Democratic Party though. There were dozens of people advertising their affiliation with “Draft Bernie for a People’s Party,” a new movement asking Sanders to start his own political party.At times the “Draft Bernie” partisans’ scorn for Democrats led them to turn on Sanders himself, booing Sanders’ calls for reforming the Democratic Party during his speech on Saturday night.Rod Brana, a 61-year-old architect from Washington, D.C., admitted to being one of the people who jeered, describing it as an almost involuntary bodily impulse. (His son Nick, a former junior staff member on the Sanders campaign, started the “Draft Bernie” initiative.)“It just comes out,” Brana said of the boos.The local and state-level wins Sanders highlighted paled in comparison to higher-profile failures to infiltrate the party, according to Brana ― especially Ellison’s defeat in the race for DNC chair and the results of the recent California Democratic Party chair election. “Kudos and congratulations to all the achievements, but it’s going too slow and there are limits to how much we can achieve as progressives within the Democratic Party,” he said.The People’s Summit organizers were tolerant of dissenting views about the Democratic Party, including by welcoming the Green Party to set up a booth in the exhibit hall.In private conversations though, leading figures in the Berniecrat orbit fretted about third-party advocates’ lack of pragmatism, emphasizing the basic barriers third parties face in getting on the ballot in 50 states.Claire Sandberg, a former senior organizer on the Sanders campaign who had just returned from advising Corbyn in the U.K., also lamented the impulse to view leaving the Democratic Party as a panacea.“They’re missing the fact that there is no shortcut to building a broad social consensus in favor of the policies that we need,” she said. “We’re actually in a battle for the common sense of America and we can’t do an end-run around that by starting a new formation and getting in the back door.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

44,MEDIA,Associated Press Names Julie Pace As Washington Bureau Chief,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/associated-press-julie-pace_us_593e8fb8e4b0b13f2c6c2dba,"She'll get more ""firepower"" to cover Trump-Russia story, as New York Times and Washington Post lead the charge.",2017-06-12,Julie Pace is expected to be the new Washington bureau chief for The Associated Press.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593e92611d00002900cc26b6.png?cache=cod88bwHY6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Associated Press named Julie Pace as Washington bureau chief on Monday and announced plans to bolster it’s coverage of the ongoing Russia investigation and intelligence matters. Pace, 35, joined the AP a decade ago and most recently served as chief White House correspondent. In recent years, she’s become one of the news organization’s most recognizable faces through regular appearances on television news shows and will continue reporting on Donald Trump’s presidency in her new role. The AP confirmed Pace’s appointment in a Monday memo from executive editor Sally Buzbee shortly after HuffPost’s report on the news organization’s plans. Buzbee described Pace as “the right person to lead this team as the Trump administration rocks the nation and the world.”The Washington bureau chief job has long been one of the most influential in the capital, given that the AP’s politics and policy coverage runs in newspapers and websites throughout the country.But the bureau has lacked a permanent bureau chief during a critical period period beginning shortly after Trump’s shocking presidential victory and through the news-saturated, crisis-driven first months of his administration. Wendy Benjaminson has been serving as the Washington bureau chief on an acting basis after Buzbee was promoted from that post to AP’s executive editor in mid-November.As Pace moves into the bureau job immediately, one of her most urgent tasks will be stepping up coverage of the investigation into links between Trump associates and Russia surrounding the 2016 election. The AP has had some successes on the overarching story, including breaking the news in April that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s consulting firm had received payments from a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party. But overall, it has lagged behind competitors such as The New York Times and The Washington Post, both of which have been battling for scoops and the AP’s investigative talent.The Post hired AP reporter Jack Gillum last month, while the Times scooped up reporter Eileen Sullivan last week. Sullivan was a member of the AP’s Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative team that also included Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman, both of whom work in the Times’ Washington bureau and have been deeply covering the Russia story.The AP not only has be concerned with The Times and Post, but outlets such as CNN and Reuters also have been regularly advancing the Trump-Russia story with scoops. Buzbee, in her memo, said the AP plans to “move additional investigative reporting resources onto the Trump-Russia story to provide more firepower” in the short term and post two additional full-time jobs in the coming days. Pace is highly regarded in the bureau and the move marks a generational shift for the news organization. But it’s not without risk, given that Pace has never managed a large operation and also plans to continue reporting and writing. She’ll have help, though, as Buzbee announced a new structure that’ll feature four deputy bureau chiefs“Our commitment to this bureau is strong and intense ― and will not waver,” Buzbee said. “We are excited by the challenges ahead, and by the team we’re assembling to attack them. Julie and the entire Washington operation have our full support ― and the deepest promise to do everything in our power to win on this story.”This article was updated after the AP officially named Pace bureau chief.

I often say that Flywheel is the only place I can “fly” and not think about nuts on planes. But that changed recently, too.I was preoccupied tweeting about flying with food allergies, so I had to rush to the exercise studio with only two minutes to spare. My favorite instructor was talking to a woman who seemed very upset outside the spin room.Being somewhat nosy, I could not help listening to their talk as I was putting on my spin shoes nearby. Imagine my surprise when I hear the words “No Benadryl, United Airlines, his throat was closing, he’s 18 years old, always eaten nuts, we did not know he had a nut allergy.”It’s amazing to me that sometimes in life, timing is everything. If I was not running late, I would never had overheard their conversation. I asked the instructor to introduce us and instead of going into the class ― I took some time to listen to Karen’s story.Her family had taken a vacation to Mexico and was flying back home on United Airlines. Her 18-year-old son, who had no history of food allergy, ate the warm nuts they served and felt his throat heat up. Not knowing what was happening, he kept ordering Sprites to quench his throat as it seemed to be on fire.Karen told me that “My son was really scared and kept minimizing the symptoms ― he ordered drinks, tried to sleep but he broke out in hives and was really nauseous.”Once the family finally realized this could be an allergic reaction, they asked airline staff for Benadryl. The crew told Karen they did not have any on board in the medical kit. According to her, they had absolutely no clue what to do for a food allergy reaction. Finally, as hives began to creep up his body, and Karen insisting, they made an announcement asking if any other passenger had Benadryl. Someone gave them his medicine and he took a dose.By the time they landed he was covered in hives with his throat feeling very constricted. Karen described the end of the flight as somewhat chaotic as “They had to pry my son out of the bathroom because he was so nauseous and covered in hives.” An ambulance and paramedics met the plane and he was taken to a local hospital.Thankfully we have a happy ending here. I shared the story of 11-year-old Oakley Debbs who had recently died from food-induced anaphylaxis. Karen had no idea that things could have turned out so drastically different.This story reminds us that food allergies can happen at any age to any person and triggered by ANY food ― even one you have been eating forever. A study in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology shows upwards of 15 percent of the people with potentially harmful food allergies have developed them as adults.This is frightening considering many airlines still serve potential trigger foods among them nuts and shellfish.Airlines are not required to stock their planes with easy-to-use auto injectors that any adult or child could operate. I am part of a FARE-led coalition seeking to replace the unlabeled epinephrine ampules currently on planes with easy to use auto-injectors, concurrent with training the staff on how to recognize and treat an anaphylactic reaction.Having an easy to use auto-injector may mean the difference between life and death for a known food allergic person, as well as a person who doesn’t know they have developed an allergy.Unknown food allergies in children are more common than you would think - data shows that approximately 20-25 percent of stock epinephrine in schools was administered to children whose allergy was unknown at that time.I have encountered many naysayers who don’t think a food allergy is their problem. But I caution you that one day, it may be you, your spouse or your loved one who has an undiagnosed food allergy and experiences anaphylaxis at 35,000 feet.You might not have the happy ending as Karen did. So when I lobby for auto-injectors on airlines, I am not just thinking about my child. I am thinking about you as well."

In response, former EPA employees have formed a new bipartisan group called the Environmental Protection Network to help reporters, activists and policymakers penetrate an administration they accuse of waging an “ideologically driven” battle to cripple core functions of the agency. On Monday, the group hosted a call to brief reporters on what slashing 31 percent of the EPA’s budget would mean for the agency. The scientists, lawyers, economists and engineers in the network submitted detailed comments to the EPA cautioning officials against scrapping regulations just because industry deems them onerous. The organization, which does not yet have a website, also helped reporters phrase Freedom of Information Act requests to make them as specific as possible. “There are a variety of ways our experience and our unique institutional memory can help the work we can do,” Ruth Greenspan Bell, who worked for the EPA’s general counsel under President Bill Clinton, said on Monday’s call. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.The Environmental Protection Network plans to help counter legislation passed in March by House Republicans to limit the types of scientific studies the EPA can use when drafting regulations. The bill comes as part of a larger push by the Republican-controlled White House and Congress to give industry more power over the rules that govern it. But don’t expect the EPN to join the ranks of the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council.“We don’t see ourselves as a green group,” said George Wyeth, who served as an EPA staff attorney for 27 years before leaving this January. “So we don’t see ourselves weighing in on narrow, specific issues. But we’ll take those one by one.” Pruitt, an avowed fossil fuel ally whose views on climate change clash with those of an overwhelming majority of scientists, has emerged as a powerful figure in the White House since President Donald Trump decided to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. Amid the waves made by Trump’s announcement, Pruitt rebuked his detractors as “climate exaggerators” and touted the United States’ success in lowering emissions. Yet he still wants to eliminate programs that helped the country get there. “Environmental protection is an ongoing process,” Greenspan Bell said. “This sort of suggestion that Pruitt is making, that the mission is accomplished, is unfathomable.” "

I wasn’t really retired ― but I still wasn’t sure if I wanted to come back and play. I didn’t have a good answer for the question.So one day I’m sitting in a restaurant with my oldest daughter, Gianna, who was seven years old at the time, and I get the question again. Finally, the answer just came to me:“I’m done, I’m retired.”Gianna shot me a look, and she said, “No, you’re not! You’re still playing!”And then she’d look at the guy and say, “He’s still playing. He just hurt his knee.”Even when my knee got better and I started working out again, I was fine with the idea of retirement. I had a good run in the NBA, 16 years. I was ready to spend more time with my kids. Gianna, now 9, is the oldest of three. There’s Gianna’s little sister, Grayson, who’s 5, and Rashard Jr., who will be 7 in July. Those guys weren’t old enough to care much about my playing days. They were more interested in the kids play area than actually watching me in the game.These days, I can tell they wish they could see me back on the court – especially Gianna. Which is why the BIG3 came about at a perfect time.When my good friend Roger Mason, Jr., approached me last year about this new professional 3-on-3 basketball league (Roger, a teammate of mine with the Washington Wizards and the Heat, is the commissioner), I was immediately interested. In fact, it was a no-brainer. Not only was this an opportunity for my kids to see me take the court again, but it was a whole new opportunity for kids around the country to discover the excitement of 3-on-3 basketball. More importantly, it might be the best chance for some kids to go to a professional basketball game. And it’s damn sure a good way to keep kids off the street and out of trouble.I remember growing up as a kid in Houston, playing 3-on-3 in my grandmother’s driveway. I was lucky to be the youngest of four kids, so we had each other to keep ourselves busy and out of trouble. Not all kids are that fortunate.It easily could have gone the other way for me. My father was in and out of jail throughout my childhood. He really wasn’t in my life at all. Thankfully, I had two strong role models who guided me through those years. My mother was amazing – a single parent raising four kids. And believe me, we weren’t the easiest kids to deal with!Then there was my uncle, Wilbert Dale. My uncle was the father figure I never had in my own father. He stepped up, set an example, and really taught me how to be a man and live a good life.Without my mother and my uncle and sports, I don’t know where I’d be.I have to say that sports is what kept me out of trouble. No matter the circumstances, my mom kept us playing sports. She worked hard to provide for us and even harder to make sure we always stayed active. Whether it was football or basketball, we were playing one sport or another year-round.My biggest role model is my mom. She was the one there at every game, picking me up, dropping me off. She was like my mom and my coach.When we weren’t playing sports, we were watching sports. We’d watch every single Houston team – Rockets, Astros, Oilers. And we’d watch as a family. Sports has always been a huge part of my life, even if we could not afford to go to the games.I’ll never forget the sacrifices my mother made to provide for us and keep us happy. And I will never forget how my uncle was always there for us.You need quality time with someone you can look up to – whether it’s the mom, the dad, an uncle or cousin, an older brother. Whoever it is. It’s family time. Quality family time that you can’t replace. That kid whose dad or mom takes him to a game – they’ll always remember that.That’s where the BIG3 comes in. I never went to an NBA game until... well, until I was already in the NBA. We couldn’t afford it. So wouldn’t it be awesome if kids had the chance to go to BIG3 games this summer... for free? It would be their first experience watching professional basketball in person!When I was playing in Seattle and Orlando, I did a lot of work with the Ronald McDonald House. I’ve always had a special thing for kids, and I know how important it is for kids to have good role models. They push us to that next level. So I want to do something special, not only for kids but for the role models who are guiding them. For every paying adult that is taking a child (13 or younger) to a BIG3 game this summer, I’ll pay for the child’s ticket.It’s all about role models, especially parents, and the way they raise their children, guide them in the right direction. If we can help in any way, I think that’s good for the community. If we can try to help them just a little bit, maybe that provides the spark that sets them on a better path.Just because a lot of kids don’t have father figures doesn’t mean they can’t be steered in the right direction. I found a father figure in two or three different people. Positive people that would lead me in the right direction. You just have to follow the people that have a positive effect on your life.Being able to bring kids to BIG3 games for free this summer will be amazing.Anyway, just the other day, another guy came up to me and asked if I’ll ever be back in the NBA. I told him, “No, I’m retired. I’m done.”Of course, Gianna fired back: “No, he’s not finished! He’s playing with the BIG3!”And she can’t wait!"

Human rights abuses, the silencing of critics, an arbitrary rule of law, and a humanitarian crisis are among the manifold casualties of his rule, according to nongovernmental organizations.While the troubled South American nation is cash-strapped, Julio Borges, head of Venezuela’s opposition-led Congress, said—in a letter to Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein—that the deal would only support the ruling administration’s authoritarian streak and drive to avoid elections. “Goldman Sachs decided to make a quick buck off the suffering of the Venezuelan people,” he wrote.Low oil prices and an inefficient state-led economic model have shrunk the oil-dependent nation’s finances. While four years of recession have tested Venezuelans’ patience. But Maduro has been stubborn—entrenching his power and defending his power violently. The last few months alone have seen the deaths of over 60 anti-state protestors, as civilians amp-up the pressure on his rule.With state coffers depleted and Maduro desperate to fund his patronage networks in order to ward off threats to his power, the leader has become dependent on international financial deals. “I’m looking around the world for money, for businesses, for investors...” he said in a televised broadcast in May.Fortunately for Venezuelan debt holders, keen to avoid spiraling debt piles, Maduro has largely kept up with payments on bond deals, which have given him some temporary respite. Yet it comes at the expense of dwindling imports of food, medicine, and other basic amenities. Malnutrition is rising, and the infant mortality rate has increased dramatically, The Washington Post reported. And so, it’s little surprise the financial product is being dubbed a “Hunger bond.”Goldman’s dealers clearly saw it as good business—an attractive financial opportunity amid despair. The bank reportedly purchased the bonds at $865mn, a 70 percent discount. It will receive over $700mn in interest payments until the bonds mature in 2022, at which stage they would be valued at $2.8bn. (The debt was issued in 2014 by Venezuela’s nationalized oil company PDVSA—and held by the country’s central bank.)With investors perhaps wagering that Venezuela would avoid bankruptcy, and escape political turmoil, the strongly discounted purchase—given the nation’s economic woes—is a lucrative investment. In fact, Nomura Securities, a Japanese investment bank, were also lured in with an investment worth $100mn in the bonds, at the same rate.Responding to the fierce disapproval of their deal—including protests outside their New York headquarters—a statement from the bank said the transaction happened via brokers and not directly with the Venezuelan government. That hardly makes it excusable, particularly as the bank has a dubious ethical track record, including recent investigations into its alleged ties with the corrupt 1MDB Malaysian state fund, and its exploitation of the Greek debt crisis.The deal also evaded the review of the bank’s senior executives and standards committee, raising concerns over how easily such trades can be made. And, it was not the first time the investment bank had been approached by the Maduro government for a bail-out either, according to Reuters. Compliance staff at Goldman are reportedly now reviewing the deal.The problem is systemic, and goes beyond Goldman. Other creditors of Venezuela include major asset management firms like Fidelity, Pimco, and BlackRock, according to the Financial Times, and individuals can make similar investments on a daily basis through emerging market fund offerings. And so, clearly, trading in the debt of poorly governed emerging market nations needs stricter control.Oppressive regimes know they can exploit the greed of the global banking system in order to gain funding. International banks can in turn inadvertently take advantage of desperate situations, to extend profit margins. This, in the case of Venezuela, means propping up an autocracy, while incentivizing national austerity in order to service bond payments—all at the expense of hungry citizens.The whole process undermines the benefits of well-targeted aid, and the actions of civil society, which fight repression and promote development. The question is, what can be done? Emerging nations need access to capital markets for growth, and are never totally innocent when it comes to governance. But, either way, guidelines are necessary and the biggest abusers must be off investor limits. While more monitoring, tighter laws, investigations, and sanctions are also required.But activists can also play a key role. The Venezuelan opposition has already threatened to renege on any debt obligations should they come to power, and have also called on U.S. authorities to investigate the matter. Meanwhile old-fashioned shaming—which raises reputational costs for banks— through protest, might just discourage further investment in Venezuela, hasten the decline of the regime, and punish investors at the same time.After all, Goldman are now left in the tarnishing position of rooting for Maduro to remain in power, in order to receive its bond payments. And so, whatever way events pan out, as Borges said, the Wall Street giant will struggle to “put lipstick on this pig.”Tej Parikh is a global policy analyst and journalist.

Seven in ten residents are of the Creative Class – those who earn their living in science, technology, academia, medicine, media, management, finance, or the arts – and nearly 4,000 daily commuters pass through our downtown every day. But despite intensive placemaking efforts to turn South Orange into an exciting and thriving destination, the Village has struggled to attract more people downtown. One possible reason for this is New Jersey’s liquor regulations, which are among the strictest in the country. Only eight of South Orange’s 70 eateries are licensed to serve alcohol. And, of these eight, one is a members-only club and the other – the new Village Hall restaurant – has yet to begin construction and is not slated to open its doors until late 2018 (at the earliest). Due to this limited supply, the cost of a license can soar into the six or seven figures. The most expensive license in the state’s history sold for a whopping $1.8 million in 2016. And, rumor has it that Landmark Hospitality, which will own and operate the new Village Hall restaurant, paid north of $500,000 for its license – or nearly half the $1.2 million it invested to acquire the property. Few restaurants can afford to pay these prices, posing a significant barrier to entry. Given that alcohol sales can account for some 30% of an average restaurant’s sales, the lack of a license makes it significantly harder for new restaurants to succeed. Perhaps most importantly, liquor-license restrictions are impeding the economic development of our communities. New Jersey Assemblyman John Burzichelli has introduced a bill that would allow New Jersey to issue an unlimited number of liquor licenses at a reduced cost. Licenses would be sold for an initial low-cost fee, with annual renewals costing anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 depending on the restaurant’s size. Licensed restaurants would be subject to local regulations, such as specific hours for serving alcohol and a requirement to operate a full-service kitchen. Proponents of the bill claim that it could have a ripple effect on New Jersey’s economy, spurring economic development and encouraging healthy competition among local businesses. Initial estimates project that the bill’s passage could add $1 billion in local and state revenues and generate 15,000 to 20,000 new jobs.As both a practitioner and teacher of urban economic development, regional cooperation and placemaking, I believe that these estimates significantly understate the positive impact that Burzichelli’s bill could have on New Jersey’s communities. I have advised cities all over the world, from Jerusalem, Mexico City and Brisbane, to Washington, D.C., Miami, Portland and Vancouver. No matter their size, location or culture, communities must compete with each other to attract and retain residents. A Gallup survey identified “quality of place” as the main driver of civic satisfaction. For many, especially millennials, this revolves around an eclectic mix of high- and low-end restaurants, in addition to walkability, an abundance of public green spaces, strong schools and quality retail.Much published research has shown that expanding liquor licenses has a positive impact on local communities. A recent study from the University of Arkansas found significant economic gains for “dry” communities that legalized alcohol sales. Similarly, Oregon has built a new identity around its thriving alcohol sector, which has created more jobs since the Great Recession than its software industry, approximately 7,400 from January 2008 to September 2016. Most importantly, more-affordable liquor licenses promote inclusive development. Research from Tufts University found that Massachusetts’ cap on liquor licenses has made it difficult for commercial districts in black and low-income neighborhoods to attract restaurants. With this in mind, Boston is expanding liquor licenses in hopes of developing new restaurant clusters in underserved neighborhoods like Mattapan, Roxbury and East Boston. As George Jacobs, the president of a New Jersey-based development company, told New Jersey Business last year: “The impact [of Burzichelli’s bill] on most larger restaurants will be negligible, but the impact on the downtown redevelopment scene will be extraordinary….You can see how the rising tide lifts all ships.” While distributing more liquor licenses at affordable prices is not a silver bullet for economic development, it’s a necessary tool for encouraging business development. “When it comes to urban redevelopment, access to a liquor license can be the difference between failure and success,” New Jersey Senator Ray Lesniak said at a policy forum in March. Still, there are a number of obstacles to reforming New Jersey’s liquor laws. Critics argue that offering additional, more affordable licenses would be unfair to existing restaurants that have already paid the hefty liquor license fee. Burzichelli’s bill addresses this concern by offering generous tax credits over five years for these businesses. Another concern is that allowing more restaurants to serve alcohol will create a safety issue for local communities. This logic is backwards, however, given that the current restrictions encourage the operation of BYOB restaurants, which are loosely regulated.As my mentor and colleague Richard Florida has often written, quality of place is a necessity, not a frill; it “defines the very soul of a successful community.” Seen in this light, access to affordable liquor licenses is as important an economic concern as basics like parking, development and density. While liquor licenses may not be the first thing that come to mind when seeking to revive our downtown areas, perhaps they should be closer to the top of the list. As countless studies and local surveys have demonstrated, it is the intangible qualities like sipping cocktails with friends at innovative restaurants that carry considerable weight with existing residents – and that do a lot to attract new ones."

However, it’s an excellent strategy or coping mechanism for managing depression. Notice I used the word “managing” in reference to depression. That’s because in some ways we have limited control over how depression impacts us on a personal level.What we DO have control over are our actions once we start feeling depressed. This is what cognitive behavior therapy is all about. You are learning real coping skills to deal with the intrusive thoughts associated with feeling depressed. CBT encourages people living with depression (myself included) to question or reality test their thoughts.For example here’s a common depression induced thought: nobody cares about me, and they would be better off if I didn’t exist.This thought is a based on multiple cognitive distortions. Let’s start with “nobody cares about me.” This is assumption based on mind reading. You don’t actually know if nobody cares about you because you can’t read their minds. Additionally, another distortion that’s involved here is overgeneralization. In life there will be people who care about you deeply and there will be others whom you are not as close to. It’s important to focus on the people who care for you and show you that you’re valued.Depression tries to trick you into believing you’re worthless and the truth is, underneath the blanket of depression: you know your worth. Depression isn’t WHO YOU ARE. Depression is an actual illness just like cancer or gastroenteritis. It should be treated with the same seriousness as a physical illness.When you’re depressed it’s important to seek a community of people who can help you through a depressive episode. There are excellent online resources out there like depression chat room that can help you feel like you are a part of something outside yourself. This kind of online-based platform can be helpful because when you’re depressed you often don’t feel like interacting with people outside your home. It’s a great start to speak to people online who are dealing with the same symptoms.In fact, starting with an online platform can give you the courage to leave your house and have more fulfilling in-person social interactions. It’s about furthering your self-confidence and empowering you to reach out to others. Depression wants you to hide; don’t listen to it. Depression wants you to isolate from friends; tell it to have a seat. Depression urges you to sleep the day away; remember that you CAN get out of bed if you take it one step at a time. You have the power to conquer your depressed mood.Remember to be kind to yourself as well. Depression wants to convince you that you are worthless, when in reality your worth is about how you see yourself. You can fight this monster entitled “depression” if you believe in yourself whole heartedly. Your voice matters, your opinion is valid and your feelings deserve to be heard. Depression cannot and will not triumph over who you are."

There were no boundaries. For over a decade Laurie and I have shown our true colors and constantly fight for equal rights and now, more than ever, we knew we wanted to be a part of the Equality March to show our solidarity with those marching in DC. We were so glad we joined the PVD Equality March for Unity and Pride and organizers Joe Di Mauro, Joe Wilson Jr and Tim Rondeau did a terrific job bringing it all together. As soon as we mentioned that we were attending our youngest son, Leo (16), wanted to join us without any prompting, which was so wonderful. Then seeing him put hours of work into making his sign and proudly holding it high during the march, was very emotive for us.The crowd gathered at the foot of the Rhode Island State House, it was a marvelous sight of extremes, seeing young children using their rainbow flags as capes running up and down the steps to the elderly, proving superheroe’s come be all ages. All wanting to share in this unifying moment. We heard from some great speakers who reflected on the Pulse Night Club massacre, honoring those who lost their lives along with the loss of life in the transgender community, heads were bowed and silence swept the crowd. But the overwhelming sense was that of unification, of being part of a community that is still strong and who will keep fighting and who will not go back in the closet.After the speeches were made the gathered crowd marched behind the enormous rainbow flag, it felt empowering as we chanted our way through the streets, cars tooting, people stopping to clap and take videoclips. We arrived at the foot of Rhode Island City Hall, with the rainbow flag taking up the entire width of the steps where both the Mayor, Jorge Elorza, and Governor, Gina Raimondo, of Rhode Island gave impassioned speeches. The crowd cheered as Governor Raimondo, with her young son by her side, officially proclaimed “the entire month of June is PRIDE month here in the state of Rhode Island.”Laurie explains “As I sat the night before the march, coloring in the words “Not Special Rights Human Rights” on the banner my wife and I had made, emotions ran through my blood as the word HUMAN kept haunting me. A word so small, yet so powerful! As we marched through the streets of Providence, RI with others for the LGBTQ community, all I could see were HUMANS, protesting the right to resist, resist all those who think they have the right to discriminate. As the chants grew louder “Out Of The Closet And Into The Streets” my heart beat faster, a sense of PRIDE filled me and right then and there I knew I will never stop advocating for myself and the group of people I’m PROUD to call my family!” The sense of family and acceptance is so important, Pride is important and hearing these words from Leo was inspiring to me. “I wanted to go to the march to show my unconditional support for my mom’s. I also wanted to show support for my friends who belong to the LGBTQ community. Now having done the march, I feel as though I belong to a much larger, more loving community than I thought possible.”We may be bombarded by news of an anti-LGBTQ administration but we have incredible rainbow clad superhero’s fighting for equality, human rights and inclusion on our side.

59,WORLD NEWS,How Architecture Is Helping Refugees Find Jobs In Sweden,"Architectural Digest, ContributorArchitectural Digest Magazine",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-architecture-is-helping-refugees-find-jobs-in-sweden_us_593ee9d2e4b094fa859f1ad3,"If the experiment is deemed a success, the structure can easily be taken apart and reconfigured elsewhere in the country or region.",2017-06-12,"<p>A rendering of the pop-up pavilion in Sweden, a place where refugees can receive training, connect with local nonprofits, and, most importantly, network with native-born Swedes.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593ee9fe160000f901115be3.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For Architectural Digest, by Nick Mafi.In the late 1800’s, the southern city of Malmo was where Swedish workers gathered to fight for better working conditions, thus sparking Sweden’s labor movement. As such, it’s apt that the same city is pushing for another type of action on workers’ rights. This time, however, it’s relating to the country’s refugee population. And they are doing so by unlocking the potential of architecture.During the refugee crisis of the past few years, Germany and Sweden took in more migrants than any other European Union country, many of whom were fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria and Iraq. Those who settled in Sweden were often sent to live in temporary housing units throughout the country. Now, some two years after the bulk of the roughly 200,000 refugees arrived in Sweden, many are still struggling to find work. Not only is it concerning that these refugees are unemployed, but it’s increasingly understood that unemployment, coupled with a lack of assimilation, has a potential to give rise to extremism.As such, the New York–based design studio ARExA has designed a pop-up pavilion where refugees can receive training, connect with local nonprofits, and, most important, network with native-born Swedes. Working in collaboration with designers Gustav Fagerström, Milad Barosen, Nathan King, and the Van Alen Institute, ARExA plans to have the pavilion — which is shaped like the top of a palm tree with the leaves shading those beneath it — host workshops and discussions on employment options throughout the local community during the daytime. At night, the structure’s leaves will turn upward, transforming the space into a well-lit gathering spot for locals to assemble, mingle, and get to know their fellow refugee neighbors while enjoying food, drinks and music. The reason these nighttime activities are so crucial for assimilation is that many of the new refugees live in segregated immigrant neighborhoods, traditionally making their interactions with long-term Swedish residents sparse, at best.The pop-up pavilion, which will be located at Malmo’s Enskifteshagen Park, will be a gathering spot from August 22 to September 2. Best of all, perhaps, is that if the experiment is deemed a success, the structure can easily be taken apart and reconfigured elsewhere in the country or region.More from Architectural Digest:126 Stunning Celebrity Homes Inside Jennifer Aniston’s Gorgeous Beverly Hills Home Go Inside a $53 Million Private Jet Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady’s Incredible L.A.

60,QUEER VOICES,"Since The Tragedy, America Has Failed The Pulse Shooting Victims","Jason Cruz, ContributorJason Cruz is a writer and recent Stetson University graduate ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/since-the-tragedy-america-has-failed-the-pulse-shooting-victims_us_593ee4fde4b0b13f2c6d2b0d,"We have not moved on, we have moved backward.",2017-06-12,Marchers carried the Pulse victims’ names through St. Petersburg,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593eeafc2200003d00c6d9f4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“They should have been here.”That was the mantra running through my mind on repeat and making my heart race with sorrow even now, almost 12 months later. “They” referred to the 49 dead queer folks gunned down at Pulse Nightclub a year ago today. “Here” meant the St. Petersburg Pride festival taking place a few weeks after the Latin night which would be the last night Pulse stood as a safe haven for LGBTQ people living in central Florida, shortly before it became shorthand for yet another site of uniquely American devastation.At the head of the parade were people marching with the names of the dead in their hands, stand-ins for the beautiful lives cut short by hatred and bigotry and a culture which propagates both. As their names moved silently through the crowd I hugged my lesbian friends and choked out the only thing I could: “they should have been here.”The 49 victims at Pulse were honored numerous times that night, and on many other nights across the nation. I happened to attend the Orlando City soccer match where 49 rainbow balloons marked out seats reserved for the dead and a 49th minute moment of silence stopped play. The Tony Awards, held just hours later after the tragedy, featured many a sobbing reminder that the theater is a place where love is love is love. Then-President Barack Obama had this to say about the massacre, in part:This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends ― our fellow Americans ― who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live. The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub ― it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights. So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American ― regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation ― is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a countryMillions of Americans recoiled in horror, struck back in anger, stood together in solidarity, or, like myself, wept in anguish. The city of Orlando bought Pulse and plans to turn it into a memorial. As a nation we hosted vigils, donated our time and money, tattooed rainbow pulses on our bodies, rainbow-ed our social media profiles, and declared #lovewins.And six months later, with the future of LGBTQ Americans on the line, we sent foxes to the hen house.We elected a president who, in addition to his other enormities, rushed to embrace the slaughter of innocent Americans as validation of his Islamophobia. We elected a vice-president who made his national name on an attempt to legalize anti-LGBT discrimination. We endorsed a political party which tacitly endorsed conversion therapy and uses state governments to roll back LGBT rights. They chose an attorney general who spent his time in the Senate attempting to block LGBT rights every chance he could. And a majority of their peers in both Houses of Congress, not to mention most governorships across the nation, are hell-bent on making sure guns have more public rights than queer folks.Of course, many factors influenced the ballots cast last November. But as I consider that the first 11 days of this Pride Month have all included a heavy dose of Trumpian surrealism, from our crashing withdrawal from the Paris Accords to Jim Comey’s testimony, to yesterday’s Tony Awards featuring numerous ACLU ribbons, I am painfully aware that the country’s political response to the deadliest shooting in US history was to grant a group of proud bigots immense power.We moved from a president who called the day Obergefell came down one when “slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt” to one who quietly pretends Pride month has been cancelled. (The snowflake probably doesn’t like seeing so many queer folks protesting his administration).In those first few days after the election, as I wandered Stetson University’s campus bewildered and afraid, one question burst from my skull on numerous occasions.Didn’t we ever matter?At the time, I asked not only if other LGBTQ people and I mattered but also my fellow Black and Hispanic people, the women and non-binary people who have saved so many of us, the immigrants building America’s underbelly, the poor and the sick and everyone else preparing to have their daily struggles compounded by the world’s most powerful government.I should have asked that question for the 49 dancers, lovers, friends, family members, unique flames snuffed out on a June night just six months earlier. I would have known immediately what seems so obvious to me now. For millions of my fellow Americans, they, I, and the rest simply do not matter. To the Bannonites, Pence people, and everyone else who thinks what I do in the privacy of my bedroom condemns me, I matter less than the dirt they hope to shovel over my body.So be it.A year after I awoke to some of the worst news I have ever seen, five months after watching those who would destroy us take office, sometime after most of the country moved on as though nothing happened, I am burning to fight.To march and wail and gnash teeth, and punch, and organize and disrupt, and love and join the queer folks I spent the weekend watching do all of these things at Pride demonstrations across the nation.To help remind the country that Pride sprung from resistance, with bricks flung from the hands of transwomen of color, and the bodies of AIDS victims, and a man who just wanted to exist on his husband’s death certificate, and the struggles of too too many unsung heroes who wanted nothing more than to live and love authentically and help others do the same. That fighting and cajoling and grasping is the only reason young queers like myself can enjoy the degree of acceptance we do today, though it remains less than we deserve.Over the past few years, building a LGBTQ family and support network has saved my life, enabled me to discover myself, live out my passions, and hope in even the bleakest moments. I hope to take the strength they have given me and pay it forward ten times over. Together, in solidarity as an LGBTQ community linked with the rest of the oppressed around us, I believe that one day we can be truly free.We shall not rest until we honor the lives and spirits of the 49 who came together in love and joy only to be slain by hate. We remember them, and together we will not fail them forever.I sign off with eternal love, sorrow, and remembrance for:Stanley Almodovar III, 23 years oldAmanda L. Alvear, 25 years oldOscar A.

61,POLITICS,Many Conservative Christian Activists Are Still OK With Donald Trump,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/many-conservative-christian-activists-are-ok-with-donald-trump_us_593ed07ce4b0b13f2c6ce3b5,They're happily turning the other cheek.,2017-06-12,"Members of the clergy pray over Donald Trump, then the Republican presidential nominee, on Sept. 21, 2016, at the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593ed0be2200002d00c6d94a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump isn’t exactly a paragon of Christian virtue. A close reading of the Ten Commandments would find him guilty of adultery, theft, bearing false witness and coveting more than a few neighbors’ houses, wives and servants. There’s no documented evidence of him committing murder, but there are definitely bad jokes to be made about some of his business ventures and the GOP’s midterm chances. Nevertheless, Trump’s questionable piety wasn’t a problem for attendees at last week’s Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority conference in D.C. ― one of the year’s largest gatherings of conservative Christian political activists. These political crusaders cited the president’s accomplishments ― like appointing conservative Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and loosening restrictions on religious institutions engaging in political activity ― as evidence that Trump himself is a near-miracle. “I am genuinely excited about what God is doing in America right now,” proclaimed Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) during his address to the conference on Saturday morning. He credited the GOP’s November triumphs to the prayers of conservatives who had beseeched God to set in motion a “refounding of our nation.” Trump the man didn’t feature strongly in Loudermilk’s remarks; however, the congressman’s excitement for Washington’s current single-party rule implied he was imminently impressed that Donald Trump is a Republican with a pulse. Indeed, to hear the language employed by speakers and attendees at last week’s gathering, Trump the ally ― the crude but reliable vector for the Christian conservative agenda ― is a welcome development, though Trump’s personal morality doesn’t meet their standards. Even if they think eternal hellfire may await the commander-in-chief in the hereafter, for the time being all they can hear is harps.“It is June of 2017 and Hillary Clinton is not the president of the United States,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Trump’s former opponent for the Republican presidential nomination, said to a hearty round of applause on Thursday morning. Cruz then referenced Gorsuch’s confirmation, earning even greater applause. Trump’s name only came up several times during Cruz’s speech, despite his focus on the political situation. Rather conspicuously, the Texas lawmaker chose instead to refer to “the administration” or “the president.” Like Loudermilk and so many of the Road to Majority attendees, Cruz had clearly decided to close his eyes and think of England ― or if not England, at least a more conservative D.C. Circuit. “This is a strange time in Washington,” Cruz said diplomatically, imploring the administration, among others, to “ignore the political circus” and “focus on delivering results.” In his own remarks to the conference, Trump didn’t focus much on his own faith, but instead tallied his accomplishments on behalf of this key Republican constituency. He did, however, sneak in a reference to the thing that he and the assembled activists share most deeply: a sense of ongoing persecution. “As you know, we’re under siege. You understand that. But we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever. You watch,” Trump said Thursday. “You fought hard for me, and now I’m fighting hard for all of you.” Nothing seemed to dampen the excitement inside the Omni Shoreham hotel in Northwest D.C., not even pride weekend, which overlapped with the gathering. One year ago, many of these activists thought they would be contending with President Hillary Clinton and a far more liberal agenda. That thousands of LGBTQ Americans and their allies were parading through the capital was of little concern. Yes, the president once referred to “Two Corinthians” while citing a Bible passage and, yes, he has admitted to sexually assaulting women, but in the eyes of attendees, he’s still better than Hillary Clinton. Presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway most aptly summarized the mood during an interview with Faith and Freedom chair Ralph Reed. “I admit I thank God everyday and click my heels three times and say, ‘She is not the president. She is not the president. She is not the president,’ and it helps!”“I want you to know that we not only have his back, but we have your back, and we love you,” Ralph Reed, the founder and chairman of Faith and Freedom, gushed as he wrapped up the interview with Conway. Love may not have been the pervasive attitude this past weekend, but the relief certainly was palpable. Mark Repke, an anti-abortion activist from Virginia, told HuffPost he’s happy with Trump’s judicial nominations and efforts to strip Planned Parenthood of funding, but says it “absolutely” can be difficult reconciling Trump’s personal indiscretions with his favorable record as president.  “Trump wasn’t my No.1 candidate ― he wasn’t in my top five,” recalled Repke, who voted for businesswoman Carly Fiorina in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. “The reality is, he’s 50 times better than Hillary Clinton.” Standing beside his conference vendor booth ― a display case featuring tiny baby-shaped hand soaps that he says represent the number of abortions performed at Planned Parenthood clinics each year ― Repke said conservatives needed to approach the matter of Trump with a degree of realism. “There are people out here who couldn’t lead a starving man to food, but they’re good people,” observed Repke. “That doesn’t help any.” That said, Repke is still hopeful for the president’s soul. “I pray ... that he will find the guidance to temper some of his tweets,” he said with a chuckle. “Paul is the rock on which the Church is built. He used to kill Christians, that was his job! I don’t think that God takes the best of us, I think he takes those of us who are most flawed and who understand our flaws and does great things with them.” Igor Bobic contributed reporting to this article."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593daefe1600002100115893.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Iran has sent planes full of food to Qatar and will continue to send more each day as the blockaded nation weathers its diplomatic crisis, Iranian officials said this weekend. “After Qatar was sanctioned by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, Iran Air has transferred foodstuff and vegetables to Qatar on four flights so far,” Shahrokh Noushabadi, the head of Iran’s national airline, told Fars News Agency on Saturday. Tehran says it will send another 100 tons of fruit and vegetables every day to Qatar, which relies on imports from neighboring countries for much of its food supplies and is facing shortages after its powerful neighboring countries cut off economic and diplomatic ties. Iran’s deputy head of the Ports and Maritime Organization said Sunday that its ports are prepared to ship goods to Qatar. The closure of the borders constitute a full-blown crisis to the small nation, with citizens flocking to stores and scrambling to stock up on food as the economy hangs in limbo. Previously, Qatar had been importing around 80 percent of its food from its bigger neighbors, Reuters estimated. Those neighboring countries cut ties last week, accusing the Qatari royals of supporting Islamist militants and Iran. The long-simmering dispute took on new proportions after Qatar’s ruling emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, was quoted in the country’s state news agency praising Israel and Iran, two of Saudi Arabia’s biggest adversaries. While Qatar blamed the story on hackers, it was only the latest in years of strain. Tensions spiked when the emir defied Saudi Arabia and called to congratulate Iranian President Hassan Rouhani upon being reelected. The Gulf dispute has been further complicated by the Trump administration’s confusing stance on the crisis in Qatar.The U.S. has long criticized Qatar, saying the country is lax on preventing private citizens from fundraising for militant groups, but its response to the crisis has been shaky. While President Donald Trump first praised the blockade in a series of tweets last Tuesday ― despite Qatar being home to the largest U.S. military base in the region ― he called regional leaders Wednesday telling them he wants to be a mediator.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and several other officials have also attempted to convince Qatar’s neighbors to restore relations.Meanwhile, Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the U.S. and chief driver of the campaign against Qatar, has laid low, several of his emails leaked to and verified by HuffPost reveal he likely expected that the U.S. would back him on the Qatar sanctions.

Improving standards of living and employment opportunities everywhere should be prioritized, she said.Her comments take aim at Trump’s election pledge to make Mexico pay for a “big, fat, beautiful wall” along the U.S.-Mexico border to keep immigrants from crossing into the U.S. A long record exists of such walls failing and friendly diplomacy succeeding, said Merkel, whose government has welcomed more than a million refugees into Germany since 2015. “It’s an issue you can study well in the history of China with the (Great) Wall of China, you can study it in the history of the Roman Empire,” she said during the panel. “Essentially, only when great empires have managed to forge sensible relationships with their neighbors and to manage migration has it been a success.”"

The show frequently appeals to us, either because of the play itself or because of the cast and director, so we generally find ourselves up there a couple of times a year.For after-theater supper, we used to despair of the somewhat awkward French restaurant right across the street: The Almeida. Then a couple of years ago the owners – the D&D London restaurant group – revamped the dining room and engaged a new chef, Tommy Boland; the food and service blossomed, and with it our fondness for the place, as I wrote for HuffPost at the time. Mr. Boland later moved on, and in April 2017, after a major renovation, everything changed again. The Calabrian-born chef Francesco Mazzei has taken charge of the kitchen at what is now called Radici (Roots). We were much taken with the cooking at his former restaurant l’Anima, though its stark décor and noisy acoustic were a deterrent for us. In 2015 he set up shop at Sartoria (on Savile Row and under the same D&D umbrella) and continues there to produce stylish Italian food that’s at once refined and gutsy in luxuriously comfy surroundings.Radici, on the other hand, is more informal than luxurious, though the large space is comfy enough for me with its bare tables and its calculatedly mismatched chairs. It isn’t a hushed restaurant, but the noise is mostly that of people having a good time. The staff is able, quick-witted, well informed about food and drink – and exuberantly friendly: the woman at the front door greeted us like old pals, not in a hokey way but in a manner that made us feel welcome and comfortable. The food is exuberant and friendly too, if this can be said of something to eat. There are certainly plenty of southern Italian flavors, and these tend to make people happy. To call it home-style cooking would not do justice to Mr. Mazzei’s professionalism, but some dishes have something of the Italian grandmother about them. There are, for instance, spicy meatballs – listed as an antipasto, and served in a portion easily large enough to share or to eat as a main dish with a side order of, say, potato gattò (from the French gâteau): a Calabrian/Neapolitan potato cake enriched with cheese. And there’s spicy chicken Calabrese, which in Little Italys across the United States would probably, and wrongly, be called chicken cacciatore.There are pizzas, made with excellent ingredients and beautifully baked in a wood-fired oven (other dishes are cooked in it too). We had a plain Margherita, which had all the virtues of Neapolitan pizza, simultaneously soft and chewy, with a puffed rim leopard-mottled from the heat of the oven and a center that grew soft and juicy as it took in the oil and sauce (good sauce – not just the plain tomatoes that purists might insist on, which is fine by me). The other pizzas are more creative but not pushed over the top by excess. Next time we’re in the restaurant, I’ll have my eye on the Siciliana, which suggests the flavors of pasta alla Norma: eggplant/aubergine and salted ricotta, in this instance smoked. Or maybe the ’nduja-and-chili Calabrese, because we know from Mr. Mazzei’s other restaurants that he has a way with ’nduja. (There’s no reason you couldn’t come to Radici and order just pizza and a beer.)If you haven’t guessed already, main courses tend toward the hearty: calf’s liver rolls stuffed with pancetta, garlic and sage; that spicy chicken; smothered salt cod and potatoes. There is a lighter side too: we ate perfectly grilled prawns/shrimp with a gentle herbed oil-and-vinegar dressing and a little salad of pea shoots. As a side dish, we tried, but failed, to finish a giant haystack of fried shoestrings of zucchini/courgettes – which stayed crisp throughout the meal, so canny was the coating and frying. Of course there is pasta, including ricotta-filled cannelloni and a lasagna variant using beef ragù, as well as vegetable and seafood options. We didn’t eat any the night we were there, however, because that would have left no room for pizza, much less dessert. What we did eat was something I wouldn’t have ordered if a friend hadn’t told us not to miss it: a pre-antipasto snack of peas in their pods, lightly oiled, grilled and salted, with a spritz of lemon added at the table. These were fantastic and fun to eat: You slip the pod into your mouth, then pull it out, using your teeth and lips to ease the sweet peas out and simultaneously scrape and suck off some of the char, oil and salt on the surface of the pod.We were wise to save room for dessert: a babà was soaked in an aromatic syrup flavored with bergamot citrus (the source of the perfume of Earl Grey tea), and a wedge of fragile pistachio cake had a true flavor of ground nuts.

Two very different men: a counter-culture Lefty icon and the former Director of the FBI. Different generations—Dylan was born in 1941, just as the U.S. entered World War II, and Comey in 1960, just as the Vietnam War was escalating. An old hippie and a suit; theoretically they would have little in common.In 2016, Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” It was a surprising pick, and the Swedish Academy’s first acknowledgement of song.Dylan was as surprised as everyone else. He seemed flummoxed, reluctant to accept, and only formally received his Nobel in a private ceremony a couple of months ago. To claim the prize, he had to commit to giving a Nobel Lecture by the end of this month, which he took very seriously. In it, he wondered aloud if his songs had any place in literature with a capital “L”, but then realized what that place was. He had not written those songs alone—his voice was new but his influences were many. He had changed his name from Zimmerman to Dylan after the poet Dylan Thomas because he thought it was an American thing to do. And he wanted to and he could because America is “a free country.” Bob Dylan came to prominence in the early 1960s. He did not go to college but studied other musicians and applied his craft. He played his guitar in small cafes, on street corners, wherever he could. His first album, entitled simply Bob Dylan, included traditional American songs like “I’m a Man of Constant Sorrow,” and “In My Time of Dyin’.” He blended folk and gospel music with the blues, delivering it all in a raspy voice that summoned the “Talking Blues” of earlier artists, a sound perfected by Delta bluesmen such as Son House and Robert Johnson and later refined by Woody Guthrie. In 1963, Dylan released The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan. Where he had only two original songs on his first album, Freewheelin’ featured eleven of his own compositions. Among the songs were “A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall” and “Talkin’ World War III Blues.” The album came out just at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis and much was made of its Cold War relevance. He supported the Civil Rights Movement with concerts and songs such as “Oxford Town,” “Only a Pawn in Their Game,” and “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll.” Dylan sang of troubled immigrants, failed friendship, violent death. These were songs about the hopes, fears, and experiences of all Americans. To him love of country has been to criticize what’s wrong in order to have people make it better. Over time Dylan’s songs have been recognized as a cultural force—if the times really were a’changin’, he was part of making it happen. In his Nobel Lecture, Dylan spoke of his musical and literary heritage. He named musicians but also three books he read in school: Moby Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front, and The Odyssey. They are all books about the Hero’s Journey. They reveal decisions and consequences, responses to adversity, the development of character, and the sheer will to endure in the face of greater forces. He outlined the plots in detail. His literary coming of age was filled with battle and fear. There’s Ishmael, who survived Captain Ahab’s reckless and ruinous pursuit of the great white whale, floating to safety on an empty coffin. There’s Paul, a young German soldier who is both a witness and a participant in the horrors of World War I—“This is a book where you lose your childhood, your faith in a meaningful world, and your concern for individuals…” Dylan said. There’s Odysseus, a hero of the Trojan War, who wanders for twenty years trying to get home, his way blocked at every turn by the Greek god Poseidon. These heroes don’t necessarily win or even survive, but they do resist the mighty forces ranked against them with all their will and energy. Dylan speaks of these stories as shared cultural experiences, “You too have had drugs dropped into your wine. You too have shared a bed with the wrong woman…You too have angered people you should not have…” he says. Yes indeed: The Vietnam War, the Sixties, and Watergate. JFK, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Medgar Evers, and Bobby Kennedy—all assassinated heroes. AIDS. 9/11 and war, war, war. These are all such tales—stories that relate to the endless process of becoming mature as a person and a country. Some are universals by which one develops values, loyalties, ethics, and even pragmatism, but all of the images in Dylan’s songs are specifically American—American heroes, situations, mistakes, horrors, joys, loves.And so to James Comey.I have no idea about Comey’s life as a youngster, but a glance at his profile reveals that before getting his law degree from the University of Chicago, he majored in chemistry and religion at the College of William and Mary. His senior thesis was on Reinhold Niebuhr and Jerry Falwell. I don’t know what Comey thought of Falwell’s bigotry, but Niebuhr is considered one of America’s most influential Protestant theologians and political philosophers. He was also a profound ethicist who influenced many of the best leaders of the last seventy years, including Martin Luther King, Jimmy Carter, John McCain, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton—and James Comey. For Comey, love of country is about service rather than activism. He began his career in the office of the U.S. Attorney, and, over the years, prosecuted notables ranging from members of the Gambino family to Martha Stewart. Gradually his career drew him closer to the halls of power. He became Deputy Council to the Senate Whitewater committee. He served as Deputy Attorney General and finally as Director of the F.B.I. Back then, he was a straight arrow and a registered Republican who could rise above personal politics. He served faithfully, if not “loyally,” under a variety of presidents from Clinton to Bush, from Obama to—not so much—Trump.There’s surely nothing like getting fired and having your reputation impugned to give you a leg up onto your high horse. Comey, “between opportunities” as he jokingly described his current lack of employment, was eager to testify before the Senate last week and to call out Donald Trump on a series of lies. He looked happy, as though being sacked had freed him from the conflict of serving this president while remaining an honest man. Honesty is a core value for him; he wanted the American people to know that the FBI is “honest” and does “honest work.” He spoke of keeping America as “the shining city on the hill.” He means it, and I believe he’s tried to live it, but that he has lacked the tools to resist compromise more often than he’s been comfortable doing. His sense of what’s right may have declined too deeply into his sense of what’s legal. Comey famously stood up to President George W. Bush when Alberto Gonzales and Andrew Card tried to do an end run around his authority as Acting Attorney General, by strong-arming John Ashcroft to reauthorize a secret domestic surveillance program while he was hospitalized after major surgery. But, a year later, when the Bush administration sought legal opinions that would allow them to use torture on insurgents and members of Al Qaida, Comey signed off on the memo—reluctantly, but he still signed. Bob Dylan might have a bead on this one when he says, “It may be the Devil or it may be the Lord, but you gotta serve somebody.” Though Comey was working for the president and trying to serve his country at the same time, at least he noticed that these two positions sometimes ethically diverge.Comey has been a “good soldier”, following sometimes distasteful orders but not standing up to say “no” unless he was on very solid ground. His career has turned on dilemmas. Go against “W”? Yes, but not so much on the issue of domestic surveillance by the NSA as the legality of White House procedure. Torture? Comey did not like it but wasn’t informed enough on the subject to pick holes in the legal reasoning. Hillary Clinton’s emails? He knew he should not say anything about re-opening her FBI investigation, but he succumbed to pressure to do so, believing Clinton would become the next president. He felt damned either way. “To live outside the law, you must be honest,” may be the words Dylan has lived by, certainly they show in his rambling lecture as he tries to explain where he fits in the great structures of myth and hard writing. He questions himself but accepts his place.Comey seems more self-assured—at ease calling the president a liar. At ease saying he kept notes on his meetings with Trump because of “the nature of the man.” At ease testifying to Congress and telling senators “no.” At ease fielding John McCain’s faltering mental capacity. At ease at last with a sense of outrage, if not about crimes we have committed, at least about attacks against us as a nation. I have wanted to respect Comey, but his adherence to the letter rather than the spirit of the law has always given me pause. His lack of passion in rejecting torture makes me more than queasy (his word), it makes me disgusted and sick. The first moment at which I felt kinship with him was on June 6th, when he smiled and said, “We have this big messy country where we fight with each other all the time, but nobody tells us what to fight about, what to think, what to vote for, except other Americans.” And then, describing Russian influence on the 2016 election, his outrage broke through, “We are talking about a foreign government that tried to shape the way we think, we vote, we act. That is a big deal…They are coming after America, which I hope we all love equally.”It’s not exactly “All Along the Watchtower,” but it’s a start. We may have Bob Dylan in our iTunes but we need to listen to James Comey too. LINK More of his testimony is certain to emerge, and hopefully because of it we’ll see the call for legislative action and structural reform to prevent a recurrence of 2016’s electoral fiasco. Comey’s going to spill his guts and it’s about saving our America. Listen to Dylan’s lecture too. Same deal.

Bob Dylan might have a bead on this one when he says, “It may be the Devil or it may be the Lord, but you gotta serve somebody.” Though Comey was working for the president and trying to serve his country at the same time, at least he noticed that these two positions sometimes ethically diverge.Comey has been a “good soldier”, following sometimes distasteful orders but not standing up to say “no” unless he was on very solid ground. His career has turned on dilemmas. Go against “W”? Yes, but not so much on the issue of domestic surveillance by the NSA as the legality of White House procedure. Torture? Comey did not like it but wasn’t informed enough on the subject to pick holes in the legal reasoning. Hillary Clinton’s emails? He knew he should not say anything about re-opening her FBI investigation, but he succumbed to pressure to do so, believing Clinton would become the next president. He felt damned either way. “To live outside the law, you must be honest,” may be the words Dylan has lived by, certainly they show in his rambling lecture as he tries to explain where he fits in the great structures of myth and hard writing. He questions himself but accepts his place.Comey seems more self-assured—at ease calling the president a liar. At ease saying he kept notes on his meetings with Trump because of “the nature of the man.” At ease testifying to Congress and telling senators “no.” At ease fielding John McCain’s faltering mental capacity. At ease at last with a sense of outrage, if not about crimes we have committed, at least about attacks against us as a nation. I have wanted to respect Comey, but his adherence to the letter rather than the spirit of the law has always given me pause. His lack of passion in rejecting torture makes me more than queasy (his word), it makes me disgusted and sick. The first moment at which I felt kinship with him was on June 6th, when he smiled and said, “We have this big messy country where we fight with each other all the time, but nobody tells us what to fight about, what to think, what to vote for, except other Americans.” And then, describing Russian influence on the 2016 election, his outrage broke through, “We are talking about a foreign government that tried to shape the way we think, we vote, we act. That is a big deal…They are coming after America, which I hope we all love equally.”It’s not exactly “All Along the Watchtower,” but it’s a start. We may have Bob Dylan in our iTunes but we need to listen to James Comey too. LINK More of his testimony is certain to emerge, and hopefully because of it we’ll see the call for legislative action and structural reform to prevent a recurrence of 2016’s electoral fiasco. Comey’s going to spill his guts and it’s about saving our America. Listen to Dylan’s lecture too. Same deal.

It was also one of the most",2017-06-11,<p>Batman (Adam West) and Robin (Burt Ward) in the colorful 1960s TV show.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593cba0e1d00001700cc2454.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Let’s agree that among all the film and TV versions of Batman, Adam West’s was the silliest.It was also one of the most important – because West kept Batman alive at a time when the character could have faded into bat-obscurity.In the ABC television series that ran from 1966 to 1968, West played Batman for laughs, parodying superhero situations and behavior while setting up jokes that could have been lifted from Hee-Haw.West’s Batman did face off with The Joker, the Riddler and the other familiar villains. But where those showdowns in the movies and the comic books would often lead Batman into very dark places – a response the current TV prequel Gotham seems to suggest is unavoidable – they took West in far different directions. They could just as easily, and randomly, end up with the Caped Crusader reminding teenage viewers that drinking plenty of milk builds strong and healthy bodies. West may have taken that advice himself, since he was 88 when he died of leukemia on Friday, and he kept working pretty much until the end. He appeared in hundreds of movies and TV shows, usually in guest roles and frequently as some incarnation of himself or Batman. That may be the strongest clue to the impact of his TV portrayal, which endured long after logic says it should have become a footnote.The TV series, to be honest, wasn’t that good. It was one joke, basically, that was recycled twice a week for the first two seasons and then once a week in the third and final season. Once you’d seen a couple of episodes, you knew the joke, which probably explains why ratings fell in the second season and plummeted in the third. No, it wasn’t script quality that kept West’s Batman in demand for the rest of West’s life.It wasn’t the fact Batman was played as a kind of earnest clown. No, the importance of West’s Batman is that it was a bridge, keeping Batman out there between the comic book years of the 1950s/early 1960s and his later explosion in the movies. Deep Batman fans, of course, didn’t need a bridge. They stayed around for the whole run. But Batman, like Superman and Spider-man, only reached the level he occupies today after he entered the wider realm of popular culture – when TV and movie viewers who knew nothing of his comic book universe found him entertaining and kind of cool. West’s Batman certainly drew viewers from the baby-boom kids who devoured comic books. By reinventing him as a campy TV character, the TV show also attracted millions of random curious civilians. Without the TV show, most of those civilians and even many of the comic-book fans would been moving on with their lives by, say, the 1970s. Life has a way of pushing pop culture aside. Because we had West’s Batman, whatever we thought of him, that didn’t happen. Batman never fell from our line of sight. Years later his name still resonated, which wasn’t the only reason studios started making Batman movies, but certainly didn’t hurt.By almost any conventional, logical assessment, West was the outlier in the Batman world, the odd duck that just didn’t belong at the party.Instead, he ended up as one of the party’s most memorable and well-loved hosts. Holy Go Figure, Batman. "
69,QUEER VOICES,Here's What Happened When I Went To Queer Summer Camp,"Jenny Block, ContributorWriter and Author of ""O Wow: Discovering Your Ultimate Orgasm""...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heres-what-happened-when-i-went-to-queer-summer-camp_us_593d82a5e4b0b65670e56b92,"For one week, A-Camp creates a magical place to witness and support our community.",2017-06-11,<p>A smattering of A-Camp staff at the Heaven is a Place on Earth camp dance.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593d838f1d00001a00cc24eb.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I first heard about A-Camp I knew I needed to go. A-Camp is the brainchild of Riese Bernard, and an outgrowth of her site Autostraddle, a wildly inclusive, feminist, online, queer community for women.A-Camp, open to queer women (cis and trans), non-binary people, and trans men (18 and over), is filled with campy activities… pun intended. They include traditional camp activities like bird-watching and canoeing and ceramics, as well as Shibari and racial justice sessions and bourbon tastings. A-Camp truly is the ultimate queer adult summer camp. (Getting ready for it was a lot like it was as a kid, except that I had to pack for myself and there were no labels ironed on to my overalls, plaid flannel shirts and hoodies.)The locale has recently moved from the West Coast to a woodsy site in Wisconsin. I knew it might be cold and rainy, but I had no idea just how cold and rainy until I arrived. I flew in to O’Hare and drove 85 miles to the camp, thinking that I must be lost at least half of the drive.I had been told that the only shopping was a nearby Walmart, so when I was 10 minutes from camp, I pulled in for essentials (i.e. real pillow, Mike’s Hard Lemonade). While filling my cart with unicorn-themed gear and trying to decide just how many pints of malt beverages I would need to get through the week, I heard someone yell, “Jenny Block!” I turned to find my friend Kaylah. She was one of the reasons I was going to camp. I met her, Sarah (also members of the Autostraddle team) and Riese on an Olivia trip. Seeing Kaylah made me calmer.Finally, I made it to camp — a strange mix of coming home and being in an alternate universe. I’ve been going to camp of one sort or another since I was a little girl. But this was something altogether different, and I could feel the difference hanging in the air.Sarah and I were assigned to the Bluebirds, a cabin known for throwing killer happy hours. They were also the oldest campers (read: over 20), so it seemed like a good fit that I, the oldest counselor, was assigned to them.I was at A-Camp to do sessions on two of my books — O Wow: Discovering Your Ultimate Orgasm and The Ultimate Guide to Solo Sex — and to sit on two panels — one on queer parenting, one on polyamory. But as much as campers said they learned from my sessions (and I hate to get all cliché on you here), it was I who learned far more from them than they could have possibly gotten from me.I live in a gay bubble. I am engaged to a powerful woman who has been such a leader that she was the grand marshal of Houston Pride. I write for gay publications. I write about gay issues. My friends are more than predominantly gay.Yet I’m not naïve. I live in Texas. I watch the news. I walk through the world as a cisgender, queer, Jewish woman and am encroached upon daily by straight, white, cis men. Looks, comments, manspreading, mansplaining and the rest. I am watching as a government that is no longer mine is working its hardest to whittle away at my rights. I fear for my disabled daughter’s insurance coverage and I shudder at the rise of white supremacy groups. I spend my time writing about how we must fight the machine. I am fighting for my rightful place in the world. I know what’s going on.I mean I thought I knew.But then I went to A-Camp.On the first night that my campers arrived, we formed a trust circle, each one choosing if and when to step in to share a statement. Other campers then chose if and when to step in with them to show that the statement holds true for them, too.“Some of you in this circle support me more than my own family.”“I fear I’m a failure as a parent.”“Camp is the one week where I can be myself.”“This week is the only one out of the year that I feel truly safe and loved.”I thought I knew what A-Camp was. But I did not. That night it was revealed to me that as much as I thought I knew about the challenges of our community, I didn’t know the half of it. But many of the campers and counselors do. Some of it’s an age thing — maybe most of it. I’m in my 40s, in a different place in a lot of ways then my 20-something fellow attendees. It’s not that I don’t know that it’s bad out there, it’s just that somehow I hoped that it was better now, easier in some ways at least. Maybe it is. But also it isn’t. It really, really isn’t, especially for the transgender members of our community.So, for one week, A-Camp creates a magical place to witness and support our community; to remember who makes up our community; to treat everyone gently and with kindness; to remember words can be weapons; to be accessible to anyone and everyone who identifies as “us;” to serve those who society not only underserves, but in almost every possible way, doesn’t serve at all; to be what the world has forgotten to be — good. Truly, purely, unselfishly, openly good.I don’t believe in “should-ing” all over people: You should do this. You shouldn’t do that. But in this case, I believe it’s justified. A-Camp models how people should serve and witness and treat one another.With a nod to Dr. King, I long for the day when everyone will be judged not by their bodies and with whom and how they choose to share (or not share) those bodies with but instead by the content of their character.I am grateful to A-Camp for reminding me why that must be, how that will be, our future. And I am equally grateful for the reminder of how far we still have to go. It breaks my heart. But it also awakens the fighting spirit that dwells restlessly inside me awaiting the future.Have a question about sex, relationships or life you want Jenny to address?

I’m not one for superhero movies, but it was an immense treat to read a message not aimed at making powerful women shut up (not gonna hyperlink Chris Cillizza, but….). WW was billed not only as a great action movie, but a leap forward for female representation.There’s a lot to like about the movie—including as a nod to female power—but it’s not a leap forward. The breakout woman’s action hero movie that should have gotten this kind of buzz came out in 2015. It’s called Spy,  and it’s the story of a woman who was at the top of her CIA training class but who works the equivalent of a pink-collar job supporting a glamorous, magnetic James Bond type. When she seizes the opportunity to get into the field, this woman saves the world from a rogue villain with a portable nuke, and she does it all while not slender.Wonder Woman, on the other hand, inspires us by saying that if you are a physically flawless superhuman member of a mythical race of warriors, and you try hard enough, you can (eventually) persuade a slightly-above-average man to believe your backstory and may also surreptitiously save the world while the men in power aren’t looking. If you change clothes.By comparison to Spy, Wonder Woman is about as gender-equalizing as Remington Steele - the 1980s series in which a talented female private investigator can’t get any clients until she finds a male poseur who looks the part to pretend to be her boss. If the dynamic between Diana, warrior goddess, and a dude named Steve, represents three decades worth of progress since Remington Steele, it’ll be a century before we elect a woman president.I don’t mean to be a complete naysayer. I found Wonder Woman inspiring at times. It’s not a perfect movie. My husband, who I can legitimately say is a feminist,[1] declared it “slow.” That disappointed me at first, but then I realized that of course he wouldn’t be mesmerized watching a little girl’s ambition (and somewhat off-putting bloodlust) win out over her mother’s expectations, or sit dumbstruck watching an all-woman army on their training field, unabashedly brutal and effective. As a part of a narrative arc for an ordinary superhero story, it’s sluggish. But if you’re 45 years into your XX chromosome American story, it feels like the climax. For me, the movie could have stopped when Diana found her power on Themyscira, and I’d feel something revolutionary had happened. I mean, on that island even the Princess Bride is actualized AF. I’d pay $12.50 just to watch Robin Wright beat the crap out of a Rodent of Unusual Size while Westley cringed and wet his black pants. I thought Gal Gadot did a beautiful job with the role. She’s vulnerable, martial, subtly witty, and clever.Nonetheless, it’s astonishing to me that Wonder Woman passes for a feminist tale today, because the story has no room for a human woman to be a hero, much less a realistic woman. Calling Wonder Woman a feminist story is the cinematic equivalent of saying “I’m not sexist; I would vote for Elizabeth Warren.”Wonder Woman 2017 Gal Gadot is indeed a wonder to behold. It’s a good thing the DC character is not even supposed to be human, because I can’t suspend disbelief to the point of accepting she could be the same species as me― this Goddess Who Does Not Know from Spanx. Nonetheless, apparently even she needs improvement in the form of flawlessly-applied eyeliner (maybe she’s born with it?). I tried to wear eyeliner to a bar mitzvah last week and it had dripped to my cheekbones by the time salad was served. Wonder Woman’s eye makeup stays put while she’s blowing up a fucking bell tower. #Respect.I’ll just pause here to acknowledge that this is where Bros would tweet that I’m a disgruntled ugly feminist who’s hostile to attractive women. Not at all. I’m happy, in a world full of strip mines, strip malls, and Mitch McConnell, to look at the likes of Gal Gadot for a couple of hours (I’ll also preempt you with the words of Allison Janney’s deputy FBI director in Spy, “please refrain from using the word ‘thunderc*nt.’”).Women are used to double standards, and Wonder Woman is no exception. The movie pairs a physically flawless woman with a male actor who is indisputably a step up from William Shatner but not among the top three hottest Chrisses working today. So there’s that.A warrior from a female warrior race, Diana gets treated to a Pretty Woman shopping sequence on arrival in 20th-century London. We’re supposed to rejoice watching Dian a reject clothes in which it would be difficult to fight, but (a) she ends up dressed as Suffragette Annie Hall; and (b) her actual battle gear is a metallic skort and wedge-heeled sandals—which is exactly what any sensible person would wear on horseback.Spy’s Susan Cooper’s relationship to clothes is refreshingly different. When she finally gets her shot at a field assignment, Cooper’s male colleagues give her a series of aliases apparently designed to degrade her because they are average women: a woman with multiple cats. A single mother. Women with boring women’s hobbies and elastic-waist pants. Women with names like Carol and Penny. And what does she do dressed in frumpy clothes and wigs, armed only with weaponized antifungal spray, stool softener, and hemorrhoid wipes? She kicks ass. She repeatedly rescues a (stupid) male agent. She saves New York from being nuked.While Susan Cooper manages to make the naysayer men in her life seem absurd, ineffectual, and a little sad, Wonder Woman takes shit from a mere mortal—a mere mortal named Steve, no less—and falls for him to boot. When they arrive in London, slightly-above-average Steve silences Diana when she makes her way into a meeting of Important Men discussing a potential armistice. He calls her his secretary and apologizes for her unseemly (or adorably naive?) attempt to behave as their equal.In Wonder Woman, we see that no woman can be so wondrous that she overcomes the presumption of male disbelief. Above-average Steve doesn’t entirely believe Diana’s story after she pulled him out of his sinking plane; even after he saw her magical island; even after the battle on the beach in which Claire Underwood leads a battalion of woman warriors in bronze-age skorts to defeat Germans with guns; even after he’s seen her stop a bullet with her forearm and kick the crap out of a bunch of guys in the alley. Even after that, fourth-hottest Chris working in Hollywood today does not fully believe Diana, who also speaks 200 languages (go on Twitter and say maybe sexism influenced some people’s votes, and you’ll get a taste of the Steve Treatment).Flawless, immortal Diana falls for Above-average Steve even after he unsuccessfully tries to prevent her from saving civilian lives. I’m reminded that in Spy, Susan Cooper tells us her mother used to say “give up on your dreams, Susan. She used to write that on my lunchbox.” Steve Trevor repeatedly tells Diana to dream a little smaller, but she still finds him inspiring. It’s not about what you deserve, he tells her. It’s about what you believe. But for a long time, he doesn’t believe in her. Susan Cooper has no time for the naysayers.Far into the story, Steve talks down to Diana about how the world works in spite of the fact that she’s read all twelve volumes of classical sexy time, translated a Sumerian chemistry formula in front of him, and told him that she was put on Earth to protect humans like him. It’s a feat of mansplaining unmatched by the most fervent bro on Twitter.Who wouldn’t fall in love with Steve? I can barely keep my shirt on just relating this story.The Diana/ Steve love story is possible because Diana accepts 20th-century gender norms more seamlessly and willingly than her costume change. Diana falls into early 20th century (let’s be honest—21st century) gender expectations without explanation or wonder. Just days off of the Island of Claire Underwood’s Badass Estrogen Army, she shows horror that women in particular are being victimized by war—apparently accepting without question that women in the world of humankind are nothing like the Amazons, nor should be. Fresh off an island where she has been the only child, and neither biologically nor culturally a human female, she makes a beeline for the first baby she sees.Could 2017 Wonder Woman ignore the baby because she’s not the type to sit at home and bake cookies? Or would that make her unappealing?Spy does it better. Once out of the basement, Susan Cooper doesn’t embrace—physically or emotionally—male terms of engagement. Perhaps because she has a female boss (imagine), or perhaps because she’s an actual #Womanwhoworks, no one can prevent Susan Cooper from doing her job regardless of whether the men in the room are happy about it. Once in the field, Susan gradually sheds her crush on a male colleague, deepens her friendship with a woman, and eventually foregoes dinner with her glamorous erstwhile crush to have a girls’ night in. By contrast, Diana’s process of actualizing happens when she embraces love as a motivator.Not only does Melissa McCarthy’s Susan Cooper save the world just like Wonder Woman, she shatters a glass ceiling that Diana does not. Spy’s Agent Karen Walker (Morena Baccarin) is a classically beautiful, thin woman who is already a field agent—a woman occupying the male James Bond space—before Susan Cooper makes her way out into the field (and before Gal Gadot tried on her first Power-Skort). Melissa McCarthy takes it a step further, daring to insert her unglamorous life and unremarkable body into a space currently reserved for only perfect women (note that Spy is not a model of intersectional representation; its cast not diverse). Wonder Woman provides space only for a woman deemed flawless and sexually desirable by Hollywood standards. That does not represent equality. Male superheroes are allowed not only to be human, but flawed. Batman is a cranky rich guy with cool toys (could he save Gotham with only stool softener and hemorrhoid wipes?). Iron Man engineers his way past a life-threatening injury. Spider Man is Tobey Maguire, ferfucksake. A female superhero must be more than an engineer. More than clever. More than changed by a radioactive spider. In fact, she may not be a real woman at all. I understand that Wonder Woman is supposed to be groundbreaking because it’s the first women-led comic book reboot. This says more about how we value stereotypically male and female genres than about Wonder Woman’s intrinsic value. Comic books and the movies about them are typically more misogynous or at least exclusionary, so a movie that tiptoes slightly forward in that space passes for feminist. It’s strange, too, that Wonder Woman’s warrior identity is being treated as so novel. Gal Gadot’s real identity - a former IDF combat trainer and Miss Israel 2004-- is as compelling and contradictory as Diana Prince herself. The fact that she is a woman warrior (others have written better about the complexity of her Israeli identity than I can do here) burnishes her credentials as a groundbreaking hero—she really is brave. But there are women serving in the military worldwide, including over 200,000 in the US military. That they are relatively invisible in our culture does not make them less real. If we wanted to celebrate actual martial bravery, we’ve got countless models, such as Lt. Emily Perez, the first black woman and first Latina to serve as Cadet Command Sergeant Major at West Point and who died in combat in Iraq.Gal Gadot is not the only woman soldier in the world; she’s perhaps the most marketably beautiful one. Melissa McCarthy shows a different kind of bravery—seeking, winning, and nailing leading roles while Decidedly Not Thin (note—I personally find Melissa McCarthy beautiful, and would say she’s more appealing than most of the Chrisses working today). Long before my 46th spin around the sun, I was aware that the world is not fond of women deemed imperfect by men, or that the world would be less mesmerized by a female hero with cankles than one whom Zeus himself bestowed with gravity-defying boobs and a 40-foot vertical leap. What surprises me, though, is that the latter has gotten so much airplay as a feminist milestone. In 2017, I can think of no more subversive act, for a woman, than unapologetically doing hero shit in a mortal woman’s body, not giving a fuck whether the men at your job have literally dressed you down. I have to wonder whether Wonder Woman Fever means that even the most fervent feminists among us, the most heartbroken of the #StillWithHer set, have made a silent, resigned accommodation to the rule that no mortal woman could be good enough to play with the big boys. I hope not. In the meantime, I have my breakout feminist action hero. Her name is Susan Cooper, and she doesn’t have to be perfect—she’s that good. [1] Ladies: please understand the difference between having a pro-choice boyfriend and a feminist boyfriend and act accordingly). "

A matter of minutes later Wawrinka wafted a forehand long to hand Nadal a second break of serve and the opening set.Wawrinka was flat, striking not a single winner off his glorious single-handed backhand in the first set, and with less than an hour on the clock his task already looked forlorn.Nadal was given a time violation warning at the start of the second, but Wawrinka could not halt his charge as the Spaniard bounded into a 3-0 lead in the second having won seven games in a row.With the crowd attempting to lift Wawrinka he stopped the rot to hold, firing himself up with a roar of “C’mon”.Nadal was relentless though, pinning Wawrinka back behind the baseline.

A matter of minutes later Wawrinka wafted a forehand long to hand Nadal a second break of serve and the opening set.Wawrinka was flat, striking not a single winner off his glorious single-handed backhand in the first set, and with less than an hour on the clock his task already looked forlorn.Nadal was given a time violation warning at the start of the second, but Wawrinka could not halt his charge as the Spaniard bounded into a 3-0 lead in the second having won seven games in a row.With the crowd attempting to lift Wawrinka he stopped the rot to hold, firing himself up with a roar of “C’mon”.Nadal was relentless though, pinning Wawrinka back behind the baseline. Even when he was stretched the response was emphatic, one astonishing forehand, whipped from close to the front row of seats to land in the corner, drawing gasps from the crowd and applause from Wawrinka.Social media lit up at that point with women’s semi-finalist Timea Bacsinszky tweeting “OMG!”Wawrinka could not lay a glove on Nadal and his frustration boiled over as the Spaniard closed in on a two-set lead, destroying his racket frame after a missed forehand.After Nadal sealed the second set both players left the court while court staff watered down the red dust.Nothing could extinguish Nadal’s fire though and he surged two breaks ahead in the third set despite the best efforts of Wawrinka to try and extend the contest.(Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Davis)"
73,BUSINESS,Caffeine Is A Silent Performance Killer,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/caffeine-is-a-silent-performance-killer_us_5939aa6de4b014ae8c69debd,This tip for improving your performance is the most simple and straightforward method I’ve provided thus far. For many people,2017-06-11,<p>Need we say more? Discover how caffeine toys with your emotions and get the motivation you need to finally kick the habit.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5939aec42200001400c6d0dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This tip for improving your performance is the most simple and straightforward method I’ve provided thus far. For many people, this tip has the potential to have a bigger impact than any other single action. The catch? You have to cut down on caffeine, and as any caffeine drinker can attest, this is easier said than done.For those who aren’t aware, the ability to manage your emotions and remain calm under pressure has a direct link to your performance. TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we’ve found that 90 percent of top performers are high in emotional intelligence. These individuals are skilled at managing their emotions (even in times of high stress) in order to remain calm and in control.The Good: Isn’t Really Good Most people start drinking caffeine because it makes them feel more alert and improves their mood. Many studies suggest that caffeine actually improves cognitive task performance (memory, attention span, etc.) in the short-term. Unfortunately, these studies fail to consider the participants’ caffeine habits. New research from Johns Hopkins Medical School shows that performance increases due to caffeine intake are the result of caffeine drinkers experiencing a short-term reversal of caffeine withdrawal. By controlling for caffeine use in study participants, John Hopkins researchers found that caffeine-related performance improvement is nonexistent without caffeine withdrawal. In essence, coming off caffeine reduces your cognitive performance and has a negative impact on your mood. The only way to get back to normal is to drink caffeine, and when you do drink it, you feel like it’s taking you to new heights. In reality, the caffeine is just taking your performance back to normal for a short period.The Bad: AdrenalineDrinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source of the “fight or flight” response, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you’re responding to a curt email. When caffeine puts your brain and body into this hyper-aroused state, your emotions overrun your behavior.Irritability and anxiety are the most commonly seen emotional effects of caffeine, but caffeine enables all of your emotions to take charge.The negative effects of a caffeine-generated adrenaline surge are not just behavioral. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that large doses of caffeine raise blood pressure, stimulate the heart, and produce rapid shallow breathing, which readers of Emotional Intelligence 2.0 know deprives the brain of the oxygen needed to keep your thinking calm and rational.The Ugly: SleepWhen you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day’s memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, focus, memory, and information processing speed are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep. Your brain is very fickle when it comes to sleep. For you to wake up feeling rested, your brain needs to move through an elaborate series of cycles. You can help this process along and improve the quality of your sleep by reducing your caffeine intake.Here’s why you’ll want to: caffeine has a six-hour half-life, which means it takes a full twenty-four hours to work its way out of your system. Have a cup of joe at eight a.m., and you’ll still have 25 percent of the caffeine in your body at eight p.m. Anything you drink after noon will still be at 50 percent strength at bedtime. Any caffeine in your bloodstream—with the negative effects increasing with the dose—makes it harder to fall asleep.When you do finally fall asleep, the worst is yet to come. Caffeine disrupts the quality of your sleep by reducing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the deep sleep when your body recuperates and processes emotions. When caffeine disrupts your sleep, you wake up the next day with an emotional handicap. You’re naturally going to be inclined to grab a cup of coffee or an energy drink to try to make yourself feel better. The caffeine produces surges of adrenaline, which further your emotional handicap. Caffeine and lack of sleep leave you feeling tired in the afternoon, so you drink more caffeine, which leaves even more of it in your bloodstream at bedtime. Caffeine very quickly creates a vicious cycle.WithdrawalLike any stimulant, caffeine is physiologically and psychologically addictive. If you do choose to lower your caffeine intake, you should do so slowly under the guidance of a qualified medical professional. The researchers at Johns Hopkins found that caffeine withdrawal causes headache, fatigue, sleepiness, and difficulty concentrating. Some people report feeling flu-like symptoms, depression, and anxiety after reducing intake by as little as one cup a day. Slowly tapering your caffeine dosage each day can greatly reduce these withdrawal symptoms.Want to learn more? Consider TalentSmart’s emotional intelligence certification program."

They were both working in a lab developing the nascent field of computerized mapping, now better known as geographic information systems.Their revelation was that good data, clearly presented ― in their case, with maps ― could help people better understand the world and make decisions without all the ruckus roiling their campus and nation.“We didn’t want to be political. We didn’t want to go to the right or to the left,” Jack Dangermond recently told HuffPost. “We wanted to go forward with science and try to make all these institutions who are our customers better by driving with quantitative methods and science.”He didn’t realize at the time how valuable their idea would be. But these days, the vast majority of the country’s 1,000 largest businesses use the software that the Dangermonds’ company, Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri), creates. Numerous state, local and federal government agencies also use the software, and the company reaps revenues north of $1 billion a year. Businesses use Esri’s programs to figure out where their customers are and what they want. If Starbucks, Walmart or Target opens a new store, it’s because the data and maps have suggested where it has the best chance to succeed. Governments use the maps for everything from improving policing and disaster response to planning new schools, roads and untold numbers of other services.“I like to call my work the science of ‘where,’” Dangermond said.Much of the data his approximately 100,000 U.S. customers use comes from the Census Bureau ― the largest, most important source of the raw information that businesses and governments need to function.“The world today is all about analytics, and the Census Bureau provides systematic and science-based information about the demographic profile of Americans,” Dangermond said. “Census data is in many ways the lifeblood of these kinds of organizations.”That’s not an exaggeration ― and it’s why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce spends a lot of time trying to persuade Congress and the White House to keep the bureau and its data production well-funded.“Policymakers need the information arising from these federal activities to formulate sound policy,” said J.D. Foster, the Chamber’s chief economist. “Many Chamber members use this information more directly in their own business planning as they attempt to identify trends in consumer behavior and preferences, resulting in better business decisions and ultimately a stronger overall economy.”Indeed, the businesses that use this government data generate up to $220 billion a year in economic activity, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce study.But Congress and the White House don’t seem to share the same high estimation of the Census Bureau, judging by the money they are willing to spend as it gears up for two of the most challenging statistical counts on the planet ― the constitutionally mandated 2020 enumeration of every person in America, and the 2017 Economic Census. The Economic Census surveys the nation’s businesses every five years, and underpins all the government’s reports on things like unemployment and the gross domestic product.Historically, when the bureau is preparing for the decennial census and starting the Economic Census, it gets a dramatic funding boost to address the enormous tasks. From 2007 to 2008, Congress increased the agency’s budget by nearly $500 million to cover prep work that year alone.Nothing of that sort is happening this year, and the agency’s funding was already lower than its estimated need. The outgoing Obama administration had recommended a 2017 allocation of $1.63 billion. But Congress never got around to passing a regular budget for this year, instead pushing through a string of stopgap bills that gave the Census Bureau $1.47 billion ― a shortfall of about $160 million. The Trump administration’s proposed 2018 budget would only barely boost it, to $1.5 billion.The stakes for the Census are especially high this time around. Counting every person in a country with a population of more than 300 million is difficult and expensive; the 2010 count cost about $12.3 billion over several years, or about $92 per housing unit. That was about 30 percent more than it cost in 2000. Part of the escalating cost is simple arithmetic ― the population had grown by 27 million people over that period.But another factor is the declining percentage of Americans who respond to the Census by mail, forcing the bureau to open offices around the country and hire tens of thousands of people to go out and get that data by going door to door. According to the Government Accountability Office, that follow-up to non-responses is the agency’s largest, most costly field operation.A failed attempt at using new, hand-held devices to automate more of the work also complicated the 2010 Census. When the costly machines didn’t function properly during tests, the bureau had to abandon them.Based on a population that is now over 325 million ― and seems to be even more distrustful of the government ― doing the 2020 Census the same way it was done in 2010 would cost about $17 billion, according to the GAO. But Congress, angered by the failures of last time, mandated that the bureau figure out ways to save enough money to carry out the 2020 Census for the same $12.3 billion it cost a decade ago. The bureau crafted a plan that it estimates will save $5 billion through new counting methods that include using smartphones, gathering internet and phone responses, and mining existing government records to fill out its tabulations. Every one of those new methods, though, is supposed to be developed through scientific consultation and thorough, peer-reviewed testing. That requires more spending from Congress on the front end, not less.That process is not going well. The GAO had already labeled the 2020 Census as “high risk,” noting that the bureau was treading into a lot of new territory that it was not especially well-equipped to handle, especially on the technological front. At a hearing on Capitol Hill in May, Census Bureau Director John Thompson admitted he was already facing cost overruns of about $400 million in building the new Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing system, known as CEDCaP. He also acknowledged that the bureau has canceled or delayed various test runs of new methods because it doesn’t have the money to do them. It has likewise abandoned planned advertising efforts that were supposed to support comprehensive dry runs of the new methods next year.Thompson tried to put a brave face on it, and even praised President Donald Trump’s historically skimpy budget request. “We’re glad we’re a priority in the president’s budget,” Thompson told an appropriations subcommittee. “We’re very, very happy about that.”In a sign that he was not actually very happy, however, Thompson followed up his testimony by abruptly handing in his resignation just five days later. He said he did so in order to give the Trump administration plenty of time to find a replacement, although he had been expected to stay on for the rest of the year to oversee the critical planning stages of the Census. As of June 30, the bureau will have no director. There isn’t a deputy director in line to replace Thompson, because that person left in January. There isn’t even a political appointee in place who is directly responsible for overseeing the bureau at its parent agency, the Department of Commerce.Even before the sudden leadership vacuum, Dave Powner, the GAO’s head of IT management oversight, saw trouble looming.“Historically, if you look at the previous decennials, there’s been a lot of money thrown at this late to bail out late starts and mismanagement and other things,” Powner said at the same hearing where Thompson spoke. “And I think you’re potentially heading down that path again.”At a June 8 Senate hearing on the Commerce Department’s budget, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross ― a billionaire who was once a Census enumerator ― fielded complaints about the cost overrun, and said the department and Trump’s Office of Management and Budget were undertaking a “crash review of what has been going on.” None of the senators asked about the flatlined budget.There are historical examples of what happens when the Census Bureau collects bad or incomplete data. In 1930, after the stock market crash, the estimates of unemployed Americans were so far off that Congress had to order a second unemployment count the following year. The recount finally revealed how severely the Great Depression was biting into America, and allowed policymakers to stop guessing about the effects and actually deal with them.When both the outgoing George W. Bush administration and the incoming administration of Barack Obama were trying to assess the severity of the Great Recession in 2008, they faced a similar data failure. Employment data was vastly better than in the ’30s, but there was a lack of statistics on key parts of the economy, especially the service sectors.As Obama’s transition team met in Chicago to start the job of putting together policy responses, the plummeting stock market and escalating job losses had them plenty frightened.But the gross domestic product ― the big economic indicator that says whether the country’s economy is growing or contracting ― proved to be way off, telling them the recession was not nearly as deep as it turned out to be. The most recent data available, when economists Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein began working on a rescue package, suggested the economy had shrunk by about 0.5 percent in the third quarter of 2008. Initial estimates for the fourth quarter found the recession accelerating, with a 3.8 percent drop at the end of the year.Later accounts of those frantic days revealed that Romer ― based on those numbers ― thought it would take a $1.8 trillion stimulus package to make up the shortfall in the economy. She, Bernstein, and the rest of the Obama transition team didn’t think Congress would be willing to pass such a large package, however. The plan they settled on was for less than half that amount, and Congress ultimately passed a package for $787 billion.When the economic data was finally fully tallied, the economy had actually shrunk 3.7 percent in the third quarter of 2008 ― not the 0.5 percent the Bureau of Economic Analysis initially estimated. And the final data for the fourth quarter showed one of the worst quarterly collapses in U.S. history ― down 8.9 percent.There’s debate about why such economic estimates were so wrong, but one acknowledged problem is that follow-up surveys were not done frequently enough. There were no quarterly updates measuring the sectors hit hardest by the housing collapse in 2007 and 2008 ― the finance and insurance sectors ― leaving the bureau to extrapolate from private data sources that are simply not as good. And the reason there were no quarterly updates for those sectors is because Congress had not funded them, despite repeated requests from multiple administrations.Scott Hoyt, a senior director with Moody’s Analytics, said the government still collects data as if manufacturing were as important as it was 40 years ago, rather than putting the emphasis on services.“We need much better understanding of the service side of the economy, and we’re only just getting there,” he said.That flaw in the data left Congress and two White House teams blind to the full extent of the financial crisis. In retrospect, Bernstein says the Obama economic team probably couldn’t have pushed for more stimulus, even if they’d had a more accurate picture, because Congress would not have agreed to it regardless of what the data said. “It’s a little bit of a heavy lift to say if only these foresightful legislators had better data, they’d have made better choices,” he said.At the very least, though, with better information, his team would not have predicted ― as they did on Jan. 9, 2009 ― that passing the stimulus package would keep unemployment under 8 percent. (It eventually hit 10 percent.)“If we had known things were going to be as bad as they were, of course we wouldn’t have made rosy predictions,” Bernstein told HuffPost.Perhaps a more important effect of the inaccurate data, he added, was that it convinced policymakers to ease off on the stimulus too soon. By late 2009, when some Democrats on Capitol Hill were pushing for more stimulus spending, the White House criticized such efforts and shifted its focus to austerity plans and ways to trim mounting debt. “Where I think we ran into trouble was in seeing green shoots that weren’t really there,” Bernstein said. “But that’s an example of confirmation bias and wanting ― there were people in the administration who really wanted to pivot to deficit reduction, and that’s what happened.”Congress did eventually come up with $8 million to fund the more robust collection of data that could have helped economists understand the recession sooner, although Congress did not fund analysis and publication of that data until Obama’s second term. The underfunded stimulus isn’t just of interest to economists and historians. It’s a cautionary tale as Congress and the White House are on course to underfund the Census Bureau as it launches its two most important undertakings.“The problem is that if you cut funding, if the data gets worse, then you’re going to have more of those types of situations, or they could be worse,” said Hoyt. “Our understanding of the economy could be further from what we later recognize to be the truth.”Of course, the decennial Census covers much broader ground than the economy. It is the basis for creating political districts to make sure Americans are represented evenly; it is the foundation for demographic research in America, and for dozens of other government surveys; and it is key to distributing up to $700 billion from the federal government, according to new estimates from George Washington University’s Institute of Public Policy. The pervasive impact of Census data explains why the bureau spends years trying to develop and test new counting methods ― and why it’s so troubling to observers that funding is not flowing to meet the demands.“It’s not looking great. I think it’s all correctable, but the money should be coming at a much higher rate than it is,” said Andrew Reamer, a research professor at GWU. “They’re really doing the biggest reinvention of the Census in decades, and they’re being nickel-and-dimed on the process.”Jack and Laura Dangermond hoped to transcend politics with facts when they launched Esri nearly 50 years ago. If their business’ dominance is any indication, they were successful.But in 2017, facts have become political. Trump regularly denigrates basic, verifiable facts, such as unemployment statistics, as phony ― unless he happens to like them. He invents crowd sizes. One of his top advisers infamously defended that invention as an “alternative fact.”Therein lies yet another danger of a poorly done Census. If people are already prone to disbelieve data based on their politics, what happens when the actual data is not all that accurate? “An inadequate Census is a good friend of alternative facts,” said Bernstein, who now works with the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.A colleague of his and Census expert, CBPP senior fellow Arloc Sherman, put it more bluntly: “Without a solid Census, all facts become alt facts.” "

There isn’t even a political appointee in place who is directly responsible for overseeing the bureau at its parent agency, the Department of Commerce.Even before the sudden leadership vacuum, Dave Powner, the GAO’s head of IT management oversight, saw trouble looming.“Historically, if you look at the previous decennials, there’s been a lot of money thrown at this late to bail out late starts and mismanagement and other things,” Powner said at the same hearing where Thompson spoke. “And I think you’re potentially heading down that path again.”At a June 8 Senate hearing on the Commerce Department’s budget, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross ― a billionaire who was once a Census enumerator ― fielded complaints about the cost overrun, and said the department and Trump’s Office of Management and Budget were undertaking a “crash review of what has been going on.” None of the senators asked about the flatlined budget.There are historical examples of what happens when the Census Bureau collects bad or incomplete data. In 1930, after the stock market crash, the estimates of unemployed Americans were so far off that Congress had to order a second unemployment count the following year. The recount finally revealed how severely the Great Depression was biting into America, and allowed policymakers to stop guessing about the effects and actually deal with them.When both the outgoing George W. Bush administration and the incoming administration of Barack Obama were trying to assess the severity of the Great Recession in 2008, they faced a similar data failure. Employment data was vastly better than in the ’30s, but there was a lack of statistics on key parts of the economy, especially the service sectors.As Obama’s transition team met in Chicago to start the job of putting together policy responses, the plummeting stock market and escalating job losses had them plenty frightened.But the gross domestic product ― the big economic indicator that says whether the country’s economy is growing or contracting ― proved to be way off, telling them the recession was not nearly as deep as it turned out to be. The most recent data available, when economists Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein began working on a rescue package, suggested the economy had shrunk by about 0.5 percent in the third quarter of 2008. Initial estimates for the fourth quarter found the recession accelerating, with a 3.8 percent drop at the end of the year.Later accounts of those frantic days revealed that Romer ― based on those numbers ― thought it would take a $1.8 trillion stimulus package to make up the shortfall in the economy. She, Bernstein, and the rest of the Obama transition team didn’t think Congress would be willing to pass such a large package, however. The plan they settled on was for less than half that amount, and Congress ultimately passed a package for $787 billion.When the economic data was finally fully tallied, the economy had actually shrunk 3.7 percent in the third quarter of 2008 ― not the 0.5 percent the Bureau of Economic Analysis initially estimated. And the final data for the fourth quarter showed one of the worst quarterly collapses in U.S. history ― down 8.9 percent.There’s debate about why such economic estimates were so wrong, but one acknowledged problem is that follow-up surveys were not done frequently enough. There were no quarterly updates measuring the sectors hit hardest by the housing collapse in 2007 and 2008 ― the finance and insurance sectors ― leaving the bureau to extrapolate from private data sources that are simply not as good. And the reason there were no quarterly updates for those sectors is because Congress had not funded them, despite repeated requests from multiple administrations.Scott Hoyt, a senior director with Moody’s Analytics, said the government still collects data as if manufacturing were as important as it was 40 years ago, rather than putting the emphasis on services.“We need much better understanding of the service side of the economy, and we’re only just getting there,” he said.That flaw in the data left Congress and two White House teams blind to the full extent of the financial crisis. In retrospect, Bernstein says the Obama economic team probably couldn’t have pushed for more stimulus, even if they’d had a more accurate picture, because Congress would not have agreed to it regardless of what the data said. “It’s a little bit of a heavy lift to say if only these foresightful legislators had better data, they’d have made better choices,” he said.At the very least, though, with better information, his team would not have predicted ― as they did on Jan. 9, 2009 ― that passing the stimulus package would keep unemployment under 8 percent. (It eventually hit 10 percent.)“If we had known things were going to be as bad as they were, of course we wouldn’t have made rosy predictions,” Bernstein told HuffPost.Perhaps a more important effect of the inaccurate data, he added, was that it convinced policymakers to ease off on the stimulus too soon. By late 2009, when some Democrats on Capitol Hill were pushing for more stimulus spending, the White House criticized such efforts and shifted its focus to austerity plans and ways to trim mounting debt. “Where I think we ran into trouble was in seeing green shoots that weren’t really there,” Bernstein said. “But that’s an example of confirmation bias and wanting ― there were people in the administration who really wanted to pivot to deficit reduction, and that’s what happened.”Congress did eventually come up with $8 million to fund the more robust collection of data that could have helped economists understand the recession sooner, although Congress did not fund analysis and publication of that data until Obama’s second term. The underfunded stimulus isn’t just of interest to economists and historians. It’s a cautionary tale as Congress and the White House are on course to underfund the Census Bureau as it launches its two most important undertakings.“The problem is that if you cut funding, if the data gets worse, then you’re going to have more of those types of situations, or they could be worse,” said Hoyt. “Our understanding of the economy could be further from what we later recognize to be the truth.”Of course, the decennial Census covers much broader ground than the economy. It is the basis for creating political districts to make sure Americans are represented evenly; it is the foundation for demographic research in America, and for dozens of other government surveys; and it is key to distributing up to $700 billion from the federal government, according to new estimates from George Washington University’s Institute of Public Policy. The pervasive impact of Census data explains why the bureau spends years trying to develop and test new counting methods ― and why it’s so troubling to observers that funding is not flowing to meet the demands.“It’s not looking great. I think it’s all correctable, but the money should be coming at a much higher rate than it is,” said Andrew Reamer, a research professor at GWU. “They’re really doing the biggest reinvention of the Census in decades, and they’re being nickel-and-dimed on the process.”Jack and Laura Dangermond hoped to transcend politics with facts when they launched Esri nearly 50 years ago. If their business’ dominance is any indication, they were successful.But in 2017, facts have become political. Trump regularly denigrates basic, verifiable facts, such as unemployment statistics, as phony ― unless he happens to like them. He invents crowd sizes. One of his top advisers infamously defended that invention as an “alternative fact.”Therein lies yet another danger of a poorly done Census. If people are already prone to disbelieve data based on their politics, what happens when the actual data is not all that accurate? “An inadequate Census is a good friend of alternative facts,” said Bernstein, who now works with the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.A colleague of his and Census expert, CBPP senior fellow Arloc Sherman, put it more bluntly: “Without a solid Census, all facts become alt facts.” "

I haven’t decided for sure yet.”“People here, folks like Our Revolution ... are really encouraging me,” he said, referring to a group formed to push Sanders’ agenda. “And they said we’ll support you if you step into it again,” he added.In the meantime, Quist has plans to start a progressive foundation called the Solution Room, and make a documentary about his experience running for office.Republican Greg Gianforte defeated Quist by about 6 percentage points in the May 25 special election to fill the seat Republican Ryan Zinke gave up to become President Donald Trump’s Interior Department secretary. Quist’s showing was respectable in a state Donald Trump won by 20 points over Hilary Clinton last November and where Zinke won re-election in that same vote by about 16 points. Still, Quist’s loss was a disappointment for Democrats in general ― and Sanders supporters in particular ― who saw an opportunity to not only land a blow against Trump, but elect an unabashed liberal. Quist, a supporter of single-payer health insurance and marijuana legalization, was an early backer of Sanders’ presidential run.That Gianforte assaulted a reporter asking about his position on the House GOP health care bill the day before the election made the loss that much tougher for Quist backers. (Gianforte has since apologized and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge.) Although Quist raised more than $6 million ― mostly through small individual donations ― during the the campaign’s relatively short course, some progressives criticized the national Democratic Party for allowing him to be pilloried by outside conservative groups in March and most of April without institutional backing of his own. Spending by outside groups for Gianforte was about 9 times the amount of comparable funding for Quist, according to a Roll Call analysis of official data.The national Republican Party focused on depicting Quist ― a newcomer to politics ― as a deadbeat, spotlighting taxes he had failed to pay on time. (Quist argued it was an error that reflects his status as an ordinary middle-class American with financial struggles.)With a chuckle, Quist said, “That’s probably true,” when asked about criticism of the national Democratic Party for not committing to his race earlier and more aggressively.“I really feel that I’ve tried to live a pretty good life,” he said. While saying he had performed “years of community service,” was his high school’s student body president and an Eagle Scout, he added that “none of that really made it to the papers.”“Every time in the local papers, it was always repeating the negative narratives,” he said. “But I understand that the first time you run for office you kind of have to go through a lot of the vetting process.”The Free Beacon, a conservative news site based in Washington that concentrated its stories on Quist’s financial problems, is a particular whipping horse for him.“I call it the ‘freakin’ beacon’!” he joked.At the People’s Summit, Quist participated in a panel about “transforming the Democratic Party,” and he lingered to engage with some of those who helped fund his campaign. Quist fans repeatedly interrupted the HuffPost interview to shake his hand and offer words of support.For Quist, it was just what he needed after his bruising first brush with electoral politics.“I come from a family of basketball players and we don’t take losing lightly,” he said. “This has been such a great healing thing to come to this and to meet with a lot of people that really supported me from all over the country.”"

It was an odor particular to the carnival that she would never forget.The word carnival has two meanings. First, according to Webster:A period of public revelry each year that takes place before Lent; and second, A traveling amusement show.Circus folks, whom I have interviewed extensively, are quick to point out the differences between them and carnival folk or more derogatory “carneys.” The circus, burlesque, and other forms of early American pop culture have been the target of my work over the past decade. After meeting someone who essentially grew up on the carnival grounds I thought I should take a look at the life of the showgirls in the carnival. Many of my burlesque ladies had certainly worked the carnival circuit including stars Sally Rand and Gypsy Rose Lee, making gobs of money with their Royal American Girlie Shows. According to Sally Rand’s son Sean, it was Gypsy who encouraged his mother to join the grueling schedule of upwards of 30 shows a day for thousands across America.But before we get into that let’s examine carnival.The carnivals were ― and are ― loaded with games of chance, heavily favored on the side of the concessionaires who run, and lure and can cheat the carnival rubes out of hard earned quarters (at least back when a quarter meant something). There was of course the side show with real and bogus “Freaks” and death-defying rides. With its geneses in the Chicago Columbian Exposition of 1893 the carnival would become known as a raucous, popcorn smelling afternoon where one tried to hang on to their wallets walking the midway. Staring in the mid-1920s most carnivals set up in a field or wherever they could for several days and took in thousands in attendance. Folks were bug-eyed over scandalously skimpy-dressed beauties and freaks of nature. Staged shows under the tens included many of the biggest vaudeville acts of the early 20th century. The freak show, which included animals as well, employed many with abnormal physicality, such as Daisy and Violet Hilton, the subject of my documentary “Bound By Flesh.” The Siamese bound sisters were stars on both the vaudeville stage and carnival and circus circuits.Like in the circus, many who felt they didn’t belong in the “real world” ran away and joined a carnival, sometimes for the first time in their lives finding a home and communion with like people. Oddities, outcasts, disenfranchised. There was every sort from the obvious runaways, drug addicts, perverts, women who had escaped abusive relationships. There were families, perverts. “A lot of temporary and seedy characters.” Everyone was escaping life back home, whether it was too ordinary for them or too troubled. All found a place where they belonged even if just for a season under the canvas amongst others who asked no questions. They were birds of a feather.When she was about 12 years-old, brown-haired Christy escaped a “mean, drunk little guy” whom her mother had married. “He was beating on my mother,” she recalled, “so I kicked the shit out of him.” Standing 5’8” and weighing between 160 and 170 lbs, her stepfather who stood 5’2” was no match.Life had been anything but idyllic for Christy in a tiny navy town outside of Seattle, Washington, in the 1950s.With a beautiful mother who worked various small jobs while raising four kids and an alcoholic stepfather she hated, Christy and her brother Chuckie tried staying out of the way of this pint-sized wife and child beater. Tragedy struck during the summer of Christy’s 8th year of hell on earth. Nine-year-old Chuckie and his best friend Jeff had been goofing around and got hold of a gun which went off in Chuckie’s hand, killing Jeff. It was particularly memorable for Christy, as Jeff had been her first sexual encounter. Yes, at age 8.Ralph, a family friend, owned a carnival. With the promise that she could work there someday, Christy took to hanging around Ralph and his carney friends. Hanging around the sawdust lots and learning to “buy” a 25-cent soda from a machine for three pennies after shaving the edges to make them the size of dimes she found “sanctuary” from her home life.Meanwhile, the abuse from her stepfather continued. When he wasn’t drunk, he was regularly beating on his wife and terrorizing the kids.Running into a travel carnival that pulled into town, Christy begged her mother to let her join. She worked there the entire week the carnival was in town. Soon things went bad at home. “My mom and I decided I shouldn’t be around during the summer.” She turned to Ralph who let her join his operation at age 11 or 12.She joined the tradition of the roaming life, traveling from town to town, pulling into large lots and anywhere the midway rides could be set. This was in the 1960s when someone her size was not only an oddity but worthy of making a living in the sideshow. By this time in history, the “born freaks” were fewer and far between in the Freak Shows. Still, for a quarter or two one could see two-headed cows, or two-headed chickens. One fake act was the “man eating chicken” who sat and ate a piece of chicken out of the KFC bucket on his lap. Jokes too.Christy’s size had never bothered her. Everyone in her family was pretty heavy, but Christy was the most eye-catching. She knew people made fun of her. But on the carnival her size brought her a different kind of attention. It was positive and accepting. She would make a successful career both on the midway and on the burlesque stage because of her generous frame and her zest for entertaining.Christy kept up with her schooling, but started a month late and left a month early until she graduated. By then so in love with her “other life,” she skipped the graduation parties and flew straight to Portland, Oregon, to work a festival and “traveled the rest of [her] life.”She worked various jobs on the midway; selling tickets, serving food, cooking and counting quarters and rolling them in sleeves. “I loved making money!”During breaks she rode all the rides, especially thrilling at the Sky Wheel where she could soar above her troubles below. The fun houses with their distorted mirrors was a particular favorite. She learned how the games were rigged. “I was around,” she said, “during the days of big money... and games you could never win.” Though some shows were “Sunday school shows” (meaning honest run) other shows took the rubes for everything which was done by paying off cops and never returning to the town once they pulled up stakes.“Everyone made money.”Like in the circus, her coworkers were transients. Christy recalled one group of Gypsies from Turkey pickpocketing “marks” on the midway by reading their mannerisms, their clothing, their walk, and even their particular body odors. When not on the midway the Gypsies could be found in the town’s department stores shoplifting (with the help of Christy being the distraction. She would pretend to faint, pulling down a large display case with expensive goods on the way to hitting the ground). So crafty were the Gypsies, sewing inner pockets and such Christy was witness to one girl who carried a television set between her thighs as she coolly walked out the store. It would take a few more heists before Christy’s conscious got the better of her and she quit the extra gig (and the $100 that came with it).However, her training among the Gypsies educated her in how to read the marks on the midway and she was hired to be what was called an “agent.” An agent leads a customer to a particular game he or she seemed best suited too. They then encourage the mark to spend, spend, spend.Jamming the midway were kiosks or individual booths. They were plentiful and varied. There were psychic readings of palm and crystal balls, “knife sharpening, religious displays, impromptu artistry, beaded costume jewelry, dancing, magic and of course in the back there was prostitution, drugs and alcohol.”Ralph essentially mentored Christy. His carnival traveled by truck. Sometimes his smaller carnival (only 12 midway rides) would merge with other carnivals for larger towns and crowds.Christy met legendary fan dancer Sally Rand who was touring with the prestigious Royal American Shows. The Royal American claimed to be the world’s largest touring midway. Nearly a hundred train cars pulled performers, rides, and the president of RAS and his family. Part of the benefit of train travel ― besides rest for the performers and crew ― was that rides and amusement arrived wholly put together. Their record of unloading from the trains to set up an operation was a fast and furious five hours. Besides Sally Rand, Lois De Fee and Gypsy, Elvis’ manager Colonel Tom Parker began his show business career working for Royal American.Christy’s job was to patrol the parameter of Rand’s tent to prevent anyone from trying to bypass the front and take a free peek. Christy didn’t consider it work. She thought of it more like fun.It was at the carnival where Christy got her first look at a girlie show. Run by a dark-haired gal with big boobs who spoke in a little girly voice, she went by the name of Delilah Dante. Delilah ran her own girlie show.It was a grueling life for the burly girls. When I interviewed Dixie Evans (a.k.a the “Marilyn Monroe of Burlesque”) she talked about loving the carnival and circus route working 30 shows a day and being so tired at the end that all she wanted as she passed out on the ride home was to eat Chinese and count her big, fat bankroll.Delilah’s show was in a large tent with “plank seating” to accommodate 80 likely horny men. Sometimes more could be squeezed in. It was a 10-minute show that ran 25 times a night. To make the men buy tickets and convince them of the dozens of beauties they would see inside the tent, Delilah would have Christy and anyone else on the midway dress up in elaborate headdresses and stand in half shadows on the stage, where the men could peek through the front flaps and see shadowy figures moving about. After the men paid their quarter, the only eyeful they got was Delilah. But it was with Delilah’s feather boas and running across the sage that Christy felt sexy. She decided she would become a dancer.Among the various types of misfits running around the midway, Christy noted that the diversity of character created strong bonds. Even with occasionally deep psychological ― sometimes physical ― challenges, they found refuge. Birds of a feather. And, Christy noted after hours, “bed hopping was rampant.” No matter whether it was men with men, women with women or some mix of group sex, it was family. A very close family.Not only was sex among the carneys a regular occurrence, but they were also targets for the local “lizards.” Lizards could be any man, woman, or teenager who hung around the lot looking for an easy target. A quick, no-hassle one night stand would ensue. There would be no drama as there was always another town calling the carnival away. No bonds, no attachments.At the end of the season, Christy would take her money and fill coffee cans with the cash, hiding it in her room. When her mother discovered one of the cans, she worried over what type of work Christy was doing to rake in such dough. Over the years, Christy worked the carnival her siblings (she had two half-sisters) and mother also worked, though none of them loved it like she did. Christy was happy as a clam and wanted to soak up everything she could learn about working at the carnival.Back home, she waded through school and roamed the seedier streets of Seattle, where at 16, she learned to master a sexy street swagger from a prostitute named Tanya. She became friends with Tanya. Tanya thought Christy had what it took to be a hooker and suggested the market would be profitable for a fat girl. Tanya was right. She was a hit and had no competition. She was “so big I was like a billboard on heels.” Her size didn’t make her lack confidence. She knew she was alluring.Venturing to Hollywood, she had a memorable encounter with Hollywood’s Stanley Kowalski. A man asking for her particular services showed up wearing a floppy hat (obviously to disguise himself) clutching a brown paper bag in his hands. “Nice to meet ya,” he said. Reaching into his bag he pulled out women’s lingerie and a stack of cash. Fannie disappeared to make espresso and when she returned, the world’s greatest actor was nude. As he pulled on a pair of stockings, she told him, “honey you are so sexy.” Turning on a Marvin Gaye tune, she gave him a wig and makeup which she helped apply to his gorgeous face. Thinking he wanted to see himself she held out a hand mirror, but he brushed it aside. Silence followed as he sashayed around her room in heels and lingerie drinking espresso in a “feminine” sort of way. They had no conversation and when he was satisfied with whatever he was exploring he pulled his clothes over the bra and panties kissed Fannie’s hand and left. His latest film “Last Tango in Paris” had been playing and Fannie “figured he was just going through a phase.”By the time she was 18, she stood 6’2” and weighed 240 pounds. She decided to change her name to Fannie Annie. She got a job working a girlie show. She loved it, especially the pretty clothes. To her, it was ironic that offstage she deflected looks of “disgust,” but onstage the little fat girl ― all grown up ― was adored and accepted. With the help of the Mob and a breast enhancement she became known as “the world’s fattest stripper.”As Fannie she commanded the stage, she’d hurl insults at customers in the clubs who were “overjoyed” with her “fatness.” She pushed men’s faces into her heaving bosoms. “My size overwhelmed.” It was as if none of them had seen a fat boob before, so she pulled them out of her costume. “The crowd went nuts as they threw money” on the stage. As a finale, Christy would push the man on the floor, lift her skirt, and lower herself onto his face.The work was nonstop and so was her ballooning size. Soon, she was 400 pounds with an 88-inch waist line. She broke chairs and “fell on [her] ass more times” than she cared to recall. She continued to tour clubs and returned to her first love, carnivals. “It was where I really wanted to be.” One of her signature tricks was to invite a bachelor to the stage where not only did she smother his head between her breasts and “tit slap him,” but also pull his pants and underwear down for a parade around the stage.By the 1980s, a 600-pound Fannie would own her own kiddy carnival with ponies and a petting zoo. She was still getting little respect in the real world because of her size. I asked her if she ever wanted to change her weight and she told me no. “I just accepted it and lived my life and took advantage of being super sized and made a living out of it.”And though she enjoyed a long career in the clubs, it was the carnivals she loved for the travel and the money and the camaraderie. (She didn’t as much care for the hot tents and trailers or the lack of restrooms). Little fat Christy had grown into a star. “I really loved all the life lessons. All the carnival and circus people really made me feel like family!

82,POLITICS,Trump Says Qatar Funds Terror. Here's His Record Of Trying To Get It To Fund Him.,"Clayton Swisher, HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-says-qatar-funds-terror-heres-his-record-of-trying-to-get-it-to-fund-him_us_593d6691e4b0c5a35ca06118,"The president is allying himself with those blockading the tiny country, but he's made attempts to secure Qatari investments in the past.",2017-06-11,"Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani meets with U.S. President Donald Trump in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 21, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593d67771d00004600cc24c7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner all repeatedly sought financing for various investments in recent years from leading figures in Qatar, according to sources with direct knowledge of the meetings.Those previously unreported overtures have taken on new relevance as a diplomatic crisis aggravated by President Trump has left the small Gulf nation blockaded and isolated by its rivals, with tensions in the Middle East reaching historic highs.President Trump on Friday characterized Qatar as “historically” a “funder of terrorism at a high level,” an accusation that came just an hour after his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appealed for “no further escalation” in the Gulf Cooperation Council squabble, urging dialogue to quickly resolve the crisis, which pits Qatar against Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE, and Bahrain. Tillerson noted the Qatari emir “made progress in halting financial support and expelling terrorist elements from his country,” comments echoed by the U.S. ambassador to Qatar, Dana Smith, who tweeted “Qatar is a strong partner in combating terrorist financing.” That partnership is not merely rhetorical. Qatar is home to Al-Udeid air base, the regional Central Command headquarters from which American bombers depart on daily missions against ISIS and al Qaeda. Reacting to the GCC dispute, the Defense Department praised Qatar’s commitment to fighting ISIS as its secretary, James Mattis, expressed his confidence that the turmoil would not interrupt Qatar’s contribution to those efforts. Given the weave of interests and close cooperation between the U.S. and Qatar, many are seeking ways to interpret Trump’s abrupt turn against Qatar in the dispute. Some think the answer lies not in the realm of policy but in the history of Trump’s business deals with the various actors in the dispute.The Trump Organization (now under the stewardship of son Donald Jr.) is reportedly in talks with Emirati tycoons to receive several billion dollars of investment in addition to owning two golf courses in Dubai. The New York Times reports that Trump has previously had as many as eight business entities registered in Jeddah alone. In 2015, Trump spoke about his admiration for the Saudis and attributed it to his business dealings with them:Saudi Arabia — and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.Therein lies the source of much consternation among Qataris. Several people interviewed for this piece expressed concern that Trump’s bias against their country might stem from a series of failed business overtures that he (along with his son-in-law Jared Kushner) made seven years ago, which are only now being reported. They did not go as swimmingly as the deals made with the Saudis and Emiratis.In 2010, as markets were still reeling from the 2008 global economic crisis, Qatar was flush with cash and countless business executives and foreign governments came calling. Some came to get liquidity; others searching for silver linings amidst the global chaos. Trump was in the latter category, then as CEO of the Trump Organization but also as host and star of the hit domestic American reality TV show, “The Apprentice.”Traveling with his daughter Ivanka, Trump visited Doha in 2010 for separate meetings with Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) executive board member Dr. Hussain Al-Abdullah and as well as Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani (commonly abbreviated as “HBJ”), who was then serving as foreign minister and prime minister. Neither responded to requests for comment on this article. At the time, the pair constituted the brain trust of Qatar’s financial and investment sector. QIA is the world’s second largest sovereign wealth fund (presently estimated at having $338 billion in assets under management). Then as now, Sheikh HBJ had renown for being kingmaker of not just political deals but financial ones too. Using his business and political savvy, he has sealed deals ranging from Britain’s Harrods to Germany’s Deutsch Bank to America’s Miramax Hollywood studios. A source close to the 2010 talks with Trump say he made the Doha stopover (along with stops in Dubai and Abu Dhabi) to raise money for a distressed real estate fund he was assembling. Trump opened the discussion with QIA by bragging about the success of Trump International and the many deals he had personally put together. Trump had hardly got through his own biography when Dr. Al-Abdullah, QIA’s senior executive, interrupted to say words to the effect of: We know who you are and what you have done. Tell us what you can do for us right now.That single, curt interruption apparently left Trump stunned. He had expected his hosts to be impressed, if not grateful, that a person of Trump’s stature would visit the Qatari capital. Apparently distracted by the lack of decorum, Trump barely continued with his pitch. The meeting abruptly ended, according to one account, with Trump exiting the room visibly angered. According to another, the meeting ended pleasantly and the decision not to invest in Trump was simply about Trump’s lack of track record in doing real estate funds. The same source also said any coldness to Trump was more a function of Dr. Al-Abdullah’s becoming numb to the same repetitive proposals—QIA routinely received such pitches. In the Qataris view, if not Trump’s, all that distinguished his proposal from so many others was his own celebrity status. A subsequent meeting that day between Trump and Sheikh HBJ ended with pleasantries but with the top Qatari businessman keeping hold of his wallet. Trump was unable to move any Qatari funds to the Trump Organization, and within months after leaving, observers noted that even Trump himself quit the distressed real estate fund idea, having failed to get a single backer anywhere.The Trump family interactions with Qatar expanded as Ivanka Trump returned to Doha within several months with her husband Jared Kushner, a wealthy real estate and media investor in his own right. Jared had a new pitch to make, this time on a different real estate deal. Ironically, some of Jared’s introductions within Qatar were facilitated by a national of the country that is a key player in the present crisis: Saudi Arabia. Through a personal friendship with Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan’s son Khalid, (who knew Jared and who remained in the U.S. after his father’s legendary tenure as ambassador ended in 2005) Jared gained entry to a younger cadre of successful Qatari businessmen during his trip.Jared and wife Ivanka overnighted at the Doha Four Seasons, and observers with direct knowledge of the visit say the atmosphere between them and their host was perceptibly better, if not warm. Jared had his own mission in mind to present to his Qatari hosts. He was desperate to secure funds to recapitalize his 666 Fifth Avenue property which, then as now, was severely underwater. But in high-level meetings in Doha, neither QIA nor Sheikh HBJ showed interest in Jared’s building. This was the same issue with follow-up meetings between Ivanka and Qatari investors held in New York in 2011. According to The New York Times:The Kushner Companies bought the building in January 2007, closing the deal on Jared Kushner’s birthday and paying the highest price ever for a New York office building. “This is a great acquisition for our company,” Jared Kushner said at the time. According to the Kushners, they put $500 million into the purchase.The luxury high-rise has been plagued by massive debt ever since—insiders say the Kushner family overpaid—which offers one explanation for why they have turned to foreign sources to help bail it out. Discussions to buy a stake in 666 Fifth Avenue between Jared and Sheikh HBJ—who left government in 2013 to pursue his own vast business interests—are said by a source with knowledge of the talks to have continued right up until the election of 2016.But the hunt for capital continued after Jared ended his pursuit of Qatari investors last year. In March 2017, Bloomberg reported that Kushner Companies was close to securing “unusually favorable terms” in talks with the Angbang Insurance Company, despite its ties to the “highest echelons of China’s Communist Party.” On the same day, Trump attacked Qatar as a financier of terrorism, lawyers from his Justice Department offered an advisory opinion arguing that as president he could accept payments from foreign governments after all, which would presumably include countries like Qatar and China.Today, with Trump allying himself and the United States with those blockading their tiny country, Qataris can’t help but wonder: is this all about Trump’s hurt feelings over business deals that didn’t pan out? For years America preached that the Arab countries should fight corruption and have financial transparency. Yet neither the American public much less most foreign countries dealing with Trump have any true understanding about the nature and volume of Trump family investments abroad whether in Saudi Arabia the UAE or elsewhere. For example, journalistic exposure of Jared’s family history of investing in illegal West Bank settlements provide Palestinians and the international community insights to his obvious personal conflicts, even if in Trump’s eyes that still makes him a suitable mediator of the Arab-Israeli conflict. So too with Qatar, it is necessary for Trump and his family to declare all their Mideast interests and holdings. This will enable others to form a view as to whether Trump’s recent weighing in on the side of Saudi Arabia and the UAE is a genuine attempt to perform the statesman role, or merely payback for business deals that never happened. Many Qataris suspect that they know the answer and are distressed by it. Could anyone have imagined that five or ten years ago, when businessmen turned down a New York mogul and reality TV host auditioning for its investment, that they were jeopardizing the security of their country? Not to mention America’s security interests in the Middle East.Clayton Swisher is an investigative journalist and author of two books on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
