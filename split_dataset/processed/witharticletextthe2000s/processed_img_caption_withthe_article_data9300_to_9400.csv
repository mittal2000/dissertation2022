But that is only one of the many actions his administration has taken to give a proverbial middle finger to all young generations, who will suffer the devastating impacts of climate change. Today's teenagers are growing up at a time where everything generations before us took for granted-- clean air, potable water, and life as we know it-- are on the verge of destruction. Teenagers, or “Generation Z” as we’re sometimes called, are growing up during a time where our future is more uncertain than it was for any generation before us.And among our internet surfing, Snapchat-addicted populace, are warriors. Many of today’s teenagers are defying stereotypes, fighting tooth and nail for our futures. Some teenagers are more civically active in one month than most adults are in a lifetime.I am one of them.Some of us are bravely tackling one of the most massive issues humanity has ever faced-- climate change-- while the leaders who are supposed to be doing it for us move backward, backing out of agreements, and buddying up with petroleum industries to destroy the futures of their own children. Take for example activist Xiuhtezcatl Martinez. He just turned 17. But by age 12, he had already organized more than 35 protests and rallies for environmental justice. President Obama gave him a national community service award in 2013 and as of today, Xiuhtezcatl has spoken at the United Nations three times, on behalf of our earth, and our entire generation, whose future is currently under assault by our own parents. Xiuhtezcatl is also a part of a lawsuit, along with 21 other youth plaintiffs, who are suing the federal government over denying our generation’s constitutional rights to life and a healthy environment. He’s gone on several speaking tours, using his words and the music he writes about the climate crisis to engage and inspire other youth to take action.The President could learn a thing or two from him.My friend 16-year-old Anne Lee, who co-founded a program that successfully lowered her school’s carbon footprint, and that of schools all over the state is better helping to safeguard the future than every single Trump Administration official combined.Then there’s Chiara Rose D’Angelo, who, when she was 19 years old, stayed in the branches of a tree for over three days to stall a mall project that would decimate a forest. At 20, she chained herself to the Anchor of a giant oil ship that was staying in a Washington State port, The Arctic Challenger, for three whole days, to stop it from leaving to go drill oil in the Arctic.Right now, leaders like Paul Ryan and Mitch Mcconnell, who are supposed to be an example for young people, are not showing even a shred of the courage Chiara has shown.And then, there’s me. Now 15-years-old, I take multiple trips a year to my state capitol to lobby my representatives and testify at bill hearings, in hopes that climate-fighting policies are passed. I spend every free hour I have attending community organizing meetings, writing Op-Eds, and putting together civic action projects to combat the climate crisis.I am not alone.But in the end, whether or not my generation inherits a livable planet relies on our leaders to actually listen to us youth activists, instead of giving us a “good work” pat on the head and then continuing to let the climate crisis get worse. We young change-makers can’t save our futures alone. We don’t make the laws. And that’s why we need our leaders to genuinely support us by taking concrete action to save our futures. Even if the current administration is exiting deals and taking strides backwards in fighting climate change, representatives in other branches of government, like the Congress and Senate, need to step up for young people’s futures. When you think of a modern day teenager, what comes to mind?Do you imagine a shallow, selfish, apathetic young person with their eyes glued to their cell phones?Well, if so, you’re wrong. That’s not the full story.We have to worry about things our parents never had to, like if the natural wonders and animals we love will still be around for us to share with our own children. We have to worry about concerns so basic that no one should ever have to even think about them, like whether the air we will breathe as adults will be clean, or whether our water will be free of toxins that make us sick. And because most of us can’t vote, we teenagers have no say in the destruction that is happening to our planet.We had no say in electing our politicians, who instead of working to safeguard our futures, are pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement, defunding the EPA, slashing environmental regulations left and right, and are pretty much ready to sell America’s national parks to the highest bidder.In fact, many of today’s teenagers are setting examples for our leaders, instead of vice versa.Youth activists need our leaders to learn from us.

The Paris Climate Agreement was not a perfect solution to the problem of global warming, but it was a start. Enraged by what was happening, I decided to speak our against the administration and climate change at my local March for Truth.Here is what I said:“When you were a kid, did you have to worry that the survival of your generation was being threatened by your own leaders and in some cases, your own parents?Did you have to worry that when you were old, the seas would be acidic and lifeless, and the natural wonders and animals you loved would still be around for you to share with our own children?Well, I do.My entire generation does.I’m in high school right now. I’m a freshman, actually. I am a member of one of the most vulnerable populations- youth.My generation can’t quite vote yet, which means we didn’t ask for any of this. We didn’t ask for climate change. We have no vote, which means we didn't ask for Trump or the destruction his administration is doing by taking steps to make the climate crisis even worse.Donald Trump is 70. Scott Pruitt is….I don’t know, but he’s old. They won’t have to deal with the mess they’ve made.I will!My entire generation will pay the biggest price for the damage they do to the earth. Right now, citizens have no choice but to fight back against this destruction. The White House isn’t going to save us from climate change, so now we have to step up and take charge.If you care about the young people in your life, you must battle the climate crisis in every way you can.Clean up your own pollution, donate to and join organizations that fight the climate crisis, call your local and state representatives about the climate crisis, and advocate for climate change fighting bills in your state capitals.Stand up for the young people in your lives. Make our movement unstoppable. I want a healthy earth and a livable future.That shouldn’t be too much to ask.”"
2,POLITICS,"Violence Erupts In Portland Amid Alt-Right, Anti-Fascist Rallies",Andy Campbell and Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/violence-erupts-in-portland-as-alt-right-anti-fascists-square-off_us_5932c1ebe4b075bff0f3dc8c,This city has been preparing for war for a week.,2017-06-04,Anti-fascist protestors and others storm the streets north of City Hall.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59349c18230000570e348c0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PORTLAND, Ore. ― For days, Portland has served as ground zero for American hate, heroism and healing. Today, it served as America’s battleground.What started Sunday as two counterdemonstrations outside City Hall between anti-fascist protesters and members of the alt-right during a “Trump Free Speech Rally” evolved into an impromptu march and standoff with police. As police began closing off Chapman Square, where the anti-fascists had staged their protest, at around 3:45 p.m., officers lobbed loud explosives in the protesters’ direction. It’s unclear whether they were concussion or tear gas grenades, but there was a yellow smoke emanating from some of them. At least five explosions were heard as police pushed people back from that square.Portland police said the explosives were in response to projectiles thrown at its officers. Following the release of the explosives, hundreds of the anti-fascist protesters and others started an impromptu march, heading northbound from City Hall and pouring into major roadways open to traffic. The protesters were held up by police at Fourth Ave. and Morrison Street in Downtown Portland, where officers arrested some and pushed others with batons. Police fired non-lethal rounds at protesters hiding in a parking garage near the intersection. Shortly after, a chemical substance was released from the spot police fired, burning and stinging marchers’ lungs and noses. It wasn’t immediately clear whether police fired chemical rounds, but the department tweeted that coughing in the crowd was caused by an unknown substance, “possibly from parking garage,” and not released by police. Police released a photo on their Twitter account. The police say they seized knives, construction tools and bits of bricks from protesters. The day’s crowds thinned and moved away from the park by 5:30 p.m., though pockets of protesters stopped on side streets to argue. Gibson was seen leaving with a few others, followed closely by about two dozen protesters chanting “get out” and waving goodbye.Overall, it appeared that the war Portland was gearing up for wasn’t going to happen. Police successfully dispersed many of the crowds and kept them under control, and both sides seemed content to stay relatively peaceful.But as early as 10:30 a.m. Sunday, it didn’t feel that way. The self-proclaimed anti-fascist and alt-right groups had occupied the parks surrounding City Hall, shoving each other and screaming until police showed up. Local and state officers, riot police and the Department of Homeland Security held the line, leaving each side to hurl insults at one another across the street for most of the day.HuffPost reporters witnessed several scattered arrests made for disorderly conduct.A third crowd ― the largest ― of local liberals protesting the Trump supporters sat outside City Hall. It was a battle they’d been preparing for all week; longstanding tensions between anti-fascists and the alt-right were compounded by the hate-fueled slashing on May 26 that left two dead and a nation in uproar.In the Trump camp, which had planned its rally days before the recent attack, alt-righters including Washington stood among people with Nazi symbolism tattooed on their arms and civilian “peacekeepers” in military gear.The loudest demonstrators on each side were often the last to identify themselves.“We’re surrounded,” one woman in a “Make America Great Again” hat said. “That’s Portland for ya.”The Trump rally was already expected to attract alt-right figures from out of state ― some of whom are straight up neo-Nazis ― but rumors that that demonstrators would be exercising their right to carry guns prompted local activists to reconsider and had all sides preparing for war. Mayor Ted Wheeler’s attempt to revoke a permit for the rally was declined by the federal government.Joey Gibson, who organized today’s Trump rally as well as the one on April 29 at which last week’s stabbing suspect Jeremy Joseph Christian was seen throwing up Nazi salutes, spoke after 2 p.m. to hundreds.“Portland I mean no disrespect, but you have gotten crazy out here,” he screamed into a mic. “You’re sitting here in a bubble and we’ve been on the outside looking in, but no more.”He said he wanted to “stop focusing on racism” as anti-fascists audibly condemned him from across the street.Anti-fascists in Portland had planned to hold a self-defense and group tactics seminar Saturday, but organizers told HuffPost that it was canceled after white nationalists and neo-Nazis mobilized against them.The Trump rally’s co-organizer, Kyle “Based Stickman” Chapman, has engaged anti-fascist protesters in battle before. His group of mostly white men called the Fraternal Order of Alt-Knights was labeled a “fight club” by The New York Times and issued a call to arms to his followers for Sunday.Fights in Portland, just a week after known white supremacist Joseph Christian allegedly slashed two men to death while screaming anti-Islamic hate at two teenaged women on a train, feel surprising and excessive to outsiders. But locals saw this coming a mile away ― this is a city with a white terror crisis and a storied history of racist confrontation. Sunday was a flashpoint in a decades-old fight."
3,RELIGION,'Terrorism Has No Religion': Muslims Across The UK Slam London Attackers,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/muslims-slam-london-attackers_us_59344b0ce4b075bff0f48fa8,"“It shouldn’t even have to be said, but this is not Islam,"" one Islamic charity group wrote.",2017-06-04,Imam Abdul Quddus Arif from the local Ahmadiyya Muslim community speaks out against Islamic extremism.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59345c272300003b00348bc1.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a rallying cry against religious extremism, Muslims across the United Kingdom are denouncing Saturday night’s deadly attacks in London, calling the violence cowardly acts by people who hide behind a religion that is not theirs.“Terrorism has no religion,” Imam Abdul Quddus Arif, of the local Ahmadiyya Muslim community, told HuffPost UK on Sunday, slamming the assailants’ twisted beliefs. “Basically, not in my name, not in the name of Islam. I want to make that very clear.”His stern words of condemnation follow witnesses describing one of the night’s assailants as calling out the name of Allah amid the attacks. The militant group the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack, which follows another attack credited to the group last month at a Manchester arena.“Islam is not a religion as portrayed by these so-called Muslims. Islam is a religion that says if you kill an innocent soul it’s akin to killing the whole of humanity, and if you save an innocent soul it’s akin to saving the whole of humanity,” he said, amid prayers for the victims and first responders. “A true Muslim, he only has two purposes. One is fulfilling the rights of God, and second is to fulfill the rights of his fellow beings.”Arif’s message was echoed by other Muslim organizations across the country, condemning Islamic extremism.“It shouldn’t even have to be said, but this is not Islam. Their warped view of the world doesn’t belong here in our country. Frankly, it doesn’t belong anywhere in the world. It should die with them,” New Horizons in British Islam charity said in a statement.The Muslim Association of Britain also expressed heartbreak with determination to stand up to acts of terror.“As members of British Society, we must continue to condemn all acts of terror, and we must not allow these criminals to spread hatred and fear; and we must foil their attempts to divide us,” they stated.Harun Khan, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, also expressed his revulsion at the attacks.“Muslims everywhere are outraged and disgusted at these cowards who once again have destroyed the lives of our fellow Britons,” he said. “That this should happen in this month of Ramadan, when many Muslims were praying and fasting only goes to show that these people respect neither life nor faith.”"

Tourists were strolling along the river Thames. Friends were dining, drinking and watching sports at pubs and restaurants nearby. But around 10 p.m., a white van sped across London Bridge, mowing down pedestrians along its path. “The van was zig-zagging along the pavement and it looked like it was aiming for groups of people,” Holly Jones, a BBC reporter who happened to be on the scene, recounted. The van “hit two people in front of me ... swerved back round again, and just clipped a girl who was walking towards me.”As the vehicle came to a halt and injured pedestrians lay on the bridge, three men jumped and ran into Borough Market. Wielding long knives, they waded into the popular restaurant locale and began attacking people.“[Then] they literally just started kicking them, punching them, they took out knives ... it was a rampage really,” Eric, a witness, told the BBC. A witness named Gerard said the men had shouted “This is for Allah.”Joe Palermo had just stepped outside of a pub near the bridge and saw a bloodied woman staggering towards him with a “clean cut” across her throat.“She was speaking English, saying, ‘Help,’” he told the London Evening Standard. Saturday night’s assault in the British capital marked the third major terrorist incident in the country in as many months, and ultimately claimed the lives of seven civilians, including one French and one Canadian citizen. Nearly 50 people were injured and 21 of them remain hospitalized in serious condition. The brutal attack was over in less than an hour. Police arrived on the scene eight minutes after the first emergency call was placed. Mark Rowley, head of the counter-terrorism police unit, said that eight officers fired about 50 bullets in total. All three attackers were fatally hit. The suspects appeared to be wearing explosive vests, which turned out to be fake. “The situation these officers were confronted with was critical, a matter of life and death; three armed men, wearing what appeared to be suicide belts, had already attacked and killed members of the public and had to be stopped immediately,” Rowley said. The three assailants have not yet been identified. “Work is ongoing to understand more about them, their connections and whether they were assisted or supported by anyone else,” Rowley said later on Sunday. “There is of course more to do, and we will work relentlessly to establish the facts.”Authorities detained 12 people in East London in connection with the attack over the weekend and several more early Monday. Officials said they identified the attackers and would release their names later on Monday.The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for Saturday’s violence via its news agency Amaq. The group said in a statement on Amaq’s page that “a detachment of Islamic State fighters” had executed the attack. However it is unclear to what extent, if any, the group’s leadership was directly involved.Saturday’s killings closely follow last month’s deadly suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester and an attack at Westminster Bridge on March 22 that also began with a car driven into pedestrians. Those attacks were claimed by ISIS as well. British Prime Minister Theresa May said that while no direct links are yet apparent among the incidents, “terrorism breeds terrorism. “Perpetrators are inspired to attack not only on the basis of carefully constructed plots ... and not even as lone attackers radicalized online, but by copying one another and often using the crudest of means of attack,” May added.May on Sunday promised firm and swift action. “Enough is enough,” she said in a televised speech. “When it comes to taking on extremism and terrorism, things need to change.” She proposed a four-point plan to crack down on extremism. New measures could include longer jail sentences for some offenses and additional cyberspace regulations.“While we have made significant progress in recent years, there is ― to be frank ― far too much tolerance of extremism in our country,” May said. But her remarks drew condemnation from some of her political opponents, who accused her of politicizing Saturday’s incident.“We need to do more but we also need to be sensitive to the fact that there are people who are only just discovering that their loved ones have died, ” Emily Thornberry, a member of Parliament and the Labour Party’s Shadow Foreign Secretary, said. Britain is just days away from a general election. May’s Conservative Party, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party temporarily suspended national campaigning Sunday out of respect for the attack victims, but the election is due to go ahead on ThursdayMay’s main opponent in the vote, Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, pledged that if elected he would have the nation’s security services prepare a report on the changing nature of the terrorist threat.Across the pond, it was U.S. President Trump who once again drew controversy with his response. As condolences poured in from around the world, including from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump seized on the attacks to reissue his call for a U.S. travel ban affecting several Muslim-majority nations. The president also took aim at London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who urged Londoners to remain calm as the police presence throughout the city intensifies. Trump mocked Kahn’s appeal on Twitter in a post that said, “At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’”British politicians quickly condemned Trump’s statements and many people took to social media to say Trump had misrepresented Khan’s comment.Khan’s spokesperson responded in a statement that the mayor “has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump’s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police ― including armed officers ― on the streets.” Tales of heroism emerged throughout the night. Pub goers threw chairs, glasses and bottles at the attackers in a bid to stop them. The first police officer at the scene took on the assailants with just a batton. The man, a British Transport Police officer, was stabbed in the face, head and leg. “It became clear that he showed enormous courage in the face of danger,” British Transport Police Chief Constable Paul Crowther said.Mark Stembridge and his staff at Cafe Brood pulled customers from the open balcony as they saw the attackers coming towards the building. “I can’t tell you what they were screaming but they seemed to hesitate when they saw we were slightly organized,” Stembridge told HuffPost UK. London residents on Sunday brought flowers and candles to the scenes of the attack. A vigil is planned for Monday in the city, and a nationwide minute of silence will be observed on Tuesday to honor the victims.“We are all shocked and angry today ― but this is our city. We will never let these cowards win and we will never be cowed by terrorism,” Khan said.On Sunday night, 50,000 people gathered in Manchester for Ariana Grande’s “One Love Manchester” benefit concert. While the concert was originally planned to commemorate the victims of last month’s attack and raise funds for their families, the concert took on new meaning after Saturday night’s killings. “The only thing we can do now is choose how we let this affect us and how we live our lives from here on out,” Grande haid said in an open letter announcing the concert. On Sunday she added: “The kind of love and unity that you’re displaying is the medicine the world really needs right now.”Photos of Saturday’s attacks can be seen below:This is a developing story.

In 2006, while running unsuccessfully for the same seat in South Carolina’s 5th district, Norman even supported privatizing the social insurance program.Norman’s Democratic opponent, Archie Parnell, a 66-year-old tax attorney, is against any Social Security benefit cuts, including through an increase in the retirement age. He sees Norman’s stances ― past and present ― as an opportunity to draw a contrast ahead of the special election on June 20.“I’m the only candidate who will fight every day to protect Social Security and Medicare in Congress,” Parnell told HuffPost in a statement late Friday. “That’s not rhetoric: Ralph Norman’s proposal to cut Social Security benefits and raise the retirement age would cost South Carolinians and is flat out wrong.”“Voters have worked and earned their healthcare and retirement security,” he continued. “Social Security is on the ballot on June 20th and we will not allow Norman to take it away.”Norman’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.Social Security has a funding gap that will require it to cut benefits across the board by some 20 percent in 2034 if Congress fails to shore up its finances before then. The program, which pays out benefits to over 61 million retirees, workers with disabilities, widows and their dependents, has faced more imminent shortfalls in the past and Congress has always acted to address them in time.Progressives favor closing the program’s funding gap by increasing revenue, such as lifting the cap on ordinary income subject to Social Security taxes, which is currently at $127,200. Conservative prefer solutions that rely on reducing benefits.Although polls consistently show that Social Security is popular among Republican and independent voters, it is not clear if Parnell’s tactic will resonate in the solid red district. Mulvaney, a dedicated budget cutter, ran up large margins in the rural swath of South Carolina without disguising his antipathy for Social Security, let alone his support for benefit cuts. Mulvaney unseated longtime Democratic incumbent John Spratt in 2010 despite a 2009 vote in South Carolina’s state senate designating Social Security and Medicare unconstitutional. And he won reelection handily in 2012 after claiming Social Security is a Ponzi scheme a year earlier.Prior to Mulvaney’s win in 2010, a Democrat had represented South Carolina’s 5th district, which currently stretches from Sumter in the South to Rock Hill in the North, going back to the era of Reconstruction in the 19th century. But since the tea party wave, it has trended increasingly Republican, allowing President Donald Trump to top Hillary Clinton there by some 17 percentage points in November, according to official data collected by Daily Kos and shared with HuffPost.Parnell’s best hope is that Democrats angry about the Trump presidency will turn out in greater numbers, and enough Republicans and independents will join them. Earlier this week, his campaign released a poll it commissioned showing that Parnell had narrowed Norman’s lead from 16 percentage points to 10.The Democrat got a head start on Norman after a decisive win in the primary on May 2. Norman was only certified as the Republican nominee on May 19, after a primary runoff that resulted in a recount. Tommy Pope, the more moderate state lawmaker he defeated, has yet to endorse Norman.The national Democratic Party has thus far been reluctant to pour money into Parnell’s bid, but they are not ignoring it either.Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez, associate chair and former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman Jaime Harrison and American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten kicked off the DNC’s “Resistance Summer” party-building initiative on Saturday by campaigning with Parnell in the Rock Hill area. The “Resistance Summer” is Perez’s attempt to revive the Democratic Party’s presence and potency in all 50 states, hiring organizers and training volunteers to mobilize voters around the Democratic agenda ahead of the 2018 midterms.“Archie is the voice South Carolinians need in Congress and his strong grassroots campaign is representative of our movement to rebuild the party from the ground up,” Perez and Harrison said in a joint statement. “Congress needs a loud wake-up call, and we believe that electing Archie would put President Trump, Speaker Ryan, and their ilk on notice.”Perez will be fundraising for Parnell as well while in South Carolina, and spoke at the South Carolina Democratic Party state dinner in May to raise money for him as well, according to the DNC.The party has elicited criticism from progressive activists for not financing every Democratic candidate in a congressional special election earlier and more aggressively. Fueling these complaints were races in Kansas and Montana where Democrats lost by single digits in districts where Trump recorded landslide wins.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee argues that it invests most heavily in races where Democrats have the best chance of winning, and notes that it ultimately injected cash into the Montana race notwithstanding Democrat Rob Quist’s steep chances.Democrats are hoping to flip Georgia’s 6th congressional on the same day as Parnell’s election in South Carolina. The DCCC and other party organs continue to flood that race with funds, believing that the affluent, suburban Atlanta district with a growing minority population is ripe for a Democratic takeover. A new poll shows Democrat Jon Ossoff with a narrow lead over Republican Karen Handel, with the contest on track to be the most expensive in House history."
7,POLITICS,A New Bill Would Protect Immigrant Farmworkers. It Has Little Chance Of Survival.,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/blue-card-immigration-reform-farmworkers_us_5931b357e4b02478cb9b419d,"The ""blue card"" proposal would give undocumented farmworkers a path to a legal status. Republicans aren't jumping on board.",2017-06-03,"Supervisor Sergio Marmalejo, 55, watches migrant farmworkers with H-2A visas harvest romaine lettuce in King City, California, on April 17.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5931cb6e2000002b00be02c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For many months now, farmworkers’ anxieties have been growing.Following President Donald Trump’s promise last fall to imprison or deport or some 3 million undocumented immigrants from this country, many of the nation’s farmworkers — an estimated half of whom are undocumented — fear that this enforcement push will target them and their families.Some of those farmworkers may have left, while others have inched further into the shadows. Arturo Rodriguez, president of United Farm Workers, a labor union that represents farmworkers, says he’s hearing a lot of reports of the latter. And he believes it is even putting farmworkers’ health at risk.Last month, almost 50 farmworkers were exposed to a controversial pesticide that made them ill — reportedly vomiting and experiencing nausea — at an orchard in Kern County, California. Before anyone arrived to check on the workers, Rodriguez says, about half of the workers had left the worksite. He believes they did so because they were afraid they might encounter immigration officials while reporting their illnesses.“I suspect they left because of the fact that they were fearful someone might find out that they may not have documents. They didn’t want to take that risk,” Rodriguez told HuffPost. “This creates more than fear. People don’t want to report anything to authorities.”The political climate, he believes, is making an already vulnerable population that is integral to the American food system even more vulnerable.But Rodriguez sees hope in new legislation, introduced last month, that would offer a temporary legal status — and a path to a green card — to undocumented farmworkers.The bill, sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and in the House by U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), would offer a so-called “blue card” to farmworkers who have been working in the nation’s fields for at least two years and can pass a “thorough” background check.The legislation isn’t exactly new. A similar proposal was sponsored by Feinstein and Rep. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) as part of the broader “Gang of Eight” immigration reform bill advanced in the Senate in 2013, though the bill was blocked by then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) in the House.Four years ago, the “blue card” plan had bipartisan support. To date, only other Democrats have signed on as co-sponsors to the new bill, and reports suggest the bill has little hope of Republican support — or the president’s signature — without significant changes.Tom Nassif, president and CEO of Western Growers, which represents farmers in Arizona, California and Colorado, is an influential industry leader and also served on the president’s agriculture advisory committee. He said he welcomed the bill’s introduction but stopped short of endorsing it because it doesn’t address the full issue.“To have a bill come out of the Senate co-sponsored by only Democrats is not meant to be a bill that’s passed, but to be a bill that starts the conversation about the need we have to do something about our existing [agricultural] workforce,” Nassif told HuffPost. “That’s a positive.”He said the legislation was incomplete when compared to the broader “Gang of Eight” bill, which also included a proposal for an agricultural guestworker visa program.“We’ve got to complete an agreement that covers a lot of the things that are important to agriculture,” Nassif added. “I don’t think anything that is less than a complete agricultural [immigration reform] bill has any chance of surviving.”Paul Schlegel, director of the energy and environment team at the American Farm Bureau Federation, the nation’s largest ag industry group, offered a similar take on the bill. Schlegel emphasized the need to address not only the industry’s current workforce, but also its future one.“I don’t think the politics will allow that to move in the absence of broader legislation,” Schlegel added.Neither Feinstein’s nor Gutierrez’s offices responded to requests for comment on the bill by publication time.Meanwhile, both farmworker advocates and ag industry groups emphasize that the issue is pressing. Perhaps as a reflection of that, applications for H-2A “guest worker” visas from the Department of Labor surged 36 percent in the first three months of this year compared to the same time last year.But industry leaders say the H-2A program is flawed — too expensive and paperwork-intensive — and cannot alone solve a serious labor shortage in the industry. Nassif called it “the worst labor shortage” he’s seen over the course of his long career.“Why the legislature has so little regard for what’s happening in production agriculture, especially those of us who use a lot of manual laborers, I just don’t understand it,” Nassif said. “We’re sending jobs abroad and importing more foreign food. There’s absolutely no upside to this.”Labor shortages can mean a big financial hit for farmers — farmers in Georgia last year reported six-digit losses they blamed on delayed processing of their H-2A visa requests. Crops rotted in the field while some farmers waited for their workers to arrive.For his part, Bruce Goldstein, president of the Farmworker Justice advocacy group, is more concerned with the reports of immigration raids that are already affecting farmworkers and their communities, families and supporters. In March, reports emerged of the ICE arrest of apple pickers in western New York and a separate arrest of farmworker advocates in Vermont.Goldstein emphasized his support for the blue card legislation, which he believes will not only put many farmworkers’ anxieties to ease, but also would help provide a stable workforce for their employers.“There’s a serious threat of enforcement and that instills fear in the farmworkers and their employers,” Goldstein said. “It’s not just a number of arrests or deportations. It’s the presence of ICE agents in so many rural communities throughout the country. That presence is being noticed.”Though he recognizes that chances for a more comprehensive immigration reform package seem dim in Washington, he is hopeful that Republicans in Congress will come around on addressing this one aspect of the bigger problem.“This is an urgently needed, reasonable response to the reality that the majority of farmworkers in this country are undocumented and that agriculture would be tremendously harmed if any significant number of them were deported.”"
8,POLITICS,Someone Is Using These Leaked Emails To Embarrass Washington's Most Powerful Ambassador,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/otaiba-ambassador-uae-leaked-emails_us_5932bf04e4b02478cb9bec1c,"HuffPost confirmed eight inflammatory D.C. insider email exchanges, including between Yousef Al Otaiba and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates.",2017-06-03,"Yousef Al Otaiba has been the United Arab Emirates' ambassador to the U.S. since 2008, and he is known as one of the best-connected diplomats in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5932bfa92100003c00aa2268.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A mysterious source contacted multiple news outlets this week to share emails between the influential ambassador of the United Arab Emirates, Yousef Al Otaiba, and top figures in the American foreign policy community, including former Defense Secretary Robert Gates.In private correspondence, Otaiba ― an extremely powerful figure in Washington, D.C., who is reportedly in “in almost constant phone and email contact” with Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s adviser and son-in-law ― is seen pushing for the U.S. to close down its military base in Qatar and otherwise poking at issues that could drive a wedge between the U.S. and that Arab nation. He also says that his country’s de facto ruler is supportive of a wave of anti-Qatar criticism in the U.S. that the Gulf state last month called a smear campaign and that has prompted behind-the-scenes alarm inside the U.S. government.The anonymous leakers told HuffPost they sought to expose the UAE’s efforts to manipulate the U.S. government, and denied any allegiance to Qatar or any other government. Regardless of the leakers’ intent, the revelations promise to heighten tensions between the two U.S. partners. If the UAE succeeds in damaging America’s decades-old relationship with Qatar, the result could dramatically undermine U.S. goals in the Middle East. The two American partners’ escalating rivalry could worsen conflict in war zones where they support different proxy forces ― notably in Libya, which has become a haven for smugglers, warlords, and terrorists ― while distracting attention from bigger international priorities, like restoring stability in Syria and Iraq after the expected battlefield defeat of the Islamic State. And the UAE strategy could leave the U.S. more wedded to that government’s whims, including its policy of maintaining brittle autocratic rule across the region instead of trying to secure long-term stability by having some level of popular participation.The UAE and Qatar have taken their rivalry public in recent days following a controversial report in Qatari media. Qatari authorities soon claimed that the May 23 story ― which suggested that the country’s ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, gave a speech describing his respect for Iran, his support for the Palestinian militant group Hamas and his ties with Israel ― was a fake product of a hack. But news sources based in the UAE and Saudi Arabia still suggest that it exposed his true feelings.Though Qatar and the Emirates are putative allies, they have drifted apart since 2011 because of their differing reactions to the Arab Spring protests that year. As the largely non-violent Muslim Brotherhood movement gained power across the region, Qatar supported it, seeing it as a vehicle for the Middle East’s democratic aspirations. The UAE calls the group a terror front. With a new U.S. administration in power, the time is ripe for one or the other to push for American action in its own interests.Otaiba, who has been the UAE’s ambassador to the United States since 2008, is known as one of the best-connected diplomats in Washington, D.C. He makes frequent high-profile appearances around the city and the U.S. speaking circuit, and he’s ensured that the Trump administration has already cozied up to the Emirates, which hosts a recently opened Trump golf course. The leakers provided HuffPost with three batches of emails from Otaiba, some as recent as May and others from as far back as 2014, the last time the UAE supported a major effort to spread skepticism about Qatar in the United States. HuffPost contacted eight of the individuals who’d exchanged messages with the ambassador and shared the contents of those emails; none denied that the exchanges took place. Though Otaiba did not respond to repeated HuffPost requests for comment, a UAE Embassy spokeswoman confirmed to the Daily Beast that the Hotmail address used for the messages belongs to him. Otaiba’s emails show an effort to build alliances and a focus on Qatar.The night before former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was scheduled to speak at a high-profile Washington conference on Qatar, for instance, Otaiba wrote him an artfully worded note. “The subject of the conference has been a neglected issue in U.S. foreign policy despite all the trouble it’s causing,” the diplomat wrote. “Coming from you, folks will listen carefully.”Gates emailed back that he thought he had “the chance to put some folks on notice.”Otaiba offered to buy the former Cabinet official lunch and passed along a message from his boss back home. “MBZ sends his best from Abu Dhabi,” the ambassador wrote, using a nickname for UAE Crown Prince Muhammed bin Zayed. “He says ‘give them hell tomorrow.’”The next day, Gates offered a scathing assault on Qatar, excoriating its support for Islamists, at an event hosted by the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “The United States military doesn’t have any irreplaceable facility,” he said. “Tell Qatar to choose sides or we will change the nature of the relationship, to include downscaling the base.”The incident worried U.S. officials. The American ambassador to Qatar, experienced career diplomat Dana Shell Smith, contacted many of the conference speakers beforehand to try to tone down the rhetoric. It appears that her attempt backfired: foundation officials have publicly criticized and questioned her efforts.The powerful Washington-based foundation features heavily in the Otaiba emails. While many of those messages show the ambassador helping its analysts plan trips to the UAE, they also contain two of the most striking revelations about Otaiba: He explicitly advocated for moving the U.S. base out of Qatar ― something he hasn’t done publicly ― and he discussed the idea of pressuring companies in U.S.-friendly countries to avoid business opportunities in Iran.An Arab’s Favorite Pro-Israel GroupThe Foundation for Defense of Democracies spends much of its time trying to strengthen ties between Washington and conservative political forces in Israel. But despite the UAE’s refusal to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, the think tank and others in the pro-Israel lobby have found common ground with the Emirates on two major issues: Both want to contain Iran and political Islam. Both suffered a high-profile defeat when the U.S. and other nations reached a nuclear deal with Iran in 2015. And for the past year or so, both have been pushing to make the future of U.S. relations with Qatar a debate in D.C.Emirati critiques of Qatar often raise the same points the foundation’s scholars bring up in their frequent appearances before Congress and in the media: The Qatari government provides, in the words of the U.S. Treasury Department, a “permissive jurisdiction” for fundraisers and donors hoping to aid violent Muslim extremists. In supporting the rights of protesters and democracy activists (at least compared to its neighbors), Qatar is accused of promoting Islamists who claim to be peaceful but really seek to impose brutal Shariah law. And it frequently offers a platform to hatemongers targeting Israel, Jews, the minority Shiite community within Islam, LGBTQ individuals and others ― generally on its marquee media property, the Arabic edition of Al-Jazeera.But experts on the region note that Qatar’s flaws as an American partner are not unique: Kuwait has also been called a “permissive jurisdiction,” and Saudi Arabia and the UAE also host terror financiers and clerics who spread hate speech. The vendetta against Qatar, then, appears to be driven by more defensive concerns, namely the pro-Israel side’s focus on Hamas and anyone who supports that group, and the UAE’s worry that the Muslim Brotherhood could threaten its own ruling regime.Otaiba made his views about the U.S. base in Qatar clear in an April 28 message this year to John Hannah, a senior counselor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney.Hannah had emailed the ambassador a Forbes article noting that an Emirati-owned hotel would actually be hosting a Hamas conference in “Muslim Brotherhood-loving” Qatar. Otaiba appeared taken aback by the jab; the UAE is rarely criticized in Washington’s policy community.“Shouldn’t we be trying to move the base?” he wrote. “I don’t think it’s fair to point the finger at an Emirati company on this one.”Hannah responded by saying he agreed about the military base. But he said criticism of the decision to host Hamas was fair no matter who owned the hotel. Otaiba snapped back that the UAE would move its hotel when the U.S. moved its base.“Don’t move the hotel,” Hannah answered. “Just force Hamas to reschedule at a different venue not owned by Emiratis.”On Friday, Hannah told HuffPost that the communications were business as usual.“As a leading Washington think tank, [the foundation] is engaged in policy discussions with a range of actors across the Middle East and elsewhere. My own relationship with Ambassador Otaiba goes back years, including both my time in government and out,” he wrote in an email.Mark Dubowitz, the foundation’s CEO, lobbied Otaiba on a different issue in a March 10, 2017, email. Dubowitz provided Otaiba with a list of mainly Western companies that operate in the UAE and Saudi Arabia and that are looking to do business in Iran, following the lifting of some sanctions as a result of the nuclear deal.“This is a target list for putting these companies to a choice, as we have discussed,” Dubowitz wrote the ambassador. The group includes businesses based in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, South Korea and the U.K.In response to HuffPost’s inquiries, Dubowitz noted that he has openly called for U.S. Gulf partners to target such companies.“I have discussed this policy idea many times in public including in published pieces and reports,” Dubowitz wrote in a Friday email. “I sent these public pieces, reports and the list of companies as an example to a number of people in Washington and abroad to get feedback on the idea.”On Saturday, Dubowitz issued a further clarification about the relationship on Twitter. While many think tanks in Washington have received funding from the UAE, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies is not one of them, he wrote.Emails with another foundation associate show the level of warmth in interactions between the think tank and Otaiba ― and the way they frequently circled back to joint foe Qatar.On May 24, Otaiba emailed nonresident fellow Mary Beth Long, a top former Pentagon and CIA official with ties to current Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. He appears to have shared an article critical of Zayed, the UAE prince.“Isnt this the former Guardian hack who used to work for al Jazeera? I know it doesnt make MBZ feel better, but hes in pretty good company. Trump takes a beating here as well (but he always does),” Long wrote back.Otaiba seemed to have expected more sympathy. “This site is paid for by Qatar!! How is donald trump the issue??” he wrote.Long quickly concurred. “Darling, I KNOW,” she wrote. “What I was trying to convey is that NO ONE takes this site seriously (although I know it is still really hurtful and annoying.) My point is that even for people who dont know that, their main writer is a well known HACK who has no credibility as he is former AJ and Guardian ― where HACKs live!! Its basically a blog of filth and could never pass for more.” Contacted about the exchange, Long stood by her comments in it and accused HuffPost of coordinating with hackers to obtain it. She threatened to sue if it was published.“That is an accurate representation of the crap that the Qataris and others have been printing about the UAE leadership, and frankly, I was defending myself about some comments I had made,” Long said. “I’m appalled with the Qatari use of media and Al Jazeera to attack its neighbors, and it is undermining US foreign policy. I was not as careful and articulate as I should have been, and I was attempting to make the ambassador feel better which was, it appalls me of what’s been going on in the press, and in fact I have an editorial I’ve been writing that will make that all very, very clear.”Although the broader foreign policy conversation is only now noting the alignment of interests between pro-Israel hawks and anti-Iran, anti-Brotherhood forces in the Gulf, like the UAE, informed analysts have recognized it for years. In a Feb. 5, 2014, email to Otaiba, lobbyist and former Clinton aide Rich Mintz directs him to note comments by former Obama administration official Dennis Ross at a public think tank event.Ross, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, is well respected among Middle East policy-makers. In a summary prepared by Mintz’s lobbying firm, Ross appeared to say that “as opposed to a few years ago, the talking points in the Gulf were almost identical to the ones he heard in speaking to Israeli officials.”(Mintz did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment; HuffPost was not able to independently confirm that exchange.)In recent weeks, Ross has publicly joined the chorus of Qatar critics and Emirates boosters. “The Qataris should know we have alternatives and are prepared to develop them in the UAE and elsewhere unless Qatar is prepared to be a genuine partner and not a party that contributes to the very threats we need to counter,” he wrote in USA Today on May 8."

Otaiba snapped back that the UAE would move its hotel when the U.S. moved its base.“Don’t move the hotel,” Hannah answered. “Just force Hamas to reschedule at a different venue not owned by Emiratis.”On Friday, Hannah told HuffPost that the communications were business as usual.“As a leading Washington think tank, [the foundation] is engaged in policy discussions with a range of actors across the Middle East and elsewhere. My own relationship with Ambassador Otaiba goes back years, including both my time in government and out,” he wrote in an email.Mark Dubowitz, the foundation’s CEO, lobbied Otaiba on a different issue in a March 10, 2017, email. Dubowitz provided Otaiba with a list of mainly Western companies that operate in the UAE and Saudi Arabia and that are looking to do business in Iran, following the lifting of some sanctions as a result of the nuclear deal.“This is a target list for putting these companies to a choice, as we have discussed,” Dubowitz wrote the ambassador. The group includes businesses based in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, South Korea and the U.K.In response to HuffPost’s inquiries, Dubowitz noted that he has openly called for U.S. Gulf partners to target such companies.“I have discussed this policy idea many times in public including in published pieces and reports,” Dubowitz wrote in a Friday email. “I sent these public pieces, reports and the list of companies as an example to a number of people in Washington and abroad to get feedback on the idea.”On Saturday, Dubowitz issued a further clarification about the relationship on Twitter. While many think tanks in Washington have received funding from the UAE, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies is not one of them, he wrote.Emails with another foundation associate show the level of warmth in interactions between the think tank and Otaiba ― and the way they frequently circled back to joint foe Qatar.On May 24, Otaiba emailed nonresident fellow Mary Beth Long, a top former Pentagon and CIA official with ties to current Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. He appears to have shared an article critical of Zayed, the UAE prince.“Isnt this the former Guardian hack who used to work for al Jazeera? I know it doesnt make MBZ feel better, but hes in pretty good company. Trump takes a beating here as well (but he always does),” Long wrote back.Otaiba seemed to have expected more sympathy. “This site is paid for by Qatar!! How is donald trump the issue??” he wrote.Long quickly concurred. “Darling, I KNOW,” she wrote. “What I was trying to convey is that NO ONE takes this site seriously (although I know it is still really hurtful and annoying.) My point is that even for people who dont know that, their main writer is a well known HACK who has no credibility as he is former AJ and Guardian ― where HACKs live!! Its basically a blog of filth and could never pass for more.” Contacted about the exchange, Long stood by her comments in it and accused HuffPost of coordinating with hackers to obtain it. She threatened to sue if it was published.“That is an accurate representation of the crap that the Qataris and others have been printing about the UAE leadership, and frankly, I was defending myself about some comments I had made,” Long said. “I’m appalled with the Qatari use of media and Al Jazeera to attack its neighbors, and it is undermining US foreign policy. I was not as careful and articulate as I should have been, and I was attempting to make the ambassador feel better which was, it appalls me of what’s been going on in the press, and in fact I have an editorial I’ve been writing that will make that all very, very clear.”Although the broader foreign policy conversation is only now noting the alignment of interests between pro-Israel hawks and anti-Iran, anti-Brotherhood forces in the Gulf, like the UAE, informed analysts have recognized it for years. In a Feb. 5, 2014, email to Otaiba, lobbyist and former Clinton aide Rich Mintz directs him to note comments by former Obama administration official Dennis Ross at a public think tank event.Ross, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, is well respected among Middle East policy-makers. In a summary prepared by Mintz’s lobbying firm, Ross appeared to say that “as opposed to a few years ago, the talking points in the Gulf were almost identical to the ones he heard in speaking to Israeli officials.”(Mintz did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment; HuffPost was not able to independently confirm that exchange.)In recent weeks, Ross has publicly joined the chorus of Qatar critics and Emirates boosters. “The Qataris should know we have alternatives and are prepared to develop them in the UAE and elsewhere unless Qatar is prepared to be a genuine partner and not a party that contributes to the very threats we need to counter,” he wrote in USA Today on May 8."

Mike Conaway (R-Texas) took over as head of the committee’s investigation on Russian election interference and possible collusion with President Donald Trump’s election campaign. But Nunes has so far refused to fully hand over subpoena power to Conaway, said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House panel. “What I’ve been urging is power be delegated to Mr. Conaway since the chair recused himself,” Schiff told HuffPost in an interview Friday evening. “The chair has not been willing to honor that part of his commitment so he’s still requiring his sign-off.”The House intelligence panel can issue subpoenas two ways, according to committee rules. The Chairman can authorize a subpoena, “upon consultation with” the ranking minority member, or the full committee can approve a subpoena with a majority vote. (There are currently 13 Republicans and nine Democrats on the committee.) The committee issued a series of subpoenas related to the Russia investigation on Wednesday. Four came from Conaway and Schiff, requesting information from Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen and Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser. Before issuing those subpoenas, Conaway and Schiff first had to submit a letter to Nunes, requesting his sign off. Conaway did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CNN previously reported that Nunes maintains a role in deciding whether to issue subpoenas and is still viewing intelligence related to the probe. But Schiff’s interview with HuffPost is one of the strongest confirmations to date that Nunes is requiring final “sign-off” on all subpoenas pertaining to the investigation. Nunes also issued his own subpoenas earlier this week, focusing on requests from former Obama administration officials to “unmask” the identities of Americans whose names showed up in classified surveillance reports. That topic first surfaced in March, after Nunes received intelligence information from the White House and used the information to accuse the Obama administration of improperly spying on the Trump campaign. (Committee members from both parties later viewed the intelligence material and said the unmasking requests looked to be routine.)In what appeared to be a breach of committee rules, Nunes issued those subpoenas “unilaterally,” without consulting Schiff, the ranking Democrat said. It is not clear why Nunes issued subpoenas related to unmasking requests. As the head of the committee tasked with overseeing the intelligence community, Nunes could have asked for a briefing from the relevant officials without a legal summons.“That does strike me as out of the ordinary,” said Matthew Olsen, the former general counsel for the National Security Agency on Thursday, referring to Nunes’ subpoenas. During his time at the NSA, officials went to Capitol Hill to brief the House and Senate intelligence communities “all the time, on a weekly basis,” Olsen said. “This would be an issue within the purview of their oversight,” he added.Intelligence agencies are “fully cooperating” with requests for information from the panel and that there was “no basis” for Nunes’ “use of compulsory process,” a committee aide told HuffPost.Nunes had said that he still sees a role for himself on aspects of the committee’s probe, despite publicly stating that he would recuse himself in April. “Simply put, I’m still the chairman of the Committee,” he told Fox News last month. “The way to look into this is that I’m still read into everything, but ... I was going to set at least the Russia investigation aside because I didn’t want to become the face of this investigation. But everything else, I’m still in charge of … especially the unmasking.”The House Ethics Committee is investigating whether Nunes violated classified information when accused former Obama administration officials of wrongdoing, citing intelligence reports. Nunes did not respond to a request for comment. He dismissed concern about his decision to unilaterally issue subpoenas as “fake news” in a Tweet on Thursday. "

The sustained growth of the U.S. solar industry over the past decade speaks directly to the evolution taking place. Today many traditional energy companies have embraced renewables as key to their portfolios. Such a shift is a game changer: It marks a new age of integration, one that stands to benefit every community across the country.The announcement by the Trump administration that the United States is pulling out of the COP21 agreement might come across as a win for traditional energy sources over renewables. However, the market tells us that this simply isn’t the case. When the Paris Agreement was finalized in April 2016, companies in the U.S. quickly worked to understand core provisions and principles so that they could factor them into their long-term business plans. By removing the U.S. from the agreement, President Trump has effectively disrupted this market, which will force many to question the possibility of future economic growth across our sector. It’s just as much an economic issue, affecting all providers, as it is an environmental one.With practically every country in the world signed onto the agreement, the U.S. is now missing a clear opportunity to stand as a leader on an issue that is just as domestic as it is global. To remain competitive with other nations, we must be a part of the infrastructure associated with the Paris Agreement. If the government doesn’t step up, the private sector will. As I’ve shared with policymakers, a departure from COP21 will help other countries secure the business of U.S. manufacturers who are well into making solar integral to their operations.By all accounts, other countries are playing to win. A recent report by British non-profit organization Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) showed that, since the United Nations Earth Summit in 1992, Great Britain has decreased emissions by 33 percent and increased its nominal GDP by 150 percent. Costa Rica has also seen great economic success from emission reductions. For the first 75 days of 2015, the entire country only used renewable energy and still sustained a 3.7 percent increase in GDP that year. There are dozens of other examples, large and small, that reinforce this point. In fact, it’s difficult to find a country that hasn’t benefited from a proactive clean energy strategy.As the U.S. market shifts to one that integrates and elevates everyday use of renewable energy, common sense and practical policymaking must always come first. COP21 is a practical approach to a growing international problem. The significant benefits of this deal will only become clearer with time, and the U.S. should be present to reap the rewards.When we think about the future of our industry, we immediately think of the continued expansion of solar energy use and the innovation that lies ahead. However, innovation isn’t a guarantee. A future with solar is one that capitalizes on decades of American inventiveness and ingenuity. If we don’t take advantage of these advancements in solar, we will find ourselves unable to meet increasing consumer demand for renewable energy and unable to evolve with the changing needs of our economy.The faster we fully realize the connection between solar and long-term economic growth, the faster we will be able to get in front of the challenges of tomorrow. Although I’m a strong believer that the market will help determine how we address them, it’s fair to say that the U.S. just lost a key strategic advantage – for now.We look forward to working with policymakers on both sides of the aisle to help ensure that we get it back. Tom Werner is president and CEO of SunPower.This post first appeared on SunPower’s blog following President Trump’s announcement that the U.S. plans to withdraw from the COP21 agreement."

To hear commentators say it was a hand-shake that sparked the Trump feud when Macron held on to Trump's little hand with his white knuckle grip is misleading. – The feud really began when Trump, along with the Russians, that's right our American President along with the Russians tried to get Macron's obstructionist/opponent elected which would have caused as much harm to France as Trump has caused as President of the United States. If that had happened, our treasured Atlantic Alliance, NATO, would really be in trouble for France too would have had a president who is aligned with Putin and in support of all Putin's initiatives, such as trashing all western alliances including NATO. Something Trump can not do all by himself. Following World War Two the United States led the formation of NATO to protect all our Democracies and it resulted in the longest period of peace in Europe since the French Revolution. Article 5, the one for all and the all for one rule has protected our country much beyond even our own military strength. In fact, the only time Article 5 has been invoked was after 9-11 when all Member countries of NATO came to the aid of the United States. And to now see our President not re-affirm our commitment to Article 5 and to NATO can only be described as despicable and UN- American. Macron made France proud when their new Leader Trumped Trump Many Europeans as well as many Americans were heartened to see President Macron stand up to Trump in view of Trump's terrible actions and disrespect to our long time European Allies. It was good to see that Trump, the mental midget puppet of Putin, is no intellectual match for Macron. That hand-shake of Macron told Trump -I know what you and the Russians tried to do and you failed! Vive La France for the people of France, unlike the United States, won with the right choice. President Macron's hand-shake amounted to a Spring Board that propelled Macron into the consciousness of many Americans as he entered the hierarchy of true World Leaders. Trump proved, while in Europe, he is no World Leader and as long as he is president of the United States, we Americans will have to look towards our European Leaders such as Macron and Angela Merkel to take on some of America's fights such as Global Warming. The Great Melting Pot America, the great melting pot of the world. It used to be all anyone in the world had to do was to get here for freedom to ring. We were the welcoming voice to the world that inspired France to gift us with the Statue of Liberty. This writer's great grandfather arrived at Ellis Island in the belief that the streets in America were paved with gold; however, upon arrival he quickly discovered not only were the streets not paved with gold, but that they were not paved at all, and worse yet, he, along with all the other migrants at that time- were expected to pave them! And that was fine because they were here in America -the great land of opportunity that welcomes all seeking a better life. In turn they enriched our country and became the life blood of America, they made America what it is today and America can only continue-on with the life blood of today's migrants from wherever they come if freedom and a better life is what they seek. That's the America we are, for we are France, Germany, Italy, and all of Europe and Great Britain for we are it's sons and daughters. Do Not Lose Heart with AmericaAmerica is now in trouble and is in need of our Allies to not lose heart with us for we have not changed, only our president has changed, but he has not changed us. Trump, no matter how determined, will not change our country into something it has never been -and never will be! We have always been a country of open doors -he wants walls -and that'll never happen. We have always welcomed the people of the world to our shores and that's never going to change -despite Trump's small minded thinking. America has always been there for others, and the welfare of others. Trump has proven to only be interested in enriching himself and his family. Trump will eventually be gone, meanwhile it is truly sad to now read the welcoming inscription on the Statue of Liberty and to hear Trump’s continuing UN-American unwelcoming words of hostility. Trump's Days are Numbered  Trump will not be president for very long because he doesn't represent American Values and the illegal actions of his Russian involvement will eventually be proven by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller. Its only a matter of time before Trump's crimes against our country ultimately drive Trump from office. The resiliency of the American Spirit; however, will not diminish in the difficult process that will emerge, but instead will grow stronger as a result of exposing and finally freeing our country of a corrupt Trump Presidency.

13,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Political Arm Cites InfoWars In An Email Boasting About Crowd Size,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alex-jones-donald-trump-fundraising-email_us_593306d1e4b0c242ca249805,The far-right website is known for hawking conspiracy theories.,2017-06-03,InfoWars founder Alex Jones has developed a mass following with his conspiracy-laden rants.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593307182000002b00be0456.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s political arm emailed supporters on Saturday, boasting of crowds outside the White House supporting the administration’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.Team Trump’s source? InfoWars, a far-right website best known for purveying conspiracy theories about the “globalist” agenda, and which has been criticized for publishing fake news.InfoWars claimed that Trump supporters “outnumbered” those who back the Paris Agreement at the rally that was dubbed “Pittsburgh not Paris,” after a line in Trump’s speech announcing the decision.But there was no mass appeal for climate activists to rally at the White House; a demonstration there immediately after the withdrawal announcement on Thursday drew large crowds. A liberal “March for Truth” on Saturday, calling for a thorough investigation of Trump associates’ Russia ties took place on the National Mall, not in front of the White House.Later in the story Trump’s campaign linked to, InfoWars repeats its belief that the Paris accord is a “globalist” plot to “scare the world’s population into believing ‘global warming’ is too big of a threat for their country to handle alone and thus it can only be ‘defeated’ through the expansion of unelected, global bureaucracies at the expense of their nation’s sovereignty and economic power.”Of course, it is not surprising that InfoWars would exaggerate a pro-Trump rally to benefit the president, let alone leaven it with tales of a “globalist” cabal.The site was created by Austin, Texas-based talk radio host Alex Jones, who developed a mass following with his conspiracy-laden rants.Jones, a conservative libertarian, has called the terrorist acts of Sept. 11, 2001 and the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre false flag attacks aimed at enabling the government to impinge on Americans’ freedoms. He has alleged that former President Barack Obama had plans to put Americans In “FEMA camps,” implied that the federal government might be responsible for a tornado in Oklahoma in 2013, and spread the infamous Pizzagate lie that Comet Ping Pong Pizza in Washington, D.C., was the site of a pedophilia ring. (He subsequently apologized for promoting the false rumor after a gunman pleaded guilty to firing shots into Comet Ping Pong to “self-investigate” the allegations.)In addition, Jones has fingered a Jewish cabal for many of society’s ills, claiming in October that he’s “not against Jews,” just the “Jewish mafia.” In March, Jones concluded that liberal billionaire George Soros is the head of the “Jewish mafia.”Although Jones has expressed his contempt for Republican leaders in the past, Trump’s nationalism piqued his interest. Trump gave Jones unprecedented mainstream legitimacy, appearing on his show in December 2015. Jones subsequently held a rally for Trump outside the Republican National Convention in July and continues to cover the president favorably."

Since Trump’s inauguration, these party renegades have had to come to terms with the political ascension of a man hellbent on sabotaging a party and an agenda they’ve worked decades to promote. Put simply: The Never Trumpers have been better. If you’re envisioning a bunch of people in business attire swaddling themselves in bed all day, you wouldn’t be far off. “I’m emotionally unwell,” quipped Jeb Bush’s former communications director, Tim Miller, “but I’m doing my best.”“I guess there’ve been some points that haven’t been as brutal as others,” said Meghan Milloy, a co-director of Republican Women for Hillary. “It kind of fluctuates day to day based on the news cycle.” A lot of people and things aren’t faring well during the Trump presidency ― immigrants, women, Muslims, refugees, the LGBTQ community, European Union officials, workers, people with pre-existing conditions, Syrian civilians, arctic ice sheets, Sean Spicer, diplomatic protocol officers, endangered species, journalists and Seth Rich’s family, to name a few. In such an environment, one isn’t inclined to feel much sympathy for a group of GOPers estranged from their party establishment. Far worse fates can befall a person than not landing a West Wing office or being unable to nab GlaxoSmithKline as a lobbying client because that person isn’t tight with Jared Kushner. But let’s spare a moment for the Never Trump Republican, if only because it’s a significant development when so many of the biggest detractors in the ruling party are disillusioned and in disagreement over whether there is anything to be done about their predicament.  The Never Trumpers interviewed for this piece were uniformly appalled by the fire hose-like stream of White House scandals inundating the news. But they’re more despairing over the president’s abandonment of key conservative principles, along with a sense that he has blown the opportunity to advance the principles he does support.“It’s frustrating for me as a conservative,” said former Ted Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler. “We were told if we won the House and got our speaker in there that all of these wonderful things would happen and that wasn’t true.” Those “wonderful things” include efforts to overhaul the tax code, repeal Obamacare and gut Wall Street regulations ― ambitions that the Trump administration’s myriad organizational shortcomings and the investigations into Russian connections have largely sidelined. As if Trump’s own goals weren’t agonizing enough, Never Trumpers fret over the president’s ongoing rhetoric targeting longheld conservative principles. Rick Wilson, a veteran GOP consultant and pundit, took particular umbrage with the president’s proposed budget. “You can’t pretend that proposing a giant, budget-busting, fantasy math budget like they proposed is fiscal conservatism,” Wilson said, adding that he wasn’t surprised that the president abandoned “most [fiscal] conservative principles and engaged in a narcissistic daily temper tantrum.” “We’ve got a president who’s telling companies what they can and can’t do, where they can and can’t move, where their workers can and can’t go. [Conservatives] complain about the size of government all the time. To administer Trumpism, you’re going to have to wildly expand the role of government in the private sector,” he said.The president’s embrace of Russia and confrontational attitude toward NATO hasn’t exactly earned himself plaudits from this crowd, either. “In foreign policy, he’s moving in exactly the opposite direction as Ronald Reagan did,” said Liz Mair, a Republican communications consultant who has previously worked with would-be Republican presidential candidates Scott Walker, Carly Fiorina and Rick Perry.Things could’ve been different, of course. Many of these Never Trumpers were once well-positioned for White House jobs, having worked for lawmakers who went on to run in 2016, or taking part in 2016 Republican primary campaigns directly. That a bunch of people they see as utterly incompetent are now occupying these dream gigs only compounds the hurt. “The problem with this team on all levels is they haven’t done the work of putting out a communications plan to inform the country of what it is they’re trying to do,” said Tyler. “They don’t have plan. It’s just a continuous campaign.”“I can’t imagine if I were somebody who was supposed to be working on something important like policy or presenting the president’s image,” echoed Mair. “Working in communications, a lot of complaints I hear are, ‘Oh my God, their communications operations!’ and I’m like, ‘What the fuck did you people expect?’”Some members of the Never Trump movement are trying to combat the trends that led to this despair. After the November election, Meghan Milloy and her Republican Women for Hillary co-founder Jennifer Pierotti Lim rechristened the organization Republican Women for Progress. The group, according to its co-founders, seeks to restore the socially progressive, economically conservative brand of Republican once personified by Nelson Rockefeller by recruiting, training and promoting female Republican candidates. “One big problem is that there aren’t many women in leadership,” said Milloy, “and I think that’s due in large part to the fact that the GOP doesn’t have the support organizations and actions in place like EMILY’s List that specifically cater to women.” Pierotti Lim said female lawmakers in Congress have proven more willing to “chart their own course” and not walk in lockstep with the president, citing Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), among others. Republican Women for Progress aims to cultivate that approach. “I think a few Republican women have been able to walk the line of not being 100 percent supportive of the Trump administration,” Pierotti Lim said.But Milloy and Pierotti Lim’s relative optimism is in short supply. Few Never Trumpers believe there is much hope for a near-term correction of the political and demographic trends that contributed to Trump’s rapid takeover of the GOP.“From an ideological standpoint, the center of gravity is moving toward the populist right,” said Miller. “I don’t see us swinging back.” A number of Never Trumpers told HuffPost that Trump’s election prompted a sobering realization: that the largely academic brand of conservatism they support ― actively small-government and interventionist ― doesn’t sync with the beliefs and outlooks of many Republican voters.“American conservatism has become anti-liberalism,” said veteran conservative commentator Charlie Sykes. “It is united by hating the media and hating the left ― as opposed to supporting small government.” White House officials dismissed the criticism as textbook wound-licking from people whose side lost. “The President is holding his promises to the American people by growing the economy, creating jobs, protecting our boarders [sic] and ensuring that every American is safe and prospering,” a White House spokesman said in a curiously spelled statement provided to HuffPost. Republican officials in Congress also expressed frustration with the criticism, citing a need to deal with the inescapable reality of Trump’s presidency and his support among an overwhelming majority of Republicans. “We certainly appreciate their advice on Twitter,” quipped one senior GOP aide. Never Trumpers aren’t unsympathetic to the political bind in which Trump has placed his congressional colleagues. “I think they’re in a tough spot,” said Miller, who cited polling showing Republican support for the president in the high 80s. “The base of the Republican Party and the people that these Congress folk respond to ― the small-dollar donors, the people who knock on doors, the people who are engaged in the political process ― they overwhelmingly want them to support Trump and his agenda.” However many more Never Trumpers were exasperated by the relative absence of elected Republicans standing up to Trump.“I have maintained my entire political career that the Republican Party is one of the most gutless collections of individuals on the planet,” said Mair. “They are some of the most spineless individuals on the planet.”Others warned that the party will suffer political consequences for inaction. “I remain absolutely convinced that [Trump] remains unfit for office, but that does not mean that I think anyone will take steps to do anything,” said Sykes, adding that anyone who assumes otherwise “fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the current Republican Party.”“This is a party that rolled over and nominated Donald Trump despite all their doubts,” he continued. “With every passing day it becomes the defining characteristic of this party that they won’t stand up to Donald Trump and that many of them on a daily basis find ways to pretzel themselves into rationalizing his conduct.” Rick Wilson was no less blunt in his assessment. “It’s suicidal, it’s self-destructive, it’s a time bomb waiting to go off that will ruin their careers and political legacies,” he predicted. “Every one of them who comes out and talks about how they’re small-budget conservatives and want to balance budgets should be struck by lightning.” But, hey, it’s not all bad ― or at least as bad as they thought. Most praised a number of Trump’s Cabinet picks, in particular Secretary of Defense James Mattis and United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. “There are a few areas where he’s proving to be not 100 percent horrible,” said Mair. “Everybody’s got to find some bright spots in their day.” Wilson was more Zen about the situation.“When you expect the worst,” he said, “you get precisely what you expected.”"

They also called for a criminal prosecution if wrongdoing is discovered.D.C. saw the most sizable crowds starting in the morning, where protesters spelled out “Investigate Trump” on the lawn of the National Mall.In New York City, demonstrators gathered at Foley Square, where they listened to speakers including Javier Munoz of Broadway’s “Hamilton.” The crowd then marched down Broadway, chanting “Resist!” as they went.At a counter-protest outside the White House, Trump supporters gathered to show their support for the president’s recent decision to leave the Paris Agreement on climate change. Leaving the agreement is likely to have devastating effects on both the country and world.“What’s unfortunate is it’s the media that’s making the division ― and the other leftist groups ― but the reality is people do support what he’s doing,” an unidentified Trump supporter told Fox News. “And hopefully as he moves along in his agenda, people will really see his best intentions.”As if to drive the point home further that truth is needed, journalist Alejandro Alvarez spoke to two other Trump supporters at the White House, one of whom claimed that “CNN is ISIS” (they’re not).Crowds were also seen in cities including Charleston, South Carolina, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:And while a bit smaller in size, demonstrators were also found in Jackson, Tennessee."

All of the advocates are volunteers, and it’s up to an individual judge to decide whether to appoint an animal legal advocate in any given case. Advocates are able to interview witnesses and experts, write briefs and make recommendations to a judge.The legislation has been in place for six months, but the AP published an extensive report on the law Friday. Though judges have appointed advocates in five cases so far, this week was the first time that an advocate testified in court. UConn law student Taylor Hansen spoke on behalf of three pit bulls involved in a dogfighting case.The legislation is called “Desmond’s Law” in memory of a dog named Desmond who was beaten, starved and strangled to death in 2012, according to the local Hartford Courant. The defendant received accelerated rehabilitation, meaning that the conviction was expunged from his record. Proponents of the law say it can help prevent animal abusers from just getting a slap on the wrist.Rubin told the newspaper that Desmond’s Law is the first of its kind in the United States.The law appears to be part of a trend of the legal world taking animal welfare more seriously. In January, Alaska passed a law requiring judges to take the well-being of pets into consideration when ruling on divorce cases. While judges across the U.S. obviously have the ability to consider animal welfare in divorce cases — and many judges do — Alaska was the first state to pass a law requiring them to do so.And in 2016, the FBI began tracking data on animal cruelty crimes the same way it collects data on homicide, arson and assault.Law schools are also offering more courses in animal law, according to the Animal Legal Defense Fund. The animal rights group states that the number of U.S. schools offering animal law classes has grown from only nine law schools in 2000, to 151 law schools in 2015."

And they want these movies to succeed internationally, you know, so they’re going to dial back.”Fellow guest Mike Gunzelman lamented that he feels “it’s cool to hate America these days.”Baia, for his part, said his comments have been misconstrued. “Taken outta context much?” he tweeted Saturday, referencing an Entertainment Weekly article that characterized him as being “upset” with the movie (probably because he used the word “sadly.”)He maintained he was simply explaining why he believes the movie’s American patriotism was “toned down.”But in any case, criticism of Gadot’s costume as not looking “American” is a little weak.A red, blue and gold color combination is still fairly reminiscent of the American flag. Gold is often incorporated into patriotic decorations and accessories, and sometimes used in place of white.The original comic and Lynda Carter’s iconic Wonder Woman costume from the 1970s TV series both included more gold than white. Yes, Gadot’s Wonder Woman is not wearing a bottom piece adorned with little white stars, but she is wearing a top with an emblem of an eagle, which is, you know, a major symbol for the United States.Plus, the actual plot of the movie involves Wonder Woman teaming up with an American pilot to stop German forces, which makes equating it with “hating America” a bit of a stretch.Whatever. There have been worse takes on the movie."

In February, the statement continues, Moi asked for $21 million, “threatening to publicly file a lawsuit if his demand for money was not met. Earlier this month, when Chihuly had not agreed to pay him, Moi served Chihuly’s legal counsel with a state court complaint.”Chihuly Inc. asserts that it has “allowed” Moi’s claims to go public “rather than accede to Mr. Moi’s ultimatum,” characterizing the demands as “nothing more than an ugly and reprehensible display of opportunism and exploitation” motivated by a desire to disclose private information, specifically about Chihuly’s mental health, a topic of a recent Associated Press interview.Chihuly told the AP he has been dealing with bouts of depression since his 20s, and, at 75 years old, suffers from bipolar disorder. “I’m usually either up or down,” he said. “I don’t have neutral very much. When I’m up I’m usually working on several projects. A lot of times it’s about a six-month period. When I’m down, I kind of go in hibernation.”Moi’s lawsuit demands credit for joint work ― “a large volume of paintings” he says were created at Chihuly’s Boathouse in Washington, some involving blow torches and plexiglass ― as well as the revenues derived from their sale.Moi never held the position of painting assistant, the company counters, while acknowledging that Chihuly does not work alone ― he uses studio assistants to “execute his vision,” particularly his large, glass-blown sculptures that often resemble alien sea creatures or Seussian shrubbery. (A few anonymous reviewers of Chihuly Studio on Glassdoor claim to have experienced a less-than-ideal working environment.)Chihuly has been a part of court cases concerning his art before. In 2006, he sued two fellow glass-blowers, one of whom was a longtime collaborator, for copyright infringement, claiming they had purposefully mimicked his signature style. (The case against one of them, Bryan Rubino, was settled.)Chihuly’s work is currently on view in shows at the New York Botanical Garden, as well as Arkansas’ Crystal Bridges museum. It’s also included in more permanent displays in venues across the country."

But France, Germany and Italy made clear in their statement that the deal is not renegotiable. French President Emmanuel Macron said he respected Trump’s decision, but called it “a mistake, both for the U.S. and for our planet” in an English speech on Thursday evening. He even went so far as to encourage American scientists to “come and work here” in France, to support the global effort to “make our planet great again.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has clashed with Trump over NATO obligations and other transnational issues, described the U.S. pullout as “extremely regrettable.”Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon denounced May’s failure to sign the joint statement as an “appalling abdication of leadership.” Tensions between the two leaders are already high, as May has refused to grant Scotland permission to hold a second independence referendum before so-called Brexit negotiations are complete.Britain has less than two years to work out an exit deal with the European Union, after Brits voted last June to leave the bloc in a stunning referendum that led to former Prime Minister David Cameron’s resignation and May’s sudden rise to power.She has called for a snap election on June 8 to determine who will lead the talks as prime minister. But her accused weakness in dealing with Trump on the world stage could hurt her chances ahead of the vote. A Guardian poll released earlier this year revealed that half of Brits consider Trump to be “dangerous,” and 56 percent think he is untrustworthy. May also took flack earlier this year for failing to stand up to Trump. She earned the disparaging nickname “Theresa The Appeaser” in January after she seemed reluctant to speak out against Trump’s internationally condemned restrictions on U.S. immigration and refugee resettlement from several Muslim-majority nations.“The United States is responsible for the United States’ policy on refugees,” she said when asked for comment. Angry backlash ensued, and she issued a statement saying she disagreed with the ban.She echoed that sentiment Thursday morning, telling reporters, “It’s up to the president of the United States to decide what position the United States is going to take” on the climate change deal.May became the first foreign leader to visit Trump at the White House in January. The pair was photographed holding hands, and celebrated the “special relationship” between their two nations.Her election rival, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, was quick to denounce Trump’s withdrawal from the accord in a snarky tweet poking fun at his bond with May."

Richard Burr (R-NC) speaks during a committee hearing titled ""Disinformation: A Primer in Russian Active Measures and Influence Campaigns"" at the U.S. Capitol on March 30, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5931ace32000003c00be0253.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has begun returning to Congress copies of a voluminous 2014 report describing the CIA’s harsh detention and interrogation programs, U.S. officials said on Friday.The Trump administration’s move means it could be more difficult for the full, 6,700-page report to be made public, because documents held by Congress are exempt from laws requiring government records to eventually be made public.The White House made the move in response to requests by Sen. Richard Burr, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s current Republican chairman, officials said.In a statement emailed to Reuters, Burr said: “I have directed my staff to retrieve copies of the Congressional study that remain with the Executive Branch agencies and, as the Committee does with all classified and compartmented information, will enact the necessary measures to protect the sensitive sources and methods contained within the report.”Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat who chaired the committee when the report was produced, had asked that it be distributed to multiple executive branch agencies, a move designed to make it eventually releasable to the public under the Freedom of Information Act law.Feinstein said in a statement that she was “concerned and disappointed” that Burr requested that the document be returned, calling it a departure from the committee’s normal bipartisan nature.“No senator, chairman or not, has the authority to erase history. I believe that is the intent of the chairman in this case,” she said.Sen Mark Warner, who succeeded Feinstein as the committee’s top Democrat, said in a Twitter post he was “disappointed” with Burr’s decision, and that the report “must be preserved so we can learn from past mistakes & ensure that abuses are never repeated.”A declassified executive summary of the report was made public in December 2014. It concluded that the CIA’s interrogation programs, using techniques such as waterboarding that most observers consider torture, were more brutal and less effective than the CIA had told policymakers.The report said that not a single terrorist attack was foiled as a result of the use of harsh interrogation techniques.The American Civil Liberties Union had filed litigation to have the full report released. But U.S. courts ruled that because the document was created by Congress, it was exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.At least one copy of the report, however, will not be returned to the committee. That’s because a copy has been preserved in former President Barack Obama’s presidential archive, according to a Dec. 9, 2016 letter written to Feinstein by Obama’s top White House lawyer at the time, W. Neil Eggleston.The CIA declined to comment. Burr’s move was first reported by the New York Times.(Reporting by Mark Hosenball and Jonathan Landay; Writing by Warren Strobel; Editing by Bernadette Baum)"

It’s OK to take it out on other people, verbally or physically, as we saw during the campaign,” she said. “That is incredibly dangerous. That is unleashing a level of vitriol and defensiveness, hatred, that I don’t think we should tolerate.”Clinton, who was at BookExpo to promote an upcoming memoir, drew several chilling comparisons from her experiences as secretary of state, as a senator and as first lady to make her point. “I will tell you, it doesn’t take much to rip off the politeness and the accommodation that really keeps diverse peoples working and living together. You saw it in Bosnia .... You saw it in Rwanda. I’ve seen it in many other places, where political leaders, for their own purposes, their own power, greed, ideology, religion, whatever it might be, really light those flames.”In response to reported outbreaks of hate speech and violence, as well as deepening partisan divides, Clinton urged Americans to vote and get involved.“I am hopeful, but I really think hope needs to be linked to a strategy for dealing with what we are facing,” she told the audience. “Some of it is very personal acts. [Kindness] is a much-overlooked attribute these days. Showing kindness, showing support for one another.”"
22,POLITICS,Trump Keeps Citing A Paris Agreement Study That Seriously Misses The Point,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-heritage-study-paris-agreement_us_5930579ee4b07572bdbfd318,He also cites it wrong because that's our president.,2017-06-02,President Donald Trump claims this is how little global temperatures would drop if the whole world reduced carbon emissions.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5930a04a230000570e3485e3.jpeg?cache=stwy38yJ06&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump cited some scary numbers on Thursday to show how bad he thinks the Paris Agreement would be for Americans ― and thus why he’s pulling the U.S. out.But the findings that Trump, members of his administration and conservative media outlets have seized upon to justify exiting the climate deal tend to come from a few outlier studies. One in particular, a 2016 Heritage Foundation report on the Paris Agreement, has drawn criticism from economic and environmental experts for its misleading conclusions.Trump pulled a very eye-catching number from the Heritage study on Thursday. The foundation pointed out that if the U.S. eliminated all its carbon dioxide emissions, the resulting reduction in global temperatures would be less than two-tenths of a degree Celsius by the year 2100.But the Paris Agreement doesn’t involve the United States alone, as the World Resources Institute pointed out in March. It is a worldwide pact among 195 countries at all levels of development.“This claim by Heritage ignores 194 of these countries,” the institute wrote in evaluating the Heritage study. “No one has suggested that the United States acting alone (or industrialized nations alone, which Heritage also mentions) would shift the direction of global temperatures.”If all industrialized nations ended their carbon dioxide emissions, the Heritage study estimated that global temperatures would drop by about four-tenths of a degree Celsius.The Heritage Foundation played a key role in shaping Trump’s transition team, according to Politico, and has long had close ties to Republican presidents. Watchdog groups say it receives significant funding from the Koch brothers and Exxon Mobil, the latter of which actually wanted the U.S. to stay in the Paris accord.In his speech Thursday, Trump also managed to cite the misleading two-tenths figure incorrectly. He claimed it was the expected reduction in temperature if all participating countries ― not just the United States ― held up their ends of the agreement. Never mind that the Paris Agreement isn’t even intended to lower global temperatures. It aims to prevent temperatures from rising by 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say might stop the most destructive and irreversible effects of climate change.In another deceiving use of numbers, the Heritage study said the Paris Agreement would lower U.S. gross domestic product by a total of $2.5 trillion over the next 20 years. (Trump cited this one wrong too, albeit during an April rally when he said it would take only 10 years.) FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, went after this claim in May. Resource economist Roberton Williams explained that while the bottom-line estimate is reasonable, it is “expressed in a misleading way.”Per FactCheck.org:The standard, he said, is to express lost GDP as a percentage of total GDP. So the foundation’s total amount — $2.5 trillion in lost GDP by 2035 — would be equivalent to a 0.55 percent decrease on average in the total GDP per year, he calculated. Williams also emphasized that the annual 0.55 percent reduction in total GDP is not to be confused with a 0.55 percent drop in the real GDP growth rate, which was 1.6 percent in 2016. The total U.S. GDP was $18.6 trillion in 2016.As the World Resources Institute also pointed out, $2.5 trillion is a “tiny sliver” of the U.S. GDP over 20 years ― especially for an investment in the planet’s future, which extends far beyond the next two decades. Equally important, both Trump and the Heritage study disregard what so many other reports have found: Investing money in renewable energy and implementing carbon taxes will ultimately save money. In recent years, at least 35 countries, including the United States, have upped their GDP while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions, according to the Brookings Institute. Between 2000 and 2014, more than 30 U.S. states did the same. While coal industry jobs are not coming back, the Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates that wind turbine service technician will be the fastest growing career between now and 2024, and that the number of jobs in the solar industry is growing 17 times faster than the U.S. economy as a whole. The costs of sitting on our hands and letting climate change continue its course are uncountable. "
23,POLITICS,De Blasio Under Fire For Plan To Keep Some Immigrants Out Of Legal Aid Program,Roque Planas and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/de-blasio-under-fire-for-restricting-immigrants-access-to-lawyers_us_59318c3ce4b02478cb9af54b,New York City's mayor says he's prioritizing. Immigrant rights groups say this looks more like discrimination.,2017-06-02,New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks regarding the U.S. President Donald Trump's federal budget proposal at the City Hall in New York on March 16.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59318c9c230000570e348781.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the last three years, New York City has footed the bill for lawyers to defend certain immigrants facing deportation under a unique program that other cities have begun to emulate. But as the June 30 deadline to finalize the city’s budget approaches, Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) is pressing the city to keep some immigrants out of the program based on their criminal histories. The debate pits de Blasio, who has positioned himself as one of the country’s leading progressive politicians, against Democrats on the city council, immigrant rights advocates and legal assistance groups who say the mayor is injecting a new form of discrimination into a successful program that primarily helps detained immigrants. De Blasio’s critics say the city’s legal aid is all the more important under the Trump administration. Since President Donald Trump took office, the number of immigration arrests has risen by nearly 40 percent compared to the same time period last year.“The ability to provide due process and an attorney to everybody going through deportation proceedings is the right thing to do,” Luis Mancheno, an immigration lawyer at the Cardozo School of Law, told HuffPost. “For years I have been able to talk to family members … and to tell them that if your family is locked up facing deportation proceedings, New York City has your back and will help defend the case. That’s a promise I could not make if these restrictions went into effect.”More than half of the city council ― including Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito (D) ― opposes de Blasio’s proposed changes as well. “We are concerned that the exclusion you propose will not only undermine our city’s commitment to due process for all but will also perpetuate the failures and racial disparities that pervade our criminal justice system,” 27 council members wrote to de Blasio this week, according to the New York Times. Under U.S. law, immigrants facing deportation may seek a lawyer in civil court, but don’t have the right to have one provided at no cost, like they do in criminal court. This applies to everyone ― even children and the mentally handicapped. But under the New York Immigrant Family Unity Program, which has been fully operational for the last three years, the city itself pays to provide lawyers to immigrants in detention who can’t afford them. The program does not currently make distinctions about which immigrants can access a lawyer. Thus far, it has helped nearly 2,500 people, according to organizers. Both de Blasio and the Democrat-led city council have already agreed to keep funding the program. The current draft of the city budget boosts funding for the program by 50 percent to $16 million, and the state government bolstered it with an addition $4 million that will go toward assisting people detained in upstate New York.But that money isn’t enough to provide a lawyer to everyone. And with the number of deportation cases jumping, the de Blasio administration says it should prioritize the cases the city chooses to defend ― which would mean no longer providing representation to everyone in detention who needs it, as the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project currently does. Under de Blasio’s proposal, anyone convicted of a list of some 170 crimes in the last five years wouldn’t qualify for representation. The list is the same one that New York City created in 2014 to determine which immigrants it will hold on behalf of ICE when the agency issues “detainer” requests. “The increase in defense funding is based not just on deportation, but on the increase of people with low-level criminal offenses or no criminal histories,” Nisha Agarwal, New York City’s commissioner of Immigrant Affairs, told HuffPost. “That’s a very scary trend for us and so we’re really prioritizing.” Agarwal described the limits on access to the program as justified by the fact that New York City’s legal defense fund for immigrants is likely the largest in the country. In addition to the $16 million for NYIFUP, the budget draft includes a similar amount of money for other immigrant legal services. New York City’s legal aid program offered a unique response to the outcry among advocates that immigrants who could not afford attorneys faced the near-certainty of deportation. A 2011 study by legal experts found that only 3 percent of detained immigrants who fought their cases without a lawyer managed to avoid deportation. By contrast, 18 percent of those detained and represented had successful cases. Nearly three-quarters of people who fought their cases from outside detention with an attorney were allowed to remain in the country. Attorneys who work with the NYIFUP don’t expect everyone they assist to avoid deportation, but believe their role is important because detained immigrants are particularly vulnerable. Their cases can move quickly and it’s difficult to find or pay for representation while locked up. The program helps detained immigrants identify whether they have a case for staying ― many don’t, based on their convictions or immigration history ― and ensures that people who do have a claim for relief don’t fall through the cracks, advocates argue. “When we do identify that someone might be able to stay here, it’s because they fall into one of these categories of people where it seems that they’re among the most dire cases and categories of people that we should be providing representation for,” said Jennifer Friedman, managing director of the immigration practice at The Bronx Defenders, which works on the NYIFUP program. The two most common categories that win relief from detention are those who fear torture or death in their native countries and those who have a claim to U.S. citizenship, she said. In some instances, people represented under the NYIFUP escaped deportation because they were U.S. citizens who had been arrested by mistake, according to Mancheno. “People who could be excluded under the mayor’s plans could be U.S. citizens, and will be deported,” Mancheno said. “Think about how unfair that is.”Denying access to certain people is particularly concerning given the current political climate, with undocumented immigrants at greater threat of being caught up in deportation proceedings, some attorneys argue. On Thursday, the New York City Bar Association wrote to de Blasio urging the city “not to deny access to counsel to anyone based upon past convictions or criminal charges.” “Denying counsel to some individuals based on their criminal record, or where they lived before being detained, will gut New York’s model universal representation system for immigrants,” bar association president John Kiernan wrote. “In this time of unprecedented hostility to immigrants from the federal government, New York should be expanding access to counsel, not contracting a successful and groundbreaking representation program.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Luis Mancheno’s employment affiliation. He is an immigration lawyer at the Cardozo School of Law."

But the early endorsement reflects the heightened interest in the 45th District race, one of several Southern California contests in which Democrats are lining up to challenge incumbent Republicans. “We need leaders on Capitol Hill who aren’t afraid to stand up to Trump associates, big banks, and entrenched special interests who wield tremendous power over the White House, the Trump family, and a Republican-controlled Congress,” EMILY’s List President Stephanie Schriock said in a statement. “As California’s financial watchdog in a historic mortgage settlement, Katie held bad actors accountable and won billions in relief for California homeowners.” “We can and will take back the House of Representatives ― starting by flipping seats from Republicans like Mimi Walters who allow abuses of power to go unchecked,” Schriock said.Porter, who teaches law at the University of California, Irvine, and who also has the backing of Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), announced she would challenge Walters in April. Dave Min, who’s also a UCI law professor, and former congressional aide Kia Hamadanchy are running for Walters’ seat, too. “I’m honored to have the support of EMILY’s List,” Porter said. “The stakes in this race against Congresswoman Mimi Walters couldn’t be higher, and their endorsement is proof that the eyes of the nation are on this race.” Walters, who has served in the House since 2015, represents a portion of Orange County, long a conservative stronghold in mostly-blue California. Democratic operatives are eyeing the region as prime for House seat pickups, in part because the county sided with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over Republican Donald Trump in last year’s election, marking the first time the county went blue since 1936.The 45th District is one of seven California districts that Democrats are hoping to flip next fall. GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, who represents parts of Orange and San Diego counties, already has two Democratic challengers. Four Democrats are looking to take on Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, and six are eyeing a challenge to Rep. Duncan Hunter. Those races are largely seen as a referendum on Trump and his presidential policies. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has even moved top staffers to the area to focus on those races. “Democrats are on offense across the map — including in districts that have not seen a serious challenge in a long time, if ever — and many of those targeted seats are in California,” said DCCC chairman Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.). EMILY’s List has also endorsed senators up for re-election in 2018 and expressed early support for Michelle Lujan Grisham in the New Mexico gubernatorial race."

(The United States is the second-biggest emitter.)In January, the country’s National Energy Administration announced it would invest more than $360 billion in renewable energy projects through 2020, as it cancelled plans to build more than 100 new coal plants. In recent years, coal consumption in China has declined to a point that researchers say the country may reach an emissions peak in 2025, before its self-imposed deadline of 2030.Shortly before Trump’s inauguration January, Xi reaffirmed his country’s pledge to abide by the Paris agreement, calling it “a milestone in the history of climate governance” that would proceed regardless of American involvement.Last month, as the U.S. planned to pull back on any financial commitments made in the name of climate change, China pledged to spend about $900 billion on infrastructure abroad ― including clean energy projects and science coalitions. The Obama administration had previously promised $3 billion to help poor nations adapt to climate change and meet their own emissions targets.“All parties should work together to implement the Paris agreement,” Xi said in an address to the United Nations in January. “China will continue to take steps to tackle climate change and fully honor its obligations.”Chinese Premier Li Keqiang echoed those calls just hours after Trump’s Thursday address in the White House’s Rose Garden, saying “China will stand by its responsibilities on climate change.Samantha Gross, a climate and foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, said no matter who takes over leadership in the climate fight, it’ll be “nothing but good.” Trump’s decision, however, will cast America as an “international pariah” unlike any other.“The problem isn’t really the Chinese moving forward, it’s the U.S. stepping back,” she said. “We’re opening up a space by abdicating our responsibility.”And China seems keen to pick up that mantle.“Politically, Beijing sees this as a gift-wrapped opportunity to position itself as a responsible global leader at the expense of the United States,” Andrew Small, a China expert at the German Marshall Fund think tank, told HuffPost. “For countries that see climate change as an existential issue ― not least the European leaders who are meeting the Chinese PM for their summit this week ― closer cooperation with China now becomes a necessity.”The East Asian power house is already working on a new global pact with the European Union to address climate change that will include efforts to develop green technology, a fund to help poor nations adapt to low carbon energy and their own commitments to cut back on emissions. “No one should be left behind, but the EU and China have decided to move forward,” Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU’s climate commissioner told the Guardian. “Our successful cooperation on issues like emissions trading and clean technologies are bearing fruit. Now is the time to further strengthen these ties to keep the wheels turning for ambitious global climate action.”Greenpeace’s Morgan said the move represents a silver lining to Thursday’s news, which she characterized as a “colossal mistake” by the president.“What I’m seeing emerge is a new form of shared leadership,” she said. “You have this new formed coalition of new players all going in the same direction. That’s the future. Trump can’t stop that.”"

She graduated last month.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59319dbd2100002b00aa2057.jpeg?cache=1LOlCRnOxg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PORTLAND, Ore. ― The evening before he became a national hero, Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche hung out with his girlfriend, Ellie Lawrence.It was Thursday, and she went over to his new house, which 23-year-old Namkai-Meche had saved up to buy the month before. They did some light garden work, and she remembers he was looking especially handsome.They had big plans for the garden. He just wanted it to look beautiful. She was going to have her own little corner, where maybe she’d grow some herbs. They both wanted to plant a bleeding heart bush, where pink, heart-shaped flowers would bloom one day.They went inside and cooked dinner, something they were trying to do more often, and their friend George came over. Namkai-Meche and George went off to play futsal for their team, the Tardigrades. They lost that night, but Namkai-Meche just loved to play. When he returned home, Lawrence was there watching TV. They liked real estate shows the best, like “House Hunters,” and nature shows, too. In the morning, she’d never have guessed it would be the last time she’d see him. “He kissed me goodbye and said thank you,” Lawrence remembers.“And I said, ‘For what?’ and he said, ‘Thank you for coming over,’ and I said, ‘Well, thank you for having me,’” she recalled, her voice trailing off. “And yeah, that’s it.”Lawrence, 22, talked exclusively to HuffPost this week at a rooftop bar in Portland, just down the road from Reed College, where Namkai-Meche had studied economics and where she’d studied French, and where an American flag now hangs at half-staff. They had so many plans. She had just graduated from college. He had the new house and a job he loved. The world felt wide open. They were looking forward to the coming Saturday, when they had tickets for a matchup between the professional women’s soccer teams the Portland Thorns and the Boston Breakers. He was from Oregon and she’s from Massachusetts, and it was fun to cheer against each other.That Sunday, he’d planned his first BBQ at the new house, a place she said was his pride and joy, where he’d done the construction work himself to turn it into a five-bedroom so a bunch of his friends could live there together. It was a place where he wanted to build something special. A community.And later this summer, they were supposed to go hiking at Punch Bowl Falls, where Eagle Creek spills down lush green cliffs into a deep pool on its way to the Columbia River.But hours after he and Lawrence said goodbye, Namkai-Meche was riding the MAX train home when he and two other men stepped up to defend a black teenager and her Muslim friend from a white supremacist’s bigoted, anti-Muslim threats. The man slashed the three men in the throats with a knife. Namkai-Meche and Ricky Best, 53, died. Micah Fletcher, 21, survived.Lawrence said there were always little glimpses of Namkai-Meche’s capacity for heroics and selflessness. “One night, we were walking in the park, and this man said he needed shelter, and Taliesin let this guy stay at his house,” she said. “He was trusting and he was kind and he was going to step in if he saw something wrong.” He was given to romantic gestures, too. Once he drove through a snowstorm to retrieve lipstick she’d left at a restaurant. He didn’t tell her he was going and she hadn’t asked him to go. He just went because it was an outrageously nice thing to do. Another time, on Valentine’s Day, she returned to her dorm room to find a bouquet of flowers waiting outside her door. “This might be borderline too cheesy,” Lawrence told HuffPost, “but one time he asked me why I loved him, and I said I loved him because he was kind and generous and ambitious and he had good morals and he was directed and excited about life.” “And his response was that those were all the things he was trying to be in his life.” On the train last Friday, a woman came to Namkei-Meche’s aid as he was dying. She later recalled the young man’s last goodbye.“Tell everyone on this train I love them,” he had said.America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story."

Those observing Ramadan typically break their fast with an evening meal called an iftar, surrounded by friends and family.“In the spirit of Ramadan and following the tradition of Muslim communities around the world, we came together tonight as New Yorkers to break bread and build community with people from all faiths and backgrounds, “ said Mohammad Khan, Campaign Director of MPower Change, in a statement. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently declined a request to host an iftar at the White House to mark Ramadan, breaking with a bipartisan tradition that’s been in place with few exceptions for nearly 20 years.Anu Joshi, deputy director of the New York State Immigrant Action Fund, said Thursday’s iftar aimed to demonstrate that “New Yorkers of all stripes and faiths... reject President Trump’s many attempts to sow fear and division among our communities.”“We stand resolute in our opposition to the policies, rhetoric, and actions by this Administration that seek to vilify and otherize the Muslim community, whether in the United States or abroad,” he said in a statement."

He then read aloud a passage in which Stephens understated the findings of a 2014 United Nations climate report, a mischaracterization that forced the Times to append the article with a correction. “What the American people deserve is a debate ― objective, transparent discussion ― about this issue,” Pruitt said.“Global warming is occurring, human activity contributes to it in some manner,” Pruitt said, staking out an argument frequently employed by what The New Republic describes as the “kinder, gentler climate-change deniers.” “Measuring with precision, in my perspective, the degree of human contribution is very challenging.” The nation’s top environmental rulemaker, who is credited with convincing President Donald Trump to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, repeatedly refused to say whether the commander-in-chief believes in the widely accepted science that emissions from burning fossil fuel, deforestation and industrial farming are warming the planet. White House press secretary Sean Spicer was equally cagey, telling reporters who asked him Friday about the president’s beliefs, “I have not had the opportunity to have that discussion.” On Tuesday, Spicer also dodged questions on what the president thinks about climate change. “Honestly, I haven’t asked him,” he said. “I can get back to you. I don’t know. I honestly haven’t asked him that specific question.”Typically, White House press secretaries don’t tell reporters they’ll come back with an answer unless they really plan to, knowing that the reporter who asked the question will bring up their pledge again a few days later.Countries around the world, including most major U.S. allies, condemned Trump’s decision to pull out of the historic accord to cut planet-warming emissions. Democrats, environmentalists and top executives from big corporations also voiced their concern.Pruitt also spoke in the White House Rose Garden Thursday after Trump announced his plan to withdraw from the pact. The EPA administrator’s comments were clearly directed at Trump, who was standing a few feet away and apparently enjoying the lavish praise. In his two-minute speech, Pruitt said “you” 21 times, but “Paris” just three.On Friday, Pruitt called the decision a “courageous” and “informed, thoughtful decision,” insisting the U.S. has “nothing to be apologetic for.”“Paris, truly, Paris at its core was a bunch of words committed to very, very minimal environmental benefits,” he said, but added that the U.S. was willing to rejoin the agreement under renegotiated terms. Other countries have said they have no plans to reopen negotiations. Pruitt fueled doubt that the administration is genuinely open to re-entering a global climate pact, saying any deal to cut U.S. emissions would require consent from the Senate. But he said the White House would circumvent Congress in any deal that allowed the U.S. to export technology for coal mining or hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the controversial method for extracting natural gas."

Hundreds of people would soon join her in flooding Lafayette Park, right next to the White House, to protest Trump’s Thursday announcement. But for the moment, it was just Schragis and her clock. She propped it up so it was facing the park, its screaming message easy for passersby to read: “WAKE UP to the climate crisis.”“We made this clock … so it’s clear, wherever we go when we’re protesting, what we’re asking Trump to do and what we think is necessary,” said Schragis, who is also an organizer with the People’s Climate Movement, a coalition of groups focused on the climate crisis. “This is a movement of mass agreement. A majority of this country is with us, is standing with the world. But Trump listens to a very small number of people with big checkbooks.”Chalk it up to gorgeous weather, or Trump hitting an unexpectedly raw nerve by backing out of a global climate pact, but even for a D.C. protest this group was on fire. They set up a makeshift stage in the park and cheered on speeches by activists, politicians and Bill Nye “The Science Guy,” who warned that Trump is “jeopardizing the whole planet.” They chanted “shame” at the White House, with Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez chiming in with them from the stage. Everyone seemed to have a sign, too, with messages like “I’m With (Mot)Her Earth” and “Trump’s Dad Should Have Pulled Out.”“Mr. President, are you serious?” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said to the crowd. “We’re moving forward without Donald Trump!”Schragis said many of the people there had taken part in the Women’s March in January and subsequent D.C. marches in support of science and combatting climate change. At this point, she said, people horrified by Trump on one front are uniting with each other on other fronts.“I think we’re all in a moment of despair. On anything,” she shouted, trying to talk over a nearby man painted head-to-toe in silver and blasting a Neil Young song from a boombox. “A lot of these movements are coming together.”As luck would have it, an eighth-grade class on a field trip from Chicago showed up to see the White House just as the climate rally began. It’s an annual trip for the students at Francis Parker School, a private school with progressive leanings. Kam Woodard, an eighth-grade math teacher there, said teachers told the kids this time that, if they wanted to make signs to voice their feeling on an issue, they could do so. So many of the roughly 75 students made signs about women’s rights, environmental rights and human rights in general.“Everybody just made a sign, about what they felt,” said Woodard, who said it was “miraculous” that they happened to roll up in the midst of a protest.The students fit right in. They arguably had the best chants of anyone there, which they made up on the spot.“Show me what our generation looks like!

35,POLITICS,Toxic Algal Blooms Are A Growing Threat. Trump’s Budget Cuts Won't Help.,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/algal-blooms-epa-budget-cuts_us_593077b3e4b0c8b8c430a401,Proposed cuts to a number of federal programs would make efforts to fight toxic algal blooms more difficult.,2017-06-02,"A bird swims through green algae near Ferril Lake in Denver, Colorado. Algal blooms, when toxic, can devastate local economies and the problem appears to be growing.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593078bd2300003b0034853a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been a disturbing scene on a number of southern California beaches of late.In recent weeks, hundreds of dead and sick seabirds, sea lions and other marine mammals have been washing up on the beaches in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.The cause of the die-off is believed to be domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by a massive algal bloom that has formed in waters just off the coast.While algal blooms themselves aren’t unusual for the region, the current situation is so extreme it was described by one expert as the “worst year” for domoic poisonings he’d ever seen.The broader problem isn’t limited to the California coastline. Last summer, toxic algal blooms sprang up in more than 20 U.S. states, including South Florida, where the situation became so serious that authorities declared a state of emergency. The main contributing factor to these blooms’ growth is nutrient runoff from both agricultural and residential lands. Though blooms across the country are made up of different types of cyanobacteria — also known as blue-green algae — the nutrients that feed them — namely phosphorous and nitrates — are the same. And experts believe blooms are becoming both more frequent and more intense due to climate change. The blooms impact both local economies and public health to the tune of a conservatively-estimated $84 million annual price tag. In humans, algal blooms are known to cause rashes, stomach or liver issues and respiratory problems if ingested, swam in or even breathed in through mist. The conditions are ripe for 2017 to see a similar number of the toxic blooms as last year. Pat Glibert, an environmental science professor at the University of Maryland, said the challenges contributing to the growing spread of the blooms are “only increasing.” The conditions are ripe for 2017 to see a similar number of the toxic blooms as last year.“I expect that we will have quite a number of blooms across the country, both in fresh waters and marine systems,” Glibert told HuffPost. “They will impact fisheries and they will impact jobs, so we need to be continuing to respond to these events.”And the blooms appear to be showing up earlier in the year, too. Back in California, Beverly Anderson-Abbs, a senior environmental scientist at the State Water Resources Control Board, said the agency has already seen 24 bloom events in freshwater bodies reported across the state so far this year.Because their portal that tracks the blooms was not up and running at this time last year, Anderson-Abbs said she couldn’t say for sure whether that marks a definite increase over the previous year, but that number is not typical. “We certainly weren’t getting contacts from the various regions having problems that early in the year [last year],” Anderson-Abbs said. “Some lakes tend to bloom early, but we’re hearing about lakes that we hadn’t heard of previously that were in full bloom.”Close monitoring and more research can help determine which approaches to controlling the notoriously unpredictable blooms, or potentially preventing them altogether, are needed.Of course, that work doesn’t happen for free and a number of federal programs have supported both the monitoring of blooms and efforts to reduce bloom-feeding nutrient runoff have been slated for funding cuts under President Donald Trump’s spending plans.According to analyses of the president’s so-called skinny budget proposal, released earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency’s Great Lakes Restoration Initiative would face a 97-percent, $290-million funding cut.The Great Lakes program helps fund projects like one that is aiming to reduce phosphorous levels in Lake Erie, where blooms became so massive and so toxic in 2014 that they impacted the water supply of more than 400,000 people in Toledo, Ohio, leaving them without drinking water for several days.Other geographically-specific EPA initiatives that earmark funding for bodies of water that have struggled with toxic algal blooms in recent years, like the Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay programs, are slated to be essentially eliminated under the president’s skinny budget. Similarly, as Mother Jones previously reported, programs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that similarly address algal blooms, like the NOAA’s Sea Grant College Program and satellite work, are also facing the prospect of funding reductions or outright elimination — cuts that were maintained in the administration’s latest budget document released last month. Mae Wu, senior attorney of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s health program, said it is hard to see a scenario where the funding gap left behind by these cuts is filled by the states.“Rolling back the funding on this is not going to improve our algal bloom situation,” Wu said. “States need more assistance to do this work, not less.”Of course, the president’s budget is only a proposal and it is up to Congress to ultimately set the nation’s spending priorities.There appears to be some bipartisan sentiment for increased federal funding for algal bloom programs, too, particularly for lawmakers representing districts who have been most severely impacted by toxic blooms.In Florida, both Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, and U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, a Republican, have proposed legislation aimed at addressing algal blooms. Nelson’s bill proposes additional funding for research into bloom control, while Mast’s bill calls for blooms to be added to the list of disasters that the Federal Emergency Management Agency can respond to.Glibert is hopeful for similarly bipartisan support for broader algal bloom efforts currently waiting to be appropriated for funding, such as the efforts laid out in the federal Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act, which was reauthorized in 2014. The alternative scenario is not pretty. “We know there are more blooms occurring, so these budget cuts are devastating on multiple levels,” Glibert told HuffPost. “The economic effects of these blooms are enormous.”"

The hearings could add to problems facing the president over probes into alleged Russian meddling in last year’s U.S. election and potential collusion by his campaign.In an interview with ABC News, Conway appeared to indicate that the president would allow Comey to testify, saying, “We’ll be watching with the rest of the world when Director Comey testifies.”But asked directly whether Trump would use executive privilege to prevent Comey from speaking with lawmakers, Conway added: “The president will make that decision.”Legal experts say Trump could invoke a doctrine called executive privilege to try to stop Comey from testifying. But such a maneuver would likely draw a backlash and could be challenged in court, they said.Trump fired Comey on May 9, prompting a political firestorm and accusations by critics that he was improperly seeking to hinder an FBI probe into Russia’s role in the election and potential collusion by Trump’s campaign.Comey is expected to be asked by the Senate panel about conversations in which the president is reported to have pressured him to drop a related FBI investigation into Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, whose ties to Russia are under scrutiny.The Justice Department and several U.S. congressional committees are investigating the Russia matter.The Russian government has denied U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that it sought to influence the election in Trump’s favor, but Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that some Russian individuals may have acted on their own.Trump, who has raised doubts about the U.S. agencies’ findings, has denied any collusion.(Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Frances Kerry)"

On Thursday, Trump announced the U.S. will withdraw from the climate change agreement nearly 190 countries joined in Paris in 2015, making America one of only three nations to ignore the pact. The unprecedented agreement ― a pillar of former President Barack Obama’s legacy ― between both rich and poor countries put the globe on a path to keep warming “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. But Trump’s decision to take the U.S. out of the agreement, effectively retreating from the global conversation on how to combat climate change, may end up hurting Republicans politically. Democrats and environmental groups are already chomping at the bit.“WE ARE NOT DETERRED, CLIMATE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020,” read an email sent out by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) as Trump stood in the White House Rose Garden announcing his decision.Trump had barely started his speech when Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) sent out his own statement, which included a rare plea.“If you haven’t joined an environmental group, join one. If your voice needs to be heard, get active,” Whitehouse said. “If you are a big corporation with good climate policies that has shied away from engaging politically, it’s time to engage. And if you’re a university that teaches climate science, it’s time to stand up for your scientists. Whoever you are, help end climate denial and take action.”But even with the ammunition that a Trump presidency has provided Democrats ― who are hoping to make inroads against the Republican majority in both chambers of Congress in 2018 and 2020 ― green groups and the Democratic Party will have to learn from prior mistakes. For one, the talking points on climate change and the Paris accord during an election cycle can’t be about simply saving the planet or keeping streams clean. They have to make a strong connection between climate change and jobs; climate change and asthma; climate change and future generations.Jamie Henn of the climate action group 350.org thinks they can do it. But he also acknowledged it will be a challenge to address the rift in the Democratic Party over how to turn out voters, prevent a repeat of 2016, and make a wedge issue out of a somewhat abstract problem like human activity contributing to the destruction of the planet.“What was missing from Democrats in the last election was making this lofty rhetoric about a beautiful future feel like an economic plan that addresses people’s concerns,” Henn said. 350.org was critical in leading the climate movement’s battles against Keystone XL, fracking in natural gas production, and the Dakota Access pipeline. The ability of environmental organizations like 350, Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters to make the “fossil fuel industry feel real to people,” as Henn put it, somehow gets lost when those groups try to make the jump to climate change and the Paris climate agreement. Henn said it doesn’t help that the political arms of the Democratic Party, from the Democratic National Committee to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, have struggled to develop strong messaging on the topic.“Tom Perez is not out there touring renewable energy facilities and saying how this will help the Rust Belt,” Henn said of the newly elected chair of the DNC. “There’s a difference between adopting talking points and making it a fully fledged effort to have [climate change] as a cornerstone of campaigns.”For 350 it’s about making climate change tangible and “feel real” to voters. For billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, who founded NextGen Climate ahead of the 2014 midterms, it’s about convincing voters ― especially young ones ― that their vote matters.Since 2014, Steyer has thrown his money at congressional candidates who will aggressively champion climate change policies. He also funded numerous ads focused on clean energy and global warming during presidential debates in 2016, and ultimately backed the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Looking back, Steyer admitted that NextGen has had difficulty fulfilling its pledge to make climate change a deciding factor in races that last two election cycles. “We just weren’t big enough,” Steyer told HuffPost. And now things are different, according to Steyer. Because of Trump, voters have to worry about things they didn’t think about before.“We’ve never seen people this upset because they’ve never seen their rights and privileges attacked the way they’re being attacked right now by their president,” Steyer said. Green groups may not have been able to convince voters before that they should care about climate change, but Steyer seems convinced that in 2018 and 2020, voters will know they can’t stay home. “We’re seeing it in terms of civic engagement right now,” Steyer said. “And I think we’ll see it in terms of participation in elections because I think that people are understanding, ‘Oh my gosh I never thought that XYZ would be under attack.’ Can you imagine we have to march for the idea of science?”But how do green groups and Democrats make the connection that Trump’s decision to take the U.S. out of the Paris agreement means they should vote against their Republican senator or House member? The fact that midterm elections tend to be a referendum on any sitting president helps. “You don’t even have to make that connection,” Steyer said. “[Republicans] have his back and they’re one big group pushing all his policies.”Tiernan Sittenfeld of the League of Conservation Voters ― which spent a record $45 million in 2016 ― pushed back against the idea that climate change doesn’t play well with voters, and issued warnings to the GOP. “Any Republican members of Congress who stand with Trump do so at their peril,” she said, adding that the public understands Trump’s decision to pull out of the climate change pact is “bad for public health, bad for the environment, bad for the U.S.’s standing in the world, and cedes the clean energy economy to China and others.” But in case voters have trouble making the connection, the DCCC started to make it for them on Thursday. In an email blasted out just hours after Trump’s announcement, the DCCC targeted Rep. Carlos Cuerbelo (R-Fla.), who’s up for re-election in 2018. Curbelo is a supporter of policies aimed at fighting climate change, and he urged Trump to stay in the Paris agreement. Curbelo and 19 other House Republicans are members of a bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, but their small numbers make it nearly impossible to get any policy related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions or boosting renewable energy through the chamber. “Trump’s decision today is a big political problem” for the 20 Republicans in the Climate Solutions Caucus, one DCCC aide said. “They are now stuck between their party and their district.”And beyond that caucus, the DCCC is eyeing 16 other districts held by Republicans that Clinton won and where climate change will likely be of concern. “Families in south Florida deserve more than the empty rhetoric they’re getting from Carlos Curbelo,” DCCC spokesperson Cole Leiter said in a statement. “They need a Representative who will protect coastal communities, local economies, and help create jobs in the American clean energy sector.”In the end, Trump’s move to withdraw from the Paris accord may have given the environmentalists exactly what they needed to help Democrats regain power.“This makes battle lines really clear,” Henn said. Now it’s up to the environmental community to “paint a more compelling picture and not stay at the slogan level and talk about winter and seals.”"

Looking back, Steyer admitted that NextGen has had difficulty fulfilling its pledge to make climate change a deciding factor in races that last two election cycles. “We just weren’t big enough,” Steyer told HuffPost. And now things are different, according to Steyer. Because of Trump, voters have to worry about things they didn’t think about before.“We’ve never seen people this upset because they’ve never seen their rights and privileges attacked the way they’re being attacked right now by their president,” Steyer said. Green groups may not have been able to convince voters before that they should care about climate change, but Steyer seems convinced that in 2018 and 2020, voters will know they can’t stay home. “We’re seeing it in terms of civic engagement right now,” Steyer said. “And I think we’ll see it in terms of participation in elections because I think that people are understanding, ‘Oh my gosh I never thought that XYZ would be under attack.’ Can you imagine we have to march for the idea of science?”But how do green groups and Democrats make the connection that Trump’s decision to take the U.S. out of the Paris agreement means they should vote against their Republican senator or House member? The fact that midterm elections tend to be a referendum on any sitting president helps. “You don’t even have to make that connection,” Steyer said. “[Republicans] have his back and they’re one big group pushing all his policies.”Tiernan Sittenfeld of the League of Conservation Voters ― which spent a record $45 million in 2016 ― pushed back against the idea that climate change doesn’t play well with voters, and issued warnings to the GOP. “Any Republican members of Congress who stand with Trump do so at their peril,” she said, adding that the public understands Trump’s decision to pull out of the climate change pact is “bad for public health, bad for the environment, bad for the U.S.’s standing in the world, and cedes the clean energy economy to China and others.” But in case voters have trouble making the connection, the DCCC started to make it for them on Thursday. In an email blasted out just hours after Trump’s announcement, the DCCC targeted Rep. Carlos Cuerbelo (R-Fla.), who’s up for re-election in 2018. Curbelo is a supporter of policies aimed at fighting climate change, and he urged Trump to stay in the Paris agreement. Curbelo and 19 other House Republicans are members of a bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, but their small numbers make it nearly impossible to get any policy related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions or boosting renewable energy through the chamber. “Trump’s decision today is a big political problem” for the 20 Republicans in the Climate Solutions Caucus, one DCCC aide said. “They are now stuck between their party and their district.”And beyond that caucus, the DCCC is eyeing 16 other districts held by Republicans that Clinton won and where climate change will likely be of concern. “Families in south Florida deserve more than the empty rhetoric they’re getting from Carlos Curbelo,” DCCC spokesperson Cole Leiter said in a statement. “They need a Representative who will protect coastal communities, local economies, and help create jobs in the American clean energy sector.”In the end, Trump’s move to withdraw from the Paris accord may have given the environmentalists exactly what they needed to help Democrats regain power.“This makes battle lines really clear,” Henn said. Now it’s up to the environmental community to “paint a more compelling picture and not stay at the slogan level and talk about winter and seals.”"

Police say Tschaggeny was previously caught on surveillance footage carrying the Best’s backpack after the incident.The backpack contained “personal items important to the Best family,” detectives said in a statement.Some of Best’s possessions ― including his wallet ― were missing from the backpack when officers recovered it. Tschaggeny is facing multiple charges, including second-degree theft and second-degree abuse of a corpse. Best, a retired Army veteran and married father of four, was one of three men who stood up for two girls on Portland’s MAX train when Jeremy Joseph Christian allegedly began threatening them in a bigoted, anti-Muslim tirade.

I’m an auto mechanic.”“Really? Because I’ve never actually seen you fix a car. Do you know how to fix a car?”“No. But I don’t have to fix a car to be an auto mechanic.”“You kinda do.”“No you don’t. I feel like an auto mechanic. Therefore, I’m an auto mechanic.”You might be tempted to say here that I’m just an idiot who doesn’t have any idea what he’s talking about. “Nobody’s dumb enough to say that.”Fine. Try this on for size? If you say, “I love you,” I might respond by saying, “Hmmm… I didn’t know that.”“Yep. I love you.”“Really? Because I’ve never actually seen you do anything loving toward me. Do you know what kinds of things I might consider gestures of love?”“No. But I don’t have to actually do loving things to love you.”“You kinda do.”“No you don’t. I feel love in my heart for you. Therefore, I love you.”You see the problem there, right? Waxing poetic about love isn’t love. Feeling extra-special warm feelings in your heart toward someone isn’t love. If you want me to agree with you that you love me, I need to see you act in loving ways.Notice, as I’ve just laid it out, I get to be the one who ultimately decides whether or not your protestations of love for me feel genuine or not. Unquestionably, there are people who are so needy they’ll never be satisfied that another is adequately loving toward them, but in general, action not feeling is a good place to begin when talking about demonstrating love.But the reverse is also true. I’ve heard people say, “I don’t hate X.” To which I respond, “Hmmm… I didn’t know that.”“That’s right. I don’t hate X.”“Really? Because I’ve seen you do things that appear awfully hateful toward X. Do you know what kinds of things X might consider gestures of hatred?”“No. But I don’t have to avoid doing things X hates not to be a hater of X.”“You kinda do.”“No you don’t. I don’t feel any hatred toward X. Therefore, I’m not a hater of X.”Whereas the first two examples I’ve given might be hard to find people to sign onto, this last argument I find to be very common. Whether you’re talking about racism, or Islamophobia, or xenophobia, or anti-immigration, or homophobia, or transphobia—it would seem that the universal response of the casual hater is, “I don’t hate X, because I don’t feel hatred.”Even when X comes along and says, “Despite what you say, the fact that you continue to say and do hateful things, or because you don’t ever call out anyone else for saying or doing these things demonstrates to all us Xs that you hate us.”“No, no, no. I don’t hate anybody.”“Then stop these things that are hateful toward us.”“It’s a free country. I can do whatever I want.”“True. It is, as you say, a free country. You’re free to continue to act hatefully. What you’re not free to do, however, is to do hateful things, but then tell everybody that you’re not hating—that X is just sensitive. Or, “X doesn’t really know my heart.” Or, “X should prove to me that I’m the one with hate in my heart.” Or, “X should just take my word for it.” Or, “Doesn’t X know I teach Sunday School?”If I’m X, I get to be the final word on what hatred toward me looks like—especially if I’ve been living with it my whole life. Just because you don’t like to see yourself as hateful, doesn’t mean that you’re not, in fact, hateful.Why do I bring this up? For a lot of reasons. However, a few things have happened over the past week or so that raise the specter of the kind of hatred that, among the haters, dares not speak its name. The president, for instance, released a proposed budget through the Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney, that has been described in some places as the most hateful budget anyone has ever seen (here and here). If Mick Mulvaney had stayed awake for a week, trying to figure out a way to screw everybody except rich people, he couldn’t have done a more devastating job than the budget he trotted on last Tuesday evening. Poor people. Sick people. People who depend on roads, bridges, and water pipes. College students. People on disability. Women. Pretty much everybody who doesn’t own a yacht gets jobbed in this budget.And if that horrific budget weren’t enough, the next day the Congressional Budget Office released its projections of how the American Health Care Act would affect the health insurance coverage of those in the private insurance market, as well as those who have benefitted from the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Turns out, 23 million people are projected to lose their health insurance by 2026. The bulk of the savings derived from refusing to pay for those grasping sick people will go to... the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.“So what?” you may be asking. The reason I find this so appalling is that the same people who argue that these sorts of things are good fiscal policy (If you’re going to make an omelet, after all...), are most often just as quick to say, “Don’t get me wrong. I love poor people. I don’t want to jeopardize healthcare. I think college students need our support. Of course women should have access to healthcare.”And if you challenge them about the hateful implications of their policy positions, they defend themselves by saying, “I don’t hate any of those people.”To which I want to respond, “Hmmm... I didn’t know that.”“That’s right. I don’t hate poor people, sick people, college students, disabled people, or women.”“Really? Because I’ve seen you do things and advocate for policies that appear awfully hateful toward all those people. Do you know what kinds of things all those people might consider gestures of hatred?”“No. But I don’t have to avoid doing things that all those people consider hateful not to be considered a hater of them.”“Yeah, you kinda do.”“No you don’t. I don’t feel any hatred toward all those people adversely affected by the policies I continually support. Therefore, I don’t hate them.”But you see, there’s the problem. That’s where the “I-don’t-hate-anyone-defense” falls apart. Just because you don’t feel hatred in your heart, doesn’t mean you’re not acting hatefully toward those you continue to disadvantage. All the warm feelings laid end to end fails to put food in the mouths of hungry children from whom you cut SNAP. It doesn’t matter how loudly you protest your concern for those who are going to lose healthcare, the bill from the oncologist doesn’t take into consideration what you feel. Your insistence about how much you value college education only sounds cruel to kids you’ve just told won’t be able to finance that education. Your love of your own wives and daughters is nice, but that does nothing to offer actual help to the pregnant sixteen year-old whose family will kick her out of the house when they find out.How is it that you can act hatefully toward people, but not hate them? It’s like saying, “Yeah, I steal stuff from the Speedway, but I’m not a thief.”You can tell yourself all you want that you don’t hate the people whose lives and families you’re destroying, but that doesn’t make you any less of a bastard to the people you’re screwing over. As long as the people with yachts still like you, though, I guess that’s sufficient consolation."
50,POLITICS,Make No Excuses For Kathy Griffin -- OR President Trump,"Jack Moline, ContributorPresident, Interfaith Alliance",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/make-no-excuses-for-kathy-griffin-or-president-trump_us_5931b6bde4b062a6ac0acf85,"If we insist on making this incident only about her epic failure in judgment, then we are overlooking the larger problem that our society is facing.",2017-06-02,<p>Ted Nugent visits President Trump in the Oval Office</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5931ba5e2300001900348836.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I have a point to make about Kathy Griffin, but let’s get something necessary out of the way first.There is nothing good to say about her ill-conceived stunt involving a mock-up of the severed head of President Trump. It was no more art than the noose left at the National Museum of African American History and Culture was practice for a merit badge. Her apology, described as “fulsome” by Sen. Al Franken, neglected the object of the prank and, at least as important, his family. And the accompanying video she released demonstrates that she did not need the “reactions of viewers” to persuade her that what she did was inappropriate ― she already knew at the time.Griffin is not the first entertainer to cross the line (and move the line and cross it again, as she said) in expressing a political opinion. But she has joined a growing cadre of performers who have normalized images and (presumed) behavior that is not only noxious but dangerous. Griffin’s staged picture is not like Robert Mapplethorpe’s controversial photography that ran afoul of taste. It is a visual analog to Ted Nugent’s infamous and profane invitation for then-candidate Barack Obama to “suck on my machine gun.”So no excuses for Kathy Griffin. (And it is important to note here that I am no relation to her much maligned ex-husband Matt Moline.)But if we insist on making this incident only about her epic failure in judgment, then we are overlooking the larger problem that our society is facing. It’s not just polarization. It’s not just incivility. It’s not just the accommodation of confrontational comportment.Instead, it is the normalization of bad behavior. The line that Griffin claims to have crossed, then moved and crossed again was neither her invention nor her exclusive domain. In the 1990s – not so long ago – untoward conduct by the President of the United States resulted in the call to restore dignity to the White House. During the administrations of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, inappropriate personal conduct by the Commander in Chief was virtually unknown; critics of their misdeeds had to dig deeply into their youth to find behaviors that crossed the line.Political opponents of the two presidents were often crude in their attacks, but neither man ever responded in kind, and certainly never initiated boorish behavior. Policy debate was sharp and on many occasions snarky, yet there was never a call for retributive justice against critics by either president or by responsible opponents.And in spite of the fact that the Secret Service was busier during the Obama administration than any other, even the bloviating voices of talk radio with their outrageous conspiracy fantasies and race-tinged rhetoric largely stopped short of romanticizing criminal acts – Mr. Nugent notwithstanding.Until candidate Trump. Complaining about the constraints of political correctness (or, as some of us prefer, humane consideration), he stomped on the Constitution, validated violence against dissenters, demeaned people with disabilities, bragged about sexual assault and dismissed due process – remember “lock her up?” – without a history of humor that Kathy Griffin lamely claims.And if Griffin’s apology fell short, it was at least an apology. Then, and now that he is president, Mr. Trump has steadfastly refused to hold himself responsible for the diminution of respectability that might have been mitigated. Instead there were excuses, all of which boiled down to Bart Simpson on the one hand (“I didn’t do it”) and Bob Fosse on the other hand (“He had it coming”).In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, nominee Trump arrogated to himself a kind of omnipotence over the political and physical infrastructures, claiming about each “I alone can fix it.” There is actually one aspect of our national malaise that he alone can fix, but he refuses. Owning up to his own shortcomings and the permissions they have created for bad behavior by others would give our elected leader the credibility to repudiate Kathy Griffin.In the meantime, I take some heart that condemnation of Kathy Griffin’s photo has been near universal and that she has suffered the consequences of her pitiable judgment. Perhaps by moving the line and crossing it one too many times, she has awakened the rest of us to be more attentive to the circumstances that made it possible for her to betray respect for the office of the president and, in the process, demand that our leaders join us in our civil and civic responsibilities."

The proposal generated a hugely controversial and heated debate in the legislature and ultimately failed after the Senate was unable to broker an agreement.In the same year, Georgia actually enacted a bill inspired by the SB 1070 Arizona bill to disastrous consequences. Georgia farmers lost millions of dollars as blueberries, onions, melons, tomatoes and other and crops were left unharvested and rotting in farms. As undocumented workers fled the state in fear of the new harsh immigration measure, these agricultural jobs were simply not being filled in time to harvest crops, doing severe damage to Georgia’s agriculture sector.More than six years later, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law what many immigration activists and groups consider to be the most discriminatory, anti-immigrant law inspired by SB 1070. Texas proposed Senate Bill 4 (SB4) enables local police officers to question the immigration status of individuals detained with “reasonable suspicion” of breaking the law. The bill would also preempt local municipalities from passing legislation that would conflict with SB4 and force police departments to comply with federal requests to detain suspected undocumented immigrants.The Texas SB4 law essentially goes along with Trump administration efforts to go after “sanctuary cities” and would embolden other states with anti-immigrant legislators to take similar measures to target immigrants by transforming police officers into immigration agents.These measures have had a chilling effect on immigrant communities by eroding the trust between the community and police departments, as there is fear that any encounter with police officers could lead to detainment and possible deportation. Police departments themselves have spoken out against these type of anti-immigrant laws. The Los Angeles police department said in a statement: “While there is no direct evidence that the decline is related to concerns within the Hispanic community regarding immigration, the department believes deportation fears may be preventing Hispanic members of the community from reporting when they are being victimized.”Interim Austin Police Chief Brian Manley has told legislators that SB4 will make police work harder. “I think that we will create situations where the trust we’ve worked so hard to build can be eroded,” he said at a press conference last week.Over a 1000 immigration activists staged a large protest on the Texas House Floor during the final day of the legislative session. As legislators were discussing SB4 and the protestors that had gathered that day, House Rep. Matt Rinaldi told fellow lawmakers “fuck them, I called ICE” regarding the activists gathered there and threatened to put a bullet in a fellow lawmakers head.The fact that a Republican legislator saw people which he assumed were Hispanic and undocumented and called ICE on them due to a political disagreement, not only demonstrates how laws like SB4 will inevitably result in racial profiling but also how these types of discriminatory proposals can be abused in order to persecute individuals who engage in political activism. Discriminatory legislation like SB4 hurts our communities by making police officers jobs more difficult, hurting the economy, and persecuting hard working immigrants and separating families which contribute to our society.Now more than ever, we all need to stand up and fight this hate - not just in Texas, but across the country.Thomas Kennedy is a writing fellow for the Center for Community Change.

Just two years ago, the Australian and Queensland state governments released the Reef 2050 Plan, officials’ long-term sustainability plan detailing how to best preserve the reef and ensure that it “continues to improve on its outstanding universal values.” The message was relatively upbeat: The iconic reef was very much not dead, and in fact could get better and better as a “natural wonder” in the decades to come.But now, with back-to-back mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 causing large swathes of the Great Barrier Reef’s corals to die, some members of the Reef 2050 advisory committee, a group of scientists and experts tasked with implementing the government’s plan, have raised doubts about its feasibility. At a recent committee meeting, two experts, both hailing from government science agencies, said that “improving the natural heritage values of the reef was no longer possible,” reported The Guardian.The experts, who spoke to the paper on the condition of anonymity, said the plan’s aim should be tweaked to something “more achievable.” The reef will “inevitably” be damaged because of global warming, they said, but perhaps its “ecological function” could be maintained. “The concept of ‘maintaining ecological function’ refers to the balance of ecological processes necessary for the reef ecosystem as a whole to persist, but perhaps in a different form, noting the composition and structure may differ from what is currently seen today,” a spokesperson for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, where one of the two experts is based, told The Guardian. Earlier this month, another group of reef experts ― the Great Barrier Reef Independent Expert Panel, an advisory group also tasked with implementing the Reef 2050 plan ― echoed that sentiment.In a communiqué published on May 5, the group said that “coral bleaching since early 2016 has changed the Reef fundamentally.”“There is great concern about the future of the Reef, and the communities and businesses that depend on it,” the statement read, “but hope still remains for maintaining ecological function over the coming decades.”The Great Barrier Reef has myriad functions, including providing a habitat for hundreds of fish and other species, protecting coastlines and acting as a draw for tourism. According to a 2013 report by consultancy firm Deloitte Access Economics, the reef contributes almost $4 billion to the Australian economy each year and supports almost 70,000 jobs. The Great Barrier Reef may never be the same again, but action can ― and must ― be taken to salvage what can still be saved, experts say. Both the Independent Expert Panel and the Reef 2050 advisory committee have said tackling climate change is central to this effort. Despite these experts’ concerns, however, the Reef 2050 plan does not currently address the importance of curbing greenhouse gases to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Criticizing this omission on the part of the federal and Queensland governments, some conservationists have accused officials of wanting to have their cake and eat it too.“The government wants to have coal mines operating in 60 years’ time, and still hopes to have a healthy reef,” Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Center of Excellence for Integrated Coral Reef Studies and a member of the Independent Expert Panel, told The Conversation in 2015. An example is a proposed $16 billion coal mine in Queensland, which would be located near Great Barrier Reef. If completed, the mine would cover more than 170 square miles (or about 80,000 football fields). Government officials have insisted the project won’t negatively impact the reef and will create thousands of domestic jobs. Conservationists, however, have called this rationale “nonsense.” “[In] our lifetime and on our watch, substantial areas of the Great Barrier Reef and the surrounding ecosystems are experiencing major long-term damage which may be irreversible unless action is taken now,” the Independent Expert Panel said in its communiqué. “The planet has changed in a way that science informs us is unprecedented in human history. While that in itself may be cause for action, the extraordinary rapidity of the change we now observe makes action even more urgent.”Climate change has been linked to the ongoing and record-breaking mass bleaching wreaking havoc on coral reefs worldwide. Since late 2014, higher-than-normal water temperatures have stressed corals in every major coral region on Earth, triggering the most widespread and longest-ever coral bleaching event in recorded history.Some reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, have been hit by repeated bleaching ― a phenomenon in which stressed corals expel a symbiotic algae from their tissues, leaving them more vulnerable to disease and death. Hughes said earlier this year that two-thirds of corals in the Great Barrier Reef’s northern section had died in back-to-back bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. A study published by the ARC Center of Excellence for Integrated Coral Reef Studies in March concluded that parts of the reef will never fully recover from the damage they’ve recently endured. “The chances of the northern Great Barrier Reef returning to its pre-bleaching assemblage structure are slim given the scale of damage that occurred in 2016 and the likelihood of a fourth bleaching event occurring within the next decade or two as global temperatures continue to rise,” said the study.

Nearly all the residents were ordered to move because of high lead levels. It is now an EPA Superfund site.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5926e7be2000003a0016ed16.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — If you listen to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, the biggest environmental problem facing the United States isn’t climate change (he doesn’t think that’s real, anyway), or lead-tainted drinking water or brain-damaging pesticides. It’s that Barack Obama didn’t clean up the more than 1,300 most contaminated and hazardous sites across the country.A Fox News headline earlier this month declared that Pruitt was here to clean up the Obama administration’s “toxic mess.” The former Oklahoma attorney general would have the American people believe that what the Superfund program really needs isn’t funding, it’s the right attitude. “It’s not a matter of money,” Pruitt told Fox News. “It’s a matter of leadership and attitude and management.”Pruitt has been fixated on the EPA’s Superfund, which is responsible for cleaning up highly contaminated sites, since taking over as agency chief in February. He’s called it “absolutely essential” and has repeatedly stressed that it’s part of EPA’s core mission. During an April visit to a lead- and arsenic-laden Superfund site in East Chicago, Indiana, Pruitt said he went there “because it’s important that we restore confidence to people in this community that we’re going to get it right going forward.” And he has blamed “poor leadership” and “poor focus” on the part of the Obama administration for there being more Superfund sites today than when Obama took office.Superfund is an important part of EPA’s work, but Pruitt’s position fails to account for the history of the program. And every decision he’s made about it so far suggests he’s not serious about making it better. While he initially vowed to protect Superfund dollars, the 2018 budget the Trump administration released this month would slash EPA’s overall funding by 31.4 percent — to its lowest level in four decades — and cut Superfund from $1.09 billion to $762 million. The administration argues that it can do more with less — that the EPA will “identify efficiencies in administrative costs” and “optimize” its use of settlements with polluters. The budget will also provide the agency with an “opportunity” to “identify what barriers have been preventing sites from returning to communities and design solutions to overcome those barriers,” the White House wrote in its justification for slashing Superfund.Pruitt celebrated the budget proposal, saying in a statement that it “respects the American taxpayer” and “supports EPA’s highest priorities.”But Superfund experts say Pruitt doesn’t seem to understand the basics of the program, which is designed to deal with expensive, complicated contamination cleanups that often have no responsible party and are not being handled at the state or local level.“A cut to the program literally means longer exposure and preventing economic recovery for communities,” former EPA official Mathy Stanislaus told HuffPost. “The response should be fact-based. Tell me how the facts support cutting funding to a program that already has a backlog of sites?” Stanislaus oversaw Superfund as part of the EPA’s Office of Land and Emergency Management under Obama.Christine Todd Whitman, who served as EPA administrator under President George W. Bush, said Superfund is yet another issue on which the Trump administration’s words and actions don’t match up. “I don’t see how this program maintains its viability in any great way with these kinds of proposed cuts,” Whitman told HuffPost during a press call last week that included former leaders of several federal agencies. “And it just doesn’t make sense when they are talking about trying to address this problem.”Established in 1980 in response to several environmental disasters, Superfund — formally the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act — is responsible for addressing areas contaminated with lead, radiation, mercury and other toxic pollutants, often left behind by industrial operations. The law authorized the federal government to force parties responsible for contamination to pay for cleanup costs and created a tax on the petroleum and chemical industries, two heavy polluters, to be pooled and used to clean up sites where a responsible party could not be found, called “orphan” sites. Areas requiring long-term remediation are put on the National Priorities List (NPL), but they often take years or even decades to clean up. In many ways, Pruitt’s obsession with Superfund makes sense. As of 2015, 53 million Americans — 17 percent of the population — lived within three miles of a Superfund site. And the large number of toxic sites that remain on the NPL is something Pruitt has realized he can pin on past administrations for failing to address. “Let’s look and think what the past administration achieved,” Pruitt said during a visit to a Pennsylvania coal mine last month, noting that there are still 1,322 sites. “Some of those have been on the list for 30 to 40 years.” It’s true that the number of NPL sites increased during Obama’s two terms, from about 1,260 at the end of fiscal year 2008. But for Pruitt to point his finger at Obama shows the EPA administrator’s willingness to ignore the Superfund listing process and the extent of contamination in many areas, as well as the challenge he now faces as head of the agency.The number of sites proposed for and listed on the NPL simply reflects that those areas have been found to pose a risk to human or environmental health, and it “has nothing to do with ‘management,’” Stanislaus told HuffPost. Superfund’s problems have almost everything to do with resources, which have all but vanished over the last two decades. In 1995, Congress allowed the so-called “polluter pays” tax — which generated billions of dollars to fund orphan cleanups — to expire. The trust fund dried up several years later, with cleanup costs now falling largely on taxpayers via federal budget allocations. As money for cleanups has shriveled, fewer sites have been remediated.From 1999 to 2013, federal appropriations to Superfund declined from about $2 billion to $1.1 billion per year, according to a 2010 Government Accountability Office report. In 1999, the program completed 85 site cleanups, compared with just eight in 2014.Over the years, several Democratic legislators have pushed for reinstating the Superfund tax, a move supported by the Obama administration, but the efforts failed.Whitman fears the program won’t be able to function with additional cuts to staff and enforcement. She said enforcement is “critical” to get polluters to pay up.But Pruitt, a longtime ally of the fossil fuel industry who sued the agency he now runs more than a dozen times as Oklahoma’s attorney general, insists Superfund will become self-sustaining under his watch. “The great thing about this is we have private funding. There are people out there responsible for these sites to clean up,” he told Fox News. “The moneys are there to do so.”Stanislaus said there are some sites that provide the economic incentive for private interests to invest in redevelopment. “But to say that there’s this hidden pot of gold out there that can be brought to bear on a site, I don’t know what fantasy island that comes from, frankly.”Nor does it seem likely that the Trump administration, which is stacked with industry lobbyists and fossil fuel allies, is going to be cracking down on polluters and forcing them to pay for cleanups. Ken Cook, president of the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said in a statement that “there’s not a snowball’s chance in hell that polluters will be forced to pay for cleaning up their toxic messes that endanger Americans’ health” under Trump and Pruitt’s watch.Those appointed to help Pruitt in his Superfund efforts so far have been less than inspiring choices. This month, Trump nominated Susan Bodine, chief counsel for the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, whom The Intercept described as a “lobbyist for Superfund polluters,” to serve as assistant administrator of EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. And Pruitt has chosen Albert Kelly, a longtime banker with no apparent experience in environmental policy, to lead a new Superfund task force.The task force, which was announced last week, will provide recommendations to the agency on how to “streamline and improve the Superfund program” within 30 days. In a statement accompanying his announcement, Pruitt said he is “confident that, with a renewed sense of urgency, leadership and fresh ideas, the Superfund program can reach its full potential of returning formerly contaminated sites to communities for their beneficial use.” Wilma Subra, a Louisiana-based chemist and Superfund expert, told HuffPost that it’s not clear what Pruitt means when he says he will reprioritize Superfund cleanups or if he will change the general understanding of what it takes for a site to be considered clean and thus eligible to be removed from the list. Until that’s more clear, Subra said, Pruitt’s claims are just a “talking point.”“Is it going to be a little small slice of [Superfund] he’s going to prioritize, and the rest is going to sit there and languish?” she asked. Stanislaus shares her concern that Pruitt may shortcut cleanups in order to cut costs. Doing so, Stanislaus said, would be “shortsighted” and come with health and economic consequences. Likewise, research has shown that investing in a Superfund site can increase property values and fuel job growth. Not to mention the positive effects that cleanup efforts have on human health. Andrew Rosenburg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said Pruitt’s Superfund talk is “smoke and mirrors.”“To simply wave your hands and say ‘We’re going to clean it up’ at the same time as you’re reducing the resources, both people and money available to do it, is frankly nonsense,” Rosenburg told HuffPost."

And the large number of toxic sites that remain on the NPL is something Pruitt has realized he can pin on past administrations for failing to address. “Let’s look and think what the past administration achieved,” Pruitt said during a visit to a Pennsylvania coal mine last month, noting that there are still 1,322 sites. “Some of those have been on the list for 30 to 40 years.” It’s true that the number of NPL sites increased during Obama’s two terms, from about 1,260 at the end of fiscal year 2008. But for Pruitt to point his finger at Obama shows the EPA administrator’s willingness to ignore the Superfund listing process and the extent of contamination in many areas, as well as the challenge he now faces as head of the agency.The number of sites proposed for and listed on the NPL simply reflects that those areas have been found to pose a risk to human or environmental health, and it “has nothing to do with ‘management,’” Stanislaus told HuffPost. Superfund’s problems have almost everything to do with resources, which have all but vanished over the last two decades. In 1995, Congress allowed the so-called “polluter pays” tax — which generated billions of dollars to fund orphan cleanups — to expire. The trust fund dried up several years later, with cleanup costs now falling largely on taxpayers via federal budget allocations. As money for cleanups has shriveled, fewer sites have been remediated.From 1999 to 2013, federal appropriations to Superfund declined from about $2 billion to $1.1 billion per year, according to a 2010 Government Accountability Office report. In 1999, the program completed 85 site cleanups, compared with just eight in 2014.Over the years, several Democratic legislators have pushed for reinstating the Superfund tax, a move supported by the Obama administration, but the efforts failed.Whitman fears the program won’t be able to function with additional cuts to staff and enforcement. She said enforcement is “critical” to get polluters to pay up.But Pruitt, a longtime ally of the fossil fuel industry who sued the agency he now runs more than a dozen times as Oklahoma’s attorney general, insists Superfund will become self-sustaining under his watch. “The great thing about this is we have private funding. There are people out there responsible for these sites to clean up,” he told Fox News. “The moneys are there to do so.”Stanislaus said there are some sites that provide the economic incentive for private interests to invest in redevelopment. “But to say that there’s this hidden pot of gold out there that can be brought to bear on a site, I don’t know what fantasy island that comes from, frankly.”Nor does it seem likely that the Trump administration, which is stacked with industry lobbyists and fossil fuel allies, is going to be cracking down on polluters and forcing them to pay for cleanups. Ken Cook, president of the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said in a statement that “there’s not a snowball’s chance in hell that polluters will be forced to pay for cleaning up their toxic messes that endanger Americans’ health” under Trump and Pruitt’s watch.Those appointed to help Pruitt in his Superfund efforts so far have been less than inspiring choices. This month, Trump nominated Susan Bodine, chief counsel for the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, whom The Intercept described as a “lobbyist for Superfund polluters,” to serve as assistant administrator of EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. And Pruitt has chosen Albert Kelly, a longtime banker with no apparent experience in environmental policy, to lead a new Superfund task force.The task force, which was announced last week, will provide recommendations to the agency on how to “streamline and improve the Superfund program” within 30 days. In a statement accompanying his announcement, Pruitt said he is “confident that, with a renewed sense of urgency, leadership and fresh ideas, the Superfund program can reach its full potential of returning formerly contaminated sites to communities for their beneficial use.” Wilma Subra, a Louisiana-based chemist and Superfund expert, told HuffPost that it’s not clear what Pruitt means when he says he will reprioritize Superfund cleanups or if he will change the general understanding of what it takes for a site to be considered clean and thus eligible to be removed from the list. Until that’s more clear, Subra said, Pruitt’s claims are just a “talking point.”“Is it going to be a little small slice of [Superfund] he’s going to prioritize, and the rest is going to sit there and languish?” she asked. Stanislaus shares her concern that Pruitt may shortcut cleanups in order to cut costs. Doing so, Stanislaus said, would be “shortsighted” and come with health and economic consequences. Likewise, research has shown that investing in a Superfund site can increase property values and fuel job growth. Not to mention the positive effects that cleanup efforts have on human health. Andrew Rosenburg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said Pruitt’s Superfund talk is “smoke and mirrors.”“To simply wave your hands and say ‘We’re going to clean it up’ at the same time as you’re reducing the resources, both people and money available to do it, is frankly nonsense,” Rosenburg told HuffPost."

But in signaling an exit from the deal, Trump would make good on one of his major campaign promises and win the favor of the 22 Republican senators who last week wrote him a letter urging him to do so.Trump has said he believes climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese to compromise U.S. manufacturing.In a letter published in the Baptist Press in December, nearly 50 evangelical leaders said Pruitt “has been misrepresented as denying ‘settled science,’ when he has actually called for a continuing debate.”Trump recently met with Pope Francis, who gave the U.S. president a copy of his 2015 encyclical on the environment, “Laudato Si.” The encyclical is a fiery and urgent call to action on climate change."

Last we saw her in Season 4, she’d stepped into the bathroom just as a crowd of prisoners got ahold of a gun and chaos started to bloom. That terrible timing will teach her a few things. A lackey of the prison’s corporate overlord, Linda hasn’t been interested in the prisoners themselves, despite her role in shaping their lives behind bars. But her outlook is set to change in Season 5 as she enters their fray and becomes “even more of a hard-hearted jerk” or “actually feels for the prisoners and want[s] to help them,” Dover told HuffPost. Either way, the season will be wholly different from ones past: The whole thing takes place over just three days, told in real time. Suddenly empowered for the first time in a long time, inmates at Litchfield face the fallout from a black prisoner’s accidental death, questions on white privilege behind bars and which snacks to include in their demands. (It’s still a comedy, after all.)We also get a look at Linda’s backstory as a sorority girl ― one who’s not actually as squeaky-clean as she projects herself to be. “Things are going to come to a pretty extreme head. It’s going to be a wild ride, I’ll put it that way,” Dover teased, adding that many characters will come out of the season changed by events of the riot. But Season 5 doesn’t just change things for the characters on the show ― Dover explained how filming during the 2016 presidential election was personally “inspiring.”“Orange Is the New Black” cast members filming in New York took breaks together to participate in protest marches in New York City and Washington, D.C., where they held signs in support of Black Lives Matter and the Women’s March. Many, including Dover, were also photographed wearing “Vaginas Against Trump” T-shirts shared on social media with the caption, “FUCK YOU TRUMP.”Although she noted that no major changes to the script were made post-election, to her knowledge, Dover credits the show’s diverse cast for turning her on to political causes. “I think it really sparked my own activism,” Dover said of filming. “I feel like I’ve been living in a bubble, and now I feel like, ‘Oh, right. We need to really get involved in everything that’s going on in this country.’ Being part of this show has been really a gift, especially during this time.”“Orange Is the New Black” Season 5 debuts on Netflix June 9.

59,POLITICS,"Hillary Clinton Partly Blames Voter Suppression For Her Loss, But Experts Aren't So Sure",Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-voter-suppression_us_59306706e4b07572bdbfea14,They say Democrats have been talking up a flawed study.,2017-06-01,"Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential nominee for the Democratic Party, at the Women for Women International Luncheon on May 2. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593067b52300003b003484ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton has suggested in two recent interviews that voter suppression tactics, especially in Wisconsin, contributed to her losing the presidential election last year, a claim that several election law experts find questionable.“I would have won had I not been subjected to the unprecedented attacks by [then-FBI Director James] Comey and the Russians, aided and abetted by the suppression of the vote, particularly in Wisconsin,” she said in an interview with New York magazine published last week. Experts agree that voter ID requirements make it more difficult to vote, especially for low-income, minority and elderly voters. And Wisconsin has a strict voter ID law that requires voters to show a driver’s license, state ID, passport, naturalization papers, tribal ID or certain student IDs. People who don’t have one of those items can cast a provisional ballot that only counts if they return shortly after Election Day to prove their eligibility to election officials.A 2014 study by the General Accountability Office showed that new voter ID laws in Kansas and Tennessee reduced turnout in 2012, particularly among African-American and young voters in 2012. A judge in 2014 estimated that 300,000 people lacked the required documentation to vote. Clinton lost to Trump in Wisconsin by 22,748 votes.During an appearance at the 2017 Code Conference on Wednesday, Clinton defended not spending more time campaigning in Wisconsin, saying she had sent strong surrogates there and that her team had imperfect data on her chances in the state. She then pivoted to talk about voter suppression in the state.100“Scott Walker has been one of the leaders in voter suppression, making it difficult,” she said, referring to the governor of Wisconsin.“So the 85-year-old woman who doesn’t have a photo ID because she doesn’t drive anymore shows up with her Medicare card and her utility bills and they turn her away,” Clinton added. “Or the African-American. Or the veteran, also African-American, who moves from Illinois to Wisconsin, registers to vote, gets on the rolls, but he still has his Illinois driver’s license, shows up, they turn him away. The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote. I don’t think we believed at the time before the election that it would be anything like that, anything as big as that.”Clinton appeared to be referring to an analysis by Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC. But experts have questioned the study, which was not peer-reviewed, and said it overestimates the impact of the voter ID law on the election.The study is suspect because it attributed all of Wisconsin’s 3.3 percent decline in turnout to voter ID laws, said Barry Burden, director of the elections research center at the University of Wisconsin.“In fact, turnout was surely affected by many factors including the ID law but also a less vigorous campaign and polling showing Clinton well ahead throughout the campaign,” he wrote in an email. “Many variables contributed to Clinton’s loss. Newly restrictive election laws such as the voter ID requirement in Wisconsin were factors. But those laws are only part of the explanation and probably not the most important part.”Clinton isn’t the only Democrat to suggest voter suppression was responsible for her loss. Keith Ellison, deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, tweeted about the Priorities USA study. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) also claimed turnout was reduced by 200,000 voters because of the state’s voter ID law. PolitiFact called that claim “mostly false,” and The Washington Post gave it three out of four possible Pinocchios.Eitan Hersh, a political science professor at Yale University, called the 200,000 number “bogus.”Hersh’s own comprehensive research on voter ID laws in Texas found that about 115,000 people there lacked a require form of identification. And he said it was “ludicrous” to think that there were nearly twice as many affected voters in Wisconsin, a state considerably smaller than Texas.He compared Democratic exaggerations on the impact of voter ID laws to the way Republicans have stoked fears about voter fraud and noncitizens voting ― an something that exists, but is not widespread.“In an era in which the Republican nominee consistently lied, I think it’d be better for the Democratic Party to be associated with truth and science,” he said. “On the Republican side, there are, for sure, a few people who are noncitizens who vote. Now is there any danger to a Republican saying, ‘Yeah, it’s 100 or 1,000 times the number, that’s the truth’? Yeah, there’s a danger to it, because it’s a lie and because it makes people feel that the election system doesn’t work.”“And when you make the same claim about voter ID ... then the Democrats are doing exactly as the Republicans are doing. People should be appalled by that,” he added.Rick Hasen, a professor and election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, said he was worried that exaggerating the impact of voter ID could actually hurt Democrats trying to improve access to the ballot box.“It is counterproductive for Democrats to tout a questionable study, as it can be easily debunked, allowing voter ID supporters to make the argument that there is no good social science supporting the idea that voter ID laws may suppress votes,” he said in an email.“For Secretary Clinton to focus on this study is especially troubling,” he added. “It is pretty clear that some on the left are still looking for excuses rather than addressing how to make the party more appealing to voters. Clinton seems to be looking to blame everyone ― Wisconsin’s voter ID law, Russia, Comey ― rather than seeing her own weaknesses as a candidate.”"

A device carried by the man as he shouted threats was not dangerous, they said. It appeared to be a bluetooth speaker device.Arif Chaudhery, a passenger on board MH128, told Reuters that about 30 minutes into the flight a male passenger attacked a female member of the cabin crew who screamed for help.“Some passengers and crew grabbed the man and tackled him to the floor,” Chaudhery said, adding that seat belts were used to tie the man’s hands.“We were very lucky. It could have been worse.”Armed police boarded the plane when it landed back in Melbourne, taking the man, who bought a plane ticket hours after being released from psychiatric care, into custody.The man was due to appear in court on Thursday on charges relating to making threats, false statements and endangering the safety of an aircraft.Malaysia Airlines said it was investigating the incident and all baggage from the flight had been re-scanned by Australian security officials before being forwarded to new flights for the passengers.“Malaysia Airlines’ technical and cabin crew that operated MH128/31May will not operate on flights until further notice,” the airline added in a statement.Australian authorities are also investigating.Melbourne’s Tullamarine airport was briefly closed during the incident but has since reopened, airport authorities said.Malaysia Airlines has suffered two major disasters in recent years. In 2014, Flight MH370 with 239 people on board went missing on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.The Boeing 777 plane has yet to be found and its location is one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries. The deep-sea search for the missing plane was called off in January.Just over four months after MH370 went missing, Flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down in eastern Ukraine, killing all on board.The airline has struggled to recover from the disasters, having to cut staff and restructure its business as passenger numbers fell."

The highly anticipated appearance will be Comey’s first public comments since Trump fired him on May 9, amid highly questionable circumstances that suggested Trump may have been trying to obstruct the investigation.While the testimony will give Comey an opportunity to address some of the many questions surrounding his firing and his conversations with Trump, it is unclear how much detail he will provide. Comey is also expected to speak with Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading an independent investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller was named to the position after Comey’s sudden firing.Several news outlets reported Wednesday that Comey spoke to Mueller privately to determine what he is legally allowed to say in his public testimony, and Mueller gave him the go-ahead to testify.Trump’s dismissal of Comey on May 9 preceded several bombshell reports suggesting that Trump tried to interfere with the ongoing investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia.According to a memo Comey wrote documenting a meeting with Trump, the president told Comey to shut down the FBI investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned after it was revealed he misled administration officials about his contacts with Russian leaders.Just one day after firing Comey, Trump met with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in the Oval Office. The meeting was closed to American reporters and only accessible to Russian state media. During the meeting, Trump reportedly bragged about firing Comey, calling him “crazy” and “a real nut job,” and said the decision lessened “great pressure because of Russia.”At the same meeting, Trump also leaked classified information that “jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State,” the Washington Post reported.The White House struggled to defend Trump’s sudden decision to fire Comey, providing perplexing and often contradictory explanations in the days following the firing.

Kathleen Rice (N.Y.) in 2010. Rice says the Office of Personnel Management declined to respond to an inquiry unless she could get a Republican to co-sign it. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593061012100002b00aa1d13.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A major government agency refused to answer a Democratic legislator’s routine inquiry unless she got a Republican to co-sign her request, the congresswoman told HuffPost. Rep. Kathleen Rice (N.Y.) said she faced an unprecedented barrier when she asked the Office of Personnel Management about its training process and suggested changes that would help the agency recruit more cybersecurity workers. Janel Fitzhugh, OPM’s legislative director, told Rice’s legislative aide that she needed a Republican committee chairman to co-sign the letter in order to get a response.It’s extremely unusual for a routine inquiry initiated by members of Congress to face a political hurdle, said former Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.), who reviewed Rice’s letter. Davis served as chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee during his tenure in Congress. “This is a vanilla letter,” Davis told HuffPost. “It’s not controversial at all. These are entirely appropriate questions. Congress has the right to ask these question and have these questions answered. Particularly on homeland security, you would hope this would be the one issue that could rise above the partisan divide.”The apparent stonewalling is part of a troubling pattern. Democrats have expressed concern that President Donald Trump’s administration is encouraging federal workers to withhold information from them, The Washington Post reported in April.Although federal governmental agencies are under the executive branch, Congress is charged with providing oversight and members of Congress send thousands of letters of inquiry to federal agencies every week. Most of these inquiries are routine and answered in an expeditious manner. Rice and two colleagues, Reps. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.) and Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), sent their letter to the OPM on May 1. Eight days later, a legislative aide in Rice’s office contacted Fitzhugh to check on the status of a response. Fitzhugh said the congresswoman’s office wouldn’t receive a response to the inquiry unless it was co-signed by a committee chairman. Given that the Republicans are in control of the House of Representatives, this meant that OPM was asking a Democrat to seek Republican approval before it would answer a simple inquiry. Rice offered to get a top Democrat on the committee to also sign the letter, she said, but the OPM said that would not suffice.Rice’s aide asked Fitzhugh where the edict to require a committee chairman signature was coming from. She replied that Jason Simmons, the OPM chief of staff, had passed down the order.“This is not OPM’s policy,” an agency spokesperson told HuffPost. “OPM has recently been engaged in conversations with Congressional staff and OPM will acknowledge their requests with written communication.”Before Simmons was appointed as OPM’s chief of staff, he was the Trump campaign’s North Carolina state director and the intergovernmental director for former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R). Placing a political staffer who has no federal government experience in charge of the office that manages civil service employees is quite unusual. The last two OPM chiefs of staff, Elizabeth Montoya and Kiran Ahuja, came to the role with extensive federal government experience. Simmons’ appointment isn’t unusual in this administration, however. In March, ProPublica listed him as a member of the 520-person Trump White House “beachhead team.” Members of the beachhead team are intended to serve as the eyes and ears (or “spies,” as one congressional staffer put it) for an administration that is increasingly convinced that career federal government employees are trying to undermine the White House.Neither Fitzhugh nor Simmons responded to a request for comment. When told of Simmons’ previous experience, Davis said he was surprised that someone with no federal government experience was serving in a critical role that deals with the intricacies of the federal bureaucracy. Although the language of Rice’s letter was routine, she says the topic ― cybersecurity at the OPM ― is critical. OPM essentially serves as the human resources department for all federal employees that quality for civil service status, which adds up to about 2 million people. Chinese hackers were reportedly behind a massive security breach at the agency in 2015. Over 21 million records were stolen, including highly sensitive security clearance forms, military records and millions of fingerprints. The breach led to multiple investigations, and Katherine L. Archuleta, who was serving as director of the OMB at the time, resigned under pressure.The letter that Rice and her colleagues sent asked OPM to detail its overall training and testing policies, as well as its education requirements for cybersecurity jobs. Government agencies have a difficult time recruiting top cybersecurity talent because the compensation and benefits provided by the federal government often pale in comparison to what is offered by tech companies. Removing the requirement of a four-year degree, the representatives said, would allow for more successful recruitment. Rice still hasn’t received a response to the letter of inquiry. This article has been updated with comment from OPM. "

She replied that Jason Simmons, the OPM chief of staff, had passed down the order.“This is not OPM’s policy,” an agency spokesperson told HuffPost. “OPM has recently been engaged in conversations with Congressional staff and OPM will acknowledge their requests with written communication.”Before Simmons was appointed as OPM’s chief of staff, he was the Trump campaign’s North Carolina state director and the intergovernmental director for former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R). Placing a political staffer who has no federal government experience in charge of the office that manages civil service employees is quite unusual. The last two OPM chiefs of staff, Elizabeth Montoya and Kiran Ahuja, came to the role with extensive federal government experience. Simmons’ appointment isn’t unusual in this administration, however. In March, ProPublica listed him as a member of the 520-person Trump White House “beachhead team.” Members of the beachhead team are intended to serve as the eyes and ears (or “spies,” as one congressional staffer put it) for an administration that is increasingly convinced that career federal government employees are trying to undermine the White House.Neither Fitzhugh nor Simmons responded to a request for comment. When told of Simmons’ previous experience, Davis said he was surprised that someone with no federal government experience was serving in a critical role that deals with the intricacies of the federal bureaucracy. Although the language of Rice’s letter was routine, she says the topic ― cybersecurity at the OPM ― is critical. OPM essentially serves as the human resources department for all federal employees that quality for civil service status, which adds up to about 2 million people. Chinese hackers were reportedly behind a massive security breach at the agency in 2015. Over 21 million records were stolen, including highly sensitive security clearance forms, military records and millions of fingerprints. The breach led to multiple investigations, and Katherine L. Archuleta, who was serving as director of the OMB at the time, resigned under pressure.The letter that Rice and her colleagues sent asked OPM to detail its overall training and testing policies, as well as its education requirements for cybersecurity jobs. Government agencies have a difficult time recruiting top cybersecurity talent because the compensation and benefits provided by the federal government often pale in comparison to what is offered by tech companies. Removing the requirement of a four-year degree, the representatives said, would allow for more successful recruitment. Rice still hasn’t received a response to the letter of inquiry.

65,POLITICS,Saudis Signal Expanded Executions Policy After Donald Trump's Visit,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saudi-arabia-executions-trump-visit_us_592f2f89e4b0e09b11ed4c83,The president's first trip abroad also appears to have sparked crackdowns in Bahrain and Egypt.,2017-06-01,"Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, King Salman, first lady Melania Trump and President Donald Trump at the opening of the World Center for Countering Extremist Thought in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on May 21.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59301e392100002b006fed6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia this month encouraged the kingdom to expand its controversial use of the death penalty, including toward peaceful protesters, a top human rights advocacy group says.The state has executed 39 people so far this year, according to Reprieve, a London-based nonprofit, which exclusively shared its latest statistics on Saudi executions with HuffPost this week. At the current rate, the kingdom is on track to have executed 2,020 people between the coronation of a new king, Salman, in 2015 and 2030, the target date for a loudly promoted reform plan that promises a more progressive Saudi Arabia but is viewed with skepticism by human rights advocates.Reprieve noted that a contentious terrorism court upheld on Thursday the death sentence of a 23-year-old man with disabilities for protesting in 2012. It’s the first time the Saudis have taken such a step since they included detained dissidents in a mass execution last year, sparking global outrage.Maya Foa, Reprieve’s director, blamed Trump for the Saudis’ apparent new sense of impunity.“International condemnation of the mass killing is thought to have been a key factor in the kingdom’s decision to halt the executions of protesters,” Foa told HuffPost in an emailed statement on Wednesday. “But it appears that president Trump’s recent visit, and his explicit approval of the Saudi regime despite gross human rights abuses, may have emboldened Saudi authorities, who are now signalling their intention to resume protest-related executions.” The jailed protester, Munir Adam, is being punished on the basis of a forced confession he made under torture in a Saudi prison, according to Reprieve. He has one more opportunity to appeal before the king signs his death warrant and he is placed on death row.Trump speaks of the Saudi leg of his first foreign trip as its highlight, and he celebrated the U.S. relationship with the kingdom by delivering a speech parroting Saudi rulers’ worldview and offering them a huge, potentially illegal arms deal. He and his team seem at best blind to the way the authoritarian Saudi regime rules: After Trump returned from the kingdom, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC he was impressed with the lack of protesters on the streets. When an anchor said that might simply reflect the way the Saudis punish dissent, Ross said, “In theory, that could be true.”The Trump administration has said it wants to raise human rights concerns only in private.But critics believe foreign governments will understand that preference to mean that that the U.S. does not care if other countries respect rights, universal standards or the rule of law. Two governments aligned with Saudi Arabia have also taken repressive steps since Trump, a long-time fan of authoritarian tactics and leaders, indicated to their leaders at the Saudi summit that he was willing to embrace them and not “tell other people how to live.”Three days after Trump’s May 21 photo op with the king of Bahrain, Bahraini security forces raided the home of an activist cleric, killing at least one person and arresting hundreds involved in a sit-in demonstration. Officials said the action was necessary because the protesters were harboring fugitives aligned with Iran and refusing to disperse peacefully, but rights watchdogs were not convinced. “Yet again the architects of bloody destabilizing violence in Bahrain appear to be the [U.S.-friendly] Al Khalifa government, and the timing of this operation ― two days after King Hamad’s convivial meeting with President Trump ― can hardly be a coincidence,” Human Rights Watch said.On Wednesday, a Bahraini court prompted further concern when it dissolved a major political opposition group known as Waad or the National Democratic Action Society. “Bahrain is now heading towards total suppression of human rights,” said Lynn Maalouf, an Amnesty International official, in a statement. “The suspension of Waad is a flagrant attack on freedom of expression and association, and further proof that the authorities have no intention of delivering on promises of human rights progress.” Authorities shut down the chief opposition party, Al Wefaq, last summer.Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi has also been busy since the Saudi conference. He authorized new media controls and the arrests of political opponents last week, and on May 29 ratified a brutal new law allowing for far greater government interference in civil society. Foreign criticism, particularly from top members of Congress like Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), appeared to have prevented the ratification for months. But Sisi clearly now feels that the time is right to crack down on dissidents. “Grave damage will be done to U.S. strategic interests in the region if Mr. Sisi is allowed to pocket billions in American aid even as he consolidates what amounts to a totalitarian state,” The Washington Post warned in a May 30 editorial. McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) blasted the ratification in a statement Wednesday.Meanwhile, the Egyptian ruler’s strongman tactics continue to brutalize Americans: At least nine U.S. citizens are in Sisi’s crowded jails. One turned 18 years old there last week.And Saudi executions and other abuses, including the targeting of religious minorities, continue unabated. Reprieve said the kingdom is using capital punishment on people arrested over non-violent alleged crimes, despite international prohibitions on that policy. Many of those put to death this year, it noted, appear to be Pakistani nationals ― which means they may be victims of human trafficking.Trump’s State Department was flummoxed this week when a reporter asked a top official why he would condemn the lack of democracy in Iran but not in Saudi Arabia. A viral clip shows Stuart Jones, the acting head of the agency’s Middle East bureau, pausing for 20 seconds before condemning Iran further.The Saudi Embassy did not respond to a request for comment for this story."

The walls, which will also debut in London, Madrid, Nashville and Cleveland later in June, will each be emblazoned with the #KindComments hashtag so that visitors can use the photo-sharing app to find a “community of support” nearby, according to Instagram’s Chief Operating Officer Marne Levine. The company’s mission, Levine said, is “to strengthen relationships through shared experiences,” and the “rainbow wall” initiative is one of many similar efforts that aim to do just that. “Every day we see members of our community coming to Instagram to share their passions and experiences,” she told HuffPost. “We are extremely proud of our whole community, but we’re especially excited about the way people are using Instagram to spread kindness and compassion for one another.”Levine said she was personally moved by Blake, Tobia and other Instagram users who’ve found unique ways to share coming out stories and other personal experiences on the app. “We’ve seen how images create empathy, bring people closer and promote understanding,” she said. “For Pride, we hope the rainbow walls become physical structures that inspire kind comments and support for Pride, but equally create an opportunity for people to come together on Instagram to support the LGBTQ community.” Find more ways to honor your Pride by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter.

69,THE WORLDPOST,"With Trump Going AWOL On Climate, California Governor Seeks China As An Ally",Matt Sheehan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-california-china-climate-change_us_59301c40e4b0e09b11ee00a5,"Heading to China Friday, Brown told The WorldPost he aims to ramp up cooperation with Beijing on mitigating climate change.",2017-06-01,"Brown speaks during the signing of a first-of-its-kind agreement with leaders from 11 states and global provinces to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius. May 19, 2015, Sacramento.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593025cb1400001f004803d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As President Donald Trump reportedly prepares to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, California Governor Jerry Brown is getting ready to take on the role of America’s de facto climate ambassador. Brown will depart Friday for a week-long visit to China, where he will meet with Chinese leaders and members of the global Under2 Coalition, an ad hoc alliance of countries, states and municipalities committed to taking action to keep global temperature rises within two degrees of pre-industrial averages.While Trump has characterized climate change as a “hoax” created by China, Brown and California have forged numerous climate-action partnerships with Chinese politicians, regulators and scientists. Those partnerships date back as early as 2005 and have involved clean-energy investments, pollution-regulation trainings and sharing of best practices as China builds its first carbon cap-and-trade market this year. In 2013, California became the first subnational body to sign a climate agreement with China’s most powerful economic regulator. Since California and Baden-Württemberg, Germany formed the Under2 Coalition in 2015, two Chinese provinces have joined. Brown will be visiting those provinces and looking to bolster clean energy investment on this China trip.For years, subnational agreements kept the flame of international climate cooperation burning, despite frosty relations between Washington and Beijing on climate. That frost began to thaw in late 2014, when former President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping shook hands on a major bilateral carbon reduction agreement — commitments that cleared the way for the Paris accord a year later. But with Trump now planning to exit that agreement, Brown says the ball is back in California’s court. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has already said that his city will adopt the Paris accord if Trump doesn’t, and Governor Brown will be looking to build on that momentum with his Under2 Coalition.The WorldPost sat down with the governor in Sacramento and asked Brown about working with China on climate. In describing California’s outreach to China, you’ve said California is not merely a state but a nation-state. What does that mean in the context of climate change?California, in terms of its economy, is the fifth largest in the world, with a gross domestic product of more than $2.4 trillion. We have Silicon Valley. We have a fabulous agricultural sector, movies, biotech and many different and diverse businesses and universities. That is a real nation-state.We have a lot to contribute, and now in terms of climate change, we’re taking bold moves to do what we have to do in terms of electric cars, reducing methane and fostering renewable electricity. But of course, with Washington going the other way, we have to intensify all that we’re doing.Do you see agreements like the Under2 Coalition between “networks of the willing” as taking the place of agreements between central governments? Can ad-hoc, non-binding agreements fill that role?That remains to be seen. We’re doing everything we can. With Trump going AWOL on climate change, the rest of the country and the rest of the world have to react, and the reaction has to be to intensify our efforts to decarbonize our economy. Now, we’re not the federal government — we’re a state government. But we’re a powerful state government. We have nine other states that agree with us. We have many other cities that agree.As Trump does his climate denial, that paradoxically is a catalytic force that mobilizes those who don’t agree with him and those who see climate change as the threat I think it is. [That movement] is inverse to Washington, but I believe Washington will very quickly rejoin the rest of the world and fight climate change. The science is not going away. The ice melt is not reversing. So is it a year? A few years? Sooner or later, Washington will get on board.Is the goal of this China trip practical ― getting more provinces to sign onto the Under2 Coalition, symbolic ― showing that Trump doesn’t represent all of America, or both?It has nothing to do with Donald Trump. It has to do with climate change. The Under2 Coalition will have reps in Beijing. We’ll meet, we’ll assess where we are, and we’ll challenge people to intensify their efforts. I’m going to be underscoring the importance of cap-and-trade and California doing everything it can. It’s all part of building momentum to make the grand reversal that we haven’t made yet. We’re still in a fossil fuel rich environment, and we have to temper that and ultimately reverse it.How would you describe the attitude of Chinese leaders in regards to climate change? What has worked well in cooperating with them?Number one, China is motivated primarily by pollution ― horrible and very unhealthy pollution. In cleaning up that carbon pollution, they reduce greenhouse gases. Number two, China has its own scientists, its own academy of sciences. Those Chinese scientists are in total agreement that the climate threat is real and that the life of the Chinese people will be dramatically worse if we don’t do anything.The Himalayas are going to melt, and then China and India will be in conflict. The devastation will be real. Therefore, China is acting, and since it has a powerful type of government, it can make decisions; we want to encourage that and make parallel decisions in California.In terms of California’s potential to impact China and other countries, is the biggest lever California’s personnel and information exchanges or the example it sets by showing that a state can boom while reducing emissions? It’s all of that. It’s the relationships, it’s our influence because of our universities like Stanford and the Universities of California. It’s our productivity and our government regulations on climate change. It’s personnel, and it’s proving that a climate change strategy is good for the economy and good for jobs.The problem is not survival today ― it’s survival tomorrow. Is there enough wisdom to take the action now to make survival possible? That’s the open question. … So we have to get going. That’s why I’m going to do everything I can to encourage China and work with them.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

In refusing to take part, the United States joins just two others ― Nicaragua and Syria (the former because its leaders didn’t think the agreement was strong enough; the latter because it’s in the middle of a brutal civil war).Trump said Thursday he would exit the accord ― which he insists “punishes the United States” ― but left open the idea the U.S. could “negotiate our way back in to Paris” or potentially work to reach some other deal entirely.“We will all sit down and we’ll get back into the deal and we’ll make it good,” said Trump.World leaders, who have been negotiating a global agreement for 25 years, of course may differ on that point. The Paris announcement doesn’t come at a great time for the Trump administration, diplomatically speaking. European leaders’ reception of Trump last week was chilly, making it clear they aren’t very enthusiastic about working with the U.S. This was emphasized even further in the readout from the G-7 summit, wherein the six other nations explicitly distanced themselves from Trump on climate.“The real problem today and the real sadness is the death blow to the international credibility of U.S. leadership,” said Christina Figueres, the former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. “The blow to the international credibility of the United States cannot be underestimated.”Figueres said Thursday’s announcement shows both that the Trump administration has no understanding of how international treaties work from a legal perspective, and that the U.S. loses significant trust among the international community in stepping away. “I think it will be yet one more confirmation for the Europeans that this guy is unreliable,” said Federiga Bindi, a former adviser to the Italian government and a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Transatlantic Relations. “The only solution they have is getting stronger among each other.”World leaders and politicians were quick to condemn Trump’s decision, with many issuing statements on Twitter lamenting the move as a dark day for the planet. France, Germany and Italy came out with a joint statement saying that the Paris Agreement could not be renegotiated.“The U.S. decision to leave the #ParisAgreement is a decision to leave humanity’s last chance of securing our childrens future on this planet,” Sweden’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Margot Wallstrom tweeted.“The science on climate change is perfectly clear: we need more action, not less,” the United Nations Environment Program said in a statement. “This a global challenge. Every nation has a responsibility to act and to act now.”Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced that in a sign of its commitment to the agreement, the French capital’s city hall building would be turned green. London Mayor Sadiq Khan also issued a statement reaffirming the city’s commitment to the agreement and saying he will work with other major metropolises to maintain it. The global outrage over Trump’s decision to exit the deal highlights the potential for diplomatic backlash, as analysts say countries will have reason to doubt the United States’ ability to honor international agreements.“President Trump has turned his back on the world on an issue they care deeply about,” said Andrew Light, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute and former high-ranking State Department official on climate change under President Barack Obama. “This will have repercussions for how other countries respond to the U.S., not just on the climate playing field, but well beyond.”The Paris decision will likely make it harder for Trump to get buy-in from world leaders on the issues he wants to prioritize.“Countries are not going to trust Trump,” said Paul Bledsoe, a top climate official in the Clinton White House and lecturer at the American University Center for Environmental Policy. “This is another validation of the suspicion that Trump is not just unpredictable but untrustworthy. So why should they negotiate trade agreements with him? How can they trust him on security agreements?”“I really don’t believe that foreign leaders believe that Trump is trustworthy. It’s another indication the U.S. cannot be a trusted partner,” he continued.  “Trump will find himself isolated more and more,” said Bindi. “I don’t think Americans put things really in perspective. They tend to think history is 10 years ago, and tend to think America’s leading role in the world is given and it’s going to be there for the rest of time and this is not going to happen.”This move from Trump also gives China the chance to “to cast themselves as the new champions of globalization,” says Andrew Small, a China expert at the German Marshall Fund think tank.“Politically, Beijing sees this as a gift-wrapped opportunity to position itself as a responsible global leader at the expense of the United States,” Small said. “For countries that see climate change as an existential issue ― not least the European leaders who are meeting the Chinese PM for their summit this week ― closer cooperation with China now becomes a necessity.” “I think the Chinese are frankly amazed that the Trump administration keeps handing them these openings,” Small added.There’s also the perception of the U.S. once again walking back from a climate commitment, after famously pulling out of the Kyoto Protocol in 2001. The administration of former President George W. Bush said that move was because Kyoto didn’t include major developing nations like India and China. It took another 14 years to get an agreement that included those nations, only for the U.S. to shirk participating in it.A future U.S. president, of course, could rejoin a climate agreement ― but would have to work very hard to convince international partners the U.S. is serious this time.“The country hurt the most with respect to this decision is the United States,” said Light.

In an open letter Thursday, the mayors of 61 U.S. cities — from Burlington, Vermont, to Los Angeles — promised to meet commitments agreed to under the international accord, namely cutting carbon emissions in an effort to ward off the worst effects of global climate change. “We will intensify efforts to meet each of our cities’ current climate goals, push for new action to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius target, and work together to create a 21st century clean energy economy,” the group of mayors wrote. “The world cannot wait — and neither will we.”Separately, the governors of California, New York and Washington formed a coalition to convene states committed to taking aggressive action to combat climate change. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, a co-signer of the Climate Mayors letter, told HuffPost after Trump’s announcement that in order to meet the Paris objectives, there’s going to have to be a thoughtful, coordinated effort among local leaders. He called Trump’s move a “terrible assault” on America’s commitment to reducing pollution.“The president’s announcement is a call to greater action, not less action. It’s a call to a higher level of sensitivity, not a time for merely frustration,” Reed said. “So what should happen from this result is we should see the gravity of his decisions, because there is no Planet B.”Reed added that he hopes states and communities across the nation realize it’s time to speed up current efforts.“There’s enough low-hanging fruit in America’s major metros to still achieve our CO₂ reductions ... to the tune of about 25 to 35 percent,” he said. “And that’s worth doing.”Also among the dozens of signers was Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, who, during a press conference Wednesday, attempted to dissuade Trump from exiting the Paris pact, saying it would damage America’s reputation as an international leader and put future generations at risk. “No matter what the president decides, I want to make it absolutely clear to the White House and our partners worldwide that the city of Boston won’t back down,” he said. “If this administration turns its back on the environment, cities like Boston will have to step up.” Walsh reaffirmed Boston’s 2014 commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. Other co-signers include Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, Mayor Steve Adler of Austin, Texas, Mayor Jackie Biskupski of Salt Lake City and Mayor William Peduto of Pittsburgh, Pa. In a series of posts to Twitter, Pittsburgh’s mayor blasted Trump’s decision and said, “It’s now up to cities to lead.” In a call with reporters Thursday, California Gov. Jerry Brown called Trump’s decision “tragic” and “insane.” And in the end it could have the opposite of its intended effect, galvanizing cities and the international community to resist Trump’s move and protect the climate, he said. “California will resist,” Brown said, “because his effort is misguided.”Shortly after Trump’s announcement, Brown, along with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, all Democrats, announced the formation of the United States Climate Alliance, a coalition that will bring together states committed to upholding the Paris Agreement. “I am proud to stand with other governors as we make sure that the inaction in D.C. is met by an equal force of action from the states,” Gov. Inslee said in a statement. “Today’s announcement by the president leaves the full responsibility of climate action on states and cities throughout our nation. While the president’s actions are a shameful rebuke to the work needed to protect our planet for our children and grandchildren, states have been and will continue to step up.”California, New York and Washington, which represent nearly a fifth of the U.S. population, are committed to fulfilling America’s promise under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels, the governors wrote in their announcement.In September, former President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, China, where they fortified commitments to reduce carbon emissions by formally joining the Paris Agreement and pledged a “continued bilateral climate cooperation.” That move, along with India’s ratification of the agreement later that month, proved key to the pact taking effect in November. Surprising no one, Trump announced Thursday, at a press conference in the White House Rose Garden, that he would follow through on his campaign promise by breaking America’s promise to the world that it would do its part to curb global climate change. Trump’s move came despite the pleas of big business, state and local leaders, the fossil fuel industry he’s worked so hard to lift up, and even his own daughter. James Brainard, the Republican mayor of Carmel, Indiana, who didn’t sign the Climate Mayors open letter, told HuffPost by phone Thursday that Trump likes to talk about greatness, but great countries take a leadership role. They recognize problems and address them, he said. They work to leave behind a clean environment for future generations. And they don’t, Brainard said, align themselves with countries like Syria and Nicaragua — the only other countries outside the Paris accord. “I think [Trump’s] appealing to a very small percentage of the American electorate when he does this,” he said. “Not only is it a policy mistake that’s bad for the country, I think it’s a political mistake as well.”Nick Robins-Early contributed to this report."
