Don Mahaney, the owner of Scratch Food & Beverage, gave all of his female employees paid time off Wednesday in honor of International Women’s Day and the concurrent “A Day Without A Woman” strike.The business will also use the day to hold an evening fundraiser benefiting Planned Parenthood that will feature a brief bartending appearance by Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto, his office confirmed to The Huffington Post.Mahaney told HuffPost that it was the least he could do to give back to the women who, in his words, “get the short end of the stick from the day they’re born.”“It’s just one day of the year,” he said. “We owe it to them to recognize the basic fact that they get 80 cents to the dollar.” Women are also more likely to be the victims of sex trafficking, he added. “It’s a really unfair world.”He credited his female bar manager, Mandi Crosby, with inspiring him to take charge after she requested the day off so she could attend outside events.“I thought there’s probably a lot of women out there who’d like to take the day off who can’t do so,” he said. “I thought my staff should not have to deal with any of that so if they want the day off they can have it.”Crosby, who Mahaney said is one of seven women among the restaurant’s 11-person staff, applauded his decision.“I think everyone I’ve talked to about it so far thinks it’s a really awesome idea, and super generous of the owner Don to really step forward and say this is how it always should be,” she told local station, WTAE.In the ladies’ absence, Mahaney said that local wellness program, Farm to Table Pittsburgh, will provide male bartenders to cover the women’s shifts, as the fundraiser will take place in the restaurant’s bar area.Those looking to get a drink from Pittsburgh’s mayor will get a chance between 8:15 p.m. and 8:45 p.m., a spokesperson told HuffPost.Mahaney, speaking to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said choosing Planned Parenthood as their event’s beneficiary “just made sense to me.”“They’re a great organization that does a lot to offer general health and reproductive health services and they’re more or less under constant attack,” he told the paper.While Mahaney says most of the public response has been positive, he acknowledged that there have been some critics on social media who accuse them of “reverse sexism” and have asked, “when’s men’s day off?” (International Men’s Day, for the record, is November 19.)“People are entitled to their opinions,” he responded."
1,ENTERTAINMENT,Milo Ventimiglia Advises You To Get The Tissues Ready For The 'This Is Us' Finale,Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/milo-ventimiglia-advises-you-to-get-the-tissues-ready-for-the-this-is-us-finale_us_58b8a290e4b0d2821b4cd4d1,"""Maybe you want a warm blanket or a puppy. Kleenex, probably mandatory.""",2017-03-08,"Mandy Moore as Rebecca and Milo Ventimiglia as Jack on ""This Is Us."" ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bdcc2d1a00003400f41f06.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Warning: “This Is Us” spoilers below.“This Is Us” has captivated TV viewers since its premiere, debuting to rave reviews and great ratings. But there’s one thing fans have been waiting for all season long: the truth about Jack Pearson’s unknown death.Will we finally learn what happened to Milo Ventimiglia’s beloved character on the season finale? During a recent Build Series interview with The Huffington Post, Ventimiglia advised fans to make a tissue run before March 14.“Get ready,” he said of the Season 1 finale. “Get yourself a watching buddy, get some food, which you probably won’t eat. I don’t know, maybe you want a warm blanket or a puppy. Kleenex, probably mandatory. And yeah, get ready, it’s going to be a little stressful.”Ventimiglia said that although “we all know something has happened to Jack,” Papa Pearson will remain on the show for the foreseeable future.“Dan Fogelman, our creator, said to me that no matter what, even though Jack is dead in the present day, that I’m not going anywhere,” he explained. “I think the idea that Fogelman really wanted to do was open up the story so that the characters you guys grow to love have a life beyond actual life. Even though when you do find out how and when and why Jack died, it doesn’t mean that the character is gone or I’m gone, its just you shift direction and tell a different story. He equates it to having a family album ― you open up to a random page and you just start telling a story based on that photo.”Ahead of the finale, Jack and his wife, Rebecca (Mandy Moore), have been facing some ups and downs. After Rebecca reveals her plans to go out on the road to tour with her band ― and her ex Ben ― Jack gets discouraged and seemingly heads down a darker path. “Jack loves his wife and loves his kids, it’s very simple. Those two things are his life ... Those two things are two screws holding him together ― [if] one gets loose or one falls out or one just kind of goes away, his life would start to unravel,” Ventimiglia shared. “They’re a real-life couple. Sure, they’re romantic and they have a storybook romance and life together, but they’re human. They’re flawed. They can break.” Jack’s drinking will also become a problem, Ventimiglia said, if he lets it affect his family unit. “It’s not that he’s a bad man when he’s drinking ― he’s not abusive, he’s not verbal ― he’s just not quite present. And I think when you really plug that into the cracks that are starting to form with Jack and Rebecca, that’s just going to make it worse.” At the end of Episode 17, “What Now?,” we see a seemingly inebriated Jack get into his car and drive off after watching a present-day Kate (Chrissy Metz) tell Toby (Chris Sullivan), “It’s my fault. I’m the reason that he’s dead.”Fogelman told Variety in a cover story this week that the finale is “definitely the darkest place we’ve been.”“There is a scene with Milo and Mandy that I have not seen on television,” he said. “I think it’s going to rock people.”Mandy Moore agreed.“We’re going to destroy America by the end of the season,” she said. “As if they don’t have enough to be upset about at this point in time anyway. But they’re going to be upset for a completely different set of reasons.”Despite what happens in the final episode, Ventimiglia feels so lucky to be a part of a show that reaches a large demographic of people and equates the success of “This Is Us” to the fact that it mirrors real families and their personal situations. “It’s a show that’s built for everyone,” he said, “and then it’s also available to everyone, you know, if you have a TV and bunny ears. It’s very important to me to make sure I show up, I’m present, and I do the best possible job with Jack I can. Just make him a real man.”Watch the full Build Series interview with Milo Ventimiglia below. The “This Is Us” finale airs Tuesday, March 14, at 9 p.m. on NBC. "

The intention to be inclusive is there and appreciated. But there’s an issue with the Marie Curie filter ― she’s inexplicably got a smoky eye and fake eyelashes. Curie was a Nobel Prize-winning pioneer in researching radioactivity. Throwing makeup onto her photo unnecessarily trivializes her accomplishments. It’s as if there needs to be a reminder that this highly accomplished scientist was ― gasp ― a woman.There also are exploding chemicals in the filter, which, considering Curie died from aplastic anemia, believed to be caused by long-term exposure to radiation, seem sort of ill-fitting.Twitter also took issue with the filter:This isn’t the first time Snapchat’s been in hot water with offensive filters. Do better, Snapchat."
3,ENTERTAINMENT,"Chance The Rapper Reminds Us Of Real Homegrown Issues, That Don't Involve Russia","Francis Maxwell, ContributorHost/Writer/Actor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chance-the-rapper-reminds-us-of-real-homegrown-issues_us_58bf2e74e4b0c3276fb77e90,"While we obsess over Trump’s fact-free Twitter accusations, Republicans vow to tear apart public education.",2017-03-08,<p>Governor Rauner has failed to address the issue facing CPS after vetoing legislation last year.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bf32e01e0000400077e5da.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yesterday, Grammy Award-winning artist Chance The Rapper held a press conference at Wescott Elementary in Chicago, specifically so he could talk about the city’s public schools and his plan to help them. This conference came about as a result of what Chance described as an unsuccessful meeting with Illinois governor Bruce Rauner, where Rauner wasn’t especially receptive to Chance’s pleas for more funding for education in Chicago. And so, this “entitled celebrity out of touch with reality” took matters into his own hands, donating $10,000 to 10 different schools, including Westcott, for arts and enrichment programming, whilst encouraging other celebrities and corporations to pitch in.Now, while the donation itself is hugely generous, it also comes at an extremely important time for education funding both in Chicago and throughout the United States. Here is why.The issue of public school funding in Chicago has been a known but largely underreported issue, brought to light briefly last year when Governor Rauner vetoed legislation that would’ve sent the district $215 million that CPS were counting on to close out the school year. Afterwards, but prior to the vocal outrage from Chance, Governor Rauner did zilch to address the situation, and public attention to the problem diminished. But here we have a public figure holding the governor and his fellow government officials accountable, and suddenly the problems facing Chicago’s schools are front and center again.Now go ahead and google “Chance The Rapper”, google “Governor Rauner,” hell google “Chicago Public Schools” and look at what comes up. Is it a coincidence that Governor Rauner released his two proposed ideas to raise the $215million needed to help the cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools, 2 hours before Chance held his own press conference on the matter? As flawed as Rauner’s proposals are, more people will now have incentive to inform themselves as to what Illinois’ governor is planning, and in doing so can identify ways to make their voice heard and join Chance’s cause.Chance represents the millions of concerned Chicago residents who have been vocalizing their outrage for years, but do not have a microphone or platform to speak from, and have had to sit by and watch their schools deteriorate due to financial mismanagement by government officials. He is not willing to see the school year reduced by 3 weeks, or see taxpayers compelled to pay more than already asked of them to account for the teacher pension shortfalls that should be addressed by the state. He is not willing to see Wescott Elementary, the school that Chance donated his first $10,000 to, have its budget frozen. This school of roughly 400 students is set to lose around $80,000 of its funding this year, thanks to a $46 million budget freeze that hit hundreds of buildings, but landed hard on schools with mostly poor and minority students. These cuts mean schools such as Wescott will have to drop a variety of after school programs, math & reading tutoring and professional development, leaving these kids without adult-supervised after school activities which could potentially put them in danger.But there is another thing I took from Chance’s public display. It represents an important reminder that while the world is caught up in Trump's latest fact-free accusations, there is real legislation being drafted to eradicate public education and use taxpayer money to fund private education. In the past few weeks, while we have been feasting on whatever Trump fiction is fed to us, bills such as HR 610 which would use our tax dollars to fund private schools and religious schools, and HR 899 to terminate the Department of Education, have been introduced. So not only is Chance the Rapper’s generosity important from a financial standpoint, it is crucial in reigniting the conversation surrounding public education that has gone stagnant just because it does not involve Russia. Ignoring public education in favor of the latest Russia news plays right into the hands of Republicans who don’t care about schools, well except for the private schools that they want to give your tax dollars to. Yeah you know, those wealthy kids from well to-do families, are now going to get even more money while the kids in public school aren’t going to have standardized textbooks, after school programs, and as Chance highlights, are at risk of losing vital days in the school year itself. These Republicans in the House of Representatives are happy to let Trump and his itchy Twitter trigger fingers run rampant and divert our attention while they calmly inflict drastic cuts on the most vulnerable populations.That is why celebrity gestures like Chance The Rapper’s are so important. Because he has the power to spark outrage and refocus attention on the conversation surrounding public education that at times becomes buried unless brought to light by a Betsy DeVos mishap or a celebrity speaker. So credit to you, Chance. Not like I needed more of a reason to be a fan, but you the man.Follow me on IG @francismmaxwell & Twitter @francis_maxwell."

We all have the power to be superwoman – but sometimes it takes an experience to ignite the fire within us. From overcoming obstacles to breaking barriers, there is no limit to what we can accomplish when we believe in ourselves and support each other. That spirit of helping each other is what The BOSS Network is all about. BOSS is an acronym for “Bringing Out Successful Sisters,” and the network provides a community of entrepreneurial and professional women who support each other through online and event-based networking. With a special interest in encouraging more women of color to interrupt the white male dominated technology industry, the organization hosted the first event of their year-long tech series called The Launch Summit in January. As one who studied public relations in college, I’ve never thought of myself as a woman in technology because I wasn’t coding or computing. But after attending The Launch Summit, I realized I had a one-sided view of what a woman in tech looked like. While there were some who worked in traditional tech fields such as engineering or computer information systems, the room was filled with women who used technology to build their businesses, brands and network in different ways. Looking around the room at the beautiful, melanin-pigmented faces inspired me to think bigger. As a blogger and social media marketer, I finally saw that I too was a woman in tech.More than a hundred women of color gathered in Atlanta to have insightful conversations about the tech-preneur journey, building an online brand, pursuing a career in technology and more at the half-day event. The presenters encouraged attendees to be tech savvy – having a business perspective on technology and knowing how to leverage it to create value. This includes learning the analytics behind the business, such as metrics and conversion rates, and understanding basic principles of coding. “Learn how to package your expertise and use technology to work for you,” said panelist Emmelie De La Cruz, a personal branding strategist and business auditor. “Build a business without you having to operate so you can make money while you sleep.” Cruz recommends e-books, webinars and email sales funnels to help grow a business using technology. Tactics to secure funding was another necessary discussion at The Launch Summit, and panelists encouraged the use of crowdfunding, pitch competitions, angel investors and grants to fund startups. “In 2016, 80% of new businesses were founded by Black and Latina women, yet only .2% of Black and Latina owned businesses received venture funding,” said Cameka Smith, founder of The BOSS Network.“We have to let the tech community know that women of color are here and that our ideas are both valid and investment-worthy. At the same time, however we have to give women the tools to continue to build and think until the market catches up with our potential.”Those tools include helping younger techies after reaching success like Kathryn Finney, recipient of the 2017 BOSS Network Minority Female in Technology Award, is doing. As the Founder and Managing Director of Atlanta-based, digitalundivided, Finney implements programs to increase the active participation of women of color in tech.The BOSS Network sought to combat the lack of funding women of color face when starting businesses with their Elevator Pitch Competition, which was also sponsored by Prudential and Black Enterprise. Five brave attendees competed in the small business start-up challenge, which awarded more than $5,000 in cash and business support. The top-prize winner, Nicole Sanchez founder of E Credit Hero, started a free credit repair program that helps fix errors on credit reports. “Watching the pitch competition excited me to follow the competitors’ entrepreneurial journeys, and even inspired me to enter into competitions for my business,” says Rochelle Valsaint, Creator of The Inc Life Box, a subscription box service for Black women entrepreneurs that will launch this summer. “What was valuable and beautiful to see and feel was this gathering of women sharing knowledge and encouraging one another.” Over 75,000 women across the world subscribes to the BOSS mailing list and across America there are countless women connecting at events like The Launch Summit, which will also stop in Houston and Austin in 2017. Like my view of women in tech, society fails to see how multifaceted and unique women around the world are. Our resilience and strength is admirable despite the inequality and misogyny that we are forced to deal with. During International Women’s Day and the other 364 remaining days of each year, we need to celebrate the brilliance and beauty of women across the globe. And commend organizations, like The BOSS Network, that are redefining societal perspectives about women’s roles and abilities.From the project manager at Google in Silicon Valley to an ecommerce marketer to an entrepreneur who uses tech innovations to transform health care – there is no one type of woman in tech just like there is no one type of woman around the world.And when we support, celebrate and love one another, we continue the infinite circle of girl power that reminds us that we can do, see and be anything that we want.Lifestyle blogger and published author Teyonna Ridgeway is dedicated to helping people recognize their beauty and unleash their brilliance.

The top-prize winner, Nicole Sanchez founder of E Credit Hero, started a free credit repair program that helps fix errors on credit reports. “Watching the pitch competition excited me to follow the competitors’ entrepreneurial journeys, and even inspired me to enter into competitions for my business,” says Rochelle Valsaint, Creator of The Inc Life Box, a subscription box service for Black women entrepreneurs that will launch this summer. “What was valuable and beautiful to see and feel was this gathering of women sharing knowledge and encouraging one another.” Over 75,000 women across the world subscribes to the BOSS mailing list and across America there are countless women connecting at events like The Launch Summit, which will also stop in Houston and Austin in 2017. Like my view of women in tech, society fails to see how multifaceted and unique women around the world are. Our resilience and strength is admirable despite the inequality and misogyny that we are forced to deal with. During International Women’s Day and the other 364 remaining days of each year, we need to celebrate the brilliance and beauty of women across the globe. And commend organizations, like The BOSS Network, that are redefining societal perspectives about women’s roles and abilities.From the project manager at Google in Silicon Valley to an ecommerce marketer to an entrepreneur who uses tech innovations to transform health care – there is no one type of woman in tech just like there is no one type of woman around the world.And when we support, celebrate and love one another, we continue the infinite circle of girl power that reminds us that we can do, see and be anything that we want.Lifestyle blogger and published author Teyonna Ridgeway is dedicated to helping people recognize their beauty and unleash their brilliance.

8,POLITICS,Tom Perez Joins White House Protest Against Trump's New Travel Ban,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-perez-trump-travel-ban-protest_us_58be1d64e4b09ab537d64aba,The new Democratic National Committee chair is keeping his promise to support the party’s activist base.,2017-03-07,"Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Tom Perez joins demonstrators outside of the White House on March 6, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58be200c1500003716abd95b.jpeg?cache=E53mwliC5G&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez spoke at a White House rally against President Donald Trump’s new travel ban on Monday evening, adding firepower to continuing protests against the president.The speech, Perez’s first appearance at a demonstration after winning a contentious race to lead the party last month, delivered on a campaign promise to bring the Democratic Party closer to the grassroots, anti-Trump activism movement.“We’ve spent so much time since January 20th, we see America at its worst, but then we come here and we see America at its best,” Perez told a crowd of hundreds in Lafayette Square Park in front of the White House. “I see people all over this country standing up and taking notice and saying, ‘You know what, Mr. Trump, history has its eye on you. And you know what, Mr. Trump, America is at its best when we are building bridges of opportunity and not walls of distrust.’”Trump’s travel ban, which freezes refugee admissions for 120 days, resonated with Perez, the DNC’s first Latino chair, because his grandparents left the Dominican Republic to escape a “brutal dictator,” he said. “America was that land of opportunity, just like it’s been for everybody else,” Perez said. “And that is why for me, this isn’t just a matter of interpretation of the Constitution, it is about who we are as a nation.”The rally was organized by Yasmine Taeb, a human rights lobbyist for the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker advocacy organization, and featured more than a dozen other speakers from progressive and civil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Our Revolution, MoveOn.org, Lambda Legal, National People’s Action and the Jewish group Bend the Arc.Perez said at a Jan. 18 debate sponsored by The Huffington Post that the Democratic Party should be involved in “protests” and “direct action” against Trump. Ten days later, he joined a protest against Trump’s first travel ban at the airport in Houston. Perez has taken pains to assuage the concerns of party leaders who backed his chief rival, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, immediately naming Ellison deputy DNC chair. Taeb, a Democratic national committeewoman from Virginia who voted for Ellison, invited Perez to the rally. She said he canceled a previous engagement to attend.“That to me shows that he really values what the grassroots thinks and says, and he wants to make sure that he’s standing with us as we’re protesting and resisting,” Taeb said. “He not only spoke, but he actually stayed, and that, to me, means a lot.”There were no significant disturbances at the hastily arranged event, which drew local activists holding homemade signs with messages like, “Deport White Nationalists.”Initially rally organizers convened at the edge of the sidewalk directly in front of the White House, but, without explanation, the Secret Service closed that part of the park. In response, there were shouts of “shame” and groans from many activists, but leaders and speakers quietly complied.Trump’s new travel ban, which goes into effect on March 16, is a significant climb-down from the expansive order in late January that embroiled the country’s airports in chaos. That travel ban was stopped in federal court a few days after it was enacted. The new ban will prohibit entry for non-visa holders from Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria for 90 days. Unlike the first prohibition, it will not apply to Iraq or to people with visas that predate the ban. It also does not exempt religious minorities from the refugee admission freeze.Those at Monday evening’s demonstration made clear, however, that they do not see this order as fundamentally different than the first. They argued that the countries Trump singled out, all of which are majority-Muslim, shows that the intent of the order is still to keep Muslims out.Joanne Lin, legislative counsel at the ACLU’s Washington office, called the executive order, Trump’s “second Muslim ban” and predicted it would meet a fate similar to the first.“For some reason, President Trump and his advisers like losing and they like losing badly, over and over again,” Lin said."
9,THE WORLDPOST,Asylum Seeker Children At Risk In Israel’s ‘Baby Warehouses’,"Gaëlle Faure, Women & Girls Hub",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/israel-baby-warehouses_us_58bf3270e4b0ed718267eff7,"Every day in Tel Aviv, about 5,000 children of asylum seekers attend daycare centers run by women with little or no training",2017-03-07,"Inside one of the unlicensed, overcrowded daycare centers that are often the only childcare option for asylum seeker mothers working in Tel Aviv.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bf33391d000026007cd04e.jpeg?cache=fCPrqAHdi4&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every day in Tel Aviv, about 5,000 children of asylum seekers attend daycare centers run by women with little or no training. Recent reports of infant deaths at some of these makeshift nurseries have caused a public uproar, but little action from the government.People call them pirate nurseries – or even “baby warehouses.” All over southern Tel Aviv, in apartments and in basements, overworked, underpaid women tend to the babies of Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers who can’t afford regular daycare. Most of these makeshift daycares are overcrowded, lacking in basic resources, and staffed by women with no training – a combination that can be dangerous for the children in their care.Every year for the past few years, Israeli media outlets have reported cases of infants dying in these makeshift daycares, often from choking. A spate of five deaths in 2015 and another two deaths in two days this past summer led to a public outcry, but little change.“We don’t want to send our children there, but we have no choice,” says Helen Kidane, an Eritrean asylum seeker who serves as director of the Eritrean Community Women’s Center and works as a house cleaner. “We have to work long hours to feed our children. Many of the Eritrean women are single mothers. We mainly work as house cleaners, and don’t make nearly enough to pay for Israeli daycares.”Activists estimate that there are about 80 to 90 makeshift daycares in Tel Aviv, where Israel’s more than 40,000 Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers are concentrated. They live in legal limbo: Because Israel is a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, the authorities can’t send them back to their home countries, which are considered too dangerous. Yet – apart from a tiny number of cases – their asylum requests have gone unanswered. Instead, thousands of Eritrean and Sudanese men have been sent to a detention center in the Negev desert, with the end goal of trying to convince them to leave for third countries, namely Rwanda and Uganda.Female asylum seekers, who mainly hail from Eritrea, are spared from detention. Instead, they’re left to fend for themselves as they wait for asylum that may never be granted. When the child of an asylum seekers turns three, he or she can start attending Israel’s public preschools. But before then, parents are on their own when it comes to daycare. Which is why, every day, more than 4,000 children attend the makeshift daycares that are owned and run by women who come from all over West Africa.“Most of these daycares are awful. There are no safety standards, no health standard, and no pedagogy whatsoever,” says Rachel Gutman, development director at UNITAF, an NGO that runs two legitimate daycare centers for asylum seekers’ kids – both with long waiting lists. “I am not blaming them. Most of these women [running the makeshift daycares] have never set foot in a [regular] daycare in their lives – it’s a uniquely Western phenomenon. So they don’t know that there is a correct teacher-to-child ratio, or that children must play outdoors for part of the day, or be picked up. They don’t know how to feed them correctly, and they don’t know how to stimulate them and help them develop.”The makeshift daycares don’t have regular hours – parents often drop off their children very early in the morning, and pick them up late at night. Some leave their children there for weeks at a time, while they go to work in different towns.With its two proper daycare centers, which receive assistance from the Tel Aviv municipality, UNITAF is hoping to set a new standard. The NGO has trained women who formerly ran makeshift daycares, and has set them up in better facilities. The daycares have strict hours of operation: 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Parents pay 850 shekels ($220) per month for each child. While much cheaper than regular Israeli daycares, which usually cost about $500 a month, that’s still higher than the rates for makeshift daycares, which range from 300 to 650 shekels ($75 to $170) per month.The Israeli government has pledged to fund UNITAF-style daycare for 1,700 asylum-seeker children over four years. The first one of these daycares opened in December, and currently serves 244 children. But for now, the vast majority of asylum seekers’ kids are still stuck in sub-standard care.With childcare options so limited for asylum seekers, NGO Elifeletis tackling the problem at the root – by supporting the makeshift daycares in the hopes of improving them from the inside. Founder Yael Gvirtz was working as a journalist in 2012 when she learned that someone had attacked a makeshift daycare with a Molotov cocktail while children were sleeping inside. No children were injured, but the apartment was damaged. Gvirtz and other Israeli volunteers helped the woman running the daycare find a new location and renovate it.“I was completely shocked by this hate crime, and by the awful conditions these babies and children are locked in,” she says. “So I quit my job and started Elifelet.”These days, she and about 200 volunteers help out at 14 makeshift daycares around Tel Aviv. “We ask them what they need. We buy food, or make medical arrangements. We never tell them ‘do this or do that,’” says Gvirtz. “But when they see our volunteers taking the babies out of the beds and into their arms, or reading them a story, they learn by observation.”Gvirtz says that after the recent spate of infant deaths, authorities have carried out more frequent safety inspections at the daycare centers, which are only loosely regulated by the government. The inspectors often tell the women who run them to make a number of expensive upgrades to comply with safety regulations or face being shut down.“When they are forced to shut down, the women go find another place, and it will probably be even worse than the one before, because changing apartments costs them money,” Gvirtz says. She believes the Israeli government is to blame for putting asylum-seeker mothers and their children in this situation. “The government refuses to register these babies in any way, so it renders them transparent,” she says. “And since they’re off the radar, that means Israel is not responsible for their rights – whether it’s their medical rights or their educational rights.”For Kidane, the director of the Eritrean Community Women’s Center, it’s personal. “Honestly, in general, [politicians] hate our children,” she says. “They don’t want to see our kids grow up and stay here.”Israeli politicians have referred to asylum seekers as “infiltrators,” with one minister calling them a “cancer” on the nation in 2012. In August 2016, Israel’s defense minister, Avigdor Liberman, issued a ban on members of the armed forces volunteering with asylum seekers’ children, saying: “Charity should begin at home.”Kidane has a young daughter who was born in Israel. She is now 3 years old, and attends a public preschool. But Kidane still hopes that peace will come to Eritrea so she can go back before her daughter grows up. “I pray that I can leave before she understands everything,” says Kidane. “Before she knows that she is different from the others, and that she isn’t accepted here.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

As for the weapon she was seen holding, Tyler said it was a pellet gun and that she didn’t fire it.Jeramie Scott, who serves as national security counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit research organization that specializes in government and commercial use of drones, didn’t entirely agree that the woman’s privacy wasn’t being violated.“There are laws on the books, called Peeping Tom laws, that address voyeurism, but they don’t necessarily go far enough to address what’s happening here,” he told HuffPost.“If you look at the angle of the video, you actually wouldn’t be able to see into this person’s home without the drone,” he said. “Just because the drone was able to peer into her home from a potentially public vantage point, doesn’t mean that that individual didn’t have a reasonable expectation of privacy that was violated.”Scott suggested that without stricter laws against such acts, drone users “may feel more emboldened given that they can remain in a position of immunity.”“It raises an issue of identifying the actual user of the drone,” he said. “The [Federal Aviation Administration] now requires individuals to register their drone, but they only require the registration number to be on the drone.”The issue with that, he added, is that that the registration number “doesn’t necessarily have to be visible.”Allen Kenitzer, a public affairs officer at the FAA, said, “All I can tell you at this time is that the FAA is looking into it.”HuffPost has reached out to the 59-year-old woman who made the police complaint as well as to the individual who appears to have sold the clip to video distributor, ViralHog, and will update the story if we get a response.Though the video may be entertaining, it also serves as a reminder that when flying a drone, it’s generally a good idea to respect people’s personal boundaries.The Academy of Model Aeronautics, a nonprofit organization that promotes model aviation, strictly discourages pilots from filming or photographing people or property if there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. An exception would be if the pilot obtains written permission from the individual being filmed.City officials in Bellevue suggest discussing the matter with the drone’s pilot to come to a resolution before calling local authorities.“A simple conversation may eliminate misunderstandings,” the city advises on its website.People have tried to shoot down drones before. Cases in which the shooter was actually successful have been reported in New Jersey, Kentucky, Virginia and California."

Not only the titular Jane, but her mother, Xiomara, her grandmother, Alba, and Petra, the mother of her son’s half-siblings. (See? Plot twists.) In the first season of “Jane,” Petra’s cast as the villain, the ambitious ex-wife of Raphael, the man Jane’s having a baby with. She’s a sharp dresser with business acumen and great hair. But she’s more than all that; she’s also lovelorn. As actress Yael Grobglas explained of her character in an interview with The Huffington Post, “she’s not just doing evil to do evil.” The show uses Petra to explore issues like thorny pregnancy and postpartum depression. “Every time I’ve tried to predict what’s on the show, and I consider myself a pretty creative person, I’ve always been wrong,” Grobglas said. With “down-to-earth characters mixed with huge, telenovela moments,” there’s plenty of room for the characters to learn and grow. This way, they don’t fall into cliche; heroes are never just heroes, mothers are never just mothers, and villains are never just villains. Below, Grobglas talks about playing a mother on screen, and ― oh yeah ― the show’s bold three-year jump.What first interested you about the role of Petra?When I first heard about the role of Petra, I didn’t know what was going to happen with her, I had no idea. I knew she was going to be the villain. I was a little hesitant about taking the role of a villain that could potentially go for ― if you’re lucky ― seven years, 10 years. And then I got on the phone with [showrunner] Jennie Urman, who told me Petra was never going to be two-dimensional, she would always be very complex, she’d be hated one moment and loved the next.She’s really been so wonderful about keeping up with that. I would have never expected everything with Petra to happen.Speaking of unexpected turns, last season you were given an extra part on the show, as Petra’s twin sister, Anezka. I had no idea that was happening. I got the script, like we usually do, one or two days before we started filming, and I read that Petra was disguising herself and getting ready to run away. I thought it was because of her postpartum depression, and I was getting a little worried, because my first go-to thought is that I’m going to get killed off. I think that about everything. And then Anezka shows up at the end of the episode, and suddenly there’s two of me. For a week beforehand, people who got the script before me were kind of trying to be nonchalant, going, “So, uh, did you read next episode?” And I was like, “No, Jesus, why?” So I spoke to Jennie and she described her to me, and I was like, what is this character, what is she about? And she spoke about the accent, and she spoke about being a ferocious eater, and having personal space issues, and scratching people, and jumping backwards ― I call it “getting the fear” ― and immediately thought, I know somebody like that. I based her off my cat. And that’s how Anezka came to be.Is it difficult to toggle between those two very different parts, or is it mostly just exciting?I have so much more appreciation for people who do this long-term. I never thought about it, but as an actor I depend so much on my costars, and when you’re doing scenes with yourself, you have nobody to play off. You have to come so well-prepared, and predict what you’re going to do. You touched on this a little already but both Petra and Anezka could be described as the show’s sympathetic villains. How do you approach playing a villain without making her seem purely evil?I think the most important thing is really in the writing. The way Jennie explained it to me when we had our first conversation was that Petra was the hero of her own story. She really started the show at her most desperate point, she’s in love with someone and he’s leaving her. But she decides to have herself inseminated, and that goes horribly wrong, obviously. So most of her actions, as crazy as they may seem, are justified, to her. It’s not that much of a challenge for me, with such great writing. She’s not just doing evil to do evil. And if you think about it, most of the crazy stuff she’s done is actually kind of selfless. It’s been to help her mother, or to protect her daughters, protect Raphael.You mentioned her daughters ― this season we get to see another side of Petra, that of a confident and loving mother. How do you think motherhood fits in with everything else we know about Petra?I think it’s been so fascinating, because the show manages to capture so many different aspects of what it is to be a mother. Everything went one way for Jane, and then Petra was a way to show a very different approach to motherhood. From the beginning, Jane’s birthing scene and Petra’s birthing scene couldn’t have been more opposite, and then she struggled with postpartum depression, which I thought was so wonderfully done, and such an interesting subject, and something that so many people suffer from.And she doesn’t have the support system that Jane has; all she has is her crazy mother and crazy sister, left with twins, pretty much alone. I thought it was just wonderful that after the three-year jump, we see her almost dealing with motherhood as if it’s a business project. She’s like, I got this, I can do this. The three-year jump was such a curveball! Was it a curveball for you, too?Oh, absolutely. It was so interesting. As a cast, we had a very hard time dealing with knowing that we were losing Brett [Dier] as a cast member, that Michael was going to go. It was kind of a double thing, because we’re so attached to our characters that by now Michael is like a friend of ours. We care about our characters so much, Petra’s like a friend of mine. And that’s how we feel about Michael. It was almost like we’re about to lose someone we very much care about. So we were mourning Michael, and then also mourning the fact that we’re not going to see Brett every day. So that took some time for me to get over. But then I absolutely loved how they dealt with it. It gave us all a chance to refresh our characters, and find them in a completely new place, and give them this whole new world, from zen Raphael to perfect-mother Petra. I also wanted to ask about Jane and Petra’s relationship. They don’t always get along, but they don’t get into too many petty catfights, either. Do you have any thoughts on how relationships between women are usually portrayed on TV, and how “Jane the Virgin” manages to combat those stereotypes?I think there are many different ways that female relationships are portrayed on TV. I think what’s great about Jane and Petra is that they didn’t go in the direction of they hit it off right away, they’re best friends, maybe they have an argument now and then but they’re best friends for life, and they also don’t hate each other. It’s kind of not here, not there. It’s almost like they need each other in spite of themselves. Petra has a hard time admitting it to herself and to Jane, but she has this great respect for Jane. Jane is someone that she needs in her life. She has a hard time admitting that, because Jane basically has everything Petra doesn’t have.They have these beautiful moments, and they have hard moments. It’s not a completely natural relationship, but you see that when something really difficult happens, something that’s actually life-or-death, they’re there for each other. "

Police said the 61-year-old suspect may have slashed more than 100 bike tires in a 30-day period, according to Local10.com.Officials now say there’s video evidence linking Merriam to the tire slashings and to the swastika keying that happened the same day, according to NBC Miami.The swastika keyings happened in a neighborhood that is predominantly Jewish, according to CBS Miami.One of the victims, Doug Eaton, told the station he believed the swastikas were a message of hate.“Obviously it was intended to offend our neighbors,” Eaton said. “We’re not Jewish but the majority of this neighborhood is Jewish and that’s what it was designed to do. It was designed to offend them and it’s a very offensive sign and it’s going to upset a lot of people around here.” Merriam, 61, faces five counts of criminal mischief and seven counts of criminal mischief with an impairment of business operations. It’s possible that hate crime charges could be added.Police said Merriam admitted to both slashing the tires and keying the vehicles.Jail records show that Merriam is being held on $11,000 bond."

The day-long event included several panels and speakers, with the university’s president Drew G. Faust giving the opening remarks. “Harvard was directly complicit in slavery from the college’s earliest days in the 17th century,” said Faust, according to The Harvard Crimson. “This history and its legacy have shaped our institution in ways we have yet to fully understand.”Research conducted by Harvard students in 2007 revealed that two Harvard presidents actually owned slaves on the campus, and that the university periodically accepted large donations from wealthy slave owners. Coates, who was the keynote speaker at the conference, reportedly received loud applause when he called on Harvard and other complicit institutions to pay reparations for slavery. “I think every single one of these universities needs to make reparations,” Coates said.“I don’t know how you conduct research that shows that your very existence is rooted in a great crime, and just say well, shrug—and maybe at best say ‘I’m sorry’—and you walk away.”Coates added that he believes it’s important that institutions not shy away from this discussion, uncomfortable as it may be. “I think you need to use the language of reparation,” he said. “I think it’s very, very important to actually say that word, to acknowledge that something was done in these institutions.”"
16,POLITICS,"Racism Has No Place In Jury Deliberations, Supreme Court Finds",Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-racism-jury-deliberations_us_58bdda0ae4b033be1467bbc8,"Judges can scrutinize verdicts when jurors may have let racial biases taint decisions, the court says.",2017-03-07,"Justice Anthony Kennedy, second from left, said the Constitution empowers judges to question racially charged statements made by jurors during secret deliberations in a criminal case.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58be01261900003300bd7221.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a decision that should send ripples through the criminal justice system, the Supreme Court ruled Monday that the Constitution empowers judges in criminal cases to scrutinize racist statements made by jurors during jury deliberations.Such deliberations, held in secret and without the presence of judges, are largely shielded from court review under the “no impeachment” rule. The general principle behind it is that the jury system would suffer if judges were constantly second-guessing what jurors decide behind closed doors.But in a 5-to-3 ruling, the Supreme Court looked at its precedents and found a constitutional exception to that rule whenever there is evidence that a juror exhibited racial bias in voting to convict a defendant.“This Court’s decisions demonstrate that racial bias implicates unique historical, constitutional, and institutional concerns,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in his opinion, which conceded that the jury system is human and thus can be flawed. “An effort to address the most grave and serious statements of racial bias is not an effort to perfect the jury but to ensure that our legal system remains capable of coming ever closer to the promise of equal treatment under the law that is so central to a functioning democracy.”The ruling ― joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan ― is highly readable and was replete with the kind of language Kennedy reserves for landmark rulings, such as those he has authored on gay marriage and affirmative action in higher education.“It must become the heritage of our Nation to rise above racial classifications that are so inconsistent with our commitment to the equal dignity of all persons,” Kennedy wrote.The case arose after two Colorado jurors in the criminal trial of a Latino, Miguel Peña-Rodriguez, reported to his attorney that another juror had made “anti-Hispanic” comments during deliberations. The defendant had just been convicted of harassment and unlawful sexual contact with two teenage girls.According to those jurors, the biased juror had expressed his belief that Peña-Rodriguez was guilty because “Mexican men had a bravado that caused them to believe they could do whatever they wanted with women” and that “he did it because he’s Mexican and Mexican men take whatever they want.” He had also referred to the defendant as “an illegal,” even though he was legally in the country.Colorado courts refused to accept these jurors’ revelations to contest the verdict and let Peña-Rodriguez’s conviction stand. He was sentenced to two years’ probation and was required to register as a sex offender.Recognizing that every state and the federal government follow a version of the no-impeachment rule, the Supreme Court nonetheless said it was its responsibility to “enforce the Constitution’s guarantee against state-sponsored racial discrimination in the jury system.” “A constitutional rule that racial bias in the justice system must be addressed — including, in some instances, after the verdict has been entered — is necessary to prevent a systemic loss of confidence in jury verdicts, a confidence that is a central premise of the Sixth Amendment trial right,” Kennedy wrote.The high court cautioned that not just any “offhand comment indicating racial bias or hostility” during deliberations will allow a defendant to challenge his or her verdict ― but only those statements in which “racial animus was a significant factor in the juror’s vote to convict.”Kennedy’s opinion left it up to the states to determine the proper procedures in similar cases moving forward. The court also noted that there are already safeguards in the criminal process to screen out and contain biased jurors ― such as the jury selection process and the instructions judges give prior to deliberations.In a dissenting opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the text of the Constitution did not compel the majority’s conclusion.“In its attempt to stimulate a thoughtful, rational dialogue on race relations ... the Court today ends the political process and imposes a uniform, national rule,” Thomas wrote. “The Constitution does not require such a rule. Neither should we.”Justice Samuel Alito, in a separate dissenting opinion joined by Thomas and Chief Justice John Roberts, called the decision “well-intentioned” but said the ruling will undermine the finality of jury verdicts and may lead to a slippery slope of similar challenges ― for example, if there’s evidence that a juror expressed sexist or religiously bigoted views during deliberations.“Today’s decision — especially if it is expanded in the ways that seem likely — will invite the harms that no-impeachment rules were designed to prevent,” Alito wrote. He noted that jurors, unlike judges and attorneys, are ordinary people who should be allowed “to speak, debate, argue, and make decisions the way ordinary people do in their daily lives.”But Kennedy and the majority saw things differently, singling out racial discrimination as “especially pernicious in the administration of justice” ― bad enough that not even everyday jurors should be allowed to use it against a defendant.“It is the mark of a maturing legal system that it seeks to understand and to implement the lessons of history,” Kennedy wrote."

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rod-rosenstein-trump-doj-russia_us_58bdb60be4b09ab537d588a3,"“If it’s America against Russia or America against any other country, I think everyone in this room knows which side I'm on.""",2017-03-07,Rod Rosenstein is the nominee for deputy attorney general.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bed9351500003b16abdacd.jpeg?cache=KRjtZCDwMY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Several Senate Democrats on Tuesday backed a longtime federal prosecutor nominated by President Donald Trump to fill the No. 2 position in the Justice Department, where he’d oversee the federal investigation into connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Rod Rosenstein, currently the top federal prosecutor in Maryland, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday morning he is open to appointing a special counsel to investigate Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election if necessary. “I’m willing to appoint a special counsel ... whenever I determine that it’s appropriate based upon the policies and procedures of the Justice Department,” Rosenstein told the committee.However, he didn’t commit to appointing a special counsel and said, at this point, he didn’t see a specific reason he couldn’t oversee such an investigation.If confirmed, Rosenstein would become deputy attorney general, a crucial role just under Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Last week, Sessions recused himself from any investigations connected to Trump’s presidential campaign, meaning the probe of connections between Trump associates and Russian officials would fall to Rosenstein. Rosenstein, 52, is a Harvard Law graduate who served as U.S. attorney in Maryland under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Rosenstein would replace former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who was fired by Trump while serving as acting attorney general because she refused to defend Trump’s travel ban.At this point, Rosenstein’s confirmation as deputy attorney general seems like a pretty sure thing. He was introduced to the Senate Judiciary Committee by two Maryland Democrats, Sens. Benjamin Cardin and Chris Van Hollen. Cardin said he was “confident” of Rosenstein’s judgment, and Van Hollen said Rosenstein would uphold the public trust.Still, many Democrats had questions for Rosenstein about how he’d handle the ongoing Russia investigation. Saying political affiliation was “irrelevant” to his work, Rosenstein told the committee that he would ensure there were independent prosecutors conducting any investigation, including the Russia probe.“I know this is the issue du jour on Capitol Hill, but I anticipate that if I were the deputy attorney general, we’d have a lot of matters coming to the Department over time, and I would approach them all the same way,” Rosenstein said. “I would evaluate the facts and the law, consider the applicable regulations, consult with career professionals in the Department, and then exercise my best judgment if I were acting attorney general or provide my best advice to the attorney general if he were not recused about what I believe is the right course of action.”Rosenstein, who said he had not had any conversations with Sessions about the Russia issue, said he is not yet in a position to decide whether a special prosecutor is necessary. But Rosenstein said he’d be willing to appoint a special counsel if necessary, based on the procedures at the Justice Department. “If it’s America against Russia or America against any other country, I think everyone in this room knows which side I’m on,” Rosenstein said during the hearing.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she believes a special prosecutor is necessary. “There is a real danger, I believe, that the Department of Justice could become politicized,” Feinstein said. But Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday it is “far too soon to tell at this time” whether a special counsel is necessary. "
19,POLITICS,Trump’s New Travel Ban Could Hinder Research On HIV And Mental Health,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-travel-ban-science-research_us_58bf2623e4b0d1078ca1debe,"Trump is ""throwing a lot of marbles for us to walk around,” said one frustrated researcher.",2017-03-07,"Columbia law student Kate Berry said they can't continue ""this crucial research without the individual who will actually be carrying out the research.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bf268e1e00002a0077e592.jpeg?ops=crop_42_427_5399_2856%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A scientist at Harvard Medical School planned to keep on collaborating with Iranian academics on HIV/AIDS research. Scholars at Columbia Law School’s human rights clinic wanted to study the impact of armed conflict on the mental health of people in Yemen, a country in the midst of a deadly civil war. And thousands of students from Muslim-majority countries hoped to attend American universities.When President Donald Trump signed a temporary ban on travel from seven countries in January, all those plans were thrown into disarray. And although the revised ban, announced Monday, represents a major political defeat, it still leaves research projects in flux. Researchers warn that it’s likely to disrupt academic and medical work — more than 7,000 doctors from the now-six impacted countries are practicing in the U.S. — while discouraging bright students from coming to the United States.The new travel ban, which goes into effect on March 16, will last for 90 days and apply to Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It will cover only those who have not already obtained visas, although even they can apply for a waiver.At Columbia Law, researchers have partnered with the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, a Yemeni think tank, to look into how Yemen’s deadly civil war is affecting its citizens’ mental health. The need for this work is “urgent,” law student Kate Berry told U.S. senators last month. Several researchers from Yemen were supposed to come to the U.S. for a workshop last week. But the event was postponed because of the original travel ban, and any rescheduling depends on whether the researchers will be able to enter the country.“We cannot move forward on this crucial research without the individual who will actually be carrying out the research,” Berry told The Huffington Post.Some of the researchers from Yemen were able to travel to Jordan to obtain U.S. visas, Berry said. (Visa services at the U.S. Embassy in Yemen have been suspended.) But because of the cost and infrequency of flights out of Yemen, not to mention the general confusion over Trump’s orders, the lead researcher wasn’t able to leave the country in time to get a visa, Berry said. The researcher is now exploring the waiver process.At Harvard Medical School, research associate Navid Madani has spent years working with Iranian scientists on HIV/AIDS research. The collaboration builds expertise in Iran, she said, while the Iranians share their knowledge on matters like needle exchange programs and methadone treatment centers.After the initial ban was announced, Madani and her team had to rethink how to bring students and scientists to the U.S. The new order offers only “minor” adjustments, she said. One “extremely decorated” physician from Iran was planning to come to Harvard as early as mid-summer for an observership, Madani noted. But that doctor now expects to wait out the 90-day period before applying for a visa.“It’s a waste of time,” Madani said. “The administration is throwing a lot of marbles for us to walk around instead of paying attention to serious security issues.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.At the University of Wyoming, Mahdi Shahabadi, a Ph.D. student from Iran, is trying to improve water-treatment technology. Because of the initial ban, he was stopped by a U.S. officer when he tried to board a plane to the United States to start school. After the first ban was legally halted, he made it in. His visa is valid until January 2019, but his Ph.D. program runs five years, and he is “depressed and frustrated” about what his future may hold, he told HuffPost.Thousands of other Iranian students are studying in the U.S., the vast majority in fields related to science, technology, engineering and math. Many of them have single-entry visas, Shahabadi pointed out, so while the new ban is in effect, they likely can’t visit their families or attend scientific conferences outside the U.S. without risking losing their right to return. These students “will feel like prisoners,” he added.Academic institutions are also weighing the consequences of the new ban. The School of Engineering and Technology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, which has a collaborative graduate program with the University of Tehran in Iran, is still processing applications from Iranian students for the fall of 2017, and the program is not on hold. But “any/all delays in visa processing obviously have potential to impact students’ ability to participate,” said Gil Latz, associate vice chancellor for international affairs at the Indiana school.“We hope that current circumstances represent a temporary setback,” Latz added.Students who have been accepted to American universities and are supposed to start in the fall, but haven’t been granted visas yet, are reaching out to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee with concerns, said Abed Ayoub, the group’s legal and policy director. Some of those people are “going to be opting to go elsewhere,” he warned.Trump’s ban has resonated throughout the world, even in countries that aren’t on the list, Ayoub added. Researchers, scientists and other professionals may now take their talents elsewhere. They’ll decide they don’t want to “be in the U.S.,” he said, “because of the way [the U.S. is] treating fellow Arabs and Muslims.”"

It is unclear if Icahn is telling industry players he speaks for the White House, but in financial and regulatory circles in New York City and Washington, D.C., people know he has a direct line, as one energy industry source told HuffPost. And Icahn seems to be doing his best to influence policy in a way that would benefit his company. Bob Dinneen, the head of an ethanol trade group, confirmed to Reuters news agency on Monday that Icahn told him Trump would be signing an executive order changing the Renewable Fuel Standard. The Environmental Protection Agency program requires fuel sold in the U.S. to contain certain amounts of biofuel, such as corn-based ethanol.Under EPA rules, refiners must blend ethanol or biodiesel into gasoline or purchase Renewable Identification Numbers, swappable serial numbers attached to shipments of biofuel. Refiners expected to pay $1.8 billion in 2016 for renewable fuel credits, the price of which surged nearly 32 percent late last year. Icahn called the program the “mother of all short squeezes,” insisting it would bankrupt small refiners and ultimately make gas more expensive.“The domino effect of this will be that ‘big’ oil will sop up the bankrupt refineries, causing an oligopoly resulting in skyrocketing gasoline prices,” Icahn said in August. CVR shares have risen just under 70 percent since election. Its stock rose 6 percent after that story ran, netting Icahn $126 million in gains. Share prices fell again after reports that the White House indicated there was no such plan; both Icahn and the White House have now said on the record that there was no executive order planned.Since the election, Icahn has ratcheted up criticism of the RFS and its costs to his refiner. He wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in late November slamming the Obama administration’s EPA for choking out small- and medium-size oil refiners by forcing them to buy renewable fuel credits.The EPA’s proposal was meant to encourage the use of more renewable biofuels, but it “threatens to destroy America’s oil refineries, send gasoline prices skyward and devastate the U.S. economy,” Icahn wrote. CVR said in regulatory filings that cost it about $200 million in 2016.“The Trump administration, with new leadership at the EPA,” he wrote, “should move quickly next year to reform the biofuels mandate and forestall the crisis.”Icahn’s advisory role, and the position it puts him in to influence policies that could benefit CVR, raises ethical red flags, said Kathleen Clark, a legal ethics professor at Washington University School of Law.“We need to know whether Icahn had access to nonpublic government information, and whether he directly or indirectly traded on that information,” Clark said. “I believe that the White House refers to Icahn as an ‘adviser’ rather than as an ‘advocate’ or a ‘lobbyist,’ but that term may obscure his actual role: advocating for his own financial interests.”This “is the purest definition of a conflict of interest that you can get,” Tyson Slocum of the watchdog group Public Citizen told Bloomberg. “It is clear that Icahn has played a role in influencing aspects of administration policy that have a direct financial impact on Icahn’s business at CVR.”Icahn did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment. A spokeswoman for CVR, Brandee Stephens, declined to comment."
21,POLITICS,New Interior Chief Must Balance His Conservation Vows With Trump’s Fossil Fuel Demands,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-public-lands-challenge_us_58b87025e4b02a4e8ddb4fea,And even Ryan Zinke's supporters plan to keep a watchful eye.,2017-03-07,"Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, right, greets employees after riding in on horseback with a U.S. Park Police mounted unit to report for his first day of work in Washington, D.C., on March 2.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bdd0581a00003400f41f1d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke describes himself as a champion of public lands and an “unapologetic admirer and disciple of Teddy Roosevelt.” He is also wishy-washy on climate change and supports rolling back Obama-era regulations on coal, oil and gas extraction on public lands.That mixed bag has left some conservation groups feeling “cautiously optimistic,” while others are outright skeptical.The former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL is now tasked with managing some 500 million acres of federal land ― roughly one-fifth of the United States. The Interior Department has a bifurcated and at times conflicted task: to preserve and protect public lands for future generations while also setting the polices that govern extracting natural resources from that land.The challenge, of course, is to strike a balance. And with environmental activists becoming increasingly set against any development on public lands, a Republican Party with a platform that calls for transferring control of federal lands to states and a boss who enthusiastically promotes the fossil fuel industry, Zinke has his work cut out for him. Last Thursday, Zinke arrived at his new post sporting a cowboy hat and riding horseback. Within hours he signed a pair of orders that signaled his intention to prioritize hunting and fishing. One order overturned a last-minute Obama-era ban on hunting and fishing with lead ammunition and tackle in wildlife refuges and other public lands. The other seeks to expand access for outdoor enthusiasts.“Outdoor recreation is about both our heritage and our economy,” Zinke said in a statement at the time. “It worries me to think about hunting and fishing becoming activities for the land-owning elite.”On Monday, Zinke announced the department would offer 73 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas exploration and development. It’s an area the oil industry has been eager to develop, but it’s less controversial than offering new onshore leases. (As The Washington Post noted, the Trump administration’s proposal doesn’t stray far from former President Barack Obama’s, which called for leasing 66 million acres in the Gulf.)Although he’s no stranger to criticism, Zinke has largely managed to retain the support of sportsmen, who are hopeful he will follow through on his promises to protect and expand hunting, fishing and recreation access. But even his most loyal supporters say they plan to keep a close eye on how President Donald Trump’s pick approaches the job.Land Tawney, president and chief executive of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, a Montana-based nonprofit dedicated to protecting public lands and preserving America’s tradition of hunting and fishing, told The Huffington Post that his organization is not against fossil fuel development on public land — if it is done responsibly. “That means staying out of core habitat areas, whether that’s for sage grouse, mule deer migration, antelope — keeping those areas off-limits to development,” Tawney said. “And then where it does happen, making sure it happens in a phased way so you’re cleaning up as you go.” The Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit advocating for public land access, was one of the groups that endorsed Zinke’s nomination. Whit Fosburgh, the group’s president, told HuffPost that while TRCP continues to support Zinke, the organization is “absolutely” concerned that Trump’s energy agenda could affect public land access.“There’s a right way of doing it and there’s a wrong way of doing it,” Fosburgh said, adding, “You have to be smart about it and you have to plan upfront.”Technology has come a long way. And if Zinke and Trump do things right, Fosburgh said, they can conserve fish and wildlife and improve access while increasing energy development, both fossil fuels and renewables, on America’s public land.Among Fosburgh’s biggest concerns is the looming repeal of a Bureau of Land Management rule known as “Planning 2.0.” Finalized by the Obama administration in December, it aimed to increase public involvement in land use planning and management. The House voted in favor of a resolution to repeal the rule last month, and the Senate followed suit Tuesday. The bill now heads to Trump’s desk for final approval.“The point of the BLM planning rule is to get people together, to sit down early in the process and figure out smart development,” Fosburgh said. “The fact that Congress is about to repeal that — and, by the way, with a provision that says you can never do something substantially similar to this — we actually think it’s going to tie Secretary Zinke’s hands with how smart you can be with development.”In voicing support for increased mining and energy development, Zinke has stressed the importance of doing things responsibly.“Our public lands can once again be economic engines for our nation by creating jobs in energy, recreation, and conservation,” he said in a statement following his confirmation. “By working with President Trump and Congress to reevaluate and fix flawed regulations that are barriers to job creation, we will unleash the economic opportunity within our borders. Creating jobs on public lands can and will be done in an environmentally responsible way during my tenure.”So far, Zinke has said all the right things, according to Fosburgh. But others are less convinced that Trump’s pick will walk the walk. David Brooks, of Montana Trout Unlimited, an organization dedicated to conserving and restoring coldwater fisheries, told HuffPost that his group remains “skeptical” of Zinke.“His record has certainly been inconsistent as a state representative on our issues — on clean water, good habitat, public lands,” he said. “And so we’re watching him closely and certainly hoping for the best.”Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, took a more pessimistic attitude, saying his confirmation “jeopardizes the future of our great outdoors.”Along with a measly 4 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters, Zinke has been listed on The Center for American Progress’s “anti-parks caucus,” a collection of lawmakers the group says jeopardize the future of the country’s flagship protected lands. Other advocates worry about the simple fact that Zinke answers to Trump, a president who has dismissed climate change as a “hoax” and largely surrounded himself with like-minded deniers and fossil fuel executives.And as Zinke told the Los Angeles Times in December, “When you’re asked by the president to serve, it’s awfully hard to say no, and I’m loyal.” "

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58beb43b1900003300bd731e.jpeg?cache=Tah8xoLmdM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new survey analyzes Donald Trump’s ratings at the county level. Most of the public didn’t see Trump’s address to Congress as a pivot. And sometimes, how pollsters ask about a policy doesn’t do much to affect the results. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, March 7, 2017.TRUMP’S JOB PERFORMANCE GETS NEGATIVE REVIEWS IN SWING COUNTIES - Monmouth University: “The 2016 election was decided by a matter of degrees. The vast majority of counties gave either Trump or Hillary Clinton a double digit victory margin. The president has a solid 55% approve and 33% disapprove rating among residents of the nearly 2,500 counties that gave Trump a victory margin of ten points or more. He is upside down - 33% approve and 57% disapprove - among residents of the more than 400 counties he lost by ten points or more. Opinion is divided at 41% approve and 46% disapprove among residents of the just over 300 counties where the 2016 winning margin was in the single digits. There is very little difference in opinion in these ‘swing counties’ based on which candidate won there. In just over half of these counties that were won by Trump, his job rating stands at 43% approve and 48% disapprove. Among the remaining swing counties won by Hillary Clinton, 40% of residents approve of Trump’s job performance and 44% disapprove. [Monmouth]Dante Chinni breaks down Trump’s supporters by geography. [WSJ]FEW SAW TRUMP’S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS AS A ‘PIVOT’ - HuffPollster: “Americans who tuned into Donald Trump’s speech to Congress last Tuesday mostly didn’t see it as a departure from his past rhetoric or actions, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds, with even fewer expecting it to lead to the ‘pivot’ periodically promised by pundits since he first clinched the Republican nomination. A 52 percent majority of Americans who watched Trump’s address, or who followed the subsequent news coverage, say that the tone and content of the speech were similar to most of what he’s said and done since becoming president, with just 33 percent saying the speech’s tone and content differed from his previous actions. Among the third who did see the speech as a break from the past, 51 percent expected Trump to go back to the way he usually behaves, while just 36 percent thought he would continue to behave the way he did during his speech.” [HuffPost] The speech was positively received by most who tuned in - More from HuffPollster: “A 57 percent majority of those who watched Trump’s speech or followed subsequent news coverage approve, with just 34 percent disapproving. Fifty-one percent say the speech spent enough time focusing on the issues they care about most, while 28 percent say it spent too much time on other issues. Presidential addresses historically have tended to get high marks, for a pretty simple reason ― people who like the president to begin with are more likely to watch….Trump’s approval rating, for instance, was 7 points higher among those who paid attention to the address than it was among the full sample of Americans in the poll….Close to half of those who watched or followed coverage of the speech say it had no impact on their opinion of Trump’s actions as president, the HuffPost/YouGov survey finds, with a similar percentage saying it didn’t affect their views of his temperament.”AMERICANS ARE SPLIT ON REVOKING THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE - Jennifer Agiesta: “Americans are sharply divided on revoking Obamacare’s mandate that individuals obtain health insurance coverage, according to a new CNN/ORC poll, a change that’s a key provision of a newly-released Republican plan to repeal and replace the 2010 law. The survey, conducted before the details of the GOP plan were released Monday, also finds mixed views on several other provisions included in the new proposal. The public is broadly opposed to reductions in funding for Medicaid, though there is near-universal support for maintaining the protections afforded to those with pre-existing conditions under the Affordable Care Act….There’s also a significant partisan gap on the individual mandate, with 60% of Democrats opposed to removing it and 55% of Republicans in favor.” [CNN]QUESTION WORDING DOESN’T NECESSARILY MAKE A DIFFERENCE - Cameron Easley and Kyle Dropp on a study comparing support for President Trump’s executive order on travel across 96 different question wording choices: “Polls have shown varying levels of support for President Donald Trump’s controversial, stalled executive order temporarily banning refugees and citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. A new Morning Consult study shows that how questions were phrased on the issue does little to affect voter sentiment….Overall, support for the ban remained relatively high, regardless of how the questions were constructed. Whether the executive order was called a ban or a block did not make much of a difference. Neither did describing its length, or providing more specific information on the countries affected themselves. The largest deviation in responses came from how the people from the Middle Eastern countries affected by the ban were described. Support for the ban is 4 percentage points higher, 55 percent approve vs. 51 percent approve, when the population is described as ‘people’ rather than ‘people, including U.S. lawful permanent residents and visa holders originally.’” [Morning Consult] PUBLIC CONCERN OVER RUSSIA REACHES COLD WAR LEVELS - HuffPollster: “Americans today are more likely to see Russia as a threat than at any time since the end of the Cold War, according to a new CNN/ORC poll released Monday. Seventy-five percent now rate Russia as either a ‘very serious’ or ‘moderately serious’ threat. The last time Americans were as wary came in November 1985, when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was preaching glasnost….More recently, the percentages started to increase in 2012 during a period of increasing tensions between the United States and Russia. In recent months, they have risen again amid the controversy over possible Russian interference in the U.S. election and the claims of ties between the Russian government and President Donald Trump’s campaign and transition team. Thirty-four percent of Americans now say Russia is a very serious threat, while 41 percent say it’s a moderately serious threat. While this shift is driven mostly by Democrats’ concerns, Republicans and independents are not optimistic about Russia either.” [HuffPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

25,POLITICS,The Affordable Care Act Has Saved Hospitals More Than $12 Billion In Health Care Spending – Don’t Repeal It,"John Toussaint, MD, ContributorCEO of Catalysis, CEO emeritus of ThedaCare",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-affordable-care-act-has-saved-hospitals-more-than_us_58bf1f82e4b0a797c1d39645,"President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of the United States Congress on Feb. 28.

There, among many other campaign topics, he spoke of the need to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare. On March 6, members of Congress began promoting a new healthcare bill designed to replace the ACA.It is consensus within the Republican party that the ACA is so broken that it must be repealed. It costs too much. It doesn’t allow individuals to choose a health plan that works best for them. It doesn’t allow enough competition among health insurers. The insurance exchanges where individuals buy coverage each year don’t function as they should.President Trump and our elected officials must realize that true health care reform can only happen when healthcare providers are financially rewarded to deliver higher quality, lower cost care. Patients must have all the information they need to make the best healthcare choices and healthcare leaders must be able to build a safe and efficient care delivery system.Our government, insurers, healthcare delivery systems and care providers must all work in concert to redesign the system to serve patient needs and reduce costs. Good for American healthcare should result in fewer people in hospitals, better overall health status, and access for anyone in need. If the replacement plan Republicans create does not address these concerns, premiums and the total cost of care will continue to increase and our system will remain inefficient.For many years, I’ve argued that health care would continue to be unaffordable unless America addressed the root cause of its high costs. With the large increases in health insurance premiums in 2016 on the insurance exchanges, it’s clear that the root cause has not been addressed. Most of the cost of health care is in the delivery of health care itself.The Institute of Medicine estimates that 30 percent – 40 percent of that care is waste. In other words, up to 40 percent of the activities involved in care delivery are unnecessary to the health outcomes of patients. These wastes include procedures that aren’t required, time spent waiting for tests and appointments, duplicated services, and worst of all, medical errors that too often end in patient deaths.What President Trump and Congress should understand is that parts of the Affordable Care Act specifically designed to attack waste are only now coming to fruition. The ACA was implemented in stages – and in the coming months and years payment system changes and public reporting of quality performance data will begin to tackle the waste that has negatively impacted our healthcare system for decades.One example of positive change the ACA is having on our system is its mandate to focus healthcare delivery organizations on improvement. Collaborative learning networks have been established throughout the country and have already produced encouraging results. CMS has facilitated these networks by committing resources to establish them. An example is the Hospital Engagement Network (HENs). Seventeen HENs were created in 2011, which include more than 3,000 hospitals. Together, they worked to reduce the rates of 10 types of harms, such as patient falls and pressure ulcers. This was part of CMS’s Partnership for Patients Initiative designed to improve the quality performance of hospitals. It was a partnership between the government and the private sector, including many consumer groups.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has touted the program’s overall success. For example, it reported that 50,000 fewer patients died, 1.3 million adverse events were avoided, and $12 billion was saved at hospitals because of reductions in hospital-acquired conditions from 2010 to 2013.The Affordable Care Act has some major flaws within it. The insurance exchanges are one example. In a separate article published in the Harvard Business Review, I suggested a series of possible fixes to the exchange. With a concerted effort to fix these flaws, lawmakers can take an existing program that was years in the making – one that, today, insures more than 20 million Americans – and make it more effective.To learn more about how hospitals and clinics are becoming more efficient and effective in patient care, read Dr. Toussaint’s book, “Management on the Mend.”Dr. John Toussaint has directly worked with CMS leaders to broaden their understanding of lean for government and has participated in many Institute of Medicine subcommittees. He is one of the foremost figures in the adoption of lean principles in healthcare. Toussaint was the founding chair of the Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality and of the Wisconsin Health Information Organization, as well as the non-executive leader of the Partnership for Healthcare Payment Reform in Wisconsin. During his 30-plus year career, he both practiced medicine and served as a hospital administrator, before founding Catalysis.Have you or your family benefited from the Affordable Care Act?

Some wonder if the government can deliver on its promises fast enough.",2017-03-06,"High in the mountains of Icononzo, Colombia, people are building a transition zone for FARC rebels.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ab5c04280000af8f99a154.jpeg?cache=Owfz7iZ1Og&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ICONONZO, Colombia ― Last November, at a solemn ceremony in the capital city of Bogota, the Colombian government signed a historic peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, ending 52 years of civil war. Four months later, the work of implementing that accord is underway at a farm high in the mountains outside the town of Icononzo.Icononzo is one of 26 transition zones established in rural regions the FARC had historically controlled. The peace deal ― which came after years of negotiations and a failed national referendum ― began a six-month process in which nearly 7,000 FARC guerrillas have been relocating to these zones to demobilize and begin reintegrating into civil society.That process includes taking classes, as many of the rebels never finished elementary school, and learning about life outside the FARC, where many of them have spent more than half their lives. Eventually, the guerrillas are supposed to turn over their weapons to United Nations representatives and surrender money and land holdings, which will be used to compensate victims of the war. In exchange, they will be allowed to form a sanctioned political party.FARC members started arriving at Icononzo in early January. The camp currently houses 280 guerrillas, both men and women, as well as seven children. On a recent Friday morning, a pair of congressmen from Bogota and a group of reporters visited the zone.The new residents were busy sawing wood, digging trenches for water pipes and carving out a village high on this mountainside. The old farm they are occupying had only a handful of established buildings. So the guerrillas were building tent houses out of green and black tarp. Throughout the zone, their guns were stored on wooden racks under more tarps ― still accessible, at least for now.Rutti Terran, 26, has been with the FARC for 11 years. She had just returned to her tent from helping construct a large building to be used as a classroom higher up the mountain. Her hands were still muddy from the work. The classroom, she said, would initially be a place to study the peace agreement, “so we can all be clear on what we can do at the moment.”“For the future, what I want, at least first of all, is an education,” said Terran. “And from there, to pick a project that will nourish my life and to look over the less fortunate people of Colombia, be of help to them. That’s what we have always dreamt of.”But many in this zone said that while they’re living up to their promise to disarm, the Colombian government’s sluggish pace in delivering infrastructure for the camps has complicated the demobilization. In late February, the government faced widespread criticism after reporting revealed that the contractors hired did not appear capable of completing the zones’ construction, which could be one reason it’s behind pace.“The deal we had with the government is that upon our arrival to these regions, there should have been a basic infrastructure in place ― potable water, sanitation, internal roads, dining halls, kitchens and other conditions that would allow people to live with dignity here, to initiate the process of building accommodations and housing for the combatants,” said Carlos Antonio Lozada, one of the FARC’s main commanders and a lead negotiator in the peace process. “Unfortunately, the Colombian government has not fulfilled that commitment. And as you can see from walking around the area, we’re living in conditions that are not the best.”“We’re putting up with it as a demonstration of our unequivocal willingness for peace,” Lozada said.Benur Hernandez, 26, was helping a woman hang a tarp over her tent. It had rained hard the night before, and the clouds looked like they might open up again soon.“If they don’t put in their part, then we won’t either,” said Hernandez, who has been with the FARC since he was 12. “We too won’t put in our part. This is not a way for peace to continue forward in a process as it should be.”“If one dedicated so much time in that fight, the fight is for something just. Not for something minimal, but for something just,” he continued. “It’s been four months. There’s two months left because it’s a total of six months. And by the looks of it, there’s a long way to go.”Others were more forgiving. Geronimo Gutierrez, 41, has been a guerrilla for 28 years. He and his wife, Carolina Santana, have a 6-month-old daughter, Alix Beatriz. “They’ve been delivering on what has been promised, but it’s a bit slow,” he said. “Little by little.”“We’re in the process, hoping everything moves forward, that it doesn’t double back,” said Vanessa Hurtado, who entered the FARC at age 13. She was standing watch at one of the camp’s gun depots, cradling a tiny black chihuahua named Guinness dressed in a T-shirt. She looked younger than her 26 years. “We’re all working here and hoping things move forward. But we’re optimistic about the agreement.” Hurtado wants to get an education, learn English and French, and maybe work as a translator. She also wants to see her family again, including her parents who are in Venezuela.Beyond the concerns about how contracts were awarded, construction in the zones seems to be a logistical challenge. The camps ― essentially 26 entirely new villages ― are being built miles up twisting mountain roads and far from towns, in places where there was almost no existing infrastructure. Meanwhile, the delays are heightening fears that the FARC, or at least splinter groups, might remobilize, as The Christian Science Monitor reported last week.Ivan Cepeda, a senator from Colombia’s liberal Polo Democratic Alternative Party and a human rights activist, said it was “disheartening” to see how little government-provided infrastructure was in place.“There is nothing, barely the beginning of what should have already been established,” said Cepeda. “But on the other hand, we are seeing that the guerrillas are committed to what they are doing. This is a fundamental ingredient, essential to the peace.”Cepeda emphasized the need to provide health and educational resources, especially in the regions most affected by the war. The FARC was often criticized for enlisting young people ― pre-teenagers, in some cases ― and its recruitment practices mean that many of the rebels have little formal education. While one can access decent health care in the country’s larger cities, it is severely lacking in the vast, remote rural areas ― the regions hit hardest by the war. “In these zones, there should be the minimal living conditions so that the people in the countryside can live with dignity and their rights,” said Cepeda.Former FARC guerrillas are also experiencing a baby boom, after their leaders barred them from having children during the war. In Icononzo, there were seven babies and toddlers, and several more women were pregnant ― “the generation of the peace,” as several people called them. One of the buildings under construction was a maternity house; men were pouring cement that very day.Lisnea Guzman, 30, has been with the FARC since she was 15.

Now she wants an education.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ab5c0525000017600ba3e2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ICONONZO, Colombia ― Last November, at a solemn ceremony in the capital city of Bogota, the Colombian government signed a historic peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, ending 52 years of civil war. Four months later, the work of implementing that accord is underway at a farm high in the mountains outside the town of Icononzo.Icononzo is one of 26 transition zones established in rural regions the FARC had historically controlled. The peace deal ― which came after years of negotiations and a failed national referendum ― began a six-month process in which nearly 7,000 FARC guerrillas have been relocating to these zones to demobilize and begin reintegrating into civil society.That process includes taking classes, as many of the rebels never finished elementary school, and learning about life outside the FARC, where many of them have spent more than half their lives. Eventually, the guerrillas are supposed to turn over their weapons to United Nations representatives and surrender money and land holdings, which will be used to compensate victims of the war. In exchange, they will be allowed to form a sanctioned political party.FARC members started arriving at Icononzo in early January. The camp currently houses 280 guerrillas, both men and women, as well as seven children. On a recent Friday morning, a pair of congressmen from Bogota and a group of reporters visited the zone.The new residents were busy sawing wood, digging trenches for water pipes and carving out a village high on this mountainside. The old farm they are occupying had only a handful of established buildings. So the guerrillas were building tent houses out of green and black tarp. Throughout the zone, their guns were stored on wooden racks under more tarps ― still accessible, at least for now.Rutti Terran, 26, has been with the FARC for 11 years. She had just returned to her tent from helping construct a large building to be used as a classroom higher up the mountain. Her hands were still muddy from the work. The classroom, she said, would initially be a place to study the peace agreement, “so we can all be clear on what we can do at the moment.”“For the future, what I want, at least first of all, is an education,” said Terran. “And from there, to pick a project that will nourish my life and to look over the less fortunate people of Colombia, be of help to them. That’s what we have always dreamt of.”But many in this zone said that while they’re living up to their promise to disarm, the Colombian government’s sluggish pace in delivering infrastructure for the camps has complicated the demobilization. In late February, the government faced widespread criticism after reporting revealed that the contractors hired did not appear capable of completing the zones’ construction, which could be one reason it’s behind pace.“The deal we had with the government is that upon our arrival to these regions, there should have been a basic infrastructure in place ― potable water, sanitation, internal roads, dining halls, kitchens and other conditions that would allow people to live with dignity here, to initiate the process of building accommodations and housing for the combatants,” said Carlos Antonio Lozada, one of the FARC’s main commanders and a lead negotiator in the peace process. “Unfortunately, the Colombian government has not fulfilled that commitment.

More than 360,000 acutely malnourished and 70,000 severely malnourished children in the East African nation need urgent and life-saving support, according to the World Health Organization.Last Tuesday, Somalia’s newly elected president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, declared the drought a national disaster and appealed to the international community for help. Humanitarian organizations report that whole villages have lost their crops. The prices of water and food have risen dramatically. Many farmers and pastoralists have lost their animals. Many families that rely on wage labor, particularly in the southern Bay and Bakool regions, have lost their income. The lack of clean water is exacerbating the risk of communicable diseases. The WHO reported that nearly 5.5 million people are at risk of cholera, and more than 4,000 cases of acute watery diarrhea have already been reported this year. The emergency has forced thousands of people to leave their homes in search of food and water, AP reported. Many of them have made their way to the capital city of Mogadishu, overwhelming aid agencies there.Humanitarian groups have called for donations, but admit that currently they have limited access to some of the drought-affected regions. The damage caused by the drought has been compounded by violence in some parts of Somalia. Insecurity not only complicates the delivery of aid, but also drives human displacement, which over the years has contributed to extreme poverty. The drought has raised fears of a full-blown famine. In its appeal for aid on Friday, the International Organization for Migration said the current situation bears worrying similarities to the 2011 famine, which left over a quarter-million people in Somalia dead.“Without assistance, many people face malnutrition, significantly increased risk of disease, loss of livelihoods and even death,” the group wrote."

After an initial version of the order, issued Jan. 27, resulted in confusion, protests and numerous legal challenges, the Trump administration was forced to issue a new, significantly scaled back travel ban.The new version makes it clear that people with dual nationality, green cards, and current visas aren’t affected by the ban. It also strikes Iraq off a list of Muslim-majority countries from which some nationals will be barred from the U.S. for 90 days. Religious minorities will no longer be prioritized for admission and Syrian refugees are no longer barred indefinitely ― although they will still be affected by a blanket ban on refugee resettlement that will last for 120 days.The new order still cuts the refugee resettlement program in half, capping it at 50,000. The ban will go reportedly go into effect on March 16.Faith-based organizations representing Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and other interfaith activists responded to the new order on Monday ― with many saying that the order was still a Muslim ban in disguise.The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights organization, called the order a “Muslim Ban 2.0.”“This executive order, like the last order, is at its core a Muslim ban, which is discriminatory and unconstitutional,” said CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad.The Trump administration has denied that the ban targets Muslims, but critics see the order as a way for Trump to legally fulfill his campaign promise for a “complete shutdown” of Muslims entering the country. The federal judge who blocked the implementation of the original order did so after failing to find evidence that immigrants from the Muslim-majority countries on Trump’s list had committed terrorist attacks in America.CAIR’s admonition of the ban was echoed by other faith-based organizations.Church World Service, a multi-denominational Christian coalition that assists the government with refugee resettlement, announced that it “strongly decries” the White House’s move. “Make no mistake: this rewritten version will have the same impact, while avoiding the court proceedings that kept the initial executive order from being implemented. It is a refugee ban. It is a Muslim ban,” the organization stated on Facebook. The Franciscan Action Network, a Catholic advocacy organization, stated that the order was a “defacto” Muslim ban that contradicts Catholic values and the example set forth by Pope Francis. “The Franciscan Action Network will stand in prayer and solidarity with Muslim sisters and brothers, as well as all refugees and immigrants, during the forty days of Lent,” Sr Marie Lucey, FAN Associate Director, said. “While opposing bans and harmful executive orders, we also pray for a change of hearts and minds of this Administration and legislators who support anti-refugee and anti-immigrant measures.”World Relief is an evangelical resettlement agency that brought more than 500 conservative Christian leaders together to speak out against the previous executive order. The organization maintained its opposition to the ban on Monday, criticizing the government for drastically reducing refugee admissions.“While we support our government in ensuring our safety and security, we believe that compassion and security do not have to be mutually exclusive. We believe that the order simply remains disproportionate,” World Relief President Scott Arbeiter said in a statement. “In our national experience, the actions mandated by this executive order are inconsistent with the security record established by the refugee program since its inception and even since 9-11.”At a rally outside the White House on Monday, interfaith clergy and community leaders gathered together to call for the order’s immediate repeal. “Clergy and community leaders are calling on President Trump to immediately repeal this executive order and protect religious freedom. Our nation was founded to be a beacon of hope and freedom for people fleeing violence and persecution,” the advocacy group Faith In Public Life, which helped organize the rally, said in a press release. The Sikh Coalition responded by asking interfaith supporters to write letters showing solidarity to both Muslims and Jews. Sikh activist and scholar Simran Jeet Singh pointed out on Twitter that despite the revisions, the executive order is still deeply problematic. Jewish organizations, such as the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, the social justice arm of America’s largest Jewish denomination, HIAS, a Jewish refugee resettlement agency, the Anti-Defamation League, and T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights also denounced the ban.In a statement, T’ruah said that the new executive order is “more of the same Islamophobia that targets Muslims.”“The Jewish community understands all too well the danger of compromising the civil liberties of any national, ethnic or religious group, or of holding entire groups collectively responsible for the actions of individuals,” the statement said. “Today’s executive order undermines our values and weakens the moral fiber upon which our nation stands.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

35,POLITICS,Supreme Court Ducks Big Transgender Rights Case — Thanks To Trump Administration,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-gavin-grimm_us_58bd7527e4b0b9989418d80a,The justices were originally scheduled to hear the case later this month.,2017-03-06,"Gavin Grimm, 17, left, is photographed with his mom Deirdre Grimm, in Gloucester, Virginia, on Sunday, August 21, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bd75771500003b16abd663.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Supreme Court on Monday decided not to rule on a high-profile transgender rights case that could have clarified whether federal law covers gender identity discrimination in public schools.Lawyers for both the Gloucester County School Board and high school student Gavin Grimm had urged the court to move forward with the case ― even though the Trump administration decided last month to roll back federal guidance that a lower court had determined covered transgender students using bathrooms that align with their gender identity.The justices’ order Monday, which was unsigned, vacated that lower court ruling “in light of” the Departments of Education and Justice deciding on Feb. 22 to no longer enforce the prior guidelines. The Obama administration originally put those guidelines in place, and a federal judge later blocked them.The high court asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to look at the case again and decide what to do with it now that the transgender guidance is no longer on the books.Grimm, who has become a trans rights activist during the course of his legal battle, expressed disappointment on the day the administration withdrew the guidance. Lawyers for the Obama administration had determined that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a law that bars sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding, covered transgender students’ bathroom access.The Supreme Court had scheduled a March 28 hearing for the case, and the dispute was already shaping up to be the biggest case of the court’s current term. Scores of trans rights organizations, school administrators, advocates and officials from the Obama administration filed legal briefs with the Supreme Court last week to throw their support behind the 17-year-old Grimm, who graduates in June.The Trump administration had not expressed a formal legal position on whether Title IX covers transgender students ― it simply went against the Obama administration on the matter.“There must be due regard for the primary role of the States and local school districts in establishing educational policy,” a letter announcing the reversal said. It added that the administration would “further and more completely consider the legal issues involved.”Perhaps as a result of that unwillingness to express a view on the law with respect to transgender students, the Supreme Court took the path of least resistance and decided not to consider the case.Joshua Block, the American Civil Liberties Union attorney who represents Grimm, tweeted on Monday that the court ducking the issue now “is a detour, not the end of the road,” and noted that protracting the court fight will leave transgender students “in limbo.”In a separate statement, Block seemed to predict that a future case involving transgender rights may examine not just whether federal law covers gender identity discrimination in schools, but also whether the Constitution does so.“Nothing about today’s action changes the meaning of the law,” Block said. “Title IX and the Constitution protect Gavin and other transgender students from discrimination.”Grimm had won at the 4th Circuit, and so the Supreme Court’s decision to undo the ruling in his favor means that his school scored a victory of sorts. In its own statement, the Gloucester County School Board said it “looks forward to explaining why its commonsense restroom and locker room policy is legal under the Constitution and federal law.”"

Agents won’t be patting down any body parts not previously included in screening guidelines, but the pat-downs will likely be more invasive than what the average passenger is used to. “This will not change the number of passengers who receive pat-down screenings,” a TSA spokesman said. However, “it changes the kind of pat-down screening those who require one will receive.”The change stems from a 2015 report that found TSA officials failed to stop weapons from passing through security, the Los Angeles Times reports. TSA officials have also confiscated record numbers of weapons in recent months.The new pat-downs are currently in effect at most U.S. airports, the spokesman said. They shouldn’t slow down overall security wait times, but they may slow down any passengers who receive them. As always, you can opt to have your pat-down in private if you choose. Gee, thanks."

These are cowardly acts to carry out.” Muslim Americans like Rashid have seen their own community come under attack in recent months. There were at least 385 documented Islamaphobic attacks in 2016 alone, according to a database maintained by The Huffington Post.Rashid said it was “heartbreaking” to see Jews experience similar threatening situations.“We’ve seen this story before. History continues to repeat itself,” he said. “People who understand what’s going on recognize that if this is not combated in a way to change the hearts of the people who are doing this, it’ll continue to get worse.”Although he hasn’t received the call to actively defend a Jewish community center ― Jewish leaders and police have deemed dozens of bomb threats over the past two months hoaxes ― Rashid joins Muslims across the country willing to do their part to strengthen interfaith solidarity.Salaam Bhatti, of Queens, New York, traveled to Philadelphia after he found out that about 100 headstones had been desecrated at a cemetery there. He wanted to help clean up and offer any support he could.“We as Muslims believe in universal human rights,” he said. “For our Jewish brothers and sisters, that freedom was infringed upon. The Koran teaches us to defend mosques ― it also teaches us to defend other churches, synagogues, cloisters or any house of worship.”He was initially turned away because he’d arrived too early ― police still considered the cemetery an active crime scene. But volunteers eventually arrived in swaths. So many people came to offer support in Philly that organizers had to stagger cleanup work and activism in shifts, according to ABC-6. Tens of thousands of dollars have been donated to form a reward for information leading to an arrest of a suspect.The incident came just days after vandals turned over another 100 headstones at a Jewish cemetery in Missouri. Bhatti and Rashid both characterized grave desecration as one of the more heinous and disrespectful acts anyone can undertake. Khalid Whalid, a 35-year-old Army veteran in the Houston area, offered his protection to local synagogues after seeing Rashid’s pledge. Eight years in the Army instilled in him the importance of protecting people and fighting for a common freedom from fear, he said. “You don’t fight for a cause, you fight so you and your brother can go home,” Whalid said. “If you’re a Muslim, it’s just like being a Christian or a Jew. We all came from tribes of Abraham. And we’re supposed to protect our brothers, no matter what.” Whalid, a self-described “chubby white guy” with a punk rock past, changed his name and converted to Islam in his 20s. “I didn’t realize what prejudice was until I became a Muslim,” he said. “So when I see someone being persecuted, I stand up.” None of the men have been taken up on their offers yet, but they all said it will be important to continue to show support and to demonstrate how their community responds to hateful and bigoted actions ― even if the federal government intervenes with hate crime prosecutions, which it hasn’t done yet. “It’s a very dangerous time we’re living in,” Rashid said. “But what we will do with silence ― which is horrible, the worst kind of reaction ― is create even more people with extremist viewpoints. ... When will they actually say something?”“We’d still be here, regardless if the White House said anything,” Bhatti said, separately. “We are not going to rely on anybody else to help out. These attacks aren’t against us as Muslims, they’re against us as humans.”"

Seventy-five percent now rate Russia as either a “very serious” or “moderately serious” threat. The last time Americans were as wary came in November 1985, when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was preaching glasnost.More recently, the percentages started to increase in 2012 during a period of increasing tensions between the United States and Russia. In recent months, they have risen again amid the controversy over possible Russian interference in the U.S. election and the claims of ties between the Russian government and President Donald Trump’s campaign and transition team. Thirty-four percent of Americans now say Russia is a very serious threat, while 41 percent say it’s a moderately serious threat.While this shift is driven mostly by Democrats’ concerns, Republicans and independents are not optimistic about Russia either. The majority of Democrats ― 51 percent ― say that country is a very serious threat. The majority of Republicans ― 53 percent ― think it’s a moderately serious one. Overall, 85 percent of Democrats, 77 percent of Republicans and 68 percent of independents see Russia as threatening to at least some degree.As for the claims that people associated with Trump’s campaign had contact with suspected Russian operatives, 55 percent of Americans say they are very or somewhat concerned about the allegations, compared to 45 percent who are not too or not at all concerned.The CNN/ORC poll also looked at how Americans view other foreign adversaries. As with Russia, 75 percent see Iran as a serious threat. But more people are worried about North Korea and ISIS, with 81 percent saying North Korea is a very or moderately serious threat, and 91 percent reporting the same about ISIS. People are less concerned about China, with 63 percent calling it very or moderately threatening.The CNN/ORC survey results generally agree with other recent polling on American attitudes toward Russia. A February Gallup poll showed 70 percent with an unfavorable opinion of that country, which ties that poll’s record high since 1989. A January Quinnipiac poll found almost half of U.S. voters consider Russia an adversary.The CNN/ORC poll was conducted March 1-4 among a random national sample of 1,025 adults. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Error margins are larger for subgroups."

Martin is known for bringing serious gore to screens everywhere. So, naturally, his dream version of “Beauty and The Beast” would involve a murderous Beast.Thanks to the much-anticipated release of Disney’s new live-action movie, “Beauty and the Beast” has made a resurgence this year and has us reminiscing about the classic tale. And we’re not just talking about the 1991 animated film.In 1987, there was a CBS TV show entitled “Beauty and the Beast” that starred Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman as a lawyer named Catherine Chandler and an underground tunnel-dweller named Vincent (aka Beast), respectively. Martin worked on the series as a writer (he’d later become a supervising producer).The show took place in a magical version of New York and involved the duo fighting crime and falling in love. The show had Perlman playing knight in shining armor to Hamilton, but with no twist at the end ― as in, Beast stays beastly the whole time. Love affair and all.There are no whimsical and lifelike candelabras, clocks or teapots. Just some casual bestiality and taking down bad guys. This, apparently, wasn’t enough for Martin, who reportedly wanted more darkness in the series.“There were constant limitations. It wore me down,” Martin said in a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone about his desire to push the show into edgier territory. He continued:There were battles over censorship, how sexual things could be, whether a scene was too “politically charged,” how violent things could be. Don’t want to disturb anyone ... The Beast killed people. That was the point of the character. He was a beast. But CBS didn’t want blood, or for the beast to kill people. They wanted us to show him picking up someone and throwing them across the room, and then they would get up and run away. Oh, my God, horrible monster! [Laughs] It was ludicrous. The character had to remain likable.The CBS show ultimately didn’t survive after (spoiler!) Catherine was killed, and the Beast became a mopey mess. In the end, he never got to revel in the gore and glory Martin wanted for him.We’ll just have to leave the “Game of Thrones”-esque version of “Beauty and The Beast” ― where Beast slits throats, fights White Walkers, and leads an army of anthropomorphic household items to prepare for winter ― to our dreams.H/T The Telegraph"
46,POLITICS,Montana Dems Nominate A Banjo Player For Special Election -- And He Might Actually Win,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rob-quist-montana-house_us_58bdd0eae4b033be14679775,Rob Quist is an award-winning bluegrass and folk singer with a big following in Big Sky Country.,2017-03-06,"Musician and Democratic congressional nominee Rob Quist with his wife, Bonni Quist.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bdd2561a00003700f41f29.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Musician and songwriter Rob Quist won the Democratic nomination on Sunday to fill the Montana congressional seat of Republican Ryan Zinke, who was sworn in last week as the new U.S. secretary of the interior.Quist, 69, a mustachioed son of ranchers who rarely appears in photos without a cowboy hat, defeated two state legislators ― Amanda Curtis and Kelly McCarthy ― for the nomination and will face Republican nominee Greg Gianforte in Montana’s May 25 special election. The race marks Quist’s first campaign for public office. Yet his award-winning oeuvre of folk and bluegrass albums has made him “the best known name of the entire Democratic slate,” according to Daily Kos. “His music is quite political,” Bonni Quist said of her husband in an interview with The Huffington Post on Monday. She said his 2016 song, “.45 Caliber Man,” was one of her favorites: “It’s going to take a .45 caliber man, meaning it’s going to take somebody with a strong will to stand up for the values of the middle-class America.” Quist was in meetings all day with Democratic Party officials, his wife said. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.For weeks, Quist has been barnstorming Montana, urging scattered Democrats to form form central committees in counties without one, according to KTVH, a local NBC affiliate.He’s running in part on his public service record. Quist served three four-year terms on the Montana Arts Council, to which two governors appointed him. In that position, he lobbied to keep funding for music, theater and arts programs in the state’s public schools and developed an anti-bullying curriculum. He also served as the state Department of Commerce’s cultural ambassador, traveling to Japan several times over his three-year tenure. He currently works as a spokesman and fundraiser for the Montana Food Bank Network. Quist rose to prominence as a founding member of the Mission Mountain Wood Band. The country-rock fivesome, sometimes abbreviated M2WB, helped start the University of Montana’s annual Aber Day kegger, a party that won a spot in Guinness Book of World Records for being the biggest benefit kegger. Late Monday, the Republican Party nominated Gianforte, a software entrepreneur who recently lost a costly governor’s race to incumbent Democrat Steve Bullock. He beat out six other candidates, including two current state lawmakers.“We don’t need to send [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi a court musician who’s advocating for a socialized, one-payer medical system,” Gianforte told The Associated Press earlier Monday.The tone of Quist’s political platform rings closer to that of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the insurgent progressive he backed in the contentious Democratic presidential primary, than to that of Hillary Clinton, who won the nomination. “The Democratic National Committee sent [Sanders] to the sidelines in favor of Hillary Clinton,” Quist told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle in January, noting that Democrats lack a grassroots network like Republican tea party groups to rally voters to the polls. “They tried to control it from top down.” The election could be seen as a microcosm of the larger fight playing out in national Democratic politics. The race for Democratic National Committee chair pitted Sanders-backed Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) against former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who got support from former President Barack Obama and establishment party leaders. Perez won, but named Ellison deputy chair in a bid to unify the party after it was devastated in the November election. “The Montana special election is one of the first special elections following the Trump takeover/inauguration,” Franke Wilmer, a professor of political science at Montana State University, told the progressive blog Down With Tyranny. “It will absolutely be viewed by the whole country, but especially those in elected office, to figure out which way the political winds are blowing as a measure of Trump’s eroded or continued support.”Like Sanders, Quist supports a single-payer healthcare system. He stumps for health care reform with a personal story: A pre-existing condition disqualified him for insurance until former President Barack Obama passed the Affordable Care Act, and he was forced to access Social Security benefits early to pay out of pocket for gall bladder surgery, the Daily Chronicle reported. Quist opposes banning abortion. In an interview with the Daily Chronicle, he told the story of being an unemployed songwriter when his wife became pregnant with their daughter, Halladay. She lost her job as a flight attendant after United Airlines decided pregnant women could not fly, leaving the pair scrambling to figure out how to afford a child. “This was a heavy time for us, it couldn’t have come at a worse time,” Quist said in the interview. “We made the decision to have this child, and my daughter is now the light of my life. I don’t know what I would do without her. But on the other hand, I wouldn’t want the government getting in the middle of that decision. That was a decision we needed to make personally.”Bonni Quist said she was “surprised he shared that” personal story, saying she never seriously considered terminating the pregnancy. “It was more about the fact that middle-class Americans are strapped with difficult financial decisions every day,” she told HuffPost. “Choosing one way or another could tip the scales. That’s why it’s important to us.”Quist also considers gun ownership “a way of life,” but backs restrictions on assault weapons.“They’re only meant to kill people,” Quist told the Chronicle. “So maybe there should be some legislation to register those types of things.”Quist’s interests may overlap somewhat with those of first lady Melania Trump. During a radio appearance in January, he played his official campaign song, a folk ballad he originally wrote to respond to cyberbullying his wife endured. The first lady has said she plans to make combatting bullying a top priority in the White House. “Bullies are not just on the playground, they’re everywhere through life,” Quist said of his song, titled “I Will Stand Up For You.”“I didn’t really have to change too much to be a campaign song,” he said. To be sure, Quist faces an uphill battle. Montana’s sole district is 87 percent white and non-Hispanic, well above the 62 percent national average, NBC News reported. The district is also older than the national average, with 44 percent of the population aged 45 or older, compared to 40 percent nationally. “Think the far-left Quist has a shot in this red state after Montanans have rejected House Democrats in eleven straight elections?” GOP operative Jack Pandol asked in a blog post on the Republican National Congressional Committee website that called Quist “to the left of even Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.” “Look us in the eye and tell us with a straight face,” Pandol wrote.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!” Trump tweeted. In an interview on ABC News’ “This Week,” guest host Martha Raddatz asked Sanders why the president had made the allegations so confidently.“I think that this is, again, something that if this happened, Martha ―” Sanders began.“If, if, if, if,” Raddatz interjected. “Why is the president saying that it did happen?”“He is going off of information that he’s seen that has led him to believe that this is a very real potential,” Sanders replied.Sanders suggested that Trump was merely asking for the matter to be investigated as part of any official investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to, or communications with, Russia.“If they’re going to investigate Russia ties, let’s include this as part of it. So that’s what we’re asking,” Sanders told Raddatz.“He’s made it very clear what he believes and he’s asking that we get down to the bottom of this,” she added. “Let’s get the truth here.” Sanders would not provide additional information about the basis for Trump’s claims, other than to say that he was taking media reports about it “seriously.” Right-wing news sites Breitbart and Heat Street are the only news outlets suggesting that Obama personally ordered Trump’s wiretapping. Those sites link to mainstream news sources like The New York Times that do not make those claims definitively.An Obama spokesman denied on Saturday that the president ever became personally involved in ordering wiretapping. The FBI requires a warrant to eavesdrop. And the Department of Justice, of which the law enforcement bureau is a part, prizes its independence.Sanders struggled on Sunday to explain Trump’s certainty that Obama had wiretapped him. Raddatz pressed her to respond to one of Trump’s actual tweets making the accusations.“I’d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!” Trump tweeted Saturday morning.“I would say that his tweet speaks for itself there,” Sanders said."

The United Nations last month warned that more than 400,00 people, more than half the remaining population in western Mosul, could be displaced.Iraqi forces captured the eastern side of Mosul in January after 100 days of fighting and launched their attack on the districts that lie west of the Tigris river on Feb. 19.Defeating Islamic State in Mosul would crush the Iraqi wing of the caliphate declared by the group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in 2014, over parts of Iraq and Syria.Baghdadi proclaimed the caliphate from Mosul’s grand Nuri mosque, in the old city center which is still under his followers’ control.Rapid Response units and Counter Terrorism Service forces launched a fresh push into the city on Sunday after a 48-hour pause due to bad weather that hampered air surveillance, facilitating counter-attacks by the militants.Rapid Response teams are “very close” to the government buildings near the old city, said a senior media officer with the elite Interior Ministry units.Their progress was met with heavy sniper and mortar fire, a Reuters photographer reported from Mosul.The complex, which houses the Nineveh Provincial Council and the Nineveh Governorate buildings, should be taken on Monday, Lt. Colonel Abdel Amir al-Mohammadawi told Reuters.Recapturing the site would help Iraqi forces attack the militants in the nearby old city. It would also mark a symbolic step towards restoring state authority over Mosul, even though the buildings are destroyed and not being used by Islamic State.Rapid Response units captured have captured the Danadan district, which lies just south-east of the complex, while U.S.-trained Counter-Terrorism Service units pushed through Tal al-Ruman and the Somood districts, in the south-west.The Iraqi military believes several thousand militants, including many who traveled from Western countries, are hunkered down among the remaining civilian population, which aid agencies estimated to number 750,000 in western Mosul at the start of the latest offensive. The militants are using suicide car bombers, snipers and booby traps to counter the offensive waged by the 100,000-strong force of Iraqi troops, Kurdish peshmerga fighters and Iranian-trained Shi’ite Muslim paramilitary groups.They were also reported to have fired rockets and mortar rounds filled with toxic agents from the western side of the city to the eastern, government-controlled side.The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) offered to assist the Iraqi government investigating the use of chemical weapons in Mosul.Twelve people, including women and children, are being treated in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish region east of Mosul, for possible exposure to chemical agents causing blisters, eye redness, vomitting and irritation, the United Nations said on Saturday. Islamic State used chemical weapons at least 52 times in Iraq and Syria and at least 19 times in the areas around Mosul between 2014 and November 2016, according to data collected by IHS Markit. Several thousand people have been killed or wounded so far in the Mosul offensive, both civilians and military, according to aid organizations.

I’ve never seen that before,” exclaims Norma Respess, who shot the video at the Seven Springs Gulf and Country Club in Trinity last Thursday, according to Fox13 News. “Wow. What a sight! He’s holding onto that fish! Amazing!”Respess assures the reptile that she’s happy to give it plenty of room to enjoy its meal.“I don’t want to get near you. I’m glad you’ve got the fish,” she says.If it’s not obvious enough, alligators are excellent hunters and love a good fish. That’s not to say they always play fair.Late last month, another video posted to Facebook revealed an even larger alligator shamelessly stealing a boy’s fish, just moments before he could reel it onto the dock.The 11-year-old was hurrying to pull in his catch when the gator started making its way toward them.“The alligator’s coming, Connor. The alligator’s coming,” a man is heard urgently telling the boy.Alas, with a quick chomp, the fish was snatched away.“There’s no way you’re bringing that in, buddy,” a man says as they watch the gator swim away."

I can’t speak for other Title III-authorized entities in the government, or a state or local entity,” Clapper told NBC News’ Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press.”Clapper added that he would have known if the FBI had obtained a warrant from the FISA court to eavesdrop on Trump’s campaign over suspected illicit contact with Russian officials.“I can deny” that the FBI obtained such a warrant, Clapper said.Clapper was responding to Trump’s claims on Saturday morning that then-President Barack Obama personally ordered the wiretapping of Trump’s campaign headquarters in Trump Tower. Trump did not cite any evidence to support his claims.Clapper also said Sunday that during the time he was director of national intelligence, the intelligence agencies did not possess any evidence that “had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians.”But the FBI or another agency could have obtained such evidence since Clapper’s departure at the end of the Obama administration in late January, he noted.“This could have unfolded or become available in the time since I left the government,” Clapper said.Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said Sunday that he, too, didn’t know of any such FISA court order.“I’m not aware of any FISA court order regarding Trump Tower,” Warner said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”Warner declined to rule out the possibility, however, that law enforcement had obtained a warrant to surveil Trump and his associates in some other capacity.“I’m not going to get into what ongoing investigations the FBI might be taking,” the senator said.CNN national security commentator Mike Rogers, a former Republican congressman from Michigan who had chaired the House Intelligence Committee, said he was puzzled by the president’s accusation.“I don’t understand why they did it,” Rogers said Sunday. “He just put another quarter in the conspiracy parking meter. They have extended this story for a week, two weeks. Makes no sense to me whatsoever.”The story has been updated with comment from former Rep. Mike Rogers."

Weisberg",2017-03-05,"<p>Elizabeth and Philip Jennings, naturally in disguise. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bc59991500002600abd42e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since none of Joe Weisberg’s earliest concerns about The Americans turned out to be a problem, he sees no point in worrying now whether the show can stick the landing.FX’s widely acclaimed 1980s spy drama launches season five at 10 p.m. ET Tuesday, with the countdown to the ending in place. The Americans will have its usual 13 episodes this season, then wrap up in 2018 with a 10-episode final season.Weisberg, who created the show and is also one of the executive producers, says the ending isn’t some great unknown – except, of course, to viewers.“Things are heating up,” he acknowledged to TV writer last week. But, he adds, “We’ve had a good idea since season two where we wanted the story to end and it’s pretty much stuck.”There also remain plenty of hours in which the future of Soviet spies Elizabeth and Philip Jennings (Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) can unspool.Their immediate concern as we enter season five is that their FBI agent neighbor Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich), a man with a blind spot as big as Siberia, may have finally figured them out. There are also issues with the Jennings’s daughter Paige (Holly Taylor), who has had some teenage ambivalence about what her parents do for a living. On top of that, she’s dating Matthew Beeman (Daniel Flaherty), Stan’s son, which Weisberg finds a perfect touch. “She’s chosen the one boy in the world that her parents don’t want her to date,” he says. “How common is that?”The Americans has run through a fairly hefty roster of characters, with fresh departures including Stan’s FBI boss Agent Gaad (Richard Thomas) and Philip’s deluded informant Martha Hanson (Alison Wright), who was convinced Philip was going to be hers any day now. Some of their screen time may now go to Mischa, Philip’s son with an earlier girlfriend. Mischa just got out of jail after serving time for anti-Soviet activities. “We met Mischa in season two,” notes executive producer Joel Fields. “We had no intention of bringing him back. Then when we needed something last season, we went back to this child Philip had. It seemed like a natural way to pull all the heartstrings we can. “It was like a seed we planted and we didn’t realize how good a seed it was.”“We’ve always felt that we tell the stories through our characters,” says Weisberg. “If we follow their journey, the audience will understand the story.”He admits that when the show launched in 2013, he wasn’t sure whether the audience would warm up to a show whose primary characters were often-ruthless KGB agents, or whether some storylines would be too complex. “In the first season,” he says, “it was a big unknown whether people would follow these characters. They’re not antiheroes, they’re heroes for the other side.“But if people are with the Jenningses by now, I think they’ll stick with them to the end.”As for the machinations of the spy game, which is inherently shadowy and full of interlocking deceptions, he says, “A lot of the stories we used to think would be hard to follow. But once we saw the reactions, we realized it was rare to find anyone who didn’t understand what we were doing. So we just don’t think about it.”Speaking of response, The Americans turned out to be one of the rare shows that seems to be getting delayed awards recognition. While it has never been particularly high-rated, its critical acclaim has been strong and FX has loved it. The awards part, Fields says, is a bonus. “For years, we could honestly say we were just glad to be making the show and having people write intelligently about it,” he says. “Then we started getting nominations and we liked that, too.”To no one’s surprise, neither Fields nor Weisberg is offering hints on where things will end up. Rhys was suggesting two years ago that “the big question for Philip is the d-word: will he defect?”That’s felt like less of an issue for Elizabeth, though in the past season she showed a few small signs of wondering if she was always doing the right thing.“Philip has changed a lot over the course of the show,” says Weisberg. “Elizabeth hasn’t changed much at all.”One thing he says not to expect with the ending is any big philosophical linkup with the present, “insane as it is,” because the world is just different today than it was in the mid-1980s.“How they would have changed between the end of the series and now, who knows?” says Weisberg. “We try very hard not to extrapolate.”"

Initial reports said the projectiles were possibly intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), but the South Korean military later said that was unlikely.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un personally supervised the missile tests and ordered the country’s strategic missile defense branch “to keep highly alert as required by the grim situation in which an actual war may break out any time, and get fully ready to promptly move, take positions and strike so that it can open fire to annihilate the enemies,” North Korean state news agency KCNA reported, according to Reuters.“In the hearts of artillerymen ... there was burning desire to mercilessly retaliate against the warmongers going ahead with their joint war exercises,” KCNA said, referencing joint military drills conducted this month between South Korea and the U.S.The launches drew fierce condemnation. “The launches are clearly in violation of (UN) Security Council resolutions.

North Korea threatened last week to unleash a “merciless” response to joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises known as Foal Eagle.The Pentagon said on Friday that about 3,600 U.S. service members joined 28,000 U.S. troops already based in South Korea for the drills.Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt.

The victim said he had never seen the man before, the chief added.“It is our belief and opinion, based upon the experience of my investigators, that our victim is absolutely credible and that this incident did occur as he has described,” Thomas said, according to Seattle station King 5 News.“To think that this could happen in our community was very surprising and extremely disappointing,” he said.The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have been contacted, the chief said.Hate crime-tracking groups note that Sikh men, who often cover their heads with turbans, have been mistaken for Muslims by perpetrators of religiously motivated crimes in the U.S.The shooting came a little more than a week after an engineer from India was fatally shot in Kansas by a man who also allegedly yelled, “Get out of my country!” Adam W. Purinton, 51, has been charged with the murder of 32-year-old Srinivas Kuchibhotla in that case."

Dr. Travis Bradberry uncovers the secrets of the Type B personality.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bb795b1900003900bd6ca8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nobel Prize winner Edith Wharton once said, “There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.” This is an amazingly accurate description of the difference between Type A and Type B personalities. Type A personalities are the candles—and they’re usually burning at both ends. Type B personalities, on the other hand, put out every bit as much light; they just don’t get as much recognition for it. Type Bs don’t have all of that sparkle and sizzle that attract everyone’s attention. Since Type Bs aren’t as in your face about their contributions, they have a tendency to get mislabeled as lazy or indifferent.That bias goes all the way back to the origin of the Type A/Type B personality paradigm, in the waiting room of a couple of cardiologists. The doctors noticed that their chairs didn’t have wear on the backs as expected; it was only visible on the front edge of the seats and the armrests, which suggested that patients were literally waiting on the edge of their seats, ready to jump up the second their names were called. So, the cardiologists—Doctors Friedman and Rosenman—then wanted to find out if impatient people were more prone to heart disease. They discovered that their hunch was correct, and they labeled these impatient individuals ""Type A."" ""Type B"" was simply a label they assigned to anyone who wasn’t Type A. It’s as if Type Bs lack the distinguishing characteristics that drive them to be successful. Type Bs, however, know that this couldn’t be further from the truth. The very traits that people assume are the products of laziness or indifference are distinct personality characteristics that help Type Bs to achieve and prosper. Unlike Type As, Type Bs don’t feel like they have to be perfect, which means they are OK with recognizing and admitting their weaknesses. This acknowledgment equips them to shore up those weaknesses. Type Bs are also easier to get along with, as they tend to be supportive rather than rushing, pushing, and criticizing others. Type Bs don’t jump to conclusions. Since they’re not in a constant rush, they take the time to analyze all the facts instead of hurrying their analysis just to reach a decision. Type Bs also won’t keep beating a dead horse. Whereas Type As can become obsessed with making their chosen strategy work, Type Bs easily switch gears when it becomes obvious something isn’t working. In a nutshell, Type B personalities deserve a lot more credit than they get. To fully grasp what it means to be Type B, you need to hear it from the horse’s mouth. Don’t take my word for it—let’s see what they have to say:1. We’re not lazy; we’re just laid-back. Just because our goals aren’t pulsating like strobe lights on our foreheads doesn’t mean we don’t have any. We have goals, and we care about them just as much as you care about yours. But we see achieving those goals as a journey, not a sprint. We may stop and smell the proverbial roses along the way, but we still stay focused on where we’re going and what we need to do to get there.2. We have a plan. Just because we’re not barreling from step one to step two at breakneck speed doesn’t mean we don’t have a plan. We do. We just keep it to ourselves and follow it quietly rather than assigning time-keepers and judges to monitor our progress and help us stay on track.3. We care. Being laid-back is not the same as being disengaged or indifferent. The truth is that we care enough to work at the pace we’re most effective. If we didn’t care, we’d let you rush us even if that compromised quality.4. We’re content. We think it’s great that you’re so focused on your goals, but we simply don’t think as much about “What’s next?” because we’re pretty happy right where we are. In fact, we Type B people report a higher level of satisfaction with our lives, and that lets us enjoy today without worrying so much about what we’re going to achieve tomorrow.5. We’re healthier than you are. Overall, we suffer less stress, which can lead to everything from heart disease and insomnia to relationship problems and substance abuse. Our ability to relax not only paves the way for better decision-making, it also helps us maintain a healthy weight, avoid cancer, and fight off infections.6. We make great friends. We see the best in everyone—including you. Since we don’t view life as a competition, we’re the first to cheer you on and to support you along the way. And we cheer and support you, not just your achievements. We think that Robert Louis Stevenson knew what he was talking about when he said, “Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.”7. We work best when we’re allowed to color outside of the lines. Don’t give us a paint-by-numbers kit; we’d much rather have a blank canvas and a shiny new palette of colors. While you’re squinting at those small spaces, trying to make sure you stay within the lines, we’re backing up all the way across the room so we can see the big picture. 8. We like group projects. We know you don’t like group projects, and we know why: there are always a few group members who don’t feel that every second has to be accounted for or who don’t share your sense of urgency to do everything NOW! We focus on the process as well as the outcome. We’re happy to share the successes, the failures, and the credit, and we enjoy the give-and-take and collaboration that are part of working with a group, even if it slows things down a bit.9. We admire and respect you—but we wouldn’t trade places. We’re awed by your drive and by your breathtaking pace. We recognize the rewards that come your way, and we’re impressed. But we’re wise enough to know that we’re not wired that way. We’d be miserable, and so would everyone around us. So, we’re content to hang out in the slow lane and see you at the finish line. We’ll be the ones who are smiling calmly, rather than gasping for breath. Bringing It All TogetherWe really don’t mind ceding the limelight to Type A personalities; just don’t count us out. We have a lot to offer, and we want to contribute. We want to succeed at a high level. However, we’d rather enjoy the game and leave the scorekeeping to somebody else. After all, it doesn’t matter until the game is over.What other characteristics set Type B people apart? Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

The network solicited nude photos of female service members, some of whom had their name, rank and duty station listed, it said.The site talked of misogynist behavior, the document said, and the photos were on a secure drive in cloud storage, which has been removed.The document advised a response along the lines of: “The Marine Corps is deeply concerned about allegations regarding the derogatory online comments and sharing of salacious photographs in a closed website. This behavior destroys morale, erodes trust, and degrades the individual.”Representative Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington State, and ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, called for a complete investigation and for proper care of the victims.“This behavior by Marines and former Marines is degrading, dangerous, and completely unacceptable,” the congressman said in a statement.In an annual report the Pentagon released in May 2016, the U.S. military received about 6,000 reports of sexual assault in 2015, similar to the number in 2014, but such crimes are still underreported.(Reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas; Editing by Frank McGurty and Nick Zieminski)"
60,ENTERTAINMENT,'Get Out' Is The Type Of Movie The Oscars Should Pay Attention To,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/get-out-oscars_us_58b9742de4b05cf0f3ffbdd2,Let's start the campaign for Jordan Peele's horror satire now.,2017-03-05,"Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford, Allison Williams, Betty Gabriel and Daniel Kaluuya star in ""Get Out.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b9f7961900003600bd6b32.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This post contains spoilers.The same night “Moonlight” won Best Picture, “Get Out” ended its fruitful theatrical debut with $33.4 million in North American grosses, surpassing forecasts that estimated a $28 million opening. Jordan Peele’s horror film is expected to net another $26 million this go-round, remarkable for a genre known for steep second-weekend revenue declines.One week alone cannot presage a seismic shift, but the coupled victories for “Moonlight” and “Get Out” send a clear message about the types of stories worth telling on the big screen. “Moonlight” is a delicate coming-of-age masterpiece with an exclusively black cast, and “Get Out” is a scalding satire that indicts America’s racial bigotry as thoroughly as any slavery movie.The two share another commonality: rapturous reception. “Moonlight” drew near-universal acclaim and placed high on many critics’ year-end lists. It was, in many ways, the defining art film of 2016, doing first-rate business for a project that cost a mere $1.5 million to make. Similarly, “Get Out” promos boasted of the movie’s 100 percent Rotten Tomatoes score, at least until critic Armond White published his characteristically contrarian review in the National Review.Because “Moonlight” is an austere drama, it found an obvious portal into the Oscar race, eventually securing eight nominations. “Get Out,” on the other hand, hails from a genre regularly ignored by awards groups. Movies released in the first half of the year aren’t often remembered by the time Oscar campaigns rev up around September anyway. But those constructs should change because “Get Out” is every bit as worthy an Oscar candidate as much of the prestige fare that floods theaters every winter.Making his directorial debut, Peele positions “Get Out” within a through-line of classics chronicling social terrors. He has cited “Rosemary’s Baby” and “The Stepford Wives” ― nightmares about female subjugation and spousal manipulation ― as key influences. Except instead of demonic neighbors or patriarchal fascism, the fear in “Get Out” is something far more common: white people. Peele has crafted a postmodern indictment of racial bondage that requires astute viewership. Some will call this a “horror comedy,” but that’s a simplistic label: The humor is often a tongue-in-cheek result of the terror, which derives from white faces preying on black bodies. It is history, modernized and largely depoliticized, aside from the central milky clan insisting they would have voted for Barack Obama for a third term.As Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a black photographer, meets his white girlfriend Rose’s (Allison Williams) family for the first time at their suburban WASP manor, his anxieties are reflected in common horror tropes. Chris oozes paranoia, leaving us at first wondering, as we did with Rosemary, whether his misgivings are unfounded.We are all acquainted with, or can at least imagine, the stresses of meeting a partner’s relatives. (In-laws are terrifying, after all.) Abetted by the tension of a psychological thriller, that familiarity invokes skeptical amusement. We chuckle nervously as Rose’s family dotes over Chris like a trophy while their black house-servants mill about like zombies. We titter as his fears are seemingly confirmed and dismissed at once. Jump-scares ― those cheap “Boo!” tricks that have come to define the horror genre ― end in us laughing at ourselves for giving in to the scene the way it wants us to. We don’t yet know Rose and her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) have brewed a sinister plot that lobotomizes and enslaves black people, but we can detect an intangible racism beneath the surface, and that careful escalation leaves the viewer feeling susceptible. (It must be said, however, that the film does pepper in earnest comedy, mostly thanks to Chris’ loyal best friend, played by a boisterous Lil Rel Howery.) “Get Out” is a piece of craftsmanship, seemingly made by a veteran director. It takes a skilled filmmaker with a deep connection to the nature of storytelling to create something that twists our familiarity with movies into something original. That it follows recognizable patterns is precisely the point. In Peele’s heightened narrative, well-meaning white people ― those clueless social liberals who would gladly dedicate their avocado toast to Black Lives Matter ― are villains without masks. These boogeymen and -women are all around us. You might even be one of them. And that idea, however brashly outlined, fosters a sociological commentary as complex as any prestigious Oscar title.Whether “Get Out” will remain one of the year’s best, thereby sealing its Oscar worthiness, is yet to be seen. The last Best Picture champ released in January or February was 1991’s “The Silence of the Lambs,” the only horror movie that’s ever won. But Universal would be wise to start pondering an awards campaign, particularly for Kaluuya’s effective performance and Peele’s direction and script. Even if the Academy hasn’t delivered on its promise, the Best Picture category expanded to a potential 10 slots so the Oscars could recognize popular movies regularly edged out by more somber conventions. “Get Out” is every bit as nuanced and layered as many intimate indie dramas, and at a time when our country can seem more racially polarized than ever, it’s just the sort of topical confrontation that Americans should be encouraged to embrace.“Get Out” is now in theaters."

Husaini, 25, and Farhang, 26, are from the mountainous Afghan province of Bamiyan, famed for its ancient Buddha statues that were blown up by the Taliban in 2001.As children, Husaini and Farhang fled to Iran with their families to escape Afghanistan’s violence. They returned as young adults just as the Bamiyan Ski Club was established in 2011. Lugging borrowed skis on their shoulders, they trekked up the Bamiyan mountains and taught themselves to ski down.After winning three championships at Afghanistan’s national competition, the pair have been training as slalom skiers in Switzerland for three winters.“They progressed incredibly well,” their Swiss trainer Andreas Hanni said by phone from the Swiss resort of St Moritz. “Two years ago when they first started, they couldn’t ski parallel, but now they are racing.”Husaini thought skiing in Switzerland would be as easy as skiing on powder snow trails back home. “When we came here, I couldn’t even control my balance on the compact ski trails. We were training with short skis that tourists use for leisure,” he said.Despite their lack of experience, both skiers qualified for the Alpine Skiing world championships in St Moritz last month. They advanced to the semi-finals after competing in four rounds of qualifying races in the giant slalom, against competitors from more than 70 countries.“This was the first time Afghanistan was represented in the winter championships, and we are proud to be ice breakers,” Farhang said via instant messenger from the Alps.Now the Afghan skiers are training for the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. An instinct for survival may have helped them make such extraordinary progress.The Hazara are a Persian-speaking, mainly Shi’ite minority who have long faced persecution in Afghanistan, with thousands massacred by the Taliban and al Qaeda in the 1990s. In-fighting between Afghanistan’s two skiing federations meant they received no support from home, the skiers said.“Like everything, unfortunately sport has also become politicized in Afghanistan,” said Husaini. “We came here to represent our nation, but none of the officials called us, not even for a minute to give a word of encouragement.”"

Zoo director Vladen Henriquez said at the time that its veterinarians found wounds and bruising all over Gustavito’s body, apparently from unknown attackers who had trespassed onto the property. The hippo was still alive, but ultimately died of his injuries, the zoo said.But after a post-mortem exam, prosecutors are telling a different story, the BBC reported Saturday.State prosecutor Mario Salazar said there were no puncture wounds on Gustivato’s body. Instead, investigators determined that the hippo died from pulmonary hemorrhaging, meaning bleeding inside the lungs.Culture minister Silvia Elena Regalado said officials are still not totally ruling out an attack, since the stress of such an event could have induced medical issues, the AFP news agency reports.But Salazar’s team is suggesting the bleeding was caused by insufficient care for Gustavito on the part of the zoo. There are no surveillance cameras focused on the hippo’s enclosure, making it difficult to determine if an attack took place.Hippos have a typical lifespan of about 50 years."

They are fleeing President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, migrants and refugee agencies say.It is not common to have so many asylum seekers in the United States looking for refuge in Canada over such a short period. The influx poses a political risk for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who faces pressure from the left, which wants more let in, and from the right, which fears an increased security risk.“We are concerned and we will deal properly with the extra hundreds (crossing illegally),” Goodale told reporters at a televised news conference in Emerson, Manitoba. “But the full border deals with 400,000 people moving in both directions every day. It also handles C$2.5 billion in trade every day.“It is critically important for us to make sure that it is strong and secure. At the same time, it needs to be efficient and expeditious.”Emerson, on the North Dakota border, has been overwhelmed by the migration and appealed for more government help to handle the influx.Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Manitoba say 183 people have walked across that border in sub-zero temperatures since Jan. 1. Goodale said the pace has picked up in recent weeks.On Jan. 25, a White House executive order temporarily banned visitors from seven mainly Muslim countries and also expanded immigration enforcement action domestically.“The current accelerated rate started in the first week ofFebruary and we’ve been following this very very closely,” Goodale said.Canadian and U.S. officials are working on a plan to tackle asylum seekers crossing into Canada illegally, with American officials keen to discover how they entered the United States in the first place. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly is to visit Canada this month for talks on theborder.Goodale said it was important for both countries to have the same data and information about themigrants “to fully appreciate where the flow began and all of the factors – and it’s not just one factor – that are contributing to the migration.”"
64,POLITICS,EPA Budget Cuts Could Make East Chicago's Lead Crisis Worse,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-budget-cuts-east-chicago_us_58b9af7ae4b0b998941755bb,Contaminated drinking water adds to the woes of a city already dealing with toxic soil from a Superfund site.,2017-03-04,"A sign requests that residents keep from playing in the dirt or mulch at the West Calumet Housing Complex in East Chicago, Indiana. The soil contains high levels of lead and arsenic.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b9bbaf1a00003400f4179b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been about about a month since residents of East Chicago, Indiana, were told they should not drink their tap water without filtering it.The Environmental Protection Agency said actionable levels of lead had been found in the city’s water supply and warned residents to use certified filters until further notice.The discovery was yet another setback for a city already dealing with lead and arsenic levels in soil surrounding a Superfund waste site that are so high that Gov. Eric Holcomb declared an emergency disaster.Advocates say state and city officials aren’t doing enough to keep residents safe from the multiple ways they can be exposed to toxic lead. A coalition that includes the Natural Resources Defense Council, local organizations and East Chicago residents on Thursday issued a petition urging the EPA to launch a comprehensive emergency response to the city’s crisis.The petition calls for the EPA to “immediately” provide East Chicago residents with free faucet filters and bottled water, and to ensure the filters are installed correctly. The coalition also called for blood testing for children younger than 7, who are at high risk of lead exposure, and expanded water testing for more households than the EPA sampled last year.“Nobody should be forced to endure contaminated water,” Anjali Waikar, a staff attorney at the NRDC, told HuffPost. “We’re asking for temporary, short-term relief to ensure that people aren’t consuming contaminated water and asking for the agency to provide these basic life necessities until the situation is resolved.” EPA officials did not respond to a request for comment.The petition arrives at a time of upheaval at the EPA under President Donald Trump. Reports emerged this week that the agency’s budget could be cut as much as 24 percent. Many programs targeted for cuts could affect cleanup efforts in East Chicago. The EPA’s brownfields program could be slashed 44 percent, or $11 million, according to reports, and the agency’s state grant programs for drinking water and lead are listed for 30-percent reductions. EPA compliance and civil enforcement programs could see large cuts, too.The budget numbers are preliminary and the agency can still contest them. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer this week that he would resist cuts to state grant or infrastructure programs. Pruitt commented elsewhere that he would protect funding for Superfund cleanup.“We’ll work through the budgeting process to protect those dollars,” Pruitt told the CNN.Advocates said they want Pruitt’s EPA to move promptly in East Chicago. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has noted that no amount of lead detected in blood can be considered safe, and many East Chicago residents have likely been exposed — through soil, air and now water — for decades.The city is also welcoming EPA action. In a statement, East Chicago city attorney Carla Morgan said the city’s experience with lead “demonstrates that what Americans need is more action to protect our children from environmental and industrial toxins, not less.”“What we need is a more nimble, responsive EPA, which moves quickly to protect the health and well being of America’s children,” the statement said. “It is our sincere hope that the Trump administration will consider the severity of the issues that are impacting our community.”As Waikar sees it, East Chicago and other lower-income communities of color are where a slashed EPA budget would be felt the hardest.Of particular concern to Waikar is a proposed reduction of 78 percent, or $5.2 million, to EPA’s environmental justice program, which helps communities address industry pollution. “This situation is an illustration of why the EPA is so important,” Waikar said. “Communities like East Chicago are exactly the types of communities at risk of being impacted by these budget cuts.”Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, expressed similar concern with the reported slashing of EPA environmental justice funds. He said in a Wednesday statement that the proposal “sent a shameful message: The health of poor Americans is less important than that of the wealthy.” The lead crisis in East Chicago recalls the drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, where the EPA was criticized for intervening too slowly in that city’s lead-contamination problems.Pruitt said during his Senate confirmation hearing in January that there “should have been a more rapid response” to the Flint crisis. Trump, on the campaign trail, blamed the Flint crisis on “incompetent politicians” and said it “would have never happened if I were president.” Debbie Chizewer, a law fellow at Northwestern University’s Environmental Advocacy Clinic who has been assisting East Chicago residents, said the city’s crisis is a chance for Pruitt and the Trump administration to make good on their remarks.“I hope they recognize that this is an opportunity to show how they’d handle situations differently,” Chizewer said.This story has been updated to include Morgan’s statement.―Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

65,POLITICS,From Despair To Anger To Determination: A Ground-Level View Of The Democratic Evolution,Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ground-level-view-of-the-democratic-evolution_us_58baae49e4b0d2821b4e7e9e,Delaware's Stephanie Hansen had a unique look at how the party's mood was changing.,2017-03-04,"“As soon as the inauguration and the women’s marches [happened], Democrats and those who are like-minded became very angry,” Stephanie Hansen said, explaining how she saw attitudes change after the presidential election. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bab5601900003300bd6bd8.jpeg?cache=WGBn9KpNoJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Delaware Democrats nominated Stephanie Hansen on Dec. 21 to run in a special election for a state Senate seat, voting was just two months away. She hit the campaign trail immediately. Although Democrats held a slight advantage in the district, she knew that special elections, like midterms, could be the party’s Achilles’ heel. Working-class voters tend to sit out contests not held in presidential election years. As Hansen went door to door, she quickly realized she had an additional problem: utter despair and depression. “All of the crazy things, all of the executive orders that created such chaos, hadn’t happened yet,” she told The Huffington Post. “What I saw on the ground, beginning in December, was that the Democrats in the community were very depressed, very sad. There was a lot of anguish, from Dec. 21 till right about the inauguration.”Hansen had a unique ground-level perception of the electorate, a view that perhaps only her Republican opponent, John Marino, can share, as he also went door to door at the same time. “As soon as the inauguration and the women’s marches [happened], Democrats and those who are like-minded became very angry,” Hansen recalled, citing the seemingly unending series of executive orders. “I watched that whole process happen. That anger turned into something different. It turned into determination.”As protests moved from airports to town halls, Hansen’s race caught the attention of Democrats around the country looking to channel their rage and newfound determination. More than $300,000 poured in from small donors. Hansen said more than 12,000 individual contributors gave her an average of $24. Ultimately, she received more donations than votes. Still, she managed to crush Marino 58 percent to 41 percent in a race he had previously lost by just two points. “These people were happily, joyfully running to the polls,” she said. “I haven’t seen that kind of turnout in a long time. It was really a curious thing, going from sadness to anguish to anger and then into determination. From a sociological perspective, it was a great thing to watch that happen.”For Democrats and other opponents of Donald Trump, it’s been an equally great thing to watch. Democrats have seen a significant uptick in turnout for special elections in Iowa, Virginia, Minnesota and Connecticut. Party activists are pouring everything they have into a Georgia special election Democrats normally wouldn’t bother competing in: to fill the seat former Rep. Tom Price left empty when he was confirmed as health and human services secretary.Now that her campaign is over, Hansen has been getting pressed by people outside the district who supported her to pay it forward.“Many of the groups that supported me are saying, ‘OK, we supported Stephanie; now, Stephanie, you join us and help these people in Connecticut, and these people in Georgia,’” she said, referring to three special elections in Connecticut and the race to replace Price.And it’s true that the kind of swing the party saw in Delaware, if nationalized, changes the map. Marino got 5,963 votes in 2014, losing to Bethany Hall-Long’s 6,230. Hall-Long became lieutenant governor last year, creating the opening that led to the special election. But this time around, Marino got just 4,936 votes, nearly 20 percent fewer than he had before. This wasn’t that unexpected, as turnout is typically at its lowest during special elections. What startled Republicans ― and energized Democrats ― was Hansen’s vote total of 7,315.Did a thousand Republicans switch parties and support Hansen, or did Democrats who had previously stayed home make their way to the voting booth? Hansen said she knows some Republicans flipped, and that she noticed a mood change among them, too. She was very concerned at the outset of the race that she might lose. “I thought I might be neck and neck or slightly behind,” she said. “My opponent was fairly well-known and a good campaigner, a good candidate. He was out at grocery stores and shaking hands, had signs up in many neighborhoods. It was difficult to get up and go door-knocking in neighborhoods where he’s got 20 signs and I’ve got nothing.”Plus, Hansen said, she saw Republicans feeling “energized” so soon after the election. “They were energized all the way up until the inauguration,” she said. “After inauguration, the days began to pass and [Trump] began with one executive order after another and one cause of chaos and instability after another, and the Republicans became less energized. They’d say, ‘Oh my, what did we do?’ By the end, we had a number of people feeling like, ‘I voted for Trump, but maybe I made a mistake.’” Hansen said she consciously worked to make room for those voters in her tent. “In my speeches, I welcomed people who wanted to have second thoughts,” she said. “They are still of the mindset they have to go out and vote. They just may not vote for the Republican this time.”Sign up to get more news on the resistance.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Instead, he spent the afternoon in a private Catholic school that participates in Florida’s tax credit scholarship program. That program gives tax breaks to corporations and individuals who donate money to a scholarship granting group. This group, in turn, helps low-income kids attend private schools. Trump’s visit has been seen as a show of support for programs like Florida’s, which make it easier for students to attend private schools. He has signaled his support for such programs before, although it is unclear what a school choice initiative from his administration would look like. Trump visited the school with an entourage, including U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner. He visited a fourth-grade classroom and participated in a roundtable discussion with school leaders. St. Andrew Catholic School in Orlando serves students from pre-kindergarten to eighth grade. The school’s website says: “our goals are simple: College and Heaven.”While at the school, Trump highlighted Denisha Merriweather, a young woman who enrolled in a private school through Florida’s school choice program. Earlier in the week, Merriweather was one of his guests to his address to Congress. He said he hopes to see “millions more to achieve the same success” as Merriweather during the visit.After one child told him she wants to start a business, he joked that she’s “gonna make a lot of money. But don’t run for politics,” he said, according to the Associated Press.Public education leaders strongly criticized Trump’s trip to the school, citing evidence that school voucher programs ― a close cousin of tax credit scholarship programs ― are ineffective and drain resources from public schools.“To borrow a word from President Trump, it’s so ‘sad’ that the president and his secretary of education have demonstrated such an antipathy toward public schools,” said president of the American Federation of Teachers Randi Weingarten in a statement. “He has taken a page right out of the extremist playbook by criticizing, undermining and proposing the defunding of public schools and instead trumpeting private alternatives.” Similar to tax credit programs, voucher programs also use taxpayer money to pay for children to go to private schools. President of the National Education Association Lily Eskelsen García noted that unlike public schools, private schools do not have to accept every student and are not held accountable for their performance. “A child’s success should not depend on a gamble, and yet today’s visit by President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos shows they’re doubling down on failed policies like voucher schemes that steal taxpayer dollars from public schools to fund private and for-profit schools, all at the expense of students,” said García’s statement. In recent days, groups like The Century Foundation have also released reports criticizing Trump’s education agenda and emphasis on private schools.Richard Kahlenberg, report author and a senior fellow at the left-leaning foundation, says that if Trump follows through on his proposed education plans, it could help lead to the privatization of the American public school system.“I think public education is under a bigger threat than any time in my memory,” Kahlenberg told The Huffington Post. Kahlenberg noted that tax credit programs essentially have the same result as voucher programs, in “diverting public money from public schools to private schools.”DeVos, Trump’s controversial secretary of education, has long been a supporter of these types of programs. She has said she sees tax credit and voucher programs as a way to provide the same opportunities to poor families as rich families.  ― ― Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

67,POLITICS,Syria Rebels Want Trump To Know They're The Ones Fighting ISIS,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syria-opposition-trump-isis_us_58b9eb17e4b05cf0f400b612,The Free Syrian Army is hopeful for more support despite the president's praise of Bashar Assad.,2017-03-04,Syrians stage a protest against the Assad regime's violation of a cease-fire after Friday prayers in Damascus.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ba12e91a00003700f418b5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Syria’s main anti-government rebel coalition hopes to keep U.S. support by pointing to successful advances against the so-called Islamic State and wants President Donald Trump to turn his talk of “safe zones” in the country into a U.S. plan for no-fly zones, a top spokesman told The Huffington Post on Friday.Speaking from Geneva after the latest round of internationally sponsored talks between the opposition and the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad, Maj. Issam Al Reis, spokesman for the Free Syrian Army, cited its push against ISIS in northern Syria, in collaboration with Turkish forces, and the rebels’ resistance against ISIS advances in the south as evidence that it’s ready for the U.S. to step up.And Al Reis dismissed the idea that Trump, who has praised Assad and his patron Russian President Vladimir Putin, would consider the regime a partner as he tries to win a quick high-profile victory against ISIS. Reporters and analysts following the conflict had noted that the U.S. air campaign against the extremist group recently launched airstrikes that helped Assad and his allies retake the city of Palmyra.“The regime is not fighting ISIS,” Al Reis, a former officer in Assad’s army, said. He noted that Assad’s forces, which rely heavily on Russian jets and pro-Iran fighters, had captured and then lost Palmyra to ISIS before.Analysts say Assad’s coalition has focused most of its attacks on the Free Syrian Army, which is relatively moderate and which the West considers an acceptable alternative to the regime, rather than on ISIS and the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda, which the U.S. and a host of other nations are committed to defeating. Trump’s United Nations ambassador, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, has continued the American denouncement of Assad.Al Reis said Assad’s removal remains non-negotiable for the tens of thousands of fighters still loyal to the opposition, arguing that no peace would be possible without a political transition. “We believe as soon as there’s a cease-fire, the regime will be out ... the regime is living on the blood of the Syrians,” he said, noting that international investigators concluded this week that Assad’s forces deliberately targeted a U.N. humanitarian aid convoy in September. The latest Geneva talks ended with a small breakthrough ― a commitment to negotiations later in the month ― but Al Reis blasted the regime for failing to stop attacks during the meetings, saying either it or Putin were at fault for breaking the promise to do so.International support for the Syrian Free Army Southern Front, which Al Reis belongs to, has continued unchanged despite external developments, he said. Aid to Free Syrian Army groups in the north had been cut after they appeared vulnerable to being defeated and having their weapons confiscated by hard-line Islamic militants, Reuters reported. The increasing power of Al Qaeda’s former affiliate in the north has caused some analysts to speculate that the opposition there is set to collapse ― deemed too extreme to the West and vulnerable to an all-out assault by the regime.Al Reis conceded that many anti-Assad Syrians in the north had become close to the Al Qaeda group, now known as Tahrir al-Sham. He blamed Assad and Russia for deliberately pushing fighters and civilians into the movement’s arms by brutally crushing Aleppo, the chief rebel bastion in the northwest, and said the Free Syrian Army maintained a strong moderate presence in the north as part of its operation with Turkey. “We know it’s a plan. We are trying to stop this from happening,” Al Reis said. “I don’t think Syrians accept the ideology of Al Qaeda.”The spokesman said his group is focused on presenting itself as the best possible option for the U.S. against extreme militants in Syria.This can be difficult in some instances. Much of the Free Syrian Army coalition dislikes a Kurdish militia, the YPG, which has worked closely with the U.S. against ISIS. The Syrian coalition, predominantly Arab, says the YPG Kurds discriminate against Arabs and are too close to Assad. Turkey, the Free Syrian Army’s top foreign supporter, considers the YPG a terrorist group. Al Reis echoed the Turkish position in the Friday interview. The alliance between his rebel group and Turkey in northern Syria has had significant clashes with a YPG-controlled coalition called the Syrian Democratic Forces, most recently this week, which puts Washington in a tough position.And some of the anti-Islam faction around Trump is skeptical of the idea that the U.S. should work with Muslim rebels, saying a dictator with a secular veneer like Assad is preferable, dismissing concerns over the regime’s alleged war crimes and accusing even the celebrated aid organization The White Helmets of being a terrorist front.But Al Reis said the rebels plan to emphasize that they have been fighting groups other than ISIS that the U.S. considers terroristic, notably the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah.“If they are aiming to fight terrorism, they should think about who’s their partners,” he said."

These are big-deal things.”McCarthy was responding to reports that President Donald Trump’s EPA, led by Scott Pruitt, a climate change skeptic with close ties to the oil and gas industry, will next week undo automobile emissions regulations put in place by former President Barack Obama. Trump will also instruct Pruitt to begin unraveling the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration’s ambitious effort to reduce power plant carbon emissions.And in February, Trump signed legislation eliminating an Obama administration regulation aimed at protecting waterways from coal mining waste.“I don’t know why they’ve decided that our core values no longer include clean air and clean water. But that seems to be what this is about,” McCarthy said. “It’s executive orders that are threatening the safety of our drinking water for 117 million Americans.” McCarthy acknowledged that Trump does not have the power to overturn the Obama administration’s regulatory regime with a mere stroke of the pen, since the rules are complex and will take time to dismantle.But, she said, “What you can do is send a signal about whether you care about public health and the core values of the American families. And this is sending a very bad signal.”The Obama administration’s environment czar went on to criticize the Trump administration’s reported plans to slash EPA funding, including by reducing staff size by one-fifth.“This is not just an all-out attack on EPA and the protections we’ve brought to the American people, but it’s an all-out attack on environmental protection, because it also cuts state grants by 30 percent,” McCarthy concluded. “You know, if people were worried before about whether Flint, Michigan, is a one-off, they should be really worried today.” How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

People say he’s this untrained, different kind of president ― one without all the deceit, political correctness and narcissism that defines the image of a stereotypical politician. But he is all of those things. This is why I can’t stand him and why I am willing to insult him by calling him a liar and a hypocrite despite my respect for the American presidency as an institution.It’s not that his policies or ideas are wrong. I’ll respectfully take on someone who is wrong but open minded, as well as principled and well-intentioned any day. It’s that his autocratic tendencies and outright lies to the American people are part of a personality which can only be described as inherently political in that it is diametrically opposed to the concept of objective truth so long as that truth does not serve his political agenda.Thus, he is eminently politically correct. Just with a different set of politics than the autocratic postmodernists of the left, also known as “social justice warriors” or “regressives”.Trump’s method of lying, that is making utterly baseless accusations with infinitely significant implications to serve his naked agenda of dominance over others exposes him as the very thing which he despises most. A typical, politically correct politician.Trump’s treatment of the media shows his autocratic tendencies. He will say anything and silence anyone no matter the facts, so long as it serves his political agenda. If political correctness is now thought to be signified by an autocratic tendency to silence others that don’t align with one’s accepted politics, then Donald Trump is not a president fighting political correctness. He is in fact contributing to it by creating an autocratic, postmodernist bubble on the right that rivals the one on the left. He does so by spouting utter, right-wing nonsense with exactly zero evidence to support his claims.In lieu of evidence, what Trump does have is the very same thing that left-wing, politically correct zealots have. That is merely an uncanny ability to shout that which is untrue so loudly and confidently that others who trust you via your shared political alignment will dogmatically believe it out of an underlying, slavish devotion to you and your shared politics.This slavish devotion can be described as the delusion of partisanship or as politically correct behavior when it has implications in government policy. The manipulation of this slavish devotion can be called demagoguery. It can also be called lying.Since he is President, everything Donald Trump says publicly has policy implications. And what he’s saying are lies. Out and out, boldfaced lies to the American people to serve his own agenda of right-wing political correctness.The only way to truly fight political correctness is with truths which may happen to serve either the left or right. These truth are designated as such by virtue of the evidence presented to support them. Donald Trump has no evidence. Donald Trump is a liar. His lies serve his political agenda and only his political agenda. So, Donald Trump is that which he and his supporters claim he is the antithesis of, thus he is a hypocrite to boot. He is a typical politician and a highly politically correct one at that."

72,POLITICS,Lindsey Graham Nails The Problem With Trump's Wiretapping Claims,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-donald-trump-wiretapping_us_58bb304be4b05cf0f40104e9,"If Obama got a warrant to eavesdrop, then Trump probably did something wrong, the South Carolina senator noted.",2017-03-04,Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) addressed Trump's baseless claim Saturday that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower phones.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bb30ff1500002200abd31a.jpeg?cache=cFKtoaEHhz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Saturday that if former President Barack Obama actually wiretapped Donald Trump’s phones, either legally or illegally, it would be the biggest scandal since Watergate.Speaking at a town hall in Clemson, South Carolina, Graham addressed Trump’s baseless claims that Obama eavesdropped on him prior to the 2016 election. Trump claimed Obama’s actions were as scandalous as “Nixon/Watergate” in one of several tweets on Saturday morning.“I don’t know if it’s true or not, but if it is true, illegally, it would be the biggest political scandal since Watergate,” Graham said, referring to a scenario in which the Obama administration tapped Trump’s phones without a warrant. The crowd, which was evidently packed with anti-Trump residents, booed at this suggestion.But then Graham, who is often willing to publicly criticize Trump, suggested that it would equally shocking if the eavesdropping had been done legally.“The other side of the story ― just be quiet for a second ― if the former president of the United States was able to obtain a warrant lawfully to monitor Trump’s campaign for violating a law, that would be the biggest scandal since Watergate,” he said.Graham made clear that the latter form of wiretapping would be aimed at investigating “Trump campaign activity with foreign governments.”“So it’s my job as a United States senator to get to the bottom of this. I promise you I will,” he concluded, drawing applause.The president typically does not order surveillance, and there is no evidence that the Obama administration wiretapped Trump’s phones. The FBI, which is part of the Department of Justice, must request a warrant for a wiretap, and the DOJ prides itself on operating independently from the White House. The president ordering surveillance on an American would be a huge violation of that independence.A FISA Court denied the FBI’s request for a warrant to monitor four members of the Trump campaign team over the summer, according to The Guardian.Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis addressed Trump’s claims Saturday in a statement, calling them “simply false.”“As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen,” Lewis said.The statement does not appear to preclude the possibility that the Obama administration’s Department of Justice surveilled Trump of its own volition.It is not clear what prompted Trump’s remarks. Trump may have been responding to recent leaks revealing that senior Trump campaign officials had contact with the Russian government during the campaign or transition period and later denied doing so, or misrepresented the nature of the meetings. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself Thursday from any investigation of Russia’s alleged interference in the election, after the Washington Post reported that he met with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the campaign. During his confirmation hearing, Sessions denied meeting with the Russian government while serving as a Trump campaign surrogate.Graham did not spend his entire town hall speaking critically about Trump, however. At one point, he spoke over loud jeers to explain why he wanted to help Trump be “as successful as possible.”“Number one, I agree with him, mostly, and I’d like to get this country moving again,” he said.Since January, disgruntled constituents have been filling Republican lawmakers’ town halls in order to grill their representatives about plans to replace Obamacare and investigate Trump. Many lawmakers have responded by canceling their public meetings or otherwise avoiding in-person contact with constituents that cannot be controlled.But Graham said he was pleased to hear from his constituents despite the cantankerous reception."

One of the most eye-popping of those is the sand verbena, which blankets the area with purple. Those flowers are just beginning to bloom now, as the San Diego Union Tribune documented on Friday.Botanist Jim Dice, who is also the husband of the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park superintendent, told the Tribune that the “prime” annual bloom is about a week or two away.

While that may sound peculiar, it’s not all that extraordinary. It snows nearly every year on the Big Island’s tallest mountains, where the warning was issued.But during that blizzard, which lasted late Tuesday to early Wednesday, the Big Island received more snow than Denver has received all year, according to Fox 31 Denver.Indeed, this week’s blizzard left up to 8 inches of snow on Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, which are both more than 13,000 feet high, USA Today reported. Denver, on the other hand, has had a total of only 7.9 inches of snow measured in 2017. However, the Mile High City has had 19.3 inches of snow for the winter season, according to CBS Denver.The Big Island’s peaks even saw more snow than Chicago, which documented zero snow on the ground in January and February for the first time in 146 years, The Chicago Tribune reported.Chicago’s measurements don’t include any snow that may have fallen and melted after 6 a.m., which is when the National Weather Service measures the snow. Some experts are chalking up Chicago’s lack of snow to climate change, according to the Tribune.“This is occurring against a backdrop of a changing climate,” Tom Skilling, a Chicago meteorologist told the newspaper. “I think the door is open to additional unusual weather events as we go forward.”And the Aloha State’s blizzard was particularly strong.“The reason for the snow amounts being heavier than we usually see is that the upper low (pressure system) really persisted down there, that has allowed colder air to remain locked in place,” Andrew Orrison, a forecaster for the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center, told Reuters on Thursday.But don’t let the Big Island’s recent show of snow fool you: The islands are not taking over as the next premiere ski destination.The Hawaii Snow Ski Club website states that Mauna Kea’s summit only “sometimes gets a skiable/boardable mantle of snow.”“There are no lifts, no grooming, no resort,” the website says. “Conditions at the top are extremely variable.”The club also warns that “snow conditions on Mauna Kea may not be the best in the world.”"

Learn them before they tempt you into looking bad.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b88c631a00003c00f414f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Our bodies have a language of their own, and their words aren’t always kind. Your body language has likely become an integral part of who you are, to the point where you might not even think about it.If that’s the case, it’s time to start, because you could be sabotaging your career.TalentSmart has tested more than a million people and found that the upper echelons of top performance are filled with people who are high in emotional intelligence (90 percent of top performers, to be exact). These people know the power that unspoken signals have in communication and they monitor their own body language accordingly.“Body language is a very powerful tool. We had body language before we had speech, and apparently, 80 percent of what you understand in a conversation is read through the body, not the words.” - Deborah BullWhen you’re working hard and doing all you can to achieve your goals, anything that can give you an edge is powerful and will streamline your path to success. Just make certain you don’t fall victim to any of these body language blunders.1. Exaggerated gestures can imply that you’re stretching the truth. Aim for small, controlled gestures to indicate leadership and confidence, and open gestures—like spreading your arms apart or showing the palms of your hands—to communicate that you have nothing to hide.2. Crossed arms create a physical barrier that suggests you’re not open to what the other person is saying. Even if you’re smiling or engaged in a pleasant conversation, the other person may get a nagging sense that you’re shutting him or her out. Even if folding your arms feels comfortable, resist the urge to do so if you want people to see you as open-minded and interested in what they have to say.3. Inconsistency between your words and your facial expression causes people to sense that something isn’t right and they begin to suspect that you’re trying to deceive them, even if they don’t know exactly why or how.For example, a nervous smile while rejecting an offer during a negotiation won’t help you get what you want; it will just make the other person feel uneasy about working with you because they’ll assume that you’re up to something.4. Turning yourself away from others, or not leaning into your conversation, portrays that you are unengaged, uninterested, uncomfortable, and perhaps even distrustful of the person speaking.Try leaning in towards the person who is speaking and tilt your head slightly as you listen to them speak. This shows the person speaking that they have your complete focus and attention.5. Slouching is a sign of disrespect. It communicates that you’re bored and have no desire to be where you are. You would never tell your boss, “I don’t understand why I have to listen to you,” but if you slouch, you don’t have to—your body says it for you, loud and clear.The brain is hardwired to equate power with the amount of space people take up. Standing up straight with your shoulders back is a power position. It maximizes the amount of space you fill. Slouching, on the other hand, is the result of collapsing your form—it takes up less space and projects less power. Maintaining good posture commands respect and promotes engagement from both ends of the conversation. 6. Avoiding eye contact makes it look like you have something to hide, and that arouses suspicion. Lack of eye contact can also indicate a lack of confidence and interest, which you never want to communicate in a business setting. Sustained eye contact, on the other hand, communicates confidence, leadership, strength, and intelligence. While it is possible to be engaged without direct, constant eye contact, complete negligence will clearly have negative effects on your professional relationships.7. Eye contact that’s too intense may be perceived as aggressive, or an attempt to dominate. On average, Americans hold eye contact for seven to ten seconds, longer when we’re listening than when we’re talking. The way we break contact sends a message, too. Glancing down communicates submission, while looking to the side projects confidence.8. Watching the clock while talking to someone is a clear sign of disrespect, impatience, and inflated ego. It sends the message that you have better things to do than talk to the person you’re with, and that you’re anxious to leave them.9. Exaggerated nodding signals anxiety about approval. People may perceive your heavy nods as an attempt to show you agree with or understand something that you actually don’t.10. Fidgeting with or fixing your hair signals that you’re anxious, over-energized, self-conscious, and distracted. People will perceive you as overly concerned with your physical appearance and not concerned enough with your career.11. Scowling or having a generally unhappy expression sends the message that you’re upset by those around you, even if they have nothing to do with your mood. Scowls turn people away, as they feel judged. Smiling, however, suggests that you’re open, trustworthy, confident, and friendly. MRI studies have shown that the human brain responds favorably to a person who’s smiling, and this leaves a lasting positive impression.12. Weak handshakes signal that you lack authority and confidence, while a handshake that is too strong could be perceived as an aggressive attempt at domination, which is just as bad. Adapt your handshake to each person and situation, but make sure it’s always firm.13. Getting too close. If you stand too close to someone (nearer than one and a half feet), it signals that you have no respect for or understanding of personal space. This will make people very uncomfortable when they’re around you.Bringing It All TogetherAvoiding these body language blunders will help you form stronger relationships, both professionally and personally.Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.

76,WOMEN,7 Reasons Why The Dating System Is Broken And How To Navigate The Shit-Show,"Megan Bruneau, M.A. RCC, ContributorI'm a psychotherapist, executive coach, podcast host, and writ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/7-reasons-why-the-dating-system-is-broken-and-how-to_us_58ba43bbe4b0fa65b844b36c,"Like most single people in New York, I both deplore and perpetuate the IRL version of The Bachelor that is dating in this",2017-03-04,"<p>Bryan is spending Saturday power-dating! After this, he’ll head to Brooklyn for cocktails with “Alaina Bumble.” </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ba44071a00001900f418f7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like most single people in New York, I both deplore and perpetuate the IRL version of The Bachelor that is dating in this city. I complain about the prevalence of sociopathy and erratic behavior, then date four people at once to cover my feelings of vulnerability with a safety net of affection. I wake up feeling lonely one day or wishing someone (I were in love with) were lying next to me – then am inundated with friends’ and clients’ stories of infidelity, heartbreak and lost interest – and return to a place of skepticism about monogamy and relationship longevity.You’ve probably heard of the “Dating Apocalypse,” and how it appears every single out there is frustrated, confused, and discouraged. This is a misnomer. Dating is alive and well. Dating is THRIVING, which contributes to said singles’ frustration. It’s dating exclusively that’s passé – at least in this city. And while NYC might be an on-steroids version of the “Dating Exclusively Apocalypse,” globally anywhere with apps and liberal values is affected.Let’s first take a look at all the reasons why the system is broken (note: this is a handy summary to share with grand/parents, colleagues, and anyone else who “can’t understand how you’re single!!!”). We’ll then all laugh nervously and discuss how to maintain sanity while partaking in the social experiment that is dating in 2017. 1. The “Paradox of Choice”A decade ago, Psychologist Barry Schwartz gave a seminal TED talk on “The Paradox of Choice.” If you haven’t seen it, watch it. It’s still one of my favs. The gist: when we’re faced with too many options, we become paralyzed in our decision-making process. Should we actually make a choice, we end up feeling dissatisfied because we question whether we made the “right” one. For example, you go to buy a box of cereal and have 30 to choose from. Overwhelmed, you labor over which cereal to go home with, finally choosing the Corn Pops fifteen minutes later but stressed AF throughout the decision-making process. You get home and wonder if you should’ve chosen the Chex instead. The next morning you eat your bowl of Corn Pops skeptically, resentful to them for getting soggy faster or being less social at parties than you imagine a bowl of Chex would. And a couple days later when you pop into CVS to pick up toothpaste (which also takes 15 mins longer than it should), you pick up a box of Chex. Now replace “Corn Pops” with “Amanda” and “Chex” with “Ayako” and “the cereal aisle” with “Bumble” and you understand the destructive effect of dating apps on commitment and satisfaction. AND imagine you could access the cereal in Germany or L.A. or Brazil as well (coughTinderPluscough)!Once upon a time, proximity was the primary way people met: we lived in the same building (or in the homestead a mile down), ran in the same friend circle, or worked in the same office. Now, we not only have access to an endless supply of options in our city, we truly can date anywhere in the world. A weekend visit to London? Put it on points! That Aussie dude you met surfing in Bali? Skype sex FTW! 2. Phantom daters in the online poolIf someone’s on an app, it means they’re committed to trying to find someone, right? Wrong. Apps are an emotionally unavailable person’s dream. You can titrate your vulnerability (yep, Yours Truly over here), seek distraction from your uncomfortable feelings, and instantly find reassurance of your desirability…then forget the app exists when you feel whole again. So for those of us who are frustrated because we don’t know where that girl we had that long talk about politics with disappeared to, or that guy we matched with who won’t respond, they’re probably still getting over their ex or are now busy with work or are seeing someone else or just aren’t that into you but wanted someone to talk to when they were feeling lonely that night.These “phantom daters” create the intermittent reinforcement that keeps us mind-fucked and “dating defensively” (which I’ll explain shortly). We become conditioned to feel anxiety, distrust, and pessimism around dating because the “phantom dating” experience creates the illusion of connection–that inevitably unravels and leaves us a little more disconcertingly unfazed each time.3. “Defensive Dating” out of uncertainty that actually perpetuates the cycleWhen I was 26, I fell hard for a guy I was seeing. With blinders on, I (incorrectly) assumed his unabashed affection meant he felt the same way. Fast forward to a few months later when he broke the news he’d been dating someone else at the same time, whom he ultimately “chose” over me. The shock, humiliation, and betrayal of such an event birthed in me a behavior I refer to as “defensive dating.” The strategy is to date multiple people at once to protect oneself from the anxiety of “all your eggs in one basket” abandonment. We used to assume a mutually identified connection with someone meant things would progress. Now, because we have limitless understudies at our fingertips (literally), there’s no security in said connection; thus the defensive dating strategy diversifies our portfolios.The problem with this strategy, though, is it perpetuates the cycle. Why? GRE refresher time! “If Megan is dating three people, and each person Megan is dating is dating two other people while they date Megan, how many stand to get hurt should things progress to an exclusive place with any of the individuals involved?” And what does each rejected party take away from the experience? Anxiety, skepticism, guardedness, and… yep… more “defensive dating” as a way of navigating the minefield.4. Other-oriented perfectionism (unrealistic expectations)Because we’re a generation of individuals who’ve been taught to “never settle,” we’re all waiting for unicorns. We might meet someone with whom we have an amazing connection, similar values, and unbelievable sex, but their grammar isn’t perfect or they’re a terrible cook or they have an itty-bitty freckle next to their nose that we find suuuper distracting. Not only does this prevent deepening of the “situationship,” it has a boomerang-back-to-the-unlimited-supply-of-alternatives effect.5. Dissolution of religionOrganized religion is so last century, and anxiety, divorce, and ambivalence about marriage are totes on-trend. Some studies actually show divorce rates are higher in Christian marriages than atheist ones, but that’s because you have to actually get married to get divorced (and atheist couples are less likely to get married than Christian ones). Religion-inspired marriage is rarely the sole impetus to seeking an exclusive relationship, but there’s no denying its influence.6. The liberation of womenI’m not complaining about this over here, but it’s worth mentioning. While the wage gap and many other forms of inequality are DEFINITELY STILL A THING, women are no longer forced to marry to survive. We’re now allowed to earn an income of our own, both legally and culturally, thus one major “need” to partner is now irrelevant. And this allows us to be choosier and less committal. 7. Children-of-divorce with resultant attachment issues and skepticism around relationship longevity/monogamyThe aforementioned dissolution of religion and liberation of women skyrocketed our parents’ divorce rates and produced a millennial generation of attachment issues, marital disenchantment, and relational skepticism. Not every child of divorce is going to be insecurely attached, and not every child from an in-tact family is going to be securely attached, but the correlation is real. Well, this is bleak. What do we do about it? Similar to the psychological struggles people bring into my office, knowing the “why” doesn’t necessarily equate to resolution. We can’t easily revert to a time when we didn’t have a date vending machine at our fingertips – to a time when people weren’t so disposable. But there are a few things we can do. And trust me, I highlight these “best dating practices” to cultivate integrity in my own behavior alongside a call to action for my fellow singles. Self preservation-driven or not, it’s up to us to fix the broken system: Make it clear on your profile and in-person whether or not you’re looking for a relationship in the near(ish) future. If you’re healing a broken heart or a workaholic or emotionally unavailable and not looking for anything “real” for another reason, no judgment, but be explicit about it. You’ll prob still attract a bunch of people on a mission to “change” you, but at least they’ve signed the waiver. That’s all for now (though I welcome you to share any advice on how to make dating great again). And, if my shameless oversharing makes you question my credibility, let’s just all fall back on wisdom we can universally agree upon: The #truth of The Sunscreen Song: “Don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts, and don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours.” Good luck out there.Megan Bruneau, M.A. RCC is a mental health therapist, wellness coach, writer, and host of Forbes’ The Failure Factor.

77,POLITICS,"Indian Americans Have Always Faced Racism, But 'Model Minorities' Don't Speak Out","Anuhya Bobba, Contributornarrative writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-murder-of-srinivas-kuchibhotla-beyond-the-minority_us_58ba4a29e4b0fa65b844b373,The model minority stereotype renders Indians abroad to be complacent.,2017-03-04,"<p>Srinivas Kuchibhotla and his wife, Sunayana Dumala.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ba4c191a00001700f41903.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The anti-immigrant, hate-driven rhetoric of the present United States administration is transforming to be deadly for the Indian American community, which has carved a home in the silence that accompanies the model minority stereotype that is befitted upon them.Srinivas Kuchibhotla, a native of Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh and an engineer by profession, had been sipping a glass of whiskey at Austin’s Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas with Alok Madasani, on February 22nd.A white man approached Kuchibhotla and Madasani, yelled racial slurs at each, mistook the men to be Middle Eastern, and subsequently shot at them — as he allegedly exclaimed, “Get out of my country.” The inflicted wounds proved to be fatal for Kuchibhotla, whose last rites were performed on March 1st. Madasani was released from the hospital on February 23rd.The murder has sent a ripple across the world. But a major shift is to be noted in the Indian American community. Or, simply within India, generally.The television is presenting a myriad of Indian faces, who have begun to overtly express the threat to their safety or to the safety of their relatives abroad in the United States. The threat to safety existed for the Indian American community, before the Kuchibhotla incident. The difference exists in the heavily vocalized backlash that has interlaced the events of the past week.According to The Economist, “Three-quarters of the Indian-born population in America today arrived in the last 25 years.” The present Indian population, in the United States, totals to more than 3 million, which can be explained from the nearly 147,000 immigrants that India provides to the country on a yearly basis.The model minority stereotype stems from the “non-threatening nature” of the Indian immigrant — a label bestowed by the white counterpart. The Indian American community is seen as “successful” – a prototype to be followed by fellow minorities. Labels that describe Black or Hispanic immigrants, such as “dangerous,” “unemployed,” or “illegal,” are not applied to the Indian American community or to the larger Asian American community. Instead, they are described as “hardworking,” as 54 percent of Asian Americans in the United States retain a bachelor’s degree.The stereotype is one that is happily occupied by the Indian American community. There are not quick to express dissent over a political action nor a racist, xenophobic sentiment. There are not quick to express dissent to their host country, the United States, which is pitted as the pinnacle of prosperity. Indian Americans abroad retain a privilege, among the existing minorities. That privilege – which is not to be compared to the magnitude of white privilege – is not a safeguard to the racism nor the xenophobia that is faced regularly by the Black or the Hispanic population, as the murder of Srinivas Kuchibhotla proves.Yet, racism and xenophobia have been experienced by the Indian American community, even as they remained silent to appease to the white counterpart. The Sikh Gudwara of Oak Creek, Wisconsin witnessed a deadly shooting in 2012 that killed six people, for example.My estranged father had pulled to the gas station on University Boulevard in Denver, Colorado, on September 11, 2001. He was filling the family Honda Civic with gas, when two white Americans looked at him with great distaste, asking that he “return to where he came from.” He had been mistaken to be Muslim. He reiterated that narrative to me, explaining, “I understood their pain. It is OK that they said that.” I remained quiet.My estranged father voted for Donald Trump. He had also voted for Mitt Romney. He had voted for conservatives with a known legacy of hate speech against immigrants. My estranged father remained a paradox, in my eye. But, he was fulfilling – to the T – what it meant to be a model minority. He was not to be grouped with fellow Black or Hispanic immigrants; he regarded himself as separate. Perceiving himself as above other minority communities, he would then vote for representatives who pass harmful policies against who should be regarded as allies. In fulfilling the role that the white man had structured for him, my father practiced internalized racism. In fulfilling that role, he showed hate not simply for other minorities but also for himself.The hate by the majority community is not to be examined. It is to be quietly expressed, among other members of the Indian community. In the confines of a two-story suburban home.The model minority stereotype renders the Indian American community to be complacent as ally minority communities face discrimination and render that discrimination visible to the public eye. The Indian American community remains silent as ally minority communities are compared to the Asian American community. The Brookings Institution explains, “…holding up one racial or ethnic minority as a ‘model’ can too easily become an implicit criticism of other minorities. ‘If Asians can do it, why can’t you?’ is the thought process lying not far below the surface of some commentaries on race and racism in the U.S.”When the infamous Muslim Ban was enacted or the border wall, in the month of January, noteworthy support had not been extended from the Indian American nor the Indian community to the minorities that were due to be affected. But, as one of their own was brutally slayed, the opposition is clear. People are denying employment opportunities in known conservative states to avoid what occurred in Kansas. The mother of Srinivas Kuchibhotla even asked for her younger son to not return to the United States.President Donald Trump, however, has yet to make a statement condemning the incident. It undeniably demonstrates that the model minority stereotype cannot be seen as a protective mechanism against the fear-driven dialogue of the Trump administration.The model minority stereotype renders Indians abroad to be complacent. To not speak of heavily politicized issues occurring in the United States, to not take a stance. They believe, as a result of their model minority role, that they will be excluded from the violence, the racism, and the xenophobia. The Kuchibhotla incident reiterates that they will not. They cannot be. That their complacency hurts themselves as well as other minority groups that do not see their support.This post originally appeared in Feminism in India."
78,POLITICS,This Stunningly Racist French Novel Is How Steve Bannon Explains The World,Paul Blumenthal and JM Rieger,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-camp-of-the-saints-immigration_us_58b75206e4b0284854b3dc03,"""The Camp of the Saints"" tells a grotesque tale about a migrant invasion to destroy Western civilization.",2017-03-04,"The cover of this English translation of <em>The Camp of the Saints</em> calls it ""a chilling novel about the end of the white world.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b7538d2200001f004ae1cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Stephen Bannon, President Donald Trump’s chief strategist and the driving force behind the administration’s controversial ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, has a favorite metaphor he uses to describe the largest refugee crisis in human history. “It’s been almost a Camp of the Saints-type invasion into Central and then Western and Northern Europe,” he said in October 2015.“The whole thing in Europe is all about immigration,” he said in January 2016. “It’s a global issue today — this kind of global Camp of the Saints.” “It’s not a migration,” he said later that January. “It’s really an invasion. I call it the Camp of the Saints.” “When we first started talking about this a year ago,” he said in April 2016, “we called it the Camp of the Saints. ... I mean, this is Camp of the Saints, isn’t it?”Bannon has agitated for a host of anti-immigrant measures. In his previous role as executive chairman of the right-wing news site Breitbart — which he called a “platform for the alt-right,” the online movement of white nationalists — he made anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim news a focus. But the top Trump aide’s repeated references to The Camp of the Saints, an obscure 1973 novel by French author Jean Raspail, reveal even more about how he understands the world. The book is a cult favorite on the far right, yet it’s never found a wider audience. There’s a good reason for that: It’s breathtakingly racist.“[This book is] racist in the literal sense of the term. It uses race as the main characterization of characters,” said Cécile Alduy, professor of French at Stanford University and an expert on the contemporary French far right. “It describes the takeover of Europe by waves of immigrants that wash ashore like the plague.”The book, she said, “reframes everything as the fight to death between races.”Upon the novel’s release in the United States in 1975, the influential book review magazine Kirkus Reviews pulled no punches: “The publishers are presenting The Camp of the Saints as a major event, and it probably is, in much the same sense that Mein Kampf was a major event.”Linda Chavez, a Republican commentator who has worked for GOP presidents from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush but opposed Trump’s election, also reviewed the book back then. Forty years later, she hasn’t forgotten it.“It is really shockingly racist,” Chavez told The Huffington Post, “and to have the counselor to the president see this as one of his touchstones, I think, says volumes about his attitude.”The plot of The Camp of the Saints follows a poor Indian demagogue, named “the turd-eater” because he literally eats shit, and the deformed, apparently psychic child who sits on his shoulders. Together, they lead an “armada” of 800,000 impoverished Indians sailing to France. Dithering European politicians, bureaucrats and religious leaders, including a liberal pope from Latin America, debate whether to let the ships land and accept the Indians or to do the right thing — in the book’s vision — by recognizing the threat the migrants pose and killing them all. The non-white people of Earth, meanwhile, wait silently for the Indians to reach shore. The landing will be the signal for them to rise up everywhere and overthrow white Western society. The French government eventually gives the order to repel the armada by force, but by then the military has lost the will to fight. Troops battle among themselves as the Indians stream on shore, trampling to death the left-wing radicals who came to welcome them. Poor black and brown people literally overrun Western civilization. Chinese people pour into Russia; the queen of England is forced to marry her son to a Pakistani woman; the mayor of New York must house an African-American family at Gracie Mansion. Raspail’s rogue heroes, the defenders of white Christian supremacy, attempt to defend their civilization with guns blazing but are killed in the process.Calgues, the obvious Raspail stand-in, is one of those taking up arms against the migrants and their culturally “cuckolded” white supporters. Just before killing a radical hippie, Calgues compares his own actions to past heroic, sometimes mythical defenses of European Christendom. He harkens back to famous battles that fit the clash-of-civilizations narrative — the defense of Rhodes against the Ottoman Empire, the fall of Constantinople to the same — and glorifies colonial wars of conquest and the formation of the Ku Klux Klan.Only white Europeans like Calgues are portrayed as truly human in The Camp of the Saints. The Indian armada brings “thousands of wretched creatures” whose very bodies arouse disgust: “Scraggy branches, brown and black … All bare, those fleshless Gandhi-arms.” Poor brown children are spoiled fruit “starting to rot, all wormy inside, or turned so you can’t see the mold.” The ship’s inhabitants are also sexual deviants who turn the voyage into a grotesque orgy. “Everywhere, rivers of sperm,” Raspail writes. “Streaming over bodies, oozing between breasts, and buttocks, and thighs, and lips, and fingers.” The white Christian world is on the brink of destruction, the novel suggests, because these black and brown people are more fertile and more numerous, while the West has lost that necessary belief in its own cultural and racial superiority. As he talks to the hippie he will soon kill, Calgues explains how the youth went so wrong: “That scorn of a people for other races, the knowledge that one’s own is best, the triumphant joy at feeling oneself to be part of humanity’s finest — none of that had ever filled these youngsters’ addled brains.”The Camp of the Saints — which draws its title from Revelation 20:9 — is nothing less than a call to arms for the white Christian West, to revive the spirit of the Crusades and steel itself for bloody conflict against the poor black and brown world without and the traitors within. The novel’s last line links past humiliations tightly to its own grim parable about modern migration. “The Fall of Constantinople,” Raspail’s unnamed narrator says, “is a personal misfortune that happened to all of us only last week.”Raspail wrote The Camp of the Saints in 1972 and 1973, after a stay at his aunt’s house near Cannes on the southern coast of France. Looking out across the Mediterranean, he had an epiphany: “And what if they came?” he thought to himself. “This ‘they’ was not clearly defined at first,” he told the conservative publication Le Point in 2015. “Then I imagined that the Third World would rush into this blessed country that is France.”Raspail’s novel has been published in the U.S. several times, each time with the backing of the anti-immigration movement. The U.S. publishing house Scribner was the first to translate the book into English in 1975, but it failed to reach a wide audience amid withering reviews by critics. A rare favorable take appeared in National Review. “Raspail brings his reader to the surprising conclusion that killing a million or so starving refugees from India would be a supreme act of individual sanity and cultural health,” then-Dartmouth professor Jeffrey Hart wrote in 1975. “Raspail is to genocide what [D.H. Lawrence] was to sex.” Hart added that “a great fuss” was being made over “Raspail’s supposed racism,” but that the “liberal rote anathema on ‘racism’ is in effect a poisonous assault upon Western self-preference.”The book received a second life in 1983 when Cordelia Scaife May, heiress to the Mellon fortune and sister to right-wing benefactor Richard Mellon Scaife, funded its republication and distribution. This time it gained a cult following among immigration opponents.May’s money has also been instrumental in funding the efforts of John Tanton, the godfather of the anti-immigration movement in the U.S. Tanton, who began as an environmentalist and population control proponent, founded a host of groups focused on restricting immigration, including the Federation of American Immigration Reform, the Center for Immigration Studies, NumbersUSA and U.S. English. May’s fortune has fueled these groups with tens of millions of dollars in contributions over the years.Linda Chavez was recruited in 1987 to head U.S. English, which advocates for English to be designated the country’s official language. But then a series of disturbing stories painted Tanton’s motives in a racial light. Among other issues, Chavez said she learned that his funding came from the pro-eugenics Pioneer Fund and from May, who Chavez knew had helped publish The Camp of the Saints. Chavez recalled seeing Tanton’s staffers carrying the book around their offices. She quit the group.Tanton, who insists his opposition to immigration is not connected to race at all, told The Washington Post in 2006 that his mind “became focused” on the issue after reading The Camp of the Saints. In 1995, his small publishing house, Social Contract Press, brought the book back into print for a third time in the U.S., again with funding from May. Historians Paul Kennedy and Matt Connelly tied the book to then-current concerns about global demographic trends in a cover story for The Atlantic.“Over the years the American public has absorbed a great number of books, articles, poems and films which exalt the immigrant experience,” Tanton wrote in 1994. “It is easy for the feelings evoked by Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty to obscure the fact that we are currently receiving too many immigrants (and receiving them too fast) for the health of our environment and of our common culture. Raspail evokes different feelings and that may help to pave the way for policy changes.”In 2001, the book was republished one more time, again by Tanton, and again gained a cult following among opponents of immigration like the border-patrolling Minutemen and eventually the online “alt-right.”Bannon’s alt-right-loving Breitbart has run multiple articles over the past three years referencing the novel. When Pope Francis told a joint session of Congress that the U.S. should open its arms to refugees in September 2015, Breitbart’s Julia Hahn, now an aide to Bannon in the White House, compared his admonition to Raspail’s liberal Latin American pontiff. And the novel’s thesis that migration is invasion in disguise is often reflected in Bannon’s public comments.The refugee crisis “didn’t just happen by happenstance,” Bannon said in an April 2016 radio interview with Sebastian Gorka, who now works for the National Security Council. “These are not war refugees. It’s something much more insidious going on.”Bannon has also echoed the novel’s theory that secular liberals who favor immigration and diversity weaken the West.“Do you believe the elites in this country have the backbone, have the belief in the underlying principles of the Judeo-Christian West to actually win this war?” he asked Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), now the attorney general, in June 2016. “I’m worried about that. … They’re eroding, regularly it seems to me, classical American values that are so critical to our success,” Sessions replied.Like Raspail, Bannon has reveled in the past victories of Christendom over Islamic forces.“If you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing,” he said in a 2014 speech broadcast to a conference at the Vatican. “I think they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna [the Battle of Vienna in 1683], or Tours [the Battle of Tours in 732], or other places. … They were able to stave this off, and they were able to defeat it, and they were able to bequeath to us a church and a civilization that really is the flower of mankind.”Now Bannon sits at the right hand of the U.S. president, working to beat back what Bannon calls “this Muslim invasion.” And Trump is all in on the project. During the campaign, he called for a ban on all Muslims entering the country. His Jan. 28 executive order, since blocked in the courts, turned this campaign idea into executive policy.Trump has continued to defend the executive order as a life-or-death national security issue. “We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America,” he said in his first speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.Five days earlier, Trump had called his immigration enforcement efforts a “military operation.”Although Department of Homeland Security officials walked back that statement, the president’s conflation of immigration with warfare did not go unnoticed.“They see this as a war,” Chavez said.Chavez, who supports some of Trump’s economic policy proposals, called the direction the White House is taking on immigration and race “extremely dangerous.” She said Trump’s immigration moves are “a kind of purging of America of anything but our Northern European roots.” Bannon, she added, “wants to make America white again.”"

Kennedy International Airport on Jan. 28, 2017, in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b755052700001f007d77b3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Stephen Bannon, President Donald Trump’s chief strategist and the driving force behind the administration’s controversial ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, has a favorite metaphor he uses to describe the largest refugee crisis in human history. “It’s been almost a Camp of the Saints-type invasion into Central and then Western and Northern Europe,” he said in October 2015.“The whole thing in Europe is all about immigration,” he said in January 2016. “It’s a global issue today — this kind of global Camp of the Saints.” “It’s not a migration,” he said later that January. “It’s really an invasion. I call it the Camp of the Saints.” “When we first started talking about this a year ago,” he said in April 2016, “we called it the Camp of the Saints. ... I mean, this is Camp of the Saints, isn’t it?”Bannon has agitated for a host of anti-immigrant measures. In his previous role as executive chairman of the right-wing news site Breitbart — which he called a “platform for the alt-right,” the online movement of white nationalists — he made anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim news a focus. But the top Trump aide’s repeated references to The Camp of the Saints, an obscure 1973 novel by French author Jean Raspail, reveal even more about how he understands the world. The book is a cult favorite on the far right, yet it’s never found a wider audience. There’s a good reason for that: It’s breathtakingly racist.“[This book is] racist in the literal sense of the term. It uses race as the main characterization of characters,” said Cécile Alduy, professor of French at Stanford University and an expert on the contemporary French far right. “It describes the takeover of Europe by waves of immigrants that wash ashore like the plague.”The book, she said, “reframes everything as the fight to death between races.”Upon the novel’s release in the United States in 1975, the influential book review magazine Kirkus Reviews pulled no punches: “The publishers are presenting The Camp of the Saints as a major event, and it probably is, in much the same sense that Mein Kampf was a major event.”Linda Chavez, a Republican commentator who has worked for GOP presidents from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush but opposed Trump’s election, also reviewed the book back then. Forty years later, she hasn’t forgotten it.“It is really shockingly racist,” Chavez told The Huffington Post, “and to have the counselor to the president see this as one of his touchstones, I think, says volumes about his attitude.”The plot of The Camp of the Saints follows a poor Indian demagogue, named “the turd-eater” because he literally eats shit, and the deformed, apparently psychic child who sits on his shoulders. Together, they lead an “armada” of 800,000 impoverished Indians sailing to France. Dithering European politicians, bureaucrats and religious leaders, including a liberal pope from Latin America, debate whether to let the ships land and accept the Indians or to do the right thing — in the book’s vision — by recognizing the threat the migrants pose and killing them all. The non-white people of Earth, meanwhile, wait silently for the Indians to reach shore. The landing will be the signal for them to rise up everywhere and overthrow white Western society. The French government eventually gives the order to repel the armada by force, but by then the military has lost the will to fight. Troops battle among themselves as the Indians stream on shore, trampling to death the left-wing radicals who came to welcome them. Poor black and brown people literally overrun Western civilization. Chinese people pour into Russia; the queen of England is forced to marry her son to a Pakistani woman; the mayor of New York must house an African-American family at Gracie Mansion. Raspail’s rogue heroes, the defenders of white Christian supremacy, attempt to defend their civilization with guns blazing but are killed in the process.Calgues, the obvious Raspail stand-in, is one of those taking up arms against the migrants and their culturally “cuckolded” white supporters. Just before killing a radical hippie, Calgues compares his own actions to past heroic, sometimes mythical defenses of European Christendom. He harkens back to famous battles that fit the clash-of-civilizations narrative — the defense of Rhodes against the Ottoman Empire, the fall of Constantinople to the same — and glorifies colonial wars of conquest and the formation of the Ku Klux Klan.Only white Europeans like Calgues are portrayed as truly human in The Camp of the Saints. The Indian armada brings “thousands of wretched creatures” whose very bodies arouse disgust: “Scraggy branches, brown and black … All bare, those fleshless Gandhi-arms.” Poor brown children are spoiled fruit “starting to rot, all wormy inside, or turned so you can’t see the mold.” The ship’s inhabitants are also sexual deviants who turn the voyage into a grotesque orgy. “Everywhere, rivers of sperm,” Raspail writes. “Streaming over bodies, oozing between breasts, and buttocks, and thighs, and lips, and fingers.” The white Christian world is on the brink of destruction, the novel suggests, because these black and brown people are more fertile and more numerous, while the West has lost that necessary belief in its own cultural and racial superiority. As he talks to the hippie he will soon kill, Calgues explains how the youth went so wrong: “That scorn of a people for other races, the knowledge that one’s own is best, the triumphant joy at feeling oneself to be part of humanity’s finest — none of that had ever filled these youngsters’ addled brains.”The Camp of the Saints — which draws its title from Revelation 20:9 — is nothing less than a call to arms for the white Christian West, to revive the spirit of the Crusades and steel itself for bloody conflict against the poor black and brown world without and the traitors within. The novel’s last line links past humiliations tightly to its own grim parable about modern migration. “The Fall of Constantinople,” Raspail’s unnamed narrator says, “is a personal misfortune that happened to all of us only last week.”Raspail wrote The Camp of the Saints in 1972 and 1973, after a stay at his aunt’s house near Cannes on the southern coast of France.

Wilson said he initially had “high hopes,” mainly regarding funding, about meeting with the White House, especially since Trump vowed to do more for HBCUs than previous presidents during Monday’s meeting. The executive order Trump signed on Tuesday moved the HBCU initiative from under the Department of Education to the White House, which HBCUs have advocated for in expectation of having a more direct line to the president. The executive order did not, however, ensure the funding that many HBCUs desperately need; several of them are in danger of closing.Wilson, who says he was expecting at least $500 million to be allocated to the schools, said it’s impossible to know if and when the order will have an impact.(Former President Barack Obama provided more than $4 billion for black schools in his time in office.)Wilson also noted his disappointment with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos calling HBCUs an example of “school choice.”“HBCUs were not created because the 4 million newly freed blacks were unhappy with the choices they had. They were created because they had no choices at all,” he said. “[I]f one does not understand the crippling and extended horrors of slavery, then how can one really understand the subsequent history and struggle of African Americans, or the current necessities and imperatives that grow out of that history and struggle?”Wilson said despite DeVos’ comments, he believes she does want to help black colleges. But overall, Wilson said his two days of meetings at the White House weren’t promising.“In general, the meetings were a troubling beginning to what must be a productive relationship,” he said. “Trust that the HBCU community will continue to press for the kind of funding that educational excellence and national competitiveness require!”Wilson’s sentiments echo those of Dillard University’s president, Walter M. Kimbrough. In a blog posted Monday, Kimbrough said that many of the college presidents went unheard after the group made an impromptu visit to meet Trump in the Oval Office. “But needless to say that threw the day off and there was very little listening to HBCU presidents today- we were only given about 2 minutes each, and that was cut to one minute, so only about 7 of maybe 15 or so speakers were given an opportunity today,” Kimbrough explained. Because he didn’t get the opportunity to address his points while at the White House, he posted them on Medium. H/T The Root"
