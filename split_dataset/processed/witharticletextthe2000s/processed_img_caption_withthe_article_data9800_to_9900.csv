After covering the Primetime Emmy Awards for a decade-and-a-half, the out comedian giddily walked the red carpet Sept. 17 for the very first time with RuPaul’s Drag Race. “I turned to RuPaul at one point and said, ‘I feel like when the misfits get to sit at the popular kids’ table for a day,’” Mathews shared on Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl.“And we are. That’s why [Drag Race] resonates with people,” continued Mathews. “We are the misfits who are pulling this off, ‘The Little Show That Could.’”Mathews spoke to Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast on Monday, just hours after attending the 69th-Annual Primetime Emmy Awards. When he arrived that evening with fellow Drag Race stars RuPaul Charles, Michelle Visage and Carson Kressley, the show had already snatched three of eight trophies for which it was nominated. At the previous weekend’s Creative Arts Emmys, Drag Race took statues for “Best Costumes” and “Best Picture Editing” in the reality TV category. Of course, RuPaul collected a second consecutive win for “Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program.”For Mathews, who has covered The Emmy Awards since his days as “Ross The Intern” on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, being an actual guest for TV’s biggest night was undoubtedly a dream come true. However, it’s clear his role on the show which got him there is no less so.“I, like everyone who’s sane in the world, was a fan,” said Mathews of Drag Race. “I’d watch at home and talk at the TV.”The Celebrity Fit Club and Chelsea Lately star did not hesitate when invited to be a guest judge on Season 6 of the popular reality competition. He was shocked the following year, he said, to join RuPaul, Michelle Visage and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy alum Carson Kressley on the panel full-time.“It’s one of those things where you look behind you like, ‘Are you talking to me?’” he said in typically self-effacing fashion. “I don’t know why they chose me, but I said ‘yes’ before he could finish the sentence.”The Season 9 jump from LOGO TV to VH1 made for Drag Race’s biggest year ever. Its surge in popularity, evidenced by eight Emmy nods, also expands the show’s ability to raise awareness of queer culture – whether that is the intent of the program or not. “I don’t think you’re ever going to see a history lesson — a Drag 101 — on the show,” Mathews asserted. He went on to say education is merely a byproduct of “the pressure to be a colorful, good show.” People are enlightened to the LGBTQ community by “taking something that is niche” (drag) “mainstream,” Mathews said, and “telling gay stories, meeting gay people and really having them expose themselves in a beautiful way.” “You’re meeting people at their most vulnerable, trying to be the best at what they do, so it becomes very human,” he pointed out. “I think that is what is educating people -- really showing humanity, the common core that unites everybody.”Another result, Mathews acknowledged, is the increased reverence afforded the art form it showcases. Widespread love for the show’s stars has boosted acknowledgement of drag entertainers universally -- both by the queer community and beyond.“Drag queens have always been on the front lines in our community, going back to Stonewall and before,” Mathews stated. “We’ve always respected them within our community,” he concluded, “Now people outside the L, the G, the B, the T, the Q, the I, the A, they’re getting it because of the show.”LISTEN: Ross Mathews, Oscar nominee Elisabeth Shue and ‘80s Pro Wrestling Icon “Babydoll” Nickla Roberts Join Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl."

2,ENTERTAINMENT,"Brie Larson Directed Her First Movie. Next Stop? A Marvel Joint, She Hopes.",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brie-larson-unicorn-store_us_59c16d38e4b087fdf508b829,"""Unicorn Store"" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival.",2017-09-20,"Brie Larson in her directorial debut, ""Unicorn Store.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c195f01900003a00564a76.jpeg?cache=2zrycthwLy&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Brie Larson’s directorial debut, “Unicorn Store,” is a replica of your teenage mood board: It has glitter, splashes of pink, annoying parents, vibrant ribbons and, of course, a shiny white mythological beast. Larson always wanted a unicorn. It was her childhood wish, which helps to explain her attraction to this movie. She first auditioned for “Unicorn Store” five years ago, before “Short Term 12″ provided her breakout flash and long before “Room” made her an Oscar winner. Rebel Wilson got the role instead. But, in typical Hollywood fashion, the project fell apart ― until about two years ago, when producers approached Larson with an offer to direct it herself. Now, Larson wants to embrace the anything-is-possible phase of her career.After spending a year shaping Samantha McIntyre’s script using inspiration from Joseph Campbell’s theories about the archetypal hero’s journey, Larson cast herself in the lead role. (She initially wanted to find an unknown actress.) Larson plays Kit, an emotionally stunted 20-something with splintered dreams of becoming an accomplished artist. “You guys still like me, right?” Kit asks the teddy bears in her childhood bedroom.After moving back in with her parents (Joan Cusack and Bradley Whitford), Kit finds a dull desk job at a marketing agency. It’s there that she receives a mysterious envelope containing an invitation to something called The Store, where a pink-suited Samuel L. Jackson offers Kit the chance to own her very own unicorn. “The main thing was thinking about the metaphor of the unicorn and allowing the story to read as many different interpretations,” Larson told HuffPost last week at the Toronto Film Festival, where “Unicorn Store” premiered. “So, what is the unicorn? Is it your ultimate dream? Is it connecting to your childhood self? Is it almost spiritual? Because the unicorn does have almost a religious connotation to it. It’s the third eye and a vortex, and pure light is the color of the rainbow.”As Kit gets closer and closer to that unicorn ― Jackson’s industrial genie has a lot of prerequisites before it can be hers ― her borderline pervy boss (Hamish Linklater) takes a liking to her. She is given a chance to pitch an ad campaign for a vacuum cleaner. Finally, an avenue to artistic glory! During her noisy presentation, Kit splashes the boardroom with glitter and, in a supervisor’s words, “rainbow-magicalness.” It is, simply, a lot ― which is something else Larson relates to.“It was somewhat metaphorically autobiographical because when I was coming up I would scare people at auditions because I would be too intense,” she said. “I’d be too much and push things too hard. I was so interested in doing things real that it was a lot. I look back on it and I think it’s kind of like a superhero origin story. You have the powers, but you might accidentally hurt someone. You can’t quite form your fireball right, and everything blows up in your face. When I look back on it, it was like that — I had something, but it wasn’t refined. It was much more animalistic. I think that was hard for me. It was a very painful thing to come to terms with: ‘Oh, I’m too much for people. I have so much I want to give to this, but it’s too much.’”Now that Larson has calmed down enough to become an A-list actress-turned-director ― she’s also helmed a couple of short films ― it’s only up from here. She’s embracing a superhero origin story of her own, playing the title role in 2019′s “Captain Marvel.”How about directing one of those little comic-book ditties next?“Oh yeah, that’s my plan,” she said. “Why not? My new life philosophy is I’m not going to tell myself no. I’m just going to do stuff until someone else tells me no.”"

LOUIS ― Chris Sommers was pissed. The owner of Pi Pizzeria had been handing out cups of water at one of his restaurants in the city’s Central West End on Friday night, hours after a judge declared a former St. Louis cop not guilty in the 2011 killing of a black man fleeing a drug stop. Sommers wanted to calm the protesting crowd, to put a human face on his business, maybe to keep someone from smashing his windows. When it looked like the protests had mainly passed, Sommers prepared to head home. But as he got in the car, he saw police officers with gas masks and shields marching down an empty street toward his business. He ran back to the restaurant. One of the officers, he said, began “indiscriminately” shooting off pepper balls, a less lethal form of crowd control that hits with a sting and explodes with a burn.Sommers started filming. He got mad. He yelled. He lost his shit, in his words. Police tossed a tear gas canister at him. Someone nearby picked it up and threw it back. The cops came running. Sommers barely managed to close the door to his restaurant in time to keep them out. Tear gas seeped inside, and he sent everyone home.“You generally want to be friendly with the police,” Sommers told HuffPost in an interview around lunchtime on Wednesday. “And then they shoot at you.”Sommers isn’t the kind of guy you’d expect to get into a conflict with the police. He has St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson’s cell number. He gives police a 50 percent discount. He has donated to law enforcement groups. He considered himself a police supporter, even though, he said, St. Louis cops never seemed to solve any of the crimes occasionally committed against his restaurants.But Sommers’ accusations of police misconduct during the weekend protests kicked off a chain of events that led to employees fielding harassing phone call after harassing phone call at his restaurants on Wednesday. On Twitter, he’d used the term “dimwits” to describe officers who chanted “Whose streets? Our streets” on Sunday night after they arrested people downtown, in a sweep that led to peaceful demonstrators and a couple of journalists spending up to 24 hours in jail. Blue Lives Matter, a right-leaning retort to the Black Lives Matter movement that has grown on Facebook and morphed into a pro-police news site, didn’t like what Sommers had said. Someone wrote up a critical post on Tuesday. The St. Louis County Police Association posted that story on Facebook, along with phone numbers for Pi Pizzeria’s various locations, and urged supporters to call the restaurant if their “freedom of speech needs a little exercise.” (The police association appears to have since deleted the Facebook post.) Sommers then laid out his story in a lengthy Facebook post that was republished by Riverfront Times, The harassment began.On Wednesday, the phones were still ringing almost constantly. One caller used an anti-gay slur. At another location, someone tried to place a fake order totaling more than $600. Callers said “Blue Lives Matter.” Someone apparently spread a rumor among protesters claiming that Pi was handing out free pizza.The online reaction has been vicious. People labeled Sommers a “lib-tard.” New one-star reviews have claimed that there were roaches at Pi Pizzeria. That there was bondage equipment inside. That the pizza sucked. People wrote that they hope the windows get smashed, that the business fails. The online reaction, Sommers said, “just goes to the character of these guys that think that cops are infallible.” Sommers said he did think a lot of the officers were “dimwitted” based on the decisions they made during these latest protests. “Who thought that was a good idea?” he said of their tactics. “Who’s standing up to it? That’s the problem, that this isn’t a few bad eggs. Who’s standing up to this behavior? Are they stressed? Yeah. Are they tired? Yeah. So am I. I’m out here trying to protect my business, protect my team, and they start terrorizing us.”His criticism was focused on actions he personally witnessed on Friday, Sommers said, although he has broader concerns about policing in general. His actions supporting police should “speak louder than my opinions of what they did this weekend,” he said.“What I think is important is that we stop talking about Chris and pizza, and start talking about why everyone is so upset,” Sommers said. “What people are supporting us about is what they too know, what we experience every year with corruption and racism. Different value of life in the city is real.”Sommers considers himself a peacemaker. He said he’s long been supportive of both police officers and activists. “But that doesn’t matter anymore to people who want to sell a story around a narrative,” he said.“When [conservative commentator] Dana Loesch tweets about me this morning, you know you’re kind of on the right side of justice and history when she’s condemning you, right?” Sommers said. “If I’m pissing her off, I’m probably doing the right thing.”Sommers said he worries about the harassment campaign against his business, which could have consequences well beyond the inconvenience of a broken window. But so far he’s been encouraged by the backing of his customers. The Central West End location was more packed than usual for Wednesday lunch, with people stopping by to lend support.The restaurant owner isn’t done. He expects to testify in federal court in connection with legal action bought by the American Civil Liberties Union over the cops’ behavior.“Did I run my mouth? Yes, certainly, after I got assaulted. Do I regret some things? I regret the impact on my employees and my wife. But I know what I said is true, and there are a lot of dimwitted people in the police department, because this stuff is happening everywhere,” Sommers said. “It’s not a few bad eggs. It’s happening everywhere, and what we need is more good eggs who stand up, for police officers to come out and acknowledge what’s going on.”"

On Tuesday night’s broadcast of “The Late Show,” Colbert told Clinton how those plans changed in a hurry when it became clear that Donald Trump would win. “The audience that night was, honest to God, like on the edge of tears in this room,” he said. “It was like we were all at a funeral.”But since Colbert still had the old, unused jokes from that special, he handed them to Clinton. He even shared one on the air ― although it had to be slightly censored ― and it prompted a priceless reaction from the former secretary of state. Check it out above. "

Syria, its infrastructure in shambles after six years of civil war, also did not sign. But three months after President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the agreement, Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega said he will sign onto the accord in a show of support for countries suffering from disasters caused by climate change. “We have to be in solidarity with this large number of countries that are the first victims, who are already the victims and are the ones who will continue to suffer the impact of these disasters,” he said Monday, according to the Nicaraguan newspaper El Nuevo Diario.“We will soon adhere, we will sign the Paris Agreement,” he added. “We have already had meetings addressing the issue and we have already programmed the adhesion of Nicaragua and the signing of the country agreement.”Following months of reality TV-style suspense, Trump proclaimed that the U.S. would pull out of the non-binding accord at a televised press conference in June. In his speech, he described the deal as if it were a trade agreement, infuriating critics who said his decision demonstrated a severe misunderstanding of the 195-country pact, forged in December 2015. He suggested the deal was designed to redistribute wealth from the U.S. ― which has paid just one-third of the $3 billion it pledged to help poorer countries adapt to climate change ― to other nations.Ortega’s announcement this week ramps up pressure on the White House to reverse Trump’s decision. The president’s refusal to accept the basic science behind climate change drew renewed criticism this month after back-to-back hurricanes ― which scientists say were made worse by warming oceans ― wreaked havoc across Texas, Florida and U.S. territories in the Caribbean. The process of withdrawing from the accord cannot begin for another few years, and won’t be complete until November 2020. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that U.S. officials were considering avenues to stay in the agreement, though White House officials denied the report.“This is continuing evidence that the U.S. is isolating itself,” Andrew Light, a climate policy expert at the World Resources Institute, told HuffPost by phone on Wednesday. He noted that Nicaragua rejected the deal because it went too easy on countries like the U.S., whose national wealth was built on top of being the world’s largest historic emitter of greenhouse gas emissions.“If they’re coming around to this,” Light said of the Nicaraguan government, “it’s just more evidence that the U.S. position is out of touch with reality.” "

This kind of reporting sheds light on the extent and complexity of our president’s corruption and avarice. Moreover, given the ties between Trump’s 2016 campaign and the Kremlin, Trump’s business activities in Russia or any of its neighbors should be scrutinized.Those seeking to shed light on Trump’s businesses practices should, however, be careful to avoid collateral damage of the kind that made its way into a New Yorker article that explored the topic of corruption in the Trump real estate business. In that piece, which ran on August 25, the author, Adam Davidson, portrayed the President’s connections to shady developers, bankers and foreign governments, but in his major case study didn’t tell the whole story. Davidson cited a stalled Trump project, more accurately licensing agreement, in Batumi, a resort town on Georgia’s Black Sea coast as an illustrative example of Trump’s business practices and erstwhile partners, but his description of the economic and political climate in Batumi overlooked some important points.If you want to open a window to explore whether there is a global network of corruption that surrounds Trump’s businesses, Davidson’s piece may be helpful, but if you are looking for an understanding of what has occurred in Batumi over the last decade or so, despite Trump’s misadventures there, the piece is considerably less useful. For many readers of The New Yorker the characterization of Batumi as a run-down post-Soviet beach town where nobody would want to invest, as suggested in the article, conjures up images of rusted Soviet ships, dilapidated Intourist hotels, restaurants serving slop and the like.Batumi today is nothing like that. Moreover, Georgia’s president at the time of Trump’s investment in Batumi, Mikheil Saakashvili, who was in the midst of a difficult election year, undoubtedly sought to leverage Trump’s visit to Georgia for political gain, but the notion that building luxury apartments in Batumi in 2012 was prima facie absurd or evidence of ethical misdoings is wrong. Davidson rightly points out that there were no luxury apartments of the kind in Batumi in 2012, but that does not mean it was an unreasonable speculative investment at the time. Indeed by 2012, Batumi was in the midst of a renaissance that has made it one of the most desirable Black Sea vacation spots, not just for Georgians, but for Russians, Ukrainians, Armenians, Israelis, Turks, Iranians and others as well.I first visited Batumi in 2003 when there were no international hotels, almost no foreign tourists, very little international development and a deeply corrupt local government, and have returned many times since. Every time I go, I find a more vibrant tourist town, with more beachgoers, restaurants and things to do in the evening. An afternoon on the pebbly beaches of the Black Sea or poolside at one of the many nice hotels there, followed by an evening of shopping in the old city and dinner at a great Georgian restaurant sharing a bottle of Mukhuzani (a famous Georgian wine variety) with some friends, is a great way to spend a summer day.Because Batumi is such a desirable vacation spot, there has been a great deal of foreign investment there in recent years. That investment occurred because Georgia has become, over the last 10-15 years, a good place to do business, particularly relative to the its neighbors. Rule of law is now much stronger there than other countries in the region; foreign investment has flowed into the country over this period; and most importantly from the investors perspective, there is money to be made in Georgia. The ill-fated Trump project in Batumi was a failure, and another example of his ethically repugnant conduct, but was surrounded by numerous other successful projects including luxury apartments and the construction of several international brand name four and five star hotels. The transformation of that city is a success story for which the current and previous Georgian government can both claim some credit.It is also unfortunate that the Trump Batumi project that was described in The New Yorker may become one of the few things that readers of that venerable and very high quality periodical now know about Georgia. Although, as the article noted, high level corruption remained a problem even as rates of low level corruption plummeted under President Saakashvili, Georgia today is considerably less corrupt than Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan or many other countries in the region.Most of the bankers and businesspeople discussed in the article were indeed Georgian and also Kazakh, but the Georgian government who sought to accelerate the deal, not least for their own political advantage in an election year, is no longer in power. Despite this project being stalled, others in Batumi and, for that matter, throughout Georgia are moving forward or have been completed in the five years since the Trump-Saakashvili in summit. Batumi remains an appealing and fun, if exotic and distant, vacation spot as well as a good place to invest, regardless of what Donald Trump did or did not do in that town."
8,POLITICS,Joe Biden Jumps In To Help Democrats Win Alabama Senate Seat,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-doug-jones-alabama-senate_us_59c2db6ce4b063b25317b501,"He'll be campaigning for Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate in the special election.",2017-09-20,Former Vice President Joe Biden will campaign for Doug Jones next month,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c2e2cc1c0000240079f865.jpeg?ops=crop_3_89_455_270%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Vice President Joe Biden will be in Alabama next month campaigning for Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate running in the state’s special Senate election. “I have seen Doug Jones’ dedication to civil rights and social justice,” Biden said in a statement released by the Jones campaign. “From his time as U.S. Attorney prosecuting the 16th Street Baptist Church bombers to his private life as an advocate for social justice and economic empowerment, Doug Jones is a proven leader in which we can place our trust.”President Bill Clinton named Jones the U.S. attorney in Birmingham in 1997. There, he led the successful prosecution of two of the Ku Klux Klan members responsible for bombing the 16th Street Baptist Church on Sept. 15, 1963. The heinous act killed four African-American girls during church services. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. called the bombing “one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity.” Given that Alabama is a solidly red state, Jones is considered a long shot for the seat currently held by Republican Sen. Luther Strange. The state’s governor appointed Strange to the seat when Jeff Sessions resigned to became President Donald Trump’s attorney general. On Tuesday, Republican voters will go to the polls in a runoff primary election to choose between Strange and Roy Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court who was twice removed from that position for flouting the law and is famous for telling state judges to ignore federal rulings in favor of same-sex marriage.Democrats haven’t won a U.S. Senate election in Alabama since 1992, when Richard Shelby was elected to a second term. Two years later, Shelby switched to the Republican Party.So far, national Democrats have largely stayed away from the current race, both because it’s considered a tough seat to flip and because Jones might not benefit from too much big party support. But Biden’s involvement may give the race more visibility and encourage others to come out. Jones said in a statement Wednesday that he has known the former vice president for nearly 40 years. The general election is set for Dec. 12. On Tuesday, Jones wrote an oped on HuffPost warning that he has seen history repeat itself in the years since he went after the KKK. “Sadly, the pattern of violence as a response to hope has reasserted itself,” he wrote. “We saw it in the Charleston church massacre in 2015. We saw it on display in Charlottesville this past August. We’ve seen it in the attacks on mosques and synagogues, and against the LGBT community. We see it in the hostility toward the Latino community. We cannot sweep this violence under the rug. We must address the forces that lead to it and prosecute those who perpetrate such acts.”Want more updates from Amanda Terkel? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth, here."

Penney and Aria are both Kenyan citizens, although Aria’s father is a U.S. citizen. Although a few boats and airplanes are rescuing people and bringing them to St. Thomas and Puerto Rico, they refuse to allow Penney and Aria on to the vessels because they are Kenyan citizens and do not have U.S. visas.Whatever one thinks of our immigration restrictions, surely there should be an emergency exception made for people standing directly in harm’s way. This episode recalls another incident in the Caribbean in 1939 when hundreds of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany on the St. Louis were refused landing in Cuba, and then also refused entry by the U.S. Almost all of the passengers were returned to Europe, and more than 250 of them died during the war.Tortola was ravaged by Hurricane Irma, leaving people trying to survive without power or water and with limited relief supplies. Sewage is running in the streets, prisoners have escaped from jail and rapes and looting are skyrocketing. Hurricane Maria is now headed directly for the British Virgin Islands, thus cutting off Penney and her daughter’s only escape plan given their visa status as residents on Tortola.Our immigration system is a distinctly human-made disaster, but natural disasters like hurricanes reveal the ugly face of our immigration policies. The U.S. government could extend a hand to Penney, Aria and thousands like them who are facing devastation in the Caribbean.Given President Trump’s “America First” stance, this outcome is unlikely. But just as in 1939, the U.S. will be judged not so much by what it does, but by what it chooses not to do in the midst of a humanitarian crisis."

There were 31 deaths, and, by one estimate, 200 landslides. The main airport was severely damaged.The most long-lasting effect on Dominica’s 72,000 people was the estimated economic losses of US$ 500 million, roughly equivalent to its entire GDP for one year.Tropical Storm Erika had wind speeds of 85 kilometres per hour and did not directly hit the island. By contrast, Hurricane Maria swept across it on Monday evening full of fury with wind speeds of 265 kilometres per hour and much rain.Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, who had to be rescued by police from his flooded and roofless home on Tuesday, fears the worse now in terms of injury and possible loss of life.Following what he vividly described as “an avalanche of torn-away roofs,” the economic cost of recovery and building back better would be ruinous without international assistance.This is the reality facing many communities living in exposed Small Island Developing States (SIDS) from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean.The forced abandonment of Barbuda in the Caribbean following Hurricane Irma, after 300 years of continuous human occupation, is a cruel reminder of the vulnerability of these low-lying outposts of civilisation.Development can never be sustainable if it is at continual risk of being destroyed by disasters.Since 1980, the economic loss risk due to floods has increased by over 160% and to tropical cyclones by 265%. For many countries, the risk of losing wealth in weather-related disasters is growing faster than GDP per capita.Given their small size, the expected annual average losses from tropical cyclone wind damage in SIDS represents a fraction of the global total but in the case of a catastrophic one-in-250 year event, six of the top ten countries that would suffer the highest percentage losses of GDP are SIDS.This seems to be borne out by events so far in this year’s Atlantic Hurricane season which has been marked by a series of catastrophically strong storm systems.The losses and impacts that characterise disasters usually have as much to do with the exposure and vulnerability of capital stock as with the severity of the hazard event.The question is how can we make SIDS more resilient and reduce the numbers of people affected by disasters if the risk continues to be ratcheted up by the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the world’s weather.SIDS are more vulnerable to disasters because many are heavily indebted, their economies are undiversified and hazard events often affect the whole territory.The magnifying effect of climate change include sea level rise and associated flood and storm surge hazard, increasing cyclone wind intensity such as many Caribbean islands have already experienced this month, flood and storm surge hazard, erosion, saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers, water scarcity and drought.In the face of climate change, to which these islands contribute negligibly, the resilience gap is only going to grow unless there is investment which reduces the existing stock of risk, and strong policies are in place to ensure that new risk is not created through poorly informed or under-resourced investments in areas like tourism, education, health facilities, transport links and public utilities.Low resilience and high risk mean that investments in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation are likely to reap significant benefits for SIDS. Once this Atlantic hurricane season ends, there must be a reflection on how best to take the resilience agenda forward to the benefit of the people of these island states.*Robert Glasser is the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction and the head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR)"

Ralph Northam has spent his entire life serving his country and the commonwealth of Virginia, while Ed Gillespie spent over 30 years of his career fighting for wealthy special interests ― including corporations that laid off thousands of Virginians,” Christina Freundlich, the Northam campaign’s deputy communications director, said in a statement. “Virginians shouldn’t have to question whether or not their governor is going to fight for their jobs, or fight for the wellbeing of corporate clients that lined Gillespie’s pockets with cash.”The Gillespie campaign did not immediately respond to a request for a response to the accusation.Gillespie has a long history of advising the three corporations in the past decade and a half, a tenure punctuated by a brief stint in the White House of then-President George W. Bush and two political campaigns.Virginia law does not require candidates for statewide office to disclose the name of every company operating in the state that they have retained as a client. But Gillespie’s campaign revealed that Gillespie’s firm, Ed Gillespie Strategies, advised Bank of America, Anthem and AT&T in 2016, as well as Microsoft.In the 2014 financial disclosure for Gillespie’s failed Senate bid, he also listed Bank of America and AT&T as clients of his firm in the preceding two years.And prior to joining the Bush White House as a counselor to the president in 2007, Gillespie was at the helm of QGA Public Affairs, the bipartisan lobbying and consulting powerhouse that he co-founded. The firm’s many clients included Bank of America, AT&T and Anthem.Bank of America paid QGA at least $780,000 in lobbying fees from 2005 until Gillespie’s 2007 departure for the White House, and retained Gillespie’s consulting services again in 2013 as it sought to fend off a potential effort to break up the big banks.Meanwhile, shortly after Gillespie left QGA to join the Bush White House, the bank began laying off workers in Virginia, continuing to do so until 2015. Bank of America laid off 136 workers in the Richmond-area location in December 2007, and another 135 workers in August 2010 in the same region. The firm laid off hundreds more workers in subsequent years, including over 100 employees in Henrico County and Norfolk in early 2014, and more than 200 workers from a single Norfolk location in March 2015.Gillespie’s relationships with Anthem and AT&T follow a similar pattern. His work for both companies either coincides with or follows significant layoffs.Anthem announced an unspecified number of layoffs in April 2015, while AT&T laid off 62 employees at a relay center in Norton, Virginia, in August 2015.It is not clear whether Gillespie was advising either company at the time of the layoffs or merely began his work with them in 2016. But Gillespie’s relationship with AT&T goes back more than a decade. Under Gillespie’s leadership, QGA received $540,000 in lobbying fees from the telecommunications giant in 2006 and the first half of 2007.The nature of Gillespie’s consulting work for Anthem and AT&T also has the potential to prove controversial on the campaign trail. His services for the two companies involved counseling them on potential mergers, according to Gillespie’s campaign.Health insurer Anthem tried to merge with its large competitor Cigna, but a federal judge blocked it in February 2017 on the grounds that it would harm consumers. For its part, AT&T is currently seeking to merge with Time Warner, and the Trump administration’s Department of Justice is close to completing a review that would allow it to proceed.Mergers of large firms often lead to industry consolidation that limits competition and hurts consumers, critics say. The four largest health insurance companies controlled 83 percent of the market in 2014, up from 74 percent in 2006, according to the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund.The mergers would also likely have resulted in additional layoffs at Anthem and AT&T. By creating redundancies in personnel, mergers typically result in layoffs. After Verizon, HuffPost’s parent company, acquired Yahoo in June, it laid off 15 percent of Yahoo and AOL’s combined workforce.It is not clear whether Northam’s attack on Gillespie will stick, given the regularity with which companies lay off employees and Gillespie’s indirect connection to the companies’ human resources decisions.But the broadside is part of Northam’s broader efforts to depict Gillespie, 56, a former Republican National Committee chairman and longtime Beltway power broker, as an out-of-touch D.C. insider as they vie for control of the governor’s mansion this November.Northam, 58, who is the current lieutenant governor, is betting that he has the advantage in a battle of biographies with Gillespie. Northam is a pediatric neurologist and Army veteran, whose deep heritage in the Old Dominion state is evident in his gentle drawl.Earlier this month, the Northam campaign debuted a 30-second video, entitled “Whoever,” which compares Northam’s record as a doctor and elected official with that of Gillespie, who the ad dubs a “Washington, D.C. corporate lobbyist.”“He shows up for whoever pays him,” the ad concludes.Northam has cast himself as a steady hand at the wheel, a continuation of the relatively popular tenure of Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe. He is running on using Affordable Care Act funds to expand Medicaid, which a Republican legislature has blocked, and offering Virginians a free associate degree in exchange for public service.Gillespie has promised to unlock economic growth and job creation through tax cuts for “all Virginians.”Democrats are eager to notch a win in Virginia, one of two states ― the other is New Jersey ― with state-level elections this November. In the 2016 general election, Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump by 5 percentage points in Virginia.Northam had a strong summer of fundraising, bringing in $7.2 million in July and August compared to Gillespie’s $3.7 million. That gives Northam $5.6 million cash on hand compared with Gillespie’s $2.6 million.But it remains a neck-in-neck race. Northam and Gillespie are tied at 42 percent each, with 12 percent undecided, according to a Suffolk University poll released Thursday. Other polls have shown Northam with a modest lead.Northam and Gillespie face off in their second debate at Capitol One headquarters in Tysons, Virginia, at 7 pm on Tuesday. "

The union movement had “Solidarity Forever” which first was sung in 1915, the civil rights movement had, of course, “We Shall Overcome,” and the anti-war movement had Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind.”Now it appears that another progressive movement, this one seeking to end gun violence has come up with its anthem, a song called “Nothing More,” which was recorded by a rock group out of Connecticut called the Alternate Routes and has been picked up by the folks who are bringing us this year’s national gun violence prevention (GVP) extravaganza, The Concert Across America (CAA.) The song was actually written by Alternate Routes to commemorate (what an inappropriate word) the tragedy at Sandy Hook, and if you go to their Facebook page, you’ll get a beautiful rendition of it by the Boston Children’s Chorus; there’s also a version on the CAA website given to us by Vy Higginson’s Harlem Choir.Last year’s concert embraced more than 5,000 musical artists appearing in more than 350 sites around the country, and this year’s shindig promises to become even more widespread. There’s something going on in more than 40 states, so no matter where you live you can get involved by driving a few miles this way or that and these events will all go off sometime between September 21st and 24th. When you go to the CAA website, take a minute and look at the sponsor’s list, or what they are calling the ‘partners’ who are supporting this effort. I’m counting more than 120 groups and organizations, and it’s not just the usual suspects that are associated with efforts to reduce the American sickness known as guns, there are all kinds of folks involved in this effort that I never heard of before, and if I haven’t heard about them, their presence and energies mean that something new and different in the GVP world may be taking place.The problem with advocating for ending gun violence is that it’s a whole lot of separate organizations going up against one organization, the NRA. Which means by definition that the ‘gun rights’ group has the upper hand because the boys in Fairfax can develop and implement strategies from a single, focused source. The GVP community doesn’t enjoy the luxury of such single-purpose activity, but the Concert Across America has become a national expression of one, basic theme, namely, that gun violence must come to an end. Which is what, for example, turned hundreds of organizations and group into the anti-war movement in the 1970s, the emergence of a consensus that the war had to end. And considering the fact that every two years we lose as many people to gun violence as we lost in the nearly quarter-century that we were in Vietnam, it’s time for a national, organized anti-gun violence movement to emerge.But this year’s concert represents something new and unique as well, because along with all the famous artists who are going to appear, every last one of us can also become a participant by making a video singing ‘Nothing More’ and then posting it on YouTube or Facebook with the hashtag #ConcertAcrossAmerica so that your performance can be counted, which is what a movement is really all about.The problem with building a movement in the digital age is that personal participation usually goes no further than sitting in front of a computer or responding to a text that came in on your droid.

The design house, which describes itself as alternative luxury fashion, sent models down the runway in Swarovski-encrusted headgear.Chalayan opened up about the theme of the show and described it as “the idea of the lost individuals in a digital world. And living with the opinion of others, but at the same time being empowered by the entitled state,” according to Vogue. Many loyal followers of Chalayan described the show as a “masterpiece,” “brilliant” and “one of your best shows ever” on the brand’s Instagram page and New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman described the look as “Motherboard chic and disassociation.” But, of course, people on Twitter had other thoughts: Somehow, the headboards aren’t even the craziest thing we’ve seen yet at London Fashion Week. Christopher Kane recently sent models down the runway in rhinestone Crocs:And at New York Fashion Week, Helmut Lang introduced us all to bras that double as purses: And let us not forget the “My Pussy, My Choice” show from Berlin-based design house Namilia: What will the rest of London Fashion Week bring us?

Reps. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.), Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), along with New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito (D), and several other protesters, sat on the street blocking traffic during a protest organized by immigration advocacy group Make The Road New York. President Donald Trump was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly and stayed at his home in Trump Tower. Demonstrators’ goal was to “make it clear to President Trump, the Republicans and the Democrats that we will continue this peaceful fight for Dreamers and immigrants as long as it takes to enact legislation and put Dreamers in a safe place,” Gutiérrez said in a statement, referring to young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. “A few Congressmen and elected-officials gathering in front of Trump Tower doesn’t mean much if it is not backed up by the grassroots and allies and today we are standing with diverse allies to make sure Congress and the President do more than just talk about solutions, they actually follow through with action,” Gutiérrez added. Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, this month. Although he did not revoke work permits and protections for so-called Dreamers immediately, they will begin to lose DACA protections in greater numbers beginning on March 6 unless Congress intervenes. Members of Congress in both parties have said they want to help DACA recipients, but have not settled on a way forward. Democrats are pushing for the Dream Act, a bill that would grant legal status to young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, and party leaders in Congress said last week that they had a loose deal with Trump to tie that legislation to border security measures. Trump and other Republicans denied that there was a deal and said they would not agree to anything without border security and enforcement measures included. The protesters outside Trump Tower called for a “clean” Dream Act that would not include separate border security measures.“We are here to defend our immigrant communities,” Mark-Viverito said before her arrest, according to the New York Daily News. “We don’t want families to be divided. Trump’s policy goes against what the majority of this nation supports and believes in. It goes against our values.”Espaillat, the first formerly undocumented member of Congress, participated because he wanted to stand up ”for immigrant youth to say loud and clear – unequivocally, that he dedicates his work in Congress to protecting immigrants, immigrant families, and their future in America,” his spokeswoman Candace Randle Person said in a statement. ’Since day one, the Trump Administration has threatened Latinos, Muslims, LGBT, women and the list continues,” Person said. “His decision to end the DACA program earlier this month increased the urgency of what’s at stake and the lives at risk when we fail to speak out against racism in America.”"

However, Italy remains one of the 14 countries in the region with ongoing endemic measles transmission. In January 2017, the Italian National Health Institute (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, or ISS) detected an increase in the number of measles cases reported to the national surveillance system compared to previous months and years.According to a report in Eurosurveillance, the ongoing measles outbreak that has resulted in over 4,400 cases has been fueled by low vaccination rates and transmission in health care settings. Investigator Dr. Antonietta Filia and colleagues at ISS analyzed data on the 4,477 cases reported from Jan. 1 through Aug. 31 of this year, 3,417 of which have been lab confirmed. (The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control noted 4,487 cases, including three deaths, through Sept.13.) The highest number of cases—900—was reported in March. Cases have been reported in 20 of the 21 Italian administrative regions, but 90 percent were reported by only seven regions. The Lazio region in central Italy reported the most number of cases (1,588) and the highest incidence (270 cases per 1,000,000 people).According to the investigators, “The main reason for this outbreak is an accumulation of a large pool of measles-susceptible population due to sustained low uptake of measles vaccine in Italy over the years.” Measles vaccine uptake was very low in the years following its introduction in Italy in 1976, which has led to large vaccination gaps among adolescents and young adults and a constantly increasing median age of reported cases. Measles vaccine uptake peaked in Italy in 2003 at 90.6 percent, well below the 95 percent target rate, and has declined since to 85.3 percent in 2015.Decreased uptake of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in Italy in recent years is the result of vaccine hesitancy. The Italian government approved a law in July 2017 extending the number of mandatory vaccinations in persons up to 16 years of age. In 2016 to 2017, measles outbreaks have also been reported in other European countries. In Romania, over 9,100 measles cases have been registered, and 34 people died during this period according to the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT).Meanwhile, in the U.S., despite the massive measles outbreak in Minnesota, anti-vaccine groups are organizing “measles parties” for unvaccinated children as a means to boost “their natural resistance.” At these soirees, children who have not received the vaccine are exposed to the disease so that they could become infected and, thus, “build up” immunity. It’s similar to the idea behind “chicken pox parties,” which were highly popular among parents before the pox vaccine was introduced in the United States. These gatherings unnecessarily expose unvaccinated kids to a potentially grave risk and contribute to further spreading the outbreak. Despite robust scientific evidence proving the safety of the measles vaccine, parents in the anti-vaccine movement continue to push the debunked autism story from the unethical and unscientific publication of Andrew Wakefield—the founder of the modern anti-vax movement. And that is causing a serious, highly contagious and potentially fatal respiratory disease to make a comeback.Measles is a highly transmissible disease. In fact, 90-95 percent of people must be vaccinated in order to protect the entire population or achieve what is called “community immunity” (also known as herd immunity). Everyone who is eligible to get the measles vaccine should get vaccinated—not only to protect themselves but to protect those who cannot be vaccinated through herd immunity. In 2015, there were 134,200 measles deaths globally—about 367 deaths every day. In addition to illness and death caused by the disease, measles outbreaks require considerable health care resources for diagnosing and treating cases and implementing control measures."

The church held retreats and anonymous surveys to help members consider the issue. It hired a conflict resolution consultant. Some leaders resigned from their posts to protest inaction on the measure, while other members decided to leave the parish altogether. Rev. Tom Crittenden, the church rector, said that the violent and deadly white supremacist rally that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August is what tipped the scale. “Charlottesville seems to have moved us to this point,” Crittenden told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. “Not that we have a different view of Lee historically in our church, but we have appreciation for our need to move on.”The general was a military man who inherited slaves through his wealthy wife, Mary Anna Custis Lee. He kept black men and women in bondage at the Arlington House in Virginia for at least five years, before freeing them in 1862. One former slave testified that Lee brutally punished slaves who tried to escape. During the Civil War, Lee rose through the ranks to become the general in chief of the Confederate Army. When the war ended, the former general moved to Lexington to help run Washington College, which is now known as Washington and Lee University.

But since 2015, the church’s name has been a source of tension for congregants. Members began to question it after the Charleston church shooting, when white supremacist Dylann Roof massacred nine black worshippers inside a South Carolina church. Members who wanted to preserve the name believed Lee would abhor white supremacy, anti-Semitism and similar movements. They viewed Lee as a reconciler after the Civil War.The debate in the church took place against a nationwide debate over whether to rename Confederate memorials. Some see the monuments as a part of the nation’s heritage and history, while others say that they celebrate America’s racist past. Lee himself was opposed to the idea of constructing Confederate monuments, believing it was not wise to “keep open the sores of war.” After his death however, his name became a symbol of Southern pride and “The Lost Cause” narrative, which reimagines the Civil War as a fight for the constitution, rather than a fight about slavery.In a statement issued last month, the church’s vestry board members wrote: “Lee was widely admired in both the North and the South as a man of virtue and honor and as among the leading reconcilers of our fractured land. We do not honor Lee as a Confederate. Nor do we subscribe to neo-Confederate ideas in honoring him. We honor Lee as one of our own parishioners, a devout man who led our parish through difficult years in post-Civil-War Virginia.”Monday’s vote was applauded by vestry board member Doug Cumming, who told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that people in the church community have been hurt and are feeling exhausted by the debate.“He was the senior warden of our church, we’re proud of that, it’s part of our history, but we’re not going to put that on a sign out on the street because it’s misunderstood,” Cumming said.

I’m not sure why; perhaps because a cauliflower is just so damned big that it looks like a main course – and because its uniform pleasantness somehow never grows boring. Sometimes we have it with cheese sauce (on which I wrote a few years ago – and vented about an expression I find irksome); sometimes as a curry, either faux-Indian or faux-Thai (most of my Asian cooking merits that “faux” disclaimer).Once a year at least, though, we eat our cauliflower cut into pieces and baked with a crisp breadcrumb-and-parmesan coating, and that’s how we had it last week after a visit to the farmers’ market. It’s easy to make: You cut up a head of cauliflower, par-cook it, egg-and-breadcrumb it, and bake it drizzled with oil or butter. But as I describe the cooking, I’ll pass along a couple of tricks that help make it a dish we return to year after year.I begin by snapping off any leaves and stems surrounding the white curd (as it is called by gardeners). Sometimes I save them, because they’re a decent thing to eat once they’ve been cooked to tenderness; sometimes I get rid of them. I then cut the cauliflower into large florets, cutting through the stalks then easing off chunks by hand. Now, here’s the first trick: when you cut the chunks into the desired bite- or two-bite-sized pieces, be sure to leave a flat surface by cutting through the stalk lengthwise. Once breaded, this will rest against the baking sheet and become particularly brown and crusty. Generally, I’ll use about two thirds of a medium-large cauliflower (about the size of the ones you see in the supermarket) and save the rest, uncooked, for the next day. (This time, I cut it smaller, simmered it and dressed it with oil, vinegar, salt and a mixture of crushed spices: pepper, caraway, cumin, coriander and fennel, a blend I’d used for a duck dinner a while before).Having turned the oven on to just shy of 400º F (205º C), I par-cook the cauliflower, and here there are choices to be made: you can either boil the pieces in salted water or you can steam them. My preference is to steam them, because the chunks could possibly break in the tumult of even slowly boiling water. The bigger choice is how long to cook them, bearing in mind that they will spend half an hour in the oven. If you steam them for a minute, the end product will retain more texture: it won’t be crunchy, but it will offer token resistance to the knife or tooth. But if you cook until almost but not quite tender – say, four minutes – the baked morsels will be very soft under their crust, almost custardy in fact, which has its own, very different, appeal. You could cook some for a minute and some for three or four and do a half-and-half platter. Last time, I went the custardy route, though typically I aim for more texture, as I think most people would do.Whether the cauliflower has been boiled or steamed, it must now be allowed to cool and – most important – dry to stop the coating from sliding off. A colander will work, but not as well as a wire rack on which you can spread the pieces in a single layer. While it’s cooling, I beat two eggs in a large bowl with two tablespoons of flour to form a light batter, and that is the second trick. The usual sequence for breading food is to flour it, then run it through an egg wash, then coat it in crumbs. But with something like a cauliflower floret, the flour will tend to gather in the gaps and mix with residual moisture to create a pasty unpleasantness. Flour-thickened egg will adhere reasonably well without that danger. I also combine a heaping cup (say, 260 ml by volume) of non-flavored breadcrumbs with half a cup of grated parmesan, seasoning it also with salt and pepper. A dry-leafed herb such as thyme or rosemary, finely chopped, can also be added; so can a quarter teaspoon of cayenne or other hot chili powder.Prepare a baking sheet by smearing it generously with either olive oil or melted butter (I almost always use oil). Before greasing, I line mine with a piece of parchment paper (greaseproof paper in the UK), which makes it easier both to remove the finished cauliflower and to clean the pan.Now, the florets are cool enough to handle. I put four or five pieces in the egg mixture, using a rubber spatula to turn them in the liquid and ensure that they are well doused. These go next into the breadcrumb mixture to be thoroughly coated. Another trick: When you lift them (by hand) from the crumbs to the greased baking sheet, try to include more crumbs than are actually sticking, because these will come together and form a good crust in the oven thanks to both the egg mixture and the cheese.Be sure to place them on the sheet flat side down, but don’t worry if some pieces don’t have a flat side: this happens. Finally, drizzle them with olive oil or melted butter, making sure there’s some on each piece.Bake them for 30 or 40 minutes until the bottoms are deep golden brown and the tops crisp and golden. Check after 15 minutes and if necessary turn the oven down by a few degrees. If you have a broiler (I don’t – a long story), you might deploy it to darken the color so long as you’re careful not to scorch the crumbs. There will be stray browned crumbs on the baking sheet; you can, if you like, sprinkle them over the cauliflower pieces when you dish them up.Jackie and I often eat these as they are, but sometimes there’s a sauce for dipping or spreading. Last time there were two: Leftover tomato sauce (just fresh ripe tomatoes cooked with oil and mint leaves), and a Special Sauce we sometimes spread on hamburgers (2/3 mayonnaise out of a jar and 1/3 Momofuku Ssäm Sauce, which you can and should buy on line).These are great fun, with their easygoing flavor and textural contrasts. You could serve them with drinks, but I still maintain they make a grand meal. Just be sure to have some dessert at the ready: Cauliflower, even breaded and even in large quantity, doesn’t exactly stick to your ribs."

My preference is to steam them, because the chunks could possibly break in the tumult of even slowly boiling water. The bigger choice is how long to cook them, bearing in mind that they will spend half an hour in the oven. If you steam them for a minute, the end product will retain more texture: it won’t be crunchy, but it will offer token resistance to the knife or tooth. But if you cook until almost but not quite tender – say, four minutes – the baked morsels will be very soft under their crust, almost custardy in fact, which has its own, very different, appeal. You could cook some for a minute and some for three or four and do a half-and-half platter. Last time, I went the custardy route, though typically I aim for more texture, as I think most people would do.Whether the cauliflower has been boiled or steamed, it must now be allowed to cool and – most important – dry to stop the coating from sliding off. A colander will work, but not as well as a wire rack on which you can spread the pieces in a single layer. While it’s cooling, I beat two eggs in a large bowl with two tablespoons of flour to form a light batter, and that is the second trick. The usual sequence for breading food is to flour it, then run it through an egg wash, then coat it in crumbs. But with something like a cauliflower floret, the flour will tend to gather in the gaps and mix with residual moisture to create a pasty unpleasantness. Flour-thickened egg will adhere reasonably well without that danger. I also combine a heaping cup (say, 260 ml by volume) of non-flavored breadcrumbs with half a cup of grated parmesan, seasoning it also with salt and pepper. A dry-leafed herb such as thyme or rosemary, finely chopped, can also be added; so can a quarter teaspoon of cayenne or other hot chili powder.Prepare a baking sheet by smearing it generously with either olive oil or melted butter (I almost always use oil). Before greasing, I line mine with a piece of parchment paper (greaseproof paper in the UK), which makes it easier both to remove the finished cauliflower and to clean the pan.Now, the florets are cool enough to handle. I put four or five pieces in the egg mixture, using a rubber spatula to turn them in the liquid and ensure that they are well doused. These go next into the breadcrumb mixture to be thoroughly coated. Another trick: When you lift them (by hand) from the crumbs to the greased baking sheet, try to include more crumbs than are actually sticking, because these will come together and form a good crust in the oven thanks to both the egg mixture and the cheese.Be sure to place them on the sheet flat side down, but don’t worry if some pieces don’t have a flat side: this happens. Finally, drizzle them with olive oil or melted butter, making sure there’s some on each piece.Bake them for 30 or 40 minutes until the bottoms are deep golden brown and the tops crisp and golden. Check after 15 minutes and if necessary turn the oven down by a few degrees. If you have a broiler (I don’t – a long story), you might deploy it to darken the color so long as you’re careful not to scorch the crumbs. There will be stray browned crumbs on the baking sheet; you can, if you like, sprinkle them over the cauliflower pieces when you dish them up.Jackie and I often eat these as they are, but sometimes there’s a sauce for dipping or spreading. Last time there were two: Leftover tomato sauce (just fresh ripe tomatoes cooked with oil and mint leaves), and a Special Sauce we sometimes spread on hamburgers (2/3 mayonnaise out of a jar and 1/3 Momofuku Ssäm Sauce, which you can and should buy on line).These are great fun, with their easygoing flavor and textural contrasts. You could serve them with drinks, but I still maintain they make a grand meal. Just be sure to have some dessert at the ready: Cauliflower, even breaded and even in large quantity, doesn’t exactly stick to your ribs."

I’m not sure why; perhaps because",2017-09-19,<p>Let the steamed cauliflower dry - preferably on a rack - before breading</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bfc35e1a00004400f0730d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Jackie and I eat cauliflower, it is rarely as a side dish: It is often our whole dinner. I’m not sure why; perhaps because a cauliflower is just so damned big that it looks like a main course – and because its uniform pleasantness somehow never grows boring. Sometimes we have it with cheese sauce (on which I wrote a few years ago – and vented about an expression I find irksome); sometimes as a curry, either faux-Indian or faux-Thai (most of my Asian cooking merits that “faux” disclaimer).Once a year at least, though, we eat our cauliflower cut into pieces and baked with a crisp breadcrumb-and-parmesan coating, and that’s how we had it last week after a visit to the farmers’ market. It’s easy to make: You cut up a head of cauliflower, par-cook it, egg-and-breadcrumb it, and bake it drizzled with oil or butter. But as I describe the cooking, I’ll pass along a couple of tricks that help make it a dish we return to year after year.I begin by snapping off any leaves and stems surrounding the white curd (as it is called by gardeners). Sometimes I save them, because they’re a decent thing to eat once they’ve been cooked to tenderness; sometimes I get rid of them. I then cut the cauliflower into large florets, cutting through the stalks then easing off chunks by hand. Now, here’s the first trick: when you cut the chunks into the desired bite- or two-bite-sized pieces, be sure to leave a flat surface by cutting through the stalk lengthwise. Once breaded, this will rest against the baking sheet and become particularly brown and crusty. Generally, I’ll use about two thirds of a medium-large cauliflower (about the size of the ones you see in the supermarket) and save the rest, uncooked, for the next day. (This time, I cut it smaller, simmered it and dressed it with oil, vinegar, salt and a mixture of crushed spices: pepper, caraway, cumin, coriander and fennel, a blend I’d used for a duck dinner a while before).Having turned the oven on to just shy of 400º F (205º C), I par-cook the cauliflower, and here there are choices to be made: you can either boil the pieces in salted water or you can steam them.

Geographically, they are at opposite ends of the globe, and their people are ethnically different and they have different levels of economic development. But there are similarities. Both are extremely large countries with highly religious populations — most in the U.S. are Christian and most in Indonesia are Muslim. And both countries are experiencing significant change in their societies.When Barack Obama became president in 2009, he called for “change we can believe in” and he personified this change in American society. As the first black American president, many saw his presidency as a decisive victory for civil rights and cheered him on when he pushed for serious socioeconomic changes. But a sizable part of the population disagreed, feeling that Obama was undermining fundamental American values grounded in a strong Christian faith.In 2014, the year after Obama took the oath of office for his second term, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama became governor of Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital. Purnama is Christian and ethnically Chinese in a predominantly Muslim city. His bold policies to clean up the city administration, build infrastructure and aid the poor were widely supported, but he met with strong resistance when he ran for a second term in 2017. Many felt he was undermining Muslim values.Obama was followed by Donald Trump in the U.S., and in Indonesia hard-line Islamists got Purnama convicted on trumped-up blasphemy charges. Reactive populism has become a decisive force in both countries.The cases of Obama and Purnama illustrate the forces of change that are sweeping though some societies across the globe. They are propelled by a global urban consumer class that expects benefits from this change. Strong resistance comes from those who fear to lose out.Who are those people whose fear makes them prone to the rhetoric of populism? Who are those who feel vulnerable and fear that change could marginalize them? In the U.S., Harvard economist Dani Rodrik blames the economics of globalization. In a recent paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research called “Populism and the Economics of Globalization,” he finds that populism speaks to those who have suffered job and income losses due to international competition and trade. Indeed, both Trump and Bernie Sanders claim to represent those who have lost their livelihood in the modern, globalized economy and blame the political establishment for colluding with powerful international business conglomerates. The two differ in their vision of social norms and values: Trump mostly reaches a more rural, conservative group, while Sanders has the support of more urban, progressive voters.In Indonesia, Islamists like Rizieq Shihab, the leader of the Islamic Defenders Front, and authoritarian populists like Prabowo Subianto, a former lieutenant general who ran against Joko Widodo in the 2014 presidential election, joined forces and backed a popular campaign against Purnama in this year’s gubernatorial election. Like other populists, they blamed the establishment for enriching itself and abusing its power, and they claimed to represent a disenfranchised community (Muslims).Their campaign grew from fertile ground, even though democracy and globalization have benefited many Indonesians. Since the beginning of the democratic era 20 years ago with the resignation of Suharto, the poverty rate in Indonesia has fallen from 24 percent to just over 10 percent and the population increased from 200 million to 260 million. Life expectancy expanded from 66 years to 70 years and people now enjoy better access to education, healthcare and basic social services.In Indonesia, it is neither directly the result of global trade or migration but the resistance against changing values and lifestyles that resulted in the backlash against Purnama and his eventual imprisonment. Observers sometimes reduce his fate to an anti-Chinese or anti-Christian sentiment, but it is better explained by a large discomfort with the fact that norms are changing.Modernization deprives traditional (mostly male) leaders of their positions of power. Gender equality is the most immediate threat and Islamists all over the world fight against the ascent of women into powerful positions of society. Besides women, there are other people who claim equal rights and power. Whether it’s homosexuality or other faiths, Islamists share a general fear of anything perceived as heretical, heterodox and undermining patriarchal values. The Islamist opposition against Purnama falls in this category. It must be seen in the same light as the increasing acts of violence against the LGBTQ community and growing religious intolerance in Indonesia. The usual and recurring argument of the offenders is that they claim to defend the rights and values of Muslim society.There is very similar to what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. White supremacists rallied to claim their dominance and privileges over people of color and other faiths. The Washington Post interviewed several of the activists and reported: “They felt silenced and censored, deprived of their rights.” In Indonesia, Islamists also fight for their dominant privileges over people of other colors and faiths.What American right-wing populists and Indonesian Islamists have in common is their sense of deprivation, the feeling they are losing power and drifting into a marginalized existence. They are also mostly male and equally disconcerted by the empowerment of women. They feel their powers are being marginalized and they want to restore values and norms they perceive as eroding.In the end, populism feeds on the fear of those who feel disenfranchised and who sense a loss of power to set and maintain norms and values in society. They fight new global rules that equalize opportunities across the borders of nations, gender, class and ethnicity. These new rules erode traditional positions of power and populists use the resulting fears for their campaigns.It is no surprise that the dissent is often stronger in the countryside — all over the world there is a cultural divide between urban and rural cultures. Both sides look down on each other. Both maintain their culture is superior. However, the forces of globalization are mostly urban, technological and international. The global trend towards urbanization signifies the victory of the city over the periphery. And those who lose their power to maintain their norms are angry.The Wall Street Journal, paraphrasing Tom W. Smith from the University of Chicago, reports that “cities’ welcoming attitudes toward immigrants from abroad, same-sex marriage and secularism heighten distrust among small-town residents with different values.” Last year, these rural folks formed a critical mass and put Donald Trump in the White House. Trump’s call to “make America great again” was directed at their feeling of losing the right to set and defend their own norms and values. Academics often refer to the rural-urban divide, but the great divide today lies between the global forces of social and technological change versus a traditional interpretation of social norms. The former appears to be winning. But the latter is putting up a strong resistance. Representative democracies like the U.S. and Indonesia are particularly vulnerable to political populism where the fight goes to ballot boxes and can put populist leaders in power. Recent elections in France and the upcoming one in Germany give us hope that reasonable voters will eventually prevail. There is no reason why this should not also happen in the U.S. and in Indonesia."

25,POLITICS,New Frontier In Corporate Incentives Are Toxic For Democracy And Justice,"Alicia Bannon and Douglas Keith, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-walker-foxconn-corporate-incentives_us_59c16f9de4b087fdf508bd4d,A Wisconsin law gives Foxconn preferential access to the state's business-friendly Supreme Court.,2017-09-19,"Scott Walker, governor of Wisconsin, speaks as Senator Ron Johnson, billionaire Terry Gou, chairman of Foxconn Technology Group, and U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan listen during an event in the East Room of the White House, July 26, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c171071a00002400f07836.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"States often compete to attract corporations with tax breaks and other perks – but should they be able to sweeten the pot with a bespoke justice system as well? A new Wisconsin law offers Foxconn Technology Group, an electronics manufacturing giant based in Taiwan, $3 billion in credits and tax breaks along with a tailor-made legal process – distinct from the process every other business and citizen in the state enjoys. It’s part of a worrying trend to give favored corporate or political interests a leg up in legal battles, spearheaded by a state where the courts have long been a magnet for big-money and political battles.Signed Monday, the new law creates a special track for certain lawsuits involving any business located in the newly-created “electronics and information technology manufacturing zone,” a “zone” that at this point appears to exist for Foxconn’s benefit alone. The new law speeds up the timeline for appeals in such cases and puts an automatic hold on trial court decisions while an appeal is taking place. It also creates a special process for the state’s Supreme Court to pluck a case from the lower courts and decide it for itself, bypassing the standard appeals process.Why might Foxconn want a fast track to the Wisconsin Supreme Court? Recent history offers more than a few clues. Over the past decade, special interests have poured millions into the state’s high court elections, securing a conservative majority that has rejected challenges to many of Gov. Scott Walker’s signature initiatives, including a 2011 union-busting law that limited collective bargaining for public employees. In 2015, the same court abruptly ended an investigation into whether Walker illegally coordinated campaign spending with business-friendly groups – many of which had also provided major campaign support to the justices. Despite the seeming conflict, the impacted justices refused to step aside from hearing the case. The new procedural changes give Foxconn easy access to the Wisconsin Supreme Court – and a different rulebook than any other employer in Wisconsin. Imagine, for example, if a worker filed a complaint with Wisconsin’s Department of Workforce Development, asserting they were denied sick leave for which they were legally entitled. If the agency found that Foxconn violated the state’s Family and Medical Leave Act, and Foxconn asked a court to overturn that decision, the company would have the benefit of faster appeals, automatic stays of unfavorable decisions, and the chance for a friendly supreme court to short circuit the judicial process.That’s right, a state already unfavorable to labor is greasing the wheels for a corporation accused of working its employees for unlawfully long hours, allowing working conditions so unsafe they caused a deadly explosion in 2011, and participating in a bribery scheme – exactly the kind of dealings that might land them in court in Wisconsin. What’s worse, Wisconsin is just one (egregious) example of how states around the country are tinkering with courts’ structure and processes for political advantage or to support favored interests – treating courts, which are supposed to provide equal justice for everyone, as just another political player. This fall, for example, North Carolina’s legislature is expected to take up a bill that would gerrymander judicial districts in the state, after previously passing laws reintroducing partisan elections and shrinking the size of the intermediate appellate court to rob the governor of the ability to make new appointments. In total, the Brennan Center has documented at least 49 bills in 24 states this year that would give political actors more control over the courts or entrench partisan interests by, for example, changing how judges reach the bench, stripping courts of their jurisdiction over certain issues, or empowering legislators to override state or federal court decisions. Unlike the Foxconn incentives in Wisconsin, most of these pieces of legislation haven’t made it into law – at least not yet – but they may herald a new frontier in efforts to blur the line between courts and politics. But why go to all this trouble to manipulate the courts? It seems that these officials have taken the same lesson from 2017 that we did: courts play an essential role in our democracy, and fair and independent courts left to do their jobs are likely to benefit the public more than they do the political branches – or their preferred businesses. Wisconsin should be an alarm bell for anyone who believes that justice doesn’t belong to the highest bidder."

How can a child understand or recognize what another child of a different race or ethnicity goes through if we think everyone has the same experiences?”That’s why his new children’s book, What’s The Difference?: Being Different Is Amazing, is focused on helping parents raise racially conscious children who “embrace and celebrate differences” instead of ignoring them. Richards, who writes and shares about parenthood as DaddyDoinWork, is the father of a 6-year-old and a 4-year-old daughter. He first thought of the concept for What’s The Difference? in 2015, when the police shooting of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, was continuing to grab headlines and dividing Americans across racial lines. “That’s when I realized that grown-ups of different races really didn’t understand each other, and I wanted to do my part to help break that cycle by targeting our younger generation. Little did I know in 2017 that race relations would be as bad as they have ever been in my lifetime. Needless to say, this is timely,” he said. More simply, Richards hopes that his book imparts the message to kids that being different is a great thing. “It’s so important to share the message of diversity and inclusion to kids at a young age, so they will grow up knowing that being different is cool,” he says. Richards’ previous children’s book, I Wonder: Celebrating Daddies Doin’ Work, highlighted the equal role of fathers in parenting. "

In what may now be a regular call-and-response to major hurricanes making landfall, Harvey led many to point out the role land use planning played in exacerbating the damage and the inequities associated with those impacted the most. With more storms coming, these arguments should be part of our regular political debate at all levels.Why have decades of effort to make cities more sustainable not affected outcomes in circumstances like Hurricane Harvey? Primarily, because the political project that underlies the concept of urban sustainability has not been seriously addressed.

In this ideal, those who profit from growth have no more say than those who advocate for environmental preservation and protections for the most vulnerable residents. Yet, we have seen a number of instances wherein mainstream urban sustainability initiatives sacrificed this essence by forwarding land use polices based on partial gains.Think of a typical urban sustainability initiative – a high-end green building. In order to call such an initiative sustainable, there is a political accommodation. Sure, the logic goes, these buildings are mostly about creating large profits from growth, but we get some environmental benefits and we will get around to social equity later. Compromises of this sort happened repeatedly over the past three decades in the name of taking politically expedient steps forward. The result has been the shifting of cities across the world toward a state of pseudo-sustainability.Recently, we have sought a way out of the urban pseudo-sustainability morass by formulating new concepts: the smart, adaptive, or resilient city. Perhaps these will provide opportunities that sustainability could not? As I and others argue, this has not been the case. Rather, efforts to mainstream these concepts have required the same sorts of compromises as with sustainability. These new conceptual arenas at least keep the urban land use agenda focused in some way on ecological preservation and social equity. But the project for systematically changing urban land use is still stuck in the pseudo-sustainability morass.Sacrificing EquityThere is increasing awareness that the onset of urban pseudo-sustainability has proved especially unfavorable for social equity in cities. UN Habitat’s 2016 World Cities Report finds that 75% of the world’s cities have higher levels of income inequality than 20 years ago. The chart below shows that this trend has occurred alongside a steep rise in income inequality, especially in wealthy countries with lots of formerly industrial space in urban centers.Many have observed that the outcomes of pseudo-sustainability forward environmental interests at the expense of social equity. In 2011, Liz Mueller and Sarah Dooling noted that “Environmental and economic rationales for redevelopment implicitly focus on the benefits brought by future residents of redeveloped neighborhoods,” but not on those of existing residents. A similar argument was made last year in the journal Nature by David Wachsmuth and colleagues who pointed out that urban sustainability policy narrowly targets ecological goals in a manner that leads to indifference to the effects on marginalized people. Earlier this year in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Robert Sampson reviewed evidence from Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles to further support the argument that urban sustainability initiatives often focus on ecosystems and physical infrastructure at the expense of creating “fissures in the civic infrastructure.” And, in her recent post to the Green Inequalities blog, Isabelle Anguelovski provides several examples, from the greenbelt in Medellin to the Highline in New York City, where cities seeking to attract new high paying industries are awash in urban greening that sometimes serves as a thinly veiled means of targeted upgrading to displace vulnerable residents.Moving forwardIt’s as if we are busying ourselves with developing new conceptual models of urbanism to avoid dealing with the politics that allow certain urban environmental initiatives to support growth at the expense of social equity. Calling for an awareness of these politics, however, is not to diminish the importance of urban greening. The response to the current side effects of urban sustainability initiatives cannot be to sacrifice social or ecological goals. Rather, the response must be to reassert the essence of urban sustainability wherein these goals are placed on equal political footing with growth agendas in the process of making land use decisions.So, how do we that? how do we start to change the politics of urban sustainability and resilience in a way that we see different outcomes for cities after hurricanes? Two things are essential.First, we need strong political coalitions that unite environmental and social equity interests. Examples of this are California’s regional planning laws and Barcelona’s neighborhood-based resistance to gentrification where social-ecological coalitions were built before negotiating with more politically powerful growth interests.Second, in order to develop strategies for strong interventions in cities upon which coalitions can be built, we need to understand who is vulnerable to social processes that exclude marginalized populations from receiving the benefits of urban greening.

After black women failed to reach the top spot in the first two seasons, Fantasia finally did. With vocals straight out of a church choir in North Carolina, she deserved it.All the black people I knew — my mom, classmates and acquaintances — were so proud. We celebrated this moment together. Fantasia’s victory on one of America’s most watched television shows at the time wasn’t just a win for her: It was a win for us.Issa Rae, a co-creator and the star of the HBO sitcom “Insecure,” stood on the Emmys’ red carpet on Sunday and proudly proclaimed to a Variety reporter who asked which people she was cheering for, “I’m rooting for everybody black.” When I heard that, I jumped up and shouted: “Same, Sis! Same!” Because that’s what I’ve been doing all my life. And apparently many other people have, too, because Variety’s video went viral on Twitter, garnering more than 16,000 retweets and countless reshares up and down my social media timelines.But what so many people missed in her comment is that expressing black pride is not the same as being racist toward whites.“Talk about racist! You are one!” a Twitter user wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat wrote.Ms. Rae’s critics don’t understand that when it comes to racial pride, the playing field is not level. Black pride does not carry the power to shut others out as white pride does. And that’s the difference. Hollywood has a long history of privileging whiteness, from who gets to greenlight movie ideas to whom studios target for consumption. While white people have the luxury of turning on any given channel and seeing themselves reflected with nuance and depth onscreen, black people haven’t been so fortunate.Though “Insecure” wasn’t nominated this year, Ms. Rae was there to unequivocally support others who broke down more of Hollywood’s white-male-dominated doors. And it was genuine: Later that night, she tweeted her congratulations to Lena Waithe, who became the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing.“You’ve been killing it for SO long! Get. Yours. Boo! @LenaWaithe #Emmys #BlacksAllZay #SaidWhatISaid,” she wrote, affirming her initial comment.Ms. Waithe replied with reciprocal support: “Love you sis! You got next!! I have a feeling your speech gon be way funnier than mine.”When black artists are honored at an esteemed award show like the Emmys, it’s no secret whom we want to win. The fact that black actors, writers and directors in 2017 are still becoming the “first” black person to ever receive “X” award should make that clear.Black pride isn’t designed to block the progress of others. It is meant to empower and create space for black people to celebrate and honor ourselves in a country that tells us in no uncertain terms that black lives do not matter. It’s a necessary escape when racial tension in the world is too much to bear. It’s a tool for survival in a world that doesn’t want to see you win.We take enormous joy in seeing Lena Waithe, Donald Glover and Sterling K. Brown walk away with trophies. Their wins give us more hope that our stories will be told in more nuanced, sensitive and multidimensional ways. We will continue to celebrate one another and will always be “rooting for everybody black.”This piece was originally featured on The New York Times."

He acknowledged firing out his apartment window after the frightened child ran into his home fleeing the clown, police said. He claimed he aimed at a nearby yard.Barrett’s clown mask stunt immediately took a turn when his daughter fled through traffic and into the stranger’s apartment, according to an arrest report obtained by HuffPost. A passing motorist summoned police, saying a little girl ran “in front of her car and jumped into it screaming she was being chased by a clown,” according to the police report.

He said he didn’t know Santiago, and said the man had fired a gun out the window.The little girl was still inside the home, afraid to come outside even after the officer explained the clown was her father wearing a mask.As the officer worked to calm the girl, Barrett and Santiago began yelling at one another, police said. Barrett was handcuffed after allegedly ignoring orders to back away from Santiago.Santiago’s son, who saw the girl burst inside, told police he had heard stories of people dressed as clowns and “got nervous and scared when he looked outside the window and saw a man with a clown mask on,” according to the police report.Police said Barrett told officers he “decided to use the clown mask into scaring [his daughter] to behave” because her mother was incarcerated for child abuse. Barrett said he “cannot discipline his daughter,” so “they have been having behavior problems with [her] at school and home.”The child was placed in the temporary care of her father’s girlfriend.Barrett and Santiago were released later Saturday to await court.

Police say the student approached officers with a knife around 11 p.m. on Saturday.Schultz appears emotionally distraught in bystander footage of the shooting. Officers can be heard repeatedly telling Schultz to “drop the knife,” but Schultz tells officers to shoot. At one point, someone says, “No one wants to hurt you, man.”In the graphic video below, Schultz can be seen continuing to approach the officers before a single gunshot rings out, followed by screams.Schultz’s mother, Lynne Schultz, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that her child had several medical issues, including depression, and had attempted suicide two years ago. But she said she doesn’t believe that Schultz was attempting “suicide by cop,” or provoking police into killing them.During a press conference alongside civil rights attorney L. Chris Stewart on Monday, Schultz’s family members questioned why officers didn’t use a Taser or mace and whether police had received training for interacting with people who are mentally disturbed. “Why did you have to shoot? Why did you kill my son?” Schultz’s father asked.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said it is now investigating the shooting.“Officers provided multiple verbal commands and attempted to speak with Schultz, who was not cooperative and would not comply with the officers’ commands,” the agency said in a statement on Sunday. “Schultz continued to advance on the officers with the knife. Subsequently, one officer fired striking Schultz.”Rates of depression and suicide are particularly high among members of the LGBTQ community, various studies have found.According to a 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey Report that surveyed 27,715 transgender people across the U.S., 40 percent of respondents reported having attempted suicide in their lifetime. That percentage is nearly nine times the overall attempted suicide rate in the U.S., which was 4.6 percent.“Respondents also encountered high levels of mistreatment when seeking health care,” the study found. “In the year prior to completing the survey, one-third (33%) of those who saw a health care provider had at least one negative experience related to being transgender, such as being verbally harassed or refused treatment because of their gender identity.”If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

After a day of rehearsal, Mr. Kelly spoke about Internet validation, humor, and how to know an audience is enjoying the show.Let’s talk about “Aliens Coming.” You’ve called the show a queer, campy, sci-fi satire, one that “explores the ideas of self-creation in our Internet age.” That, and alien invasion.There’s a little bit of genital harvesting, but it’s tastefully incorporated.What about the cultural force of YouTube drew you in?I’ve been obsessed with YouTubers and their audiences for a while now. The idea for the show started with my desire to explore that world and what spirals from there.I think the Internet is the funniest thing in the world. That we’re constantly exposed to these strangers, pumping out new content every day, has been insanely good for comedy. There was stuff on Vine that came from small-town kids, funnier than any film playing in theaters. I wanted to lean into that slightly alternative vein of comedy.As a playwright, how do you begin to capture that? One of the main focuses of the show is the attempt we make with our online personas, to substitute the attention of our followers for that of our real-life companions. Once [our team] leaned into the camp and decided that there would be alien characters, the show became weirder and weirder with each new draft.One of the show’s stars, Brandi, is a YouTube “celebrity” whose fame isn’t quite self-made… You mention the dangers of mixing social media with influence and power. What are some of the issues that emerge out of fandom?Well, the void we try to fill with likes and views only gets bigger the more likes and views flow in. I would say this builds toward a greater inability to connect and find fulfillment in the real world.“Aliens Coming” returns to the Peoples Improv Theater for a limited engagement through September, after a previously sold-out run. What are the rewards of breathing new life into your work?It’s my favorite feeling in the world. I love getting the actors involved in the creative process as early as possible. Having real voices and bodies adding nuance and dimension to the dialogue is unbelievably inspiring. It’s essential in making sure that characters who appear on stage are believable and relatable.“Aliens” has made a real impression on audiences. How would you describe the show’s latest reception?I’ve been very pleasantly surprised. I’m an extremely anxious person, I get wildly nervous before every show. But that melts away as soon as the audience starts laughing.It’s usually around the delivery of a certain joke — one about a character’s made-up Nepalese boyfriend — that I start to relax and feel like the audience is going to enjoy the show.Has this production come in above your own expectations?Absolutely. The music is a million times better than I ever thought it would be, and the actors are funny. I find myself laughing at lines I've already heard delivered so many times before.You’ve worked with three of your lead actors – Maia Scalia, Alice Kors, and Andrew L. Ricci – in past productions of “Aliens.” What makes them good actors for your work?The show is lucky to have such a talented cast. Every one of them is amazing. Maia, Alice, and Andrew have been with the production right from the very beginning, so they know the show inside out. At this point, they have informed so much of who their characters are.We've also had new cast members join us. The entire cast of “Aliens” is comprised of recent or current students at NYU Tisch, so they come with incredible training and experience. I'm sure they will go on to do some amazing things, so I feel lucky to watch them bring this show to life.How would you describe the show’s humor?I’ve been told that the show is similar in tone to “Rocky Horror” or “Little Shop of Horrors,” but I think I'm too close to the work to be the best judge of that. The show incorporates classic themes with some very current issues.They say, ""Write what you would want to watch."" A musical with songs anchored by big, poppy, Swedish-style melodies about sex-obsessed aliens and all-powerful, yet emotionally fragile YouTube stars, is exactly the type of show that I want to watch.This interview has been condensed and edited."

Once [our team] leaned into the camp and decided that there would be alien characters, the show became weirder and weirder with each new draft.One of the show’s stars, Brandi, is a YouTube “celebrity” whose fame isn’t quite self-made… You mention the dangers of mixing social media with influence and power. What are some of the issues that emerge out of fandom?Well, the void we try to fill with likes and views only gets bigger the more likes and views flow in. I would say this builds toward a greater inability to connect and find fulfillment in the real world.“Aliens Coming” returns to the Peoples Improv Theater for a limited engagement through September, after a previously sold-out run. What are the rewards of breathing new life into your work?It’s my favorite feeling in the world. I love getting the actors involved in the creative process as early as possible. Having real voices and bodies adding nuance and dimension to the dialogue is unbelievably inspiring. It’s essential in making sure that characters who appear on stage are believable and relatable.“Aliens” has made a real impression on audiences. How would you describe the show’s latest reception?I’ve been very pleasantly surprised. I’m an extremely anxious person, I get wildly nervous before every show. But that melts away as soon as the audience starts laughing.It’s usually around the delivery of a certain joke — one about a character’s made-up Nepalese boyfriend — that I start to relax and feel like the audience is going to enjoy the show.Has this production come in above your own expectations?Absolutely. The music is a million times better than I ever thought it would be, and the actors are funny. I find myself laughing at lines I've already heard delivered so many times before.You’ve worked with three of your lead actors – Maia Scalia, Alice Kors, and Andrew L. Ricci – in past productions of “Aliens.” What makes them good actors for your work?The show is lucky to have such a talented cast. Every one of them is amazing. Maia, Alice, and Andrew have been with the production right from the very beginning, so they know the show inside out. At this point, they have informed so much of who their characters are.We've also had new cast members join us. The entire cast of “Aliens” is comprised of recent or current students at NYU Tisch, so they come with incredible training and experience. I'm sure they will go on to do some amazing things, so I feel lucky to watch them bring this show to life.How would you describe the show’s humor?I’ve been told that the show is similar in tone to “Rocky Horror” or “Little Shop of Horrors,” but I think I'm too close to the work to be the best judge of that. The show incorporates classic themes with some very current issues.They say, ""Write what you would want to watch."" A musical with songs anchored by big, poppy, Swedish-style melodies about sex-obsessed aliens and all-powerful, yet emotionally fragile YouTube stars, is exactly the type of show that I want to watch.This interview has been condensed and edited."

She and her mom and younger sister would often temporarily escape in the middle of the night, sometimes to their grandmother’s home. Murry-Drobot was 7 when the three of them fled for the final time. But their problems didn’t stop there.They lived in public housing and struggled financially. Murry-Drobot’s mom had to trek a long distance to her low-wage job, and most of their money went toward car and gas payments. Murry-Drobot nearly failed the second grade. She often didn’t have enough to eat and the family moved around a lot. She was shy and unsure of herself until college, she told HuffPost.While domestic violence can affect people in any income bracket, low-income women are particularly vulnerable because their poverty makes escaping that much more challenging. When they consider leaving their relationship, they will often think about the financial tradeoffs and how they’ll feed their children without their partner’s support, for example.About 75 percent of victims earn less than $20,000 a year, according to Murry-Drobot.

These are the consequences of scapegoating communities for political gain. It makes the job of rescue and law enforcement agencies harder because people are justifiably afraid to seek help if they think that they will be targeted for deportation if they do so.Unfortunately, the same story is repeating itself as Florida deals with Hurricane Irma and the destruction that the storm has left in its wake. In Polk County, Sheriff Grady Judd is facing a lawsuit after vowing to check IDs at shelters, in an effort to catch people with outstanding warrants who were seeking refuge from an approaching category 5 hurricane.“If you go to a shelter for #Irma, be advised: sworn LEOs will be at every shelter, checking IDs. Sex offenders/predators will not be allowed,” Judd said in a tweet.The prospect of evacuation shelters being turned into the equivalent of pedestrian checkpoints scared residents from neighboring counties like Apopka, who often live in trailer homes that are especially susceptible to hurricane winds, into putting themselves at risk by not seeking refuge from the storm.In Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties, residents were asked for proof of residence in the aftermath of the storm before they could access areas which were hit hard, like the Florida Keys or Miami Beach. This effectively left folks who do not have ID unable to reach their homes until these checkpoints were lifted, sometimes leaving them stranded or unable to access important items such as needed medication.The Florida Immigrant Coalition sent Governor Rick Scott a letter urging him to release an official statement clarifying that immigrants seeking refuge would not be targeted for their immigration status or country of birth. It’s time that elected officials in Florida go beyond that and grant a driver’s license to undocumented immigrants or at the very least, municipal ID’s as a form of protection against the harsh anti-immigrant policies stemming from the federal government.Just like the people of Texas, Florida now needs to focus on rebuilding in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. The healing process will only be hampered by the criminalization and persecution of immigrant communities. These times of crisis highlight the need for Florida’s elected leaders to step up and take concrete steps to protect immigrants living in the state.Thomas Kennedy is a communications fellow for the Center for Community Change."

In three previous years, 5,000 policemen were there to protect a few hundred Pride March participants from possible violence and bashing that was seen before. This year, there were more visitors and less policemen, but still the same security measures ― the city’s downtown was in lockdown during the three-hour event.Around 1,000 in total attended ― including a few local politicians and MPs, openly lesbian prime minister Ana Brnabic, a few ambassadors, many foreign and local activists, many straight allies ― but the Serbian LGBTQ people themselves were the least represented group present. A small truck with fierce local queen Alex Electra led the colorful crowd through Belgrade city center and ended with a short party on the city’s main square. One person was arrested for “preparing acts against constitutional order and security of Serbia.”The Pride March itself went well, but what is the position of LGBTQ community and state of human rights in Serbia during the remaining 364 days of the year?Most of the queer people in Belgrade and Serbia are too scared to attend the Pride March, which is why messages that resonated among guests and speakers included, “We are walking for those who can not join us” and “you are not alone.” There are almost no publicly out celebrities and many queer people are still struggling with violence and repression on an everyday basis while state institutions and most of the media fail to address the matter.In Serbia, holding hands with your same-sex partner or just wearing a rainbow flag in public might cause a physical attack and harassment. Yet, not one case of violence and harassment of LGBTQ people has been positively resolved this year, local LGBT organization DaSeZna reports. People are afraid to even report attackers and abusers because usually the alleged attackers are released or not prosecuted as they should be. Quite often the victims face institutional discrimination when they try to report the incident or revenge from their perpetrators.There are also no same-sex partnerships available even after years of lobbying for a law that would regulate them and help gay and lesbian couples to get the same rights as straight couples ― rights like visiting their partners in the hospital, the right to inherit property, and the right to raise a bank credit. The same goes for gender identity laws ― transgender people are facing many existential problems, as well as troubles with obtaining IDs, education, employment and health care.For years now, the LGBTQ community in Serbia has hoped to see the government delivering legislative changes helping same-sex couples or transgender individuals, but things haven’t moved much beyond empty promises. Serbian politicians keep repeating how “we have gone a long way” and assuring the public that “the government will respect the rights of all citizens, both the majority and minorities,” like PM Brnabic said ahead of Belgrade’s 4th Pride March. Unfortunately, this sounds like the broken record the LGBTQ community has been listening to for years.As Serbia is an European Union membership candidate, improving the protection of minorities and vulnerable groups is one of the conditions that has to be met before it can join the Union. But it seems like these EU demands are only met on paper or in empty promises. This kind of Pride March is only good for the government, activist Predrag Azdejkovic claims, as it sends a message that everything is fine and that the government is doing its job while in reality things are quite grim. One minute of reading the comments on Serbian news portals about the Pride March will be more than enough to conclude the kind of danger and hostility LGBTQ people face every day. “Put them in gas chambers,” “Kill them all,” “You are sick and perverted,” are just a few of the choice quotes.What is interesting is that, Ana Brnabic was appointed as PM by Serbia’s former prime minister, now-president Aleksandar Vucic. For a homophobic country such as Serbia, this was quite a controversial political move, but the question remains - is this just an act of pink-washing or is the government really ready to help and protect the LGBTQ community?The Pride March in Serbia is an isolated even, but still the most visible event for the LGBTQ community. There are some positive improvements. We’re smelling the roses. Still, Pride in Serbia seems like a colorful bubble of freedom, where LGBTQ people are safe to express themselves and be who they are ― but only until the end of the party. For the rest of the year, when there aren’t thousands of armed policemen to protect them, queer people in Serbia remain mostly invisible, hiding from bashing, hate speech and discrimination. Until things really start to get better, we must continue to fight for change and freedom.Feel the atmosphere in the photos below."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c00f0b1900002500564600.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Model and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen is well-known for her hilarious, outspoken responses to would-be shamers on social media. In a recent interview, her husband and co-parent, John Legend, pointed out the sexist double standard around the phenomenon of mom shaming. Legend told Today Parents he feels guilty about the amount of criticism Teigen has to deal with, and explains the unfair nature of how moms are treated versus dads. “I think the expectation from the general public is that the mom is more responsible for raising the child, and I think there’s more of a culture around mommy shaming than there is around dad shaming,” he said. “So Chrissy has to deal with it more.”The 38-year-old musician has pointed out the unfair level of criticism that moms face before. In 2016, when the couple went out to dinner shortly after the birth of their daughter, Luna, Teigen tweeted several screenshots of comments from people lambasting her for leaving her young child at home. Legend responded with another pitch-perfect critique of mommy-shaming culture, tweeting, “Funny there’s no dad-shaming. When both of us go out to dinner, shame both of us so Chrissy doesn’t have to take it all. We’ll split it.” For her part, Teigen told Today in August that despite her brassy clapbacks, the mom-shaming comments bother her. “It gets to me every time,” she said, citing incidents where she was shamed for letting her daughter wear “chemical-laden” jelly shoes and for eating cereal while pregnant. “You realize you’re going to get it no matter what, and it started when I was pregnant,” she said. “If I seem like I don’t care, I definitely care.”"
41,POLITICS,Trump Still Hasn't Officially Declared The Opioid Crisis A National Emergency,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-opioid-crisis-national-emergency_us_59bfc03fe4b0edff971d8759,"More than a month ago, Trump announced he was ""drawing documents now"" to tackle ""a serious problem, the likes of which we have never had.""",2017-09-18,"Trump, with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price (L), being briefed on the opioid crisis in August.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c00d791c0000240079f0c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― More than a month after President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced that he would declare a national emergency on the opioid crisis, he has yet to make it official.Trump designated this week Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week ― something his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, also did to draw attention to the addiction crisis.But it is mostly a symbolic measure. Declaring the national emergency, by contrast, would allocate more federal funding to state and local officials dealing with the crisis and pressure lawmakers to take more long-term steps.“The opioid crisis is an emergency, and I’m saying officially right now it is an emergency. It’s a national emergency,” Trump said on Aug. 10, before adding that he was “drawing documents now” to make the official declaration.Trump’s description of the crisis as “a serious problem, the likes of which we have never had,” was seemingly made off-the-cuff, just two days after Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said the administration believed the epidemic “can be addressed without the declaration of an emergency.”Later that day, the White House released a statement affirming that Trump had issued instructions “to use all appropriate emergency and other authorities to respond to the crisis caused by the opioid epidemic.”But since then, the administration hasn’t said when Trump will make the official declaration and what that would entail.Public health officials in a number of states ravaged by the crisis, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, say they have yet to hear from the White House on specific guidance.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters last week that Trump was “absolutely taking [the declaration] very seriously,” attributing the delay to administrative and legal matters.“The commission and members of the administration have continued to meet and work on the details of that national declaration. And that’s certainly a big priority for the administration, and we’ll continue to focus on pushing that through,” she said. “It’s a much more involved process, and that’s something that they’re working through on the legal side, the administrative side, and making sure that it’s done correctly.”On Thursday, Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.), who chairs the White House’s opioid commission, said that there was no timeline for when Trump would officially make the emergency declaration, explaining that the president is “awaiting the best advice that is very soon to come to him.”Price similarly provided no details in New Hampshire on Thursday, when he announced more federal grants to help community health centers address substance abuse and mental health issues.“The president has talked recently about raising the level of the opioid crisis to an emergency, and we’re working on that with his staff, literally as we speak, to bring greater clarity and focus to that,” Price said.It is unclear how the national emergency declaration would be implemented, as the action is usually designed for addressing short-term epidemics and natural disasters, not long-term public health problems like the opioid crisis.“We’re understanding that, as we see the urgency placed upon these other national disasters, we need to appreciate that there’s an urgency around this national disaster that merits the same comprehensive approach,” former Rep. Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.), a member of the White House opioid commission, said on Thursday.But administration officials have said that relief efforts for recent natural disasters like hurricanes Harvey and Irma may limit the availability of funding to stem the opioid crisis.Declaring a national emergency was among the White House opioid commission’s extensive list of recommendations in July. The panel also suggested measures to expand treatment options and to improve medical education on addiction. Trump has not said whether he will implement any of those proposals.More broadly, members of his administration have sent mixed messages on drug policy. Despite pledging compassion for victims of the opioid crisis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has proposed an aggressive approach to drug enforcement, and Trump’s pick to head the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.), has called for more criminalization of drug use, which could undermine efforts to treat addiction as a public health issue.The White House commission met again on Monday, with Christie holding a press conference to announce a partnership between the National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical companies.Asked about the delay, Christie said White House officials “want to make sure they get it right.” He added that Trump is “waiting for his staff to come up with the appropriate way to do this,” and noted that the declaration was “an unprecedented move.”“The president and I speak regularly, and every time we speak, we talk about this issue,” Christie said. “And he is completely resolved to this being done.” This article has been updated with additional comments from Christie on Monday afternoon."

Murray has been an outspoken advocate for women in tennis over the years, regularly calling out sexist questions from reporters. Murray wrote that many people were surprised by his choice to work with Amelie Mauresmo, a former professional tennis player from France who coached Murray between 2014 and 2016. During his time with Mauresmo, Murray said he realized sexism played a large part in the way she was treated day-to-day.Since then, Murray wrote he’s found it hard to not speak up about gender equality.“I have been asked about women’s equality and I would find it hard to look any of the top female tennis players in the eye if I did not speak my mind,” he wrote. “People often underestimate the amount of work that it takes to become a top tennis player. And that work ethic is the same whether you are a man or a woman.”Murray added that female athletes make the same sacrifices and put in just as much work as male athletes. “Anyone who has spent any time with any of the top women will know that they make those same sacrifices and are as determined and committed to winning as any of the top men on the tour,” he wrote.Murray finished on a positive note, writing that the sport has more female role models and commentators than ever before: “Things are moving in a positive direction and I am excited about a future in which the playing field might be level for all.”Head over to BBC to read Murray’s full essay."
43,POLITICS,"That Climate 'Scandal' Rep. Lamar Smith Promoted Was, Indeed, Fake News",Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daily-mail-climate-data-inaccurate-lamar-smith_us_59bfcbc4e4b086432b08a296,A U.K. media watchdog has ruled on the inaccuracy of a story published by the Daily Mail and promoted by the GOP congressman from Texas.,2017-09-18,Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) has a history of attacking federal climate scientists. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c010701900003a00564605.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), an early and loyal supporter of President Donald Trump, likes to make noise about the liberal media’s coverage of climate change, often dismissing it as “fake news.” In February, however, this vocal denier of near-universally accepted climate science promoted a story about a climate data manipulation scandal that is about as flawed as they come. The British tabloid The Daily Mail was forced to run a lengthy statement acknowledging the inaccuracies of a story it claimed to be “the biggest scientific scandal since ‘Climategate.’” The publication “failed to take care over the accuracy of the article” or correct “significantly misleading statements,” according to a statement released this week from the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), a media watchdog in the United Kingdom.The story was published in February with the headline, “Exposed: How World Leaders Were Duped Into Investing Billions Over Manipulated Global Warming Data.” In it, journalist David Rose wrote that “high-level whistleblower” John Bates, a retired scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, had revealed that the federal agency “breached its own rules on scientific integrity” when it published a “sensational but flawed report” that “exaggerated global warming and was timed to influence the historic Paris Agreement on climate change.”Convinced that NOAA cooked its books, Rep. Smith pounced on the opportunity. In a press release titled, “Former NOAA Scientist Confirms Colleagues Manipulated Climate Records,” as well as a series of Twitter posts, the chair of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology accused the federal agency ― yet again ― of playing “fast and loose” with data and the Obama administration of pushing its “costly climate agenda.”The 2015 study, led by NOAA scientist Thomas Karl and published in the journal Science, found that an apparent slowing trend, or hiatus, in the rate of global warming from 1998 to 2012 was the result of its own biased data. The agency corrected its analysis to account for differences between ships’ measurements and those of more accurate at-sea buoys, which increased the estimated rate of warming over the previous 15 years.At a committee hearing two days after The Daily Mail’s story came out — a hearing that was supposed to focus on “Making EPA Great Again” — Smith blasted NOAA scientists, who he said “cheated and got caught,” and demanded the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) “redact” the NOAA study. Bates later took issue with the Daily Mail story, telling E&E News that “the issue here is not an issue of tampering with data, but rather really of timing of a release of a paper that had not properly disclosed everything it was.” And AAAS chief executive Rush Holt, a former member of Congress from New Jersey, told Smith at the committee hearing that the Daily Mail story is “not the making of a big scandal.” “This is an internal dispute between two factions within an agency,” he said. “There’s nothing in the paper, the Karl paper, that at our current analysis suggests retraction.”Reached via email on Monday, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology spokeswoman Thea McDonald said that IPSO’s criticisms of the Daily Mail story “focused on Mr. Rose’s characterization of Dr. Bates’ concerns — its investigation did not assess Dr. Bates’ legitimate questions about the integrity of the data included in the Karl study in any way.” McDonald added that the Science committee’s probe into the matter “has always been about getting to the bottom of whistleblowers’ concerns about the data underlying the Karl study.”“The facts of the committee’s investigation, which began more than a year before the Daily Mail article was published, remain unchanged,” she wrote. “Obama administration NOAA officials repeatedly obstructed congressional oversight requests, including a subpoena, which agency officials refused to comply with before finally beginning to produce some responsive documents. The committee looks forward to receiving the remaining requested documents and conducting an objective review.”Smith’s February statement thanking Bates for “courageously stepping forward to tell the truth about NOAA’s senior officials playing fast and loose with the data in order to meet a politically predetermined conclusion” remains unchanged on his congressional website. McDonald did not answer HuffPost’s question about whether he planned to remove it.From the get-go, the Daily Mail story received widespread criticism. Smith has yet to acknowledge that independent researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, published a study that it says confirms the accuracy of the Karl paper, further eroding a favorite argument among climate deniers.The GOP congressman, who has received more than $700,000 in donations from the oil and gas industry since 1989, has been on a years-long crusade ― or “witch hunt,” as some have called it ― to discredit all-but-universally accepted climate science. In 2015, after NOAA published its study updating the global temperature record, Smith harassed agency scientists, issuing subpoenas to obtain communications related to their analysis. He has also used his power as chairman of the science committee to push his anti-science views, and gone as far as to argue that pumping the atmosphere full of carbon dioxide is “beneficial” to global trade, crop production and the lushness of the planet."

But President <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/barack-obama"">Barack Obama</a> and China’s President Xi Jinping didn’t think so. A year before the international community achieved the Paris climate accord, the two nations entered into a historic bilateral agreement to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c02c741a00001400f074f1.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As international leaders gathered in New York for this week’s meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, they got another taste of the Trump Administration’s leadership style. It can be summed up in one word: confusion. Sometimes it appears to be a result of ineptitude; other times it appears to be tactical.The latest example is the ongoing drama about the historic climate agreement that 195 nations achieved in Paris nearly two years ago. Each participating country including the United States submitted a plan on how it would reduce its climate-altering greenhouse gas pollution.Then came the election of Donald Trump. After months of intrigue about what he might do, Trump announced in June that the United States plans to withdraw from the accord “unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country.” It seemed that Trump left the door open to reversing his decision.Recent events have offered a good opportunity for Trump to do so. Steve Bannon, the senior advisor who reportedly pressed Trump to withdraw from the accord, has left the White House. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma showed with unprecedented fury that global warming is putting Americans in greater jeopardy by making storms more destructive. And the current convergence of world leaders on New York gives them another opportunity to lobby Trump to reverse his position.As last weekend began, the Wall Street Journal reported “The Trump administration is considering staying in the Paris agreement to fight climate change ‘under the right conditions,’ offering to re-engage in the international deal…” The White House shot down the story by responding that the president’s intentions have not changed.Then while appearing on CBS’s Face the Nation Sunday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reiterated that “the President said he’s open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others…”It was the latest example of the bewilderment Trump has created about whether or not the world’s second biggest source of climate-altering pollution plans to do anything about it.First, with his seemingly provisional withdrawal decision last June, Trump used one of his deal-making gambits. He announced an extreme position but hinted he was willing to negotiate. In reality, there is no deal to be made and no interest among other nations to reopen an agreement that took the world 20 years to achieve. It appears that Trump’s real purpose was to please his base while blunting criticism with the hint that he might change his mind.Second, it is clear even now that Trump and his people do not understand the Paris accord. They seem not to have read it. It calls for voluntary commitments from nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. If Trump feels the climate action plan President Obama submitted under the Paris accord was somehow disadvantageous to the country, he could simply submit a new plan. Instead, Trump hopes to show that he is standing up to the world community on behalf of America’s interests.Tillerson exhibited his lack of understanding when he said Sunday, “if you look at those targets and terms of the Paris climate accord, they were just really out of balance for the two largest economies.” He presumably was talking about China and the United States, who are also the world’s two largest carbon polluters.However, the commitments that China and the United States submitted under the Paris accord reflected a historic bilateral agreement that the two nations announced in November 2014. On Sept. 3, 2016, President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China jointly reaffirmed their commitments to the Paris deal “offering a rare display of harmony,” as the New York Times put it.So, Tillerson’s perception that the Paris accord is not good for China or the United States was not shared by the two nation’s leaders. Nor, I assume, is it shared by the hundreds of businesses and investors who urged Trump to remain in the pact.Other history contradicts the idea that the United States signed onto an “out of balance” deal. In 1997, most nations signed the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement under which developed but not developing nations committed to reduce their carbon pollution. The premise was that the industrial economies were most responsible for the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and that developing countries needed to continue using fossil fuels for the immediate future to grow their economies.The U.S. Senate, whose “advice and consent” was necessary before President Clinton could ratify the Protocol, signaled that it would not concur. It approved a resolution saying that it would not consent to any agreement that did not also include greenhouse gas reductions by developing nations. As a result, President Clinton did not bother to submit the Protocol to the Senate and in March 2001, President Bush announced officially that the U.S. would not participate.That is one of the reasons why after 10 more years of negotiations, the Paris accord calls for all nations – large, small, rich, poor, developed and developing ― to reduce their emissions.Third, Trump’s conditional willingness to reengage in international climate action is belied by the fact that he has laid waste to the federal government’s ability to influence America’s carbon pollution. The United States would return to the table with little or nothing to offer in regard to our own substantial emissions.Whether or not it’s intentional, Trump often leaves the international community and the American people confused. But the evidence shows that the greatest confusion is in the White House itself, even on one of the world’s most important and precedent-setting global agreements."

The party has seen a surge in recent week, despite being mired in political scandal and infighting throughout the year.The AfD’s potential success at the polls this weekend is a major shift for Germany, highlighting how deeply populist far-right movements have engrained themselves in European politics even as they fail to actually win elections. This year has seen the collapse of the far-right narrative that a populist wave ― along the lines of the U.K.’s Brexit vote and the 2016 election of U.S. President Donald Trump ― would overtake European governments. Far-right candidates such as the Netherland’s Geert Wilders and France’s Marine Le Pen have instead fallen short in their respective elections, and the AfD is certain to be shut out of any potential coalition government.But even as the majority of voters in European countries still oppose far-right candidates, many right wing populist parties have reached unprecedented levels of support. Around a third of French voters wanted Le Pen to be president, for instance, a tally that would have been unthinkable many years ago.“We’re still in an upward trend” for European populist parties, said Terri Givens, a professor at Menlo College and an expert on the radical right. “This is the strongest we’ve seen any far-right party in [post-war] Germany.”  Even the moderate success of the AfD represents a fracture of Germany’s political landscape. Since 1945, the country has essentially rejected far-right parties, in large part because of the devastating legacy of Nazism and the country’s culture of acknowledging the atrocities committed under fascist rule.But the AfD, which was founded in 2013 as an anti-eurozone party before shifting further to the right, has seen it’s popularity grow in recent years as it plays to nationalist and anti-Islam sentiment. The effects on political debate in Germany have been destabilizing and brought once-taboo, radical views into the mainstream discourse.AfD candidates have repeatedly challenged Germany’s continued atonement for its past and still maintained popularity. Last week, one of the party’s lead candidates, 76-year-old Alexander Gauland, said the country has the right to be proud of the “achievements” of its soldiers in both world wars.Earlier in the year, regional leader Bjorn Hocke called for a “180 degree turnaround in our memory politics” and referred to Berlin’s Holocaust memorial as a “monument to shame.” The AfD’s extreme rhetoric has drawn widespread outrage from established parties, with German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel comparing the party’s candidates to Nazis ― a rare and serious accusation in German politics. Germany’s parliament even changed a rule that the oldest member of the chamber gives an opening speech following the election, a move seen as a way to ensure that 77-year-old AfD candidate Wilhelm von Gottberg cannot hold the honor. As the vote on Sunday approaches, the AfD has embraced some of its more extreme and Islamophobic talking points in a bid to stir up more support. The AfD held a press conference on Monday, in which Gauland and co-leader Alice Weidel claimed that Islam was incompatible with German democracy, called for increased border security to target migration and vowed to tighten rules around citizenship.There is little chance that the AfD will be allowed to implement its policies, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to easily win her fourth term in office and form a coalition government that would exclude the far-right party. But the certainty around Merkel’s reelection has potentially buoyed the AfD, with supporters voicing discontent with the continuation of the political status quo.A large part of the AfD’s rhetoric has also focused on attacking Merkel and her decision to let in hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers during the height of Europe’s refugee crisis in 2015. Although asylum numbers have dramatically fallen since then and support for Merkel remains strong, polls show issues around immigration, integration and refugees are still the top concern for voters in the election.If the AfD lives up to polling predictions and manages to gain around 10 percent of the vote, it will have dozens of members in Germany’s 703-seat parliament. The party would also find itself in a position familiar to other far-right parties in Europe, dragging policy and debate to the right while its position as an opposition party means it doesn’t have to figure out how to implement its ideas.

47,ARTS & CULTURE,"Merriam-Webster Isn't Trolling You, It's Just Redefining What That Means",Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/merriam-webster-new-words-troll-alt-right-dog-whistle_us_59bff90fe4b06f9bf04863d4,The language of 2017 is a depressing reminder of how bad things are.,2017-09-18,"Neo Nazis, Alt-Right, and White Supremacists encircle counter protestors at the base of a statue of Thomas Jefferson after marching through the University of Virginia campus with torches in Charlottesville, Va., USA on August 11, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bfff3c1c0000240079f070.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Language is a living, evolving thing ― and when our society moves in ugly directions, so must our language.Merriam-Webster just added hundreds of words to its online dictionary, including an online-harassment definition of “troll” and several others that remind us of America’s sorry state.“Troll” had a life before 4chan and Reddit: It used to be a whimsical term for a folkloric monster, or even a verb for searching or fishing. Now, the first action it suggests, at least to Internet users, is, as Merriam-Webster puts it, “to antagonize (others) online by deliberately posting inflammatory, irrelevant, or offensive comments or other disruptive content,” or “to harass, criticize, or antagonize (someone) especially by provocatively disparaging or mocking public statements, postings, or acts.”Trolling has become such a pervasive issue online that it’s inarguably spilled into the real world ― take the racist Pepe the Frog memes and other far-right online trolling, which helped spread white supremacist sentiments that ultimately bolstered Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.That leads us to another word just added to Merriam-Webster.com: “alt-right.” The newly dictionary-approved term doesn’t mince words in its definition, which calls it “a right-wing, primarily online political movement [...] whose members reject mainstream conservative politics and espouse extremist beliefs and policies typically centered on ideas of white nationalism.”It’s a vague-sounding term, and is alternately denied and embraced by its purported leaders, like Milo Yiannopoulos. When we think about rightwing trolling and Pepe the Frog memes, we’re usually thinking of the “alt-right,” basically a white supremacist movement gestated on message boards and propagated through deliberately inflammatory memes. The political definition of “dog whistle” also made the cut at last, though it’s perhaps less relevant than it’s been in a while. Merriam-Webster defines it as “an expression or statement that has a secondary meaning intended to be understood only by a particular group of people.” Often, the secondary meaning is derogatory or damaging toward a marginalized group, while the apparent surface meaning of the statement provides political cover against charges of racism or sexism. For example, politicians might rail against food stamps ― while their real mission is to gin up outrage among white listeners that poor, non-white Americans are eating up tax dollars. In the era of the “alt-right,” which often flaunts its racist messages, dog whistles might no longer be the only way to insert bigoted ideas into the mainstream political discourse, though they’re still frequently deployed. That’s not to say that all the new Merriam-Webster words are grim reminders of our current political swamp. We also welcome “sriracha” and “pregaming” ― what could be more fun than that?"

She, her husband Nasir Ahmed, their two young sons and about a dozen other refugees boarded a small fishing boat crossing the Bay of Bengal to the Bangladesh village of Shah Porir Dwip, Reuters reported.The photo below was taken when the family arrived in Teknaf, Bangladesh after their boat capsized. She survived, but Abdul Masood, her 40-day-old infant, did not.“I rushed to the spot and found people crying over the dead body of a child,” Reuters photographer Mohammad Ponir Hossain said.Hamida’s and Nasir Ahmed’s horror mirrors ones that thousands of families have experienced in recent weeks following recent unrest in the area. The Rohingya community, an ethnic minority in Myanmar, have been persecuted for decades, but violence flared up last month after Rohingya militants attacked local police posts. Local government forces responded with a widespread crackdown of Rohingya villages across the northwest part of the country, pillaging villages, leaving hundreds dead and threatening thousands more.More than 400,000 Rohingya people have fled Myanmar into Bangladesh. Some of the refugees have recounted the scenes of carnage they left behind in Rakhine state. “We were all watching what the military did,” Soe Win, a 10th-grade teacher, told The Washington Post from Ukhia, Bangladesh. “They slaughtered them one by one. And the blood flowed in the streets.”Bangladesh’s government announced Sunday that it plans to build shelters capable of accommodating 400,000 people in the next ten days. The refugees won’t be allowed outside the camps, the government said.Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi has drawn international condemnation over her response to the violence, which she has dismissed as being the product of “a huge iceberg of misinformation.”Suu Kyi is expected to address the issue on Tuesday in a televised speech to the United Nations General Assembly, which meets this week in New York. She said last week that she would not be attending the gathering in person due to the crisis.U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the BBC on Sunday that the address is Suu Kyi’s “last chance” to put an end to the violence.“If she does not reverse the situation now, then I think the tragedy will be absolutely horrible, and unfortunately then I don’t see how this can be reversed in the future,” Guterres warned.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch has called for targeted sanctions and an arms embargo on Myanmar’s military.“Burmese security forces are committing ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya and disregarding the condemnation of world leaders,” said John Sifton, HRW’s Asia advocacy director. “The time has come to impose tougher measures that Burma’s generals cannot ignore.”"

As stars arrived at the festivities, the official Twitter account for the Television Academy, which presents the award shows every year, was live-tweeting from the red carpet. Naturally, someone sent out a tweet congratulating RuPaul Charles on scoring a second nomination for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program. Except, instead of posting a photo of the legendary drag queen, they shared a of picture of musical director Rickey Minor, who’s worked with stars like Beyoncé and Alicia Keyes on their tours, according to BuzzFeed. Whoever was running the Television Academy’s account quickly deleted the tweet and shared the correct photo of RuPaul, who already picked up the prize for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program at the Creative Arts Emmys last week.

Your silence on this is sending a confusing and damaging message to both LGBTQ students who are affirming as well as to those who have chosen celibacy.The Nashville Statement says, “WE DENY that adopting a homosexual or transgender self-conception is consistent with God’s holy purposes in creation and redemption.” (Article 7). This means that the Biola professors who have signed this are opposed to anyone claiming an LGBTQ identity.Yet Biola University has an approved campus group called, “Sustinere,” specifically driven to “create a safe space” for students navigating through same-sex attraction while allowing students to identify as gay and Christian.Sustinere’s website states:“This group, entitled Sustinere, will seek to provide a caring and supportive community where students can journey together as they learn to live authentically and lovingly with same-sex attractions, orientations and identities.Led by staff/faculty advisors and student leaders, the group will aspire to be a safe space for students who experience enduring same-­sex attractions or identify as having a same­-sex sexual orientation or identity.”The group’s creator and Associate Dean of Students at Biola, Matthew Hooper, is quoted as saying about this group: “[Sustinere]... faces the realities of LGB students on a Christian campus and equips them to be leaders holding onto their own convictions.”Biola’s policy on Sexuality and Relationships acknowledges that students may self-identify as Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual:“Biola University believes that students are best supported if they are able to share their questions, struggles, or their self-understanding with trusted others, including those in Student Development. Concerns about sexuality may be difficult to disclose, but struggling in silence is a far greater challenge. In all such personal issues, Student Development staff members are committed to discretion, sensitivity, confidentiality, compassion, and redemption.”Furthermore, the policy addresses the historical mistreatment of LGBTQ people and encourages compassion rather than speech that diminishes one’s identity.“We do lament the insensitive and often callous treatment that students working through these issues [same- sex behavior, same-sex attraction and/or sexual orientation] may have received from the Christian community. All members of the Biola Community are expected to treat one another with respect and Christ-like compassion. Insults, slurs and other forms of derogatory speech have no place in a Christian community. Through faculty & staff training, peer education and example we seek to educate staff and students about the harm caused by disrespectful or flippant speech around this topic.Due to the complexity of issues related to same-sex behavior, same-sex attraction and sexual orientation, we are committed to engaging this conversation with courage, humility, prayerfulness and care. We believe, in accordance with Scripture, that we are all broken. Therefore, a primary goal of Student Development at Biola is to help each student find God in the midst of their unique history and struggles and discern how to walk with Him and others along the way.”Biola’s stated policy on Sexuality and Relationships is completely incongruent to the wholly derogatory nature of the Nashville Statement and its assertion that its theological view is the only correct one regarding homosexuality and being transgender. (Article 10 of the Nashville Statement)Dr. Corey, the fact that you remain silent about the claims made within the Nashville Statement and remain silent about your professors who signed the Nashville Statement, who are clearly in a position of authority within teaching, mentoring, and pastoring at Biola, is incredibly incongruent with your stated goals. If the “primary goal of Student Development at Biola is to help each student find God in the midst of their unique history and struggles and discern how to walk with Him and others along the way,” we ask that you would publicly disavow the Nashville Statement so that Biola can fulfill its stated intention towards the LGBTQ community.In faith,Biolans’ Equal GroundBiola University professors who are signatories and signers of the Nashville Statement; K.

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iceland-government-collapse_us_59bddeb2e4b02da0e1427d63,"Meanwhile, Brexit is destabilizing the region, Donald Trump is rattling NATO and China is flexing its muscles.",2017-09-17,"Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson arrives at the presidential residence in Bessastadir, Iceland, on Saturday. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bddf731a00007100f070b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"REYKJAVIK, Iceland ― Iceland’s government has collapsed amid uproar over Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson’s father helping expunge the criminal record of a convicted child rapist. The centrist Bright Future party dropped out of the three-party, conservative coalition, eliminating its one-seat parliamentary majority. Benediktsson called a snap election on Friday as protesters gathered near the parliament building in this city’s posh downtown area. “We have lost the majority, and I don’t see anything that indicates we can regain that,” Benediktsson said Friday at a press conference. “I am calling an election.”The party blamed Benediktsson for failing to inform the government that his father wrote a letter recommending a pardon for Hjalti Sigurjón Hauksson. Hauksson was convicted in 2004 of raping his stepdaughter almost daily for 12 years, starting when she was 5 years old. He served nearly six years in prison, but was granted “restored honor” last August ― a legal status encoded in old Icelandic law that allows criminals who receive three letters of recommendation speaking to their good character to have their records wiped clean and go on to serve in public office or work as an attorney. Hauksson’s victim described the pardon as “surreal” and said he continues to harass her in text messages and phone calls, according to The Reykjavík Grapevine, an English-language newspaper in Iceland. The election is scheduled for Oct. 28. Despite the scandal, Benediktsson could return to power.The Independence Party leader refused to step down as the nation’s finance minister after his name appeared in the Panama Papers last year, despite 60 percent of Icelanders calling for his departure. The leaked cache of financial documents showed he once owned part of an offshore investment firm in the Seychelles. Then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned two days after reporters began publishing the documents, as an estimated 6.6 percent of Iceland’s population took to the streets in protest. The tree-lined square near the parliament building was quiet on Saturday night, as well-heeled tourists dined at the neighborhood’s trendy restaurants and drank in its pubs. Yet the disintegration of the coalition ― which had been in power for just nine months ― comes at a particularly sensitive time for the island nation of less than 335,000 people. “Iceland needs to remain a functioning country despite the crisis at election time,” Damien Degeorges, a Reykjavik-based international consultant, told HuffPost on Saturday evening. “There’s no room for putting things on hold because you’re waiting on a new government.”The head of the legislature, called the Alþingi, canceled a budget debate Friday after the government disbanded, and no other sessions were listed on its official website. Birgitta Jónsdóttir, a parliamentarian from the anarchist Pirate Party, told HuffPost on Sunday that she was fighting to convene lawmakers at least one more time before the legislative session officially ended. “The parliament is supposed to be a safety valve in regard to the executive branch,” she said in a phone interview, during which she jokingly derided Benediktsson as the “crime minister.”“We still have pending bills and resolutions that need to be ratified,” she added. “It’s time-sensitive stuff.”Top party officials are scheduled to meet Monday morning to discuss plans to move forward, she said. Alþingi President Unnur Brá Konráðsdóttir did not immediately respond to a call and email requesting comment on Sunday. Iceland emerged from a deep financial crisis in 2011 to a tourism-fueled economic boom. The country is set to welcome a record 2.3 million visitors this year, a 30 percent surge from 2016. The economy expanded 7.2 percent last year. In March, the government lifted capital controls put in place nine years ago after three banks failed and sent the country spiraling into its great recession. Cranes dot the skyline, a sign of rapid housing construction.But Iceland’s recovery, hailed by some as a miracle, has made it a critical player in the drama over Britain’s exit from the European Union. The United Kingdom was Iceland’s second-largest trading partner in 2015, buying $611 million of the country’s roughly $5.4 billion in exports. Iceland is not a member of the EU, but it participates in the European Free Trade Association alongside Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.Icelandic Foreign Minister Guðlaugur Thór Thórðarson extended an olive branch to the British during an interview on BBC Radio 4 earlier this month. The British risk being penalized by France and Germany in Brexit negotiations.“Everyone wants to make a free-trade deal with Britain,” he said. “You are the fifth-largest economy in the world. Everyone wants to sell you goods and services. It’s as simple as that.”Without a stable government in Iceland, British Prime Minister Theresa May appears even more alone. Her political mandate shattered after the Labour Party’s surprise surge in the election.“Iceland needs to be functioning well for this period,” Degeorges said.Despite its size, Iceland has long played an outsize role in international affairs. It hosted the famed 1986 summit between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Union premier Mikhail Gorbachev that marked the beginning of the Cold War’s end. The country also looked to confirm its status as an arbiter between the U.S. and Russia earlier this year, when officials in Washington and the Kremlin considered it as a venue for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.The summit never took place, but the talks underscored the strategic importance of a country that has no military and therefore depends on NATO for its defenses. Trump has repeatedly threatened NATO allies for not paying enough for their defenses and made unprecedented suggestions that he would not honor long-standing security pacts.Iceland has long courted superpowers. In 2013, it became the first European country to sign a free-trade agreement with China. The accord came as China ramps up its ambitions in the Arctic. Last year, Beijing took a nearly 10 percent stake in a Russian natural gas project, amounting to a $1.2 billion investment from its $40 billion Silk Road Fund. China has yet to expand into Nordic countries, but in March, two top Icelandic executives wrote an op-ed in The Diplomat proposing Beijing as a natural partner to build up infrastructure in the region.Iceland seems keen to hold China at a comfortable distance. Earlier this month, the ruling coalition moved to tighten rules limiting foreign ownership of Icelandic land. The decision appeared to be aimed at blocking an unidentified Chinese investor from buying a nearly 5-square-mile plot of land to build a resort in the island’s touristy Golden Circle, according to Bloomberg.But, at least for now, those have become a distant worry.“Violence against women is a direct threat to the democratic participation of women, and therefore a direct threat to Icelandic democracy,” The Icelandic Women’s Rights Association wrote in a statement following the government’s collapse. “How can we build an equal and progressive society, when we still can’t guarantee the safety of all our citizens?”This article has been updated with the date of the election.This article has been updated with comment from Jónsdóttir.

Authorities say they continue to investigate his potential connection to the killings.“There is a strong possibility that it could be racially motivated,” Baton Rouge Police Sgt. L’Jean McKneely told the AP.A manhunt was launched shortly after Donald Smart, 49, was found gunned down in a roadway around 11 p.m. Thursday, police said. Smart was shot multiple times while walking to work, The Advocate reported.Just two days earlier, authorities had found a similar scene by a crosswalk roughly 5 miles away. Bruce Cofield, 59, was found lying dead in the roadway, also from apparent gunshot wounds, police said.A witness told The Advocate that she heard what sounded like a dozen shots being fired Tuesday during the attack that killed Cofield. The outlet reported that Cofield appeared to have been homeless.McKneely said Gleason’s vehicle fit the description of one police were looking for and that shell casings collected at the scene of both shootings matched each other. Authorities reportedly have collected additional evidence, but McKneely declined to say what it was.A search of Gleason’s home on Saturday yielded less than a gram of marijuana, as well as human growth hormones for which Gleason did not have a prescription, the Advocate reported, citing an arrest report. As of Sunday afternoon, a bond hearing reportedly hadn’t been set for Gleason. Police in Baton Rouge did not immediately return HuffPost requests for comment. "

The young entrepreneurs behind Roshni Rides, an envisioned transportation network to empower refugees overseas, on Saturday won the prestigious Hult Prize challenge ― which comes with a $1 million award in seed capital.The Hult Prize Foundation, a nonprofit organization for social enterprise, last year presented students with its eighth annual goal-oriented contest: develop a startup venture to restore the rights and dignity of 1 million refugees by 2022.More than 50,000 applicants from well over 100 countries rose to the task, and judges selected six finalists after several stages of competition. The finals, hosted at the United Nations headquarters in New York City on Saturday, officially kicked off U.N. Global Goals Week for sustainable development during the General Assembly. The Roshni Rides team pitched its proposal before a chamber of spectators, including a panel of eight judges.The business model is a formalized rickshaw shuttle service inspired by the New York subway system. The team aims to optimize existing infrastructure in order to offer fixed, affordable commuting prices to urbanized refugees in South Asia, where transportation options are often limited. Facilitating local travel will also help eliminate refugees’ barriers to accessing education and employment opportunities, the team members said.Former President Bill Clinton, a key Hult Prize partner, declared Roshni Rides the winner of this year’s challenge. “This is a private solution to a public problem that will have a big impact,” he said.An unprecedented 65.6 million people worldwide have been forcibly displaced from their homes by conflicts, natural disasters and other crises, according to the latest U.N. data. This figure includes nearly 22.5 million refugees.The Roshni Rides team is made up of recent Rutgers University graduates Hanaa Lakhani, Moneed Mian and Hasan Usmani, as well as CEO Gia Farooqi, who is on track to graduate from Rutgers later this year. All four plan to relocate to southern Pakistan, Asia’s leading host country of refugees, so they can use their award money to bring the business to life as soon as possible. They intend to return to Orangi Town, where they conducted field research over the summer.Farooqi, 22, said the refugee-focused challenge posed a politically poignant issue for her team. There was a lot of news coverage surrounding the Syrian refugee crisis when it was announced last October, she noted.“Being Muslim, and feeling very connected to our global Muslim family, it just became something that was so much more than a competition,” she explained.Farooqi said it felt “very unsafe and almost uncomfortable” to be a Muslim in America after President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign, which focused heavily on a ban to halt the entry of refugees and other citizens from predominantly Muslim nations into the United States. Participating in the Hult Prize challenge to support refugees in Muslim-majority Pakistan and beyond afforded her a platform to represent the U.S. on a global stage as an American Muslim, Farooqi said.“America is diverse and looks different,” she added. “Anybody can help anybody, no matter what you look like.”The 2017 Hult Prize challenge also resonated on both a professional and deeply personal level for Francis Duahn, 39, the CEO of finalist startup Kwado.Duahn spent much of his life as a refugee in Western Africa. At age 12, he and his younger brother were separated from their family in Liberia during the country’s first civil war. They spent the next 15 years living in various displacement camps, sometimes “sleeping on the road with nowhere else to stay,” he recalled. Duahn had dreamed of going to school while growing up, remembering his mother’s advice that education is the key to a better future. Finally, at 27, he immigrated to Canada as a government-sponsored refugee and enrolled in high school classes. He went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in international relations, and is currently pursuing a Master of Business Administration at the University of Calgary.Although his team’s company ― which seeks to link refugees with local employment opportunities ― was not selected as the winner, Duahn said he hopes his story can serve as a source of inspiration for other refugees.“You can redefine your future when you make good choices and work hard,” he said. “Leaving from a refugee camp to make it this far at the United Nations headquarters is an outstanding opportunity. I hope those [refugees] who are watching today will think, ‘If that refugee can make it, I can make it too.’”Diversity and innovation are among the Hult Prize’s defining pillars, according to CEO Ahmad Ashka.“We looked at the refugee crisis and thought, ‘Could this be the greatest renaissance of entrepreneurship that people are missing? How do we convert the problem of the crisis into an opportunity?’” he said of determining what the 2017 challenge theme would be. Ashkar said he’s hopeful that the challenge winners’ influence will extend beyond “just the direct outcome on refugees.”“I’d like to get more and more people to understand that refugees, if looked at through the right lens, can be an added benefit to society, not a strain,” he said.

The team aims to optimize existing infrastructure in order to offer fixed, affordable commuting prices to urbanized refugees in South Asia, where transportation options are often limited. Facilitating local travel will also help eliminate refugees’ barriers to accessing education and employment opportunities, the team members said.Former President Bill Clinton, a key Hult Prize partner, declared Roshni Rides the winner of this year’s challenge. “This is a private solution to a public problem that will have a big impact,” he said.An unprecedented 65.6 million people worldwide have been forcibly displaced from their homes by conflicts, natural disasters and other crises, according to the latest U.N. data. This figure includes nearly 22.5 million refugees.The Roshni Rides team is made up of recent Rutgers University graduates Hanaa Lakhani, Moneed Mian and Hasan Usmani, as well as CEO Gia Farooqi, who is on track to graduate from Rutgers later this year. All four plan to relocate to southern Pakistan, Asia’s leading host country of refugees, so they can use their award money to bring the business to life as soon as possible. They intend to return to Orangi Town, where they conducted field research over the summer.Farooqi, 22, said the refugee-focused challenge posed a politically poignant issue for her team. There was a lot of news coverage surrounding the Syrian refugee crisis when it was announced last October, she noted.“Being Muslim, and feeling very connected to our global Muslim family, it just became something that was so much more than a competition,” she explained.Farooqi said it felt “very unsafe and almost uncomfortable” to be a Muslim in America after President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign, which focused heavily on a ban to halt the entry of refugees and other citizens from predominantly Muslim nations into the United States. Participating in the Hult Prize challenge to support refugees in Muslim-majority Pakistan and beyond afforded her a platform to represent the U.S. on a global stage as an American Muslim, Farooqi said.“America is diverse and looks different,” she added. “Anybody can help anybody, no matter what you look like.”The 2017 Hult Prize challenge also resonated on both a professional and deeply personal level for Francis Duahn, 39, the CEO of finalist startup Kwado.Duahn spent much of his life as a refugee in Western Africa. At age 12, he and his younger brother were separated from their family in Liberia during the country’s first civil war. They spent the next 15 years living in various displacement camps, sometimes “sleeping on the road with nowhere else to stay,” he recalled. Duahn had dreamed of going to school while growing up, remembering his mother’s advice that education is the key to a better future. Finally, at 27, he immigrated to Canada as a government-sponsored refugee and enrolled in high school classes. He went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in international relations, and is currently pursuing a Master of Business Administration at the University of Calgary.Although his team’s company ― which seeks to link refugees with local employment opportunities ― was not selected as the winner, Duahn said he hopes his story can serve as a source of inspiration for other refugees.“You can redefine your future when you make good choices and work hard,” he said. “Leaving from a refugee camp to make it this far at the United Nations headquarters is an outstanding opportunity. I hope those [refugees] who are watching today will think, ‘If that refugee can make it, I can make it too.’”Diversity and innovation are among the Hult Prize’s defining pillars, according to CEO Ahmad Ashka.“We looked at the refugee crisis and thought, ‘Could this be the greatest renaissance of entrepreneurship that people are missing? How do we convert the problem of the crisis into an opportunity?’” he said of determining what the 2017 challenge theme would be. Ashkar said he’s hopeful that the challenge winners’ influence will extend beyond “just the direct outcome on refugees.”“I’d like to get more and more people to understand that refugees, if looked at through the right lens, can be an added benefit to society, not a strain,” he said.

59,POLITICS,The First White House Of The Confederacy Is A Museum That Won't Talk About Slavery,"Hannah Riley, Guest WriterGuest Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-first-white-house-of-the-confederacy-is-a-museum_us_59be6d5ee4b0390a1564de85,"As a recent Southern transplant, the glut of patriotic Confederate memorabilia was off-putting.",2017-09-17,<p>A sample of what adorns this public museum’s walls.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59be8a0919000014005642b2.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The current location of the First White House of the Confederacy is not accidental. The two-story antebellum house, in which Confederate President Jefferson Davis lived and worked for the first four months of the Civil War, sits pointedly just across the street from the Alabama State Capitol and Statehouse in Montgomery. It wasn’t always there — the house originally sat 10 blocks away, but a long push from the Daughters of the Confederacy saw it moved to its new central location in the 1920s.When my husband and I arrived to visit the First White House yesterday, a jovial white man greeted us on the porch. “There’s a bunch of Koreans in there,” he told us. “They’re a visiting choir. Don’t be alarmed.”The First White House is, technically, a publicly-owned museum (last year, its upkeep cost Alabama taxpayers in excess of $100,000.) A more appropriate term might be “shrine.” The museum is self-guided, though the guidebooks offer only descriptions of the various items of furniture and Davis family trinkets in the roped-off rooms. Laudatory posters of Davis adorn the walls (Jefferson Davis: An American Patriot; Jefferson Davis, Mississippian, Author, and American Patriot; Jefferson Davis, Leader of Heroic Resistance) devoid entirely of context. You will see Davis’s bed, his bathrobe, his pens, and his desk — affixed to which is a sign stating that it was at this very desk that Davis wrote “The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government.” Ascend the old staircase and you’re in the Relic Room, where a prominent painting of General Robert E. Lee hangs, accented by the four flags of the Confederacy.As a recent Southern transplant, the glut of patriotic Confederate memorabilia was off-putting, but the First White House is remarkable mostly for what it doesn’t say than for what it does. The self-guided tour — and every piece of literature I perused while there — makes absolutely no mention of slavery. None. I checked their website’s FAQ section in hopes of seeing this addressed; instead, there were questions about the gift shop, and questions about how to donate. (And yes, the gift shop is well stocked with cuddly confederate teddy bears, confederate battle flag lapel pins, confederate cross-stitches, and more.)Though Alabama declined to write its own Declaration of Causes for secession (Georgia, Mississippi, Texas, South Carolina, and Virginia’s can be read here), Davis’s own words are more than clear. When asked in 1861 to illuminate why his state had seceded, Davis wrote “...she had heard proclaimed the theory that all men are created free and equal, and this made the basis of an attack upon her social institutions; and the sacred Declaration of Independence has been invoked to maintain the position of the equality of the races.” The Vice President of the Confederate States, Alexander Stephens, made similar remarks: “slavery ... was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution,” and protecting it was the “cornerstone” of the newly formed Confederate government.I spoke with two friendly gentlemen at the First White House who were both self-professed civil war historians. In this conversation I heard the first and only mention of slavery (both at all, and as a cause for secession) but its significance was grossly shrunken and couched in a longer list: “It was slavery, tariffs, the price of cotton, and 1,000 other things,” one told me. It wasn’t.The First White House is a Confederate marker, masquerading as an educational museum; dangerous in its white-washing and distortion of history and reality.We watched as the South Korean choir members milled around the gift shop, buying giant novelty pencils decorated with the confederate battle flag. Families with young children strolled through the rooms. In a rather surreal moment at the end of our visit, the choir assembled in the foyer and sang a song. Smattered applause came at the end, and a voice with a Southern twang rang out: “Jeff Davis would’ve loved that!”"

Hurricane and tropical storm watches, which are issued when storm conditions are possible but not necessarily expected, remain in place across several Caribbean island nations. The threat comes just days after Hurricane Irma ripped through the Atlantic, causing mass destruction in several Caribbean communities and throughout much of Florida. The Leeward Islands will likely take the first hit as Maria moves west-northwest with maximum sustained wind speeds near 65 miles per hour, the NHC warned. “Hurricane conditions are first expected within portions of the Leeward Islands by Monday night, with tropical storm conditions beginning on Monday,” the center said. “A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves will raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Maria moves across the Leeward Islands.”Over the next several days, the storm may bring isolated instances of 20 inches of rain to the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.Meanwhile, Hurricane Jose has gained some strength but remains a Category 1 hurricane with no effective watches or warnings associated with it. But that could change in the coming days.“Interests from North Carolina northward to New England on the east coast of the United States should monitor the progress of this system,” the NHC warned Sunday morning. “Tropical storm watches may be needed for portions of this area during the next day or so.”Potentially dangerous swells associated with Jose are already affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas and much of the east coast of the U.S.In the Pacific, the more sluggish Tropical Storm Otis saw maximum sustained wind speeds increase to 60 miles per hour on Sunday, up from 50 miles per hour earlier that morning. No watches or warnings associated with the storm are in currently effect. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated there were three storms gaining strength in the Atlantic. There are two gaining strength there."

The BBC said the couple, 88-year-old Ronald Jones and Penelope Jones, 71, had been honored by Queen Elizabeth for their work with children.ISLAMIC STATE CLAIMIslamic State claimed responsibility, as it has for other attacks in Britain this year, including two in London and one at a concert by American singer Ariana Grande in Manchester in May.Interior minister Amber Rudd said on Sunday the second arrest indicated it was not a “lone-wolf” attack, but there was no evidence Islamic State was involved.“It is inevitable that so-called Islamic State, or Daesh, will reach in and try to claim responsibility. We have no evidence to suggest that yet,” she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.“But as this unfolds, and as the police do their investigations, we will make sure that we find out exactly how he was radicalized, if we can.”The bomb struck as passengers were traveling towards the center of the British capital. Some suffered burns and others were hurt in a stampede to escape. Health officials said none was thought to be in a serious condition.Prime Minister Theresa May put Britain on its highest security level of “critical” late on Friday, meaning another attack might be imminent.

The BBC said the couple, 88-year-old Ronald Jones and Penelope Jones, 71, had been honored by Queen Elizabeth for their work with children.ISLAMIC STATE CLAIMIslamic State claimed responsibility, as it has for other attacks in Britain this year, including two in London and one at a concert by American singer Ariana Grande in Manchester in May.Interior minister Amber Rudd said on Sunday the second arrest indicated it was not a “lone-wolf” attack, but there was no evidence Islamic State was involved.“It is inevitable that so-called Islamic State, or Daesh, will reach in and try to claim responsibility. We have no evidence to suggest that yet,” she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.“But as this unfolds, and as the police do their investigations, we will make sure that we find out exactly how he was radicalized, if we can.”The bomb struck as passengers were traveling towards the center of the British capital. Some suffered burns and others were hurt in a stampede to escape. Health officials said none was thought to be in a serious condition.Prime Minister Theresa May put Britain on its highest security level of “critical” late on Friday, meaning another attack might be imminent.

Dolores Huerta, a longtime activist and co-founder of the United Farm Workers (UFW) with the late Cesar Chavez, knows a thing or two about peaceful activism.“People have to understand that nonviolence has a strong, spiritual power,” she tells Robert Scheer in this week’s episode of KCRW’s “Scheer Intelligence.”“You can’t see it, but it’s there. And it does influence, and it’s very, very effective.”At the beginning of the interview, Huerta describes her ancestry and upbringing and shares memories of early days in the UFW. Scheer also brings up “Dolores,” a new documentary about her life, which he says shows “you can have a life as an activist, as an organizer, and win and survive.”The two discuss current activism in the United States. Huerta explains how women have been, and will continue to be, crucial for the civil rights movement: “We need women’s intuition, we need women’s voices.”Huerta emphasizes that peaceful demonstration isn’t the only way to effect widespread change, urging today’s activists to become involved in politics and government.“We’ve got to make policy changes. We’ve got to get on those boards, those school boards, the city councils, and we’ve got to come back to voting,” she tells Scheer. “The ultimate way that you can change things is by voting. And also a call-out to nonviolence … we’ve got to have that political power.”Listen to the full podcast and find past editions of “Scheer Intelligence” at KCRW.com."
