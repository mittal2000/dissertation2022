This is ordinarily what we mean by “the truth.” So, what if the facts consistently and harmoniously played to the tune of Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump having strong ties to the Russian Government? What if this couldn’t be explained away as a fluke without squinting so much that it hurt? What if the facts consistently suggested that the man we are putting in charge of the greatest democracy on earth has dangerous ties to the Russian Government? In this article, I want to explore this possibility since, if true, it would be of momentous importance to the survival of America as a free and democratic nation.Indeed, the very thought of such a possibility is so extraordinary that at first blush it would be hard to imagine. But, as Socrates admonished, the royal route to the truth is to question what we take for granted, to greet the facts with open arms, and to be prepared to travel wherever they may lead us. So, where do the alleged facts regarding Trump and the Russians take us?First, there are reports covered extensively by the MSM suggesting that Trump admires Russian President Vladimer Putin:• 1: Trump has praised Putin and has proclaimed that he is a stronger leader than Obama. “Certainly, in that system, he’s been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader,” stated Trump at a national security forum in September; and, earlier in December 2015 on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” he stated, “When people call you brilliant it’s always good, especially when the person heads up Russia”; and that he “always felt fine about Putin. He’s a strong leader, a powerful leader.”• 2: Trump has also entertained ideas favorable to the Russians such as on not supporting NATO against Russian attacks, and cooperating with Russia and Syrian dictator Bashar Assad against ISIS.But, while these facts, by themselves, suggest that Trump likes Putin and even agrees with him on some foreign policy issues, they do not prove that he is in bed with him. Add another report:• 3: Former Trump Campaign Chair, Paul Manafort, has been reported to have had ties to the Pro-Russian ousted President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovich. So now we are getting closer to a relationship, albeit an indirect one.But add these other reports to the woodpile and things start to get more interesting:• 4: In July, U.S. officials told NBC News that Russian hackers attacked two state voter registration databases, that of Illinois and Arizona. The hackers managed to download information on as many 200,000 Illinois voters. According to Politico, there were more than 20 state voter databases on which hacking attempts were made.• 5: In October 2016, researchers maintained that there was a link between the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair John Podesta’s emails and Russian hackers working for the Kremlin. According to the New York Times, private security researchers maintained Russia’s foreign intelligence service, the GRU, tricked Podesta into clicking on a fake Google login page, handing over his digital credentials.• 6: The DNC, not the Republican National Committee (RNC), was hacked by the Russians. Perhaps Putin likes Trump because Trump likes him, but hates Clinton.So maybe Putin targeted the Democrats for self-serving purposes not necessarily related to having ties with Trump. This can, indeed, explain report 6, but what motive would the Russians have had in the first place for stealing Podesta’s emails? A reasonable explanation is that the Russians favored Trump over Clinton, and tried to help Trump win the election. Report 4 supports this explanation since it supports the Russian intent to interfere with the results of the US election. But this does not mean that Trump was a witting participant in the hackings. But what evidence is there, in the first place, that has led the intelligence community to claim that Russians working for high level officials in the Russian government did the hacking?• 7: According to Wired, some of “the most compelling evidence” included “a command-and-control address hardcoded into the DNC malware,” which was identical to malware used to hack the German Parliament in 2015, which German security officials claimed “originated from Russian military intelligence.” And, “an identical SSL certificate was also found in both breaches.” According to this report, there were also traces of metadata found in the document dump indicating that it had been translated into Cyrillic, the script used in Russian writing.There are also Trump’s own statements related to the subject:• 8: Oct July 27, 2016, Trump called upon the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton’s email messages. “Russia, if you’re listening,” he said, “I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.”• 9: In the final debate, in October, between Clinton and Trump, when the moderator, Chris Wallace, pressed Mr. Trump on whether he would condemn the alleged hacking of the DNC by Russia he finally responded, “Of course I condemn. Of course I — I don’t know Putin. I have no idea. I never met Putin. This is not my best friend.” But then he added, “But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn’t be so bad. Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.”So what we see here is that Trump was reticent to publicly disapprove of Russian intelligence hacking DNC servers. He appears to have apologetically praised Putin after stating “I condemn” and “Of course I” without stating explicitly what he condemns. And he has even encouraged further Russian hacking activities (“I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing”). While Trump has disavowed “knowing” Putin (which appears to be inconsistent with earlier statements Trump made), reports 8 and 9 suggest that there may have been a cooperative effort between the two parties surrounding the U.S. election.• 10: On August 21, 2016, the Guardian reported that the Trump campaign had been in contact with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, the individual who leaked the allegedly Russian-stolen email messages. Roger Stone, a close confidante of Trump as well as of Paul Manafort, said that a “mutual friend” of Assange informed him in advance about the allegedly stolen emails to and from key allies of Hillary Clinton. Stone was also reported to have “boasted” about his having had direct contact with Assange, but later denied it.While report 10 does not directly link Trump to the Russians, it does indicate that the Trump campaign had an interest in the email messages that allegedly originated from Russian hacks. But there is also evidence that the Trump campaign was directly in contact with the Russians.• 11: After the election, on November 10, the Washington Post reported that, according to the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, “there were contacts” with the Trump team; that “Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage”; and that “We have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future Donald Trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes.”Now consider these reports:• 12: Trump has recently denied knowing Putin (see report 9 above), but, in a 2013 MSNBC interview with Thomas Roberts, when asked if he has a relationship with Putin― a “conversational relationship” or “anything he feels he has sway or influence over his government,” Trump responded, “I do have a relationship and he’s very interested in what we’re doing here today and he’s probably interested in what you and I are saying today, and I’m sure he’s going to be seeing it in some form, but I do have a relationship with him….”• 13: In 2014 Trump stated, “I was in Moscow recently and I spoke indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success.” Trump had been in Moscow for a Miss Universe event.• 14: However, according to NBC News, a source connected to the Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov said Putin asked the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to set up a meeting between the two men when Trump was in Moscow, but their schedules conflicted and the meeting never happened. After the event, Putin sent a gift and note to Trump in New York City, delivered by Argalov’s daughter.Report 14 contradicts the claim in report 13 that Trump “spoke directly” to Putin when he was in Moscow but it does corroborate their indirect communication. Reports12 and 14 corroborate that Putin was interested in Trump. Putin wanted to meet with Trump when he was in Moscow, and Trump confirms that Putin keeps track of him (“he’s very interested in what we’re doing here today”). So the relationship starts to sound more direct.Still, however, this is very thin, not the sort of systematic, sophisticated, covert means of communication you would expect if there really was a Russian plot in progress. So maybe add this interesting, internally consistent set of alleged facts reported by Franklin Foer in Slate, October 31, 2016:• 15: According to Slate, in late July, 2016, a Domain Name System (DNS) specialist who was entrusted by internet service providers with a comprehensive log of communication between the world’s servers (DNS log) tracked metadata of communications from Alfa Bank, a Russian Bank with ties to the Kremlin, to a Trump server.• 16: In early October, 2016,the specialist passed the log on to Paul Vixie, a world renowned DNS specialist who actually wrote some of the DNS code that makes the internet work. According to Vixie, “The parties were communicating in a secretive fashion. The operative word is secretive. This is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project.”• 17: The Trump server was not public and accepted traffic from only a few IP addresses, mostly from the Bank. When the scientists themselves pinged the server they got error messages, showing that it was configured to accept only a few IP addresses.• 18: When political activities increased, the traffic to, and from, the servers in question increased. For example the traffic peaked during both national conventions.• 19: On September 23, after the New York Times asked Alfa Bank about the server, and said it might expose the connection, the Trump organization shut down the domain. Alfa Bank, which hired Mandiant, a cyber security company, to investigate, denied that it had a relationship with the Trump organization. According to Alfa Bank, Mandiant’s “working hypothesis” is that the alleged activity “was caused by email marketing/spam campaign by a marketing server, which triggered security software.” This activity, it stated, “may indeed have been initiated by someone for the purpose of discrediting parties to this traffic.”• 20: However, four days after the Trump organization shut down the domain, a new host name was created which also communicated with Alfa Bank.• 21: The first traffic to the server, after being given a new host name, came from Alfa Bank. According to Vixie, it is impossible that the traffic randomly found its way to the renamed server unless someone told the bank the address. “That party, said Vixie, “had to have some kind of outbound message through SMS, phone, or some noninternet channel they used to communicate [the new configuration].”• 22: According to Vixie, the log was authentic. “The data has got the right kind of fuzz growing on it,” he said. “It’s the interpacket gap, the spacing between the conversations, the total volume. If you look at those time stamps, they are not simulated. This bears every indication that it was collected from a live link.” Reports15 through 22, taken together, point to a “communicative” relationship between Trump and/or his associates and the Russian government focused on the election. This can explain Putin’s personal interest in Trump. However, only metadata, not actual email messages, were captured, so the political nature of the correspondence can only be inferred from the functional relationship between increased traffic to and from the servers and election activities. But that there has been ongoing communication between the two servers seems highly probable. According to Richard Clayton, a cyber security expert at Cambridge University, any other explanation would be improbable. Add this fact too:• 23: Richard Burt, a person who allegedly helped Trump write his first foreign policy speech is on Alfa’s senior advisory board. Burt was also recruited by Paul Manafort (see Report 3 above) to join Trump’s campaign.This web of connections between the Russian government, Alfa Bank, and at least two people on the Trump team does suggest a political link between the Trump team and the Russian-government-connected bank. But there is more:• 24: According to Mother Jones’ David Corn, a well respected former intelligence officer was told by Russian informants that Trump has, for the past five years, been groomed to work for the Russians, and has been receiving intelligence briefings from the Kremlin. He also said that Trump is being blackmailed by the Russian government. “Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.” It maintained that Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” It claimed that Russian intelligence had “compromised” Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.” It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on “bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.”Indeed, it is a fact that Mother Jones reported that Trump is being groomed (and blackmailed) by the Russians, but this does not mean that what was reported is true. Witnesses can lie and have political interests too. But the probabilities of testimonials are themselves assessed on the basis of the reliability of the informant. Is a skilled intelligence officer prone to use shoddy sources? Can an intelligence officer have political interests of his or her own? It is certainly possible.According to the New York Times, the FBI has been investigating Trump’s alleged connection to Russia, and has, so far, not found any “conclusive or direct link” between Trump and the Russian government. However, the Bureau appears to have considered the evidence piecemeal. For example, according to the Times, it entertained the possibility that there could be an “innocuous” explanation for the apparent connection with Alfa Bank “like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts” as was also the “working hypothesis” of Mandiant. True, this is possible; and the FBI understandably wants the proverbial smoking gun, that single deciding fact, like the content of the email messages themselves, as Exhibit A in creating a legal case. For instance, the National Security Agency (NSA) has powerful technology such as Xkeyscore, a worldwide “deep packet” analysis network that can search and analyze the content of any email message when given an email address. Nevertheless, in the search for a single deciding fact, or set of facts, we can, and often do, lose the forest for the trees; for the “smoking gun” may be the forest itself, and not this or that tree. Outside the legal context inhabited by the FBI, there may be enough facts available to the public through credible media reports for the astute, concerned citizen to put two and two together.As such, it is important to keep in mind that there is strength in numbers. Like a house of cards, each fact can support the other. This is generally the way facts hang together when a belief is true. It is not one fact alone that builds the case. It is, instead, a consistent body of evidence that consistently points in the same direction. So where do the alleged facts as enshrined in reports 1 through 24 point? Do they point to a dangerous relationship between Trump and the Russian government, which has the capacity to undermine the free and democratic edifice of the United States?Based on the aforementioned reports, a reasonable case can be made that the Russians may have stolen personally damaging Clinton email messages from the DNC (and nothing from the RNC) utilizing WikiLeaks to leak them; and perhaps they have also launched cyber attacks on more than 20 state voter databases in seeking to bias the election results away from Clinton, and, by default, toward Trump. But despite the fact that Trump has supported policies favorable to Russia, has praised Putin for his leadership, and has even invited the Russians to hack Clinton messages, it does not necessarily follow that there is quid quo pro between Trump and the Kremlin (“You help me to get elected and I will bring U.S. policy into alignment with Russian interests).Allegedly, the Trump campaign has also been in contact (directly or indirectly) with WikiLeaks about the hacked emails before they were leaked. But are the sources (Roger Stone and his “mutual friend”) credible; and does this necessarily mean that Trump knew about it? According to David Corn, based on a source he considers reliable, Trump was being groomed for five years by Putin and the Russians are now blackmailing him. However, while a person who was being blackmailed might behave like Trump—pushing the Russian policy agenda—is it reasonable to rely on a single source?Clearly, when such questions are raised, there is room for doubt. Keep in mind that we are speaking about probability, not certainty. So how probable does a reasonable person require an explanation to be before being willing to accept it, and do the alleged facts contained in reports 1 through 24 provide enough evidence to warrant belief that Trump is a national security risk?When the stakes are high, it is reasonable to take even a small probability seriously. If a medical intervention poses a 1 percent risk of a serious complication, such as death, then a reasonable person may indeed take the risk seriously. On the other hand, a 1 percent chance of mild bruising would not ordinarily be reasonably taken as seriously. If Trump truly is working cooperatively with the Kremlin then the stakes are extremely high—the potential loss of our democracy. If there were just a small chance (say between 1 and 10 percent) that Trump has been engaging in quid pro quo with the Russians, is banking on him worth the gamble? What if the risks were much more substantial, such as 80 percent?Based on the evidence presented here (which is likely only a trifling of what may yet be uncovered), and given what could be at stake, is it probable enough to accept that Trump has been working with and for the Kremlin? If so, then is it probable enough to give pause that now President Elect Trump may still be doing so?"
1,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton's Popular Vote Victory Will Likely Keep Growing,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-popular-vote-victory_us_5827a2c5e4b02d21bbc91bbc,The states with the bulk of votes still being counted overwhelmingly favor the Democratic nominee.,2016-11-13,"Hillary Clinton gives her concession speech on Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5827ab8c180000f503503c2a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton not only won the popular vote in Tuesday’s election. When all the votes are counted, it is likely that she will have won it by a margin larger than two candidates who went on to win the presidency.The official results of the election show Clinton with a popular vote lead over Donald Trump of about half of a percentage point.Votes are still being counted, however, with the outstanding ballots overwhelmingly concentrated in Democratic bastions like California, Washington state and New York. The Times’ Nate Cohn estimated on Saturday that there were a total of 7 million votes left to be counted nationwide. As of Thursday, more than 4 million votes had yet to be counted in California alone.That means that Clinton’s lead will almost certainly grow in the coming days.David Leonhardt, a columnist for The New York Times, noted on Friday that if current trends hold, Clinton will have a 1.7-percentage-point popular vote lead over Trump. That means Clinton will have a larger margin of victory than Richard Nixon had over Hubert Humphrey in 1968 or John F. Kennedy had over Nixon in 1960. (Her edge is also larger than Al Gore’s popular vote victory over George W. Bush in 2000, though he too was stymied by an electoral college loss.)A larger popular vote lead will not change the electoral college math and thus the election’s fundamental outcome.But it comes as welcome news for progressives eager to cast aspersions on President-elect Trump’s political mandate ― and gives fodder to a nascent campaign to abolish the electoral college, which has defied the will of the voters twice in the past two decades.CORRECTION: This article initially said Clinton’s lead was 1.8 million votes; in fact, that number is a projection. Language has also been updated to indicate that Clinton’s popular vote lead of 1.7 percentage points is projected, not current."
2,THE WORLDPOST,Korea’s Trump Quandary – It’s Time to Revisit Our Regional Strategy,"Taehwa Hong, ContributorManchester United fan, Stanford Class of 2021, Aspiring diplom...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/koreas-trump-quandary-its-time-to-revisit-our-regional_us_582860d5e4b0852d9ec218a8,"The Rise of Donald Trump and America-First Policy 84%. According to the New York Times, that was the odds of Hillary Clinton",2016-11-13,<p>President-elect Trump views Japan and South Korea as free-riders of American led regional order </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582861611500001700b0ca15.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Rise of Donald Trump and America-First Policy84%. According to the New York Times, that was the odds of Hillary Clinton winning the hotly contested 2016 Presidential election. Few expected the erratic real estate mogul to be seated as the owner of the Oval Office, the leader of the Free World. Now that the impossibility has prevailed, the world is bracing itself for the consequences.Donald Trump’s election victory came as an unpleasant surprise especially to America’s allies, given that the President-elect accused them as being “free-riders” during his campaign. Mr Trump called for a switch to “America-first” policy: “I will return us to a timeless principle. Always put the interest of the American people and American security above all else …… replace randomness with purpose ... chaos with peace.”Plausible at first sight, such statement brings up the question of whether the US will honor its security commitment to allies in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. American allies in East Asia are especially concerned, as Mr. Trump specified Korea and Japan as “free-riders”, nonchalantly commenting (when asked what he would do if Japan is attacked): “ (I will) sit home and watch Sony television”.It is unlikely that President Trump would actually remove American presence from the region entirely—it is more realistic to assume that his rhetoric is intended to nudge South Korea and Japan to “pay their dues.” Nonetheless, given deep American involvement in East Asia over the last seven decades, even the slightest of disengagement can be problematic. Korea especially has long relied on American military for its security; in the face of North Korea’s ever-menacing nuclear program, it is about time Korea considers alternative policies to prepare for the future.During his campaign, President-elect Trump vacillated between carrots and sticks over North Korea and its unpredictable leader, Kim Jong-un. During his interview with CBS earlier this year, he said he would get China to make him disappear. Asked when if he meant assassination, he replied: “there are worse things.” Then in June, he reversed his stance, suggesting that he is up for a “hamburger talk” with Kim to discuss nuclear disarmament. Regarding his ally in the South, he flatly demanded that South Korea pay more for US troops stationed in the country and otherwise expect them to be removed. Even if it does not come down to such drastic decision, it is highly possible that he will reduce the number of troops and arms deployed to Korea, if not worse.These comments do not amount to a specific policy roadmap, yet they should alarm policy makers in Korea for two reasons. First, the Korean army is highly dependent on American forces; the U.S. currently possesses wartime operational control of South Korean troops, and responses to North Korean provocations go through the Combined Forces Command. Second, fruitful dialogue with the North is likely to come from joint American and Korean effort, rather than unilateral approach from Korea.Balance Between Independence and CooperationTo deal with the issue of military dependence, Korea should remain within the current system of US-led deterrence until it enhances its own capability to an adequate level. Retrieving wartime operational control—as many suggested—will not serve the cause, as there must be a prerequisite that the Korean army has the ability to monitor & track North Korea’s missile movements and precisely strike key targets in Pyongyang independently. Furthermore, the handover of operational control may reduce the number of reinforcement troops in the allies’ contingency plan. An allied operation plan for an all-out-war includes deployment of 690,000 troops, five aircraft carriers, and 1600 aircrafts. Such formidable force can decrease once there is less formal American commitment to Korea, regardless of how much Washington values their friendship. Mr. Trump assumes that Korea can defend itself from the rogue communist state. To a considerable extent his belief is well founded, but the power of deterrence is considerably weak when the South is unilaterally keeping North Korea in check.Therefore reclaiming wartime operational control is not the answer. On the other hand, South Korea should increase its stockpile of advanced weapons and focus on surveillance and strike competence, which can be accompanied by a massive build up of intelligence capability. South Korea’s ability to detect political and military contingencies in North Korea has been criticized repeatedly, notably with its failure to obtain the information of the death of Kim Jung-il, the father of the current strongman, in 2011. This year in May, Korea’s National Intelligence Service came under fire when it wrongly reported that Ri Yong Gil, former chief of the North Korean military’s general staff, was executed. Korea should seek to enhance its Human Intelligence (HUMINT). Spy satellites and surveillance planes are useful in discerning North Korea’s troop and missile movements, but the regime has been erratic in nature even when compared to the time it was under Kim Jung-il’s rule, who was more cautious and skillful in dealing with the South. Being cognizant of the reclusive regime’s intentions and game plans will be crucial when it comes to preventing and dealing with occasional aggressions which Pyongyang seems to have made a habit of over the last decade. This will be only possible with “our man in Pyongyang”, a human source that can relay back to Seoul on the trend of power play within the ranks of North Korean military.Pressure and Persuade ChinaTo deal with the issue of diplomatic pressure on North Korea, Korea needs a fundamental shift in its paradigm. Bilateral talks between the North and South throughout the last 10 years produced little result, and so did the Six Party Talks that only served to buy time for the dictatorship. Such dire condition warrants a drastic change in the way regional countries engage with North Korea, namely directly putting direct pressure on China. International effort to denuclearize North Korea largely came in the form of sanctions, blocking the reclusive state’s trade with even its closest allies. But China has been providing oil and food to North Korea despite participating in UN-led sanctions itself, while Chinese firms are engaging in illegal transactions with its North Korean partners. For example, the 2007 sanction on Macau’s Banco Delta Asia, although successful, did not push China to freeze North Korean assets in its country in large scale.It was only after North Korea’s fifth nuclear test earlier this year that the Obama administration considered sanctioning Chinese firms in a series of secondary boycotts—compelling banks to freeze the assets of anyone who breaks the blockade. Such bold measure incentivized the Chinese authorities to step up its regulations on companies doing businesses with North Korea, namely the infamous Hongsheng Group.It is relieving that Mr. Trump claimed he will be pushing China to end its support for North Korea, but given the extremely vague nature of his proposed foreign policy, Korea cannot simply rely on the US to pressure and persuade China. Diplomatic ingenuity will be crucial in reaching this goal.China considers South Korea to be part of the American ring of allies region, and its support of North Korea comes not as much from their communist comradeship as from the fear that it will lose a buffer state that can prevent the presence of American troops on its border with the Korean peninsula. Furthermore, although China does not favor North’s nuclear armament, it fears that a sudden stop of aid may result in the collapse of the regime, which in turn can lead to a refugee crisis on its border. Although South Korea’s long-term goal is unification—Korea’s constitution stipulates the Republic of Korea to be the only legitimate government in the peninsula—it must allay China’s fear of a sudden, overwhelming collapse of North Korean system. Like it or not, dismantling nuclear program does not equate to liquidating the regime.Obviously, Korea is not in a state to impose sanction on China or even its major firms. But Korea needs to show that North Korea’s growing nuclear stockpiles can endanger Chinese interests in the long run. For example, the Korean government was right to explicitly state that once the threat of North Korean nuclear missile is gone there is no further need for THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile). China has long suspected that THAAD is an American ploy to monitor Chinese missile movements, reducing the power of deterrence when it comes to a Sino-American conflict. Actually removing THAAD after the end of North Korean nuclear threat may or may not be in the interest of the US, but it is apparently an incentive for China to ramp up its effort to pressure its quasi-ally into giving up its nuclear program. Korea should also hint that the more North Korea grows stronger, the more the South is forced into American sphere of influence. Although the US is South Korea’s strongest ally, Korea enjoys large volume of trade with China. In that backdrop, it has refused make a clear stance on the tensions in Southeast Asia where America and its allies are facing territorial dispute with China. Korea should signal that the more China loosens its grip on North Korea, the more it is forced to abandon the delicate balance between siding with China or US on a variety of issues, because then American influence, not Chinese, will be the only hope of removing North Korea’s nuclear threat. Such declaration may force the hands of the Chinese to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear program.As Henry Kissinger noted in his book World Order, Bismarck’s 19th century aphorism applies in this situation: “We live in a wondrous time, in which the strong is weak because of his scruples and the weak grows strong because of his audacity.” It is unclear how exactly Donald Trump’s ascendancy will shape the region, but South Korea should seek to exploit any opportunity that comes from it. It’s about time we show off our own audacity and brilliance.The Grand Strategy: Triangular Diplomacy But the most game-changing move should come in the form of Korea’s Triangular Diplomacy. President-elect Trump’s idea of American retrenchment has overreaching implications not just limited to North Korea. It also impacts the geopolitical terrain of partnerships and alliances—Korea may not be able to count on the US to be its permanent, omnipresent ally. Such condition warrants a need to seek alternative partnerships in the region.Due to tension over past history and territorial dispute over Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo), Korea has refused to form an alliance with Japan. An outright alliance is simply unrealistic, but Korea should seek to form partnerships with Japan where needed not only in preparation for American absence but also for Korea’s rise as a global power that the Korean people aspire. In Northeast Asia, where powerhouses like Japan, China, US and Russia play dangerous realpolitik, and with the ever-dangerous North Korea, it is strategically unviable to declare unswerving animosity towards Japan.Korea should pursue a two-track diplomacy, whereby it separates negotiation over contentious issues and areas where they clearly should be cooperating in, such as environmental issues and North Korea. The coordination will not only have merits of its own, but also create an optimum environment for Korea to play Triangular Diplomacy with Japan and China. To see how such grand strategy would work out, one can revisit how the US exploited Sino-Soviet split in the 1970s.After Nikita Khrushchev’s Secret Speech in 1956 and the subsequent de-Stalinization, Mao’s China criticized the Soviet Union for its “revisionist” ideas. Border dispute near Ussur River flared up that in 1969, the two countries came close to an all-out-war. US President Richard Nixon exploited this historic rift between communist comrades to bring about concessions from both China and the USSR. First, using diplomatic back channel, the US started engage with China, lifting a travel ban on China and relieving economic sanctions in July 1969. Fearing a Sino-American partnership against the Soviet Union, Kremlin had to tone down its aggression; it signed Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT), and proceeded with a summit with Nixon in the fear of renewing tension even when its Vietnamese ally asked it to cancel the meeting after massive bombing campaign on Hanoi. China reduced its anti-American rhetoric and showed willingness to work with the US on issues such as diplomatic normalization. This was possible because China and the USSR was each other’s number one enemy—their hatred for capitalist US paled in comparison to mutual animosity. Nixon’s Triangular Diplomacy served American interest by exploiting its position in the region.Similarly, Korea should take advantage of the fact that Japan and China are suspicious towards each other more than they are about Korea. Despite much war of words between Japan and Korea, Japan has never threatened a military clash with Korea since 1945. On the other hand, Japan has continued to participate in military exercise with US marines to train for a potential Chinese takeover of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Island. China also sees Japanese militarism as a bigger threat than Korea; Chinese state media do not shy away from boldly commenting on the prospect of China-Japan limited warfare, while it does not unnecessarily provoke its Korean neighbor. In that respect, once Korea establishes a possibility that it can cooperate with Japan the same way it is doing with China, a new possibility of Triangular Diplomacy will be open.When China is failing to uphold its promise to reign in North Korea, Korea can work more closely with Japan to share intelligence on its weapon—an uncomfortable scenario for China. When Japan pressures Korea to make concessions over Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo), or make provocative statements over the contentious issue of Comfort Women, Korea can signal that deteriorating public opinion of Japan can lead the country closer to China in issues that have Japanese interests at stake. This Triangular Diplomacy, when substantiated with more details by policymakers, can boost Korean interest in the region even amid reduced American presence in the region.In fact, a first step towards such Grand Strategy has been consolidated this week when Korea and Japan signed General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) which facilitates the sharing of classified defense-related threat. In this case, intelligence on North Korea is likely to be a big part of the agreement. This can be used as a “quasi-stick” to China, who is clearly uncomfortable with the idea of Seoul and Tokyo cooperating. But at the same time, Beijing needs to realize that such move came from a strategic need to keep North Korea in check, which would have been unnecessary had China successfully persuaded North Korea into giving up its nuclear stockpile. In essence, Korea is not only obtaining valuable information via its partnership with Japan, but also signaling to China that there aren’t many alternatives to working with Japan if the international community fails to remove North Korean threat. Significantly, Korea has also suggested to China that they also sign this agreement, laying foundation to a potential Triangular Diplomacy in this field of regional geopolitics. These efforts should continue and expand into other areas such as environmental pollution, territorial dispute and trade.Of course, all this can be materialized only when Korea’s own domestic politics is stable. The current state of Korean politics is anything but unified and calm, amid the Choi Sun-sil scandal that has hit the country hard. It seems that only when those who are culpable for this unimaginable calamity are brought to justice—which will take time—will the issue be settled, if it ever will. Korea’s Presidential election is scheduled for December 2017, but with increasing demands for President Park Geun-hye’s resignation, the transition may come earlier than expected (Under the Korean constitution, once the President is either impeached or resigns, there must be an election within 60 days). The new administration should seek to maintain current alliances while harnessing Korea’s independent military and political strength, and explore the possibility of partnership with even unlikely entities. In the past, there were too many occasions where Korean politicians prioritized ideological victory over rival parties and popularity to national interests. Coupled with potential American retrenchment, further political internecine can be fatal—let’s hope that is not the case."

Those who choose to wear the headscarf, also known as a hijab, often face verbal insults and threats, and even physical intimidation and violence. For many Americans, the hijab has become a stark physical reminder of “difference” and otherness.Of course, not all Muslim women choose to wear the hijab. But for those who do, they are often assumed to be oppressed, or even “forced” to wear it. And many have been the target of physical attacks in the heart of America.In reality, there is no correlation between the hijab and the oppression of women. As a matter of fact, American Muslim women who wear the hijab choose to do that as a statement of identity. They are making the point that they can be independent, strong and free and choose to wear the hijab as part of their freedom of choice as an American.Decisions to wear the hijab vary from one woman to the other and from one culture and country to the other. Immigrants such as myself who grew up in Iraq, did not think of the hijab at all in our upbringings. Friends who wore it later in life chose to do that for various reasons: some as a reflection of piety, some as a measurement of security when the streets of Iraq turned into a battleground, and some as a fashion statement or solidarity with other friends, among other reasons.Those who wore it and those who didn’t coexisted in the same families and social circles. Yes, there were some judgments between them, but not enough to get in the way of any social relationships. Out of the 49 Muslim majority countries worldwide, only two force women to wear the headscarf by law ― Iran and Saudi Arabia. In countries such as Afghanistan they are indeed still dealing with the cultural consequences of years of Taliban ruling and its impact on the wearing of Burqa and the fear that was implanted in women’s hearts. We cannot generalize these countries as the entire Muslim population of 1.6 billion people ― whose drive for decision-making differs from one culture to the other and one country to the other.Indeed, the wearing of hijab has increased significantly in the past two decades. That is due to many reasons around the world, including an expression of political opposition in countries like France, social norms in countries like Somalia, and economic and security reasons in countries like Iraq. Women in America who chose to wear the hijab have their own reasons as well.Needless to say, oppression of women does take place in many countries. But oppression of women is a cultural issue and a family oriented. To say that Muslims oppress women is to deprive every Muslim family of their integrity, their dignity and their love. Women’s issues are only one of the disconnects between Muslims and non-Muslim assumptions of Islam.During my journey to explore women and Islamophobia in Minnesota, I asked every single Muslim about how they define Islam. All the answers I got were related to human behavior: be good to your neighbors; be good to the animals, to Earth; be kind; be clean.When I asked them about the role sharia played in their understanding of Islam (as many outside of Islam fear the term), Haji, a Somali store owner explained that “sharia simply means law, and to think the sharia is only about the death penalty is like thinking that the U.S. constitution is only about the death penalty, which it is simply not correct.” Haji is right. Sharia is a diversity of laws that are interpreted differently from one sect of Islam to the other, from one country to the other, and even and from historical time to the other. It has never meant one thing in Islamic history in any one time, nor to all individuals or communities. Sharia is a fluid interpretation, not a solid document.Indeed, the term has been corrupted and co-opted by terrorist groups such as ISIS, and transformed to equate with threats of extreme violence. But that “corruption” is neither embraced, nor does it apply to the majority of Muslims who are fighting these terrorist groups themselves. It is definitely not part of the consciousness or daily practice of the vast majority of Muslims whose drive in life is to simply be good, like any other person of any other religion.The gap between what Islam is and how the vast majority of Muslims practice it, and between stereotypes, projection and fear of the religion from non-Muslims is vast. The only ones who benefit from the divide are the very people that everyone really fears: terrorist groups who thrive on division and discrimination to legitimize their use of terror for their desire for power. Across America, women who wear the hijab face consistent harassment. They hear phrases like “go back home,” get called “terrorists,” and hear wishes that “ISIS would gang rape them.”This is especially the case in Minnesota, and is happening to American-born Muslims and immigrants alike. While fending off verbal and physical attacks directed towards them, almost all are worried about the impact of bullying on their kids. In this episode of The Zainab Salbi Project, I witnessed a lot of pain and fear in amongst American Muslim women. They worry for their families’ safety, feel ostracized and are even suspected as terrorists, just for practicing their religion ― a basic American right. President-elect Trump’s talks about Muslim deportations have unleashed a wave of attacks on American citizens and legal immigrants who happened to be Muslims, leaving many to live in fear.Zainab Salbi is an Iraqi-American author, women’s rights activist, humanitarian, social entrepreneur, and media commentator who is the founder and former CEO of Washington-based Women for Women.

8,POLITICS,Trump Says He’ll Immediately Deport Or Imprison Up To 3 Million Undocumented Immigrants,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-deport-3-million_us_5828ad2be4b0c4b63b0d22f1,The Republican leader is embracing mass deportation.,2016-11-13,President-elect Donald Trump smiles as he arrives to speak at an election night rally in New York. Trump says he'll immediately launch a mass deportation effort.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President-elect Donald Trump plans to deport or imprison somewhere between 2 million and 3 million undocumented immigrants as soon as he takes office.In an interview with CBS News that will air Sunday night, Trump said he would launch what could be the largest mass deportation effort in modern history, vowing to immediately deport a number of people comparable to the record-setting figure that President Barack Obama carried out over two terms in office.“What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,” Trump said in the interview. “But we’re getting them out of our country, they’re here illegally.”In saying that 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records live in the U.S., Trump was repeating a claim he’d made earlier in the campaign that The Washington Post fact-checked and determined was inaccurate. The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, estimates that around 820,000 undocumented immigrants have criminal records ― a figure that includes many people whose only conviction is crossing the border illegally. Under prosecutorial discretion guidelines in place since 2011, undocumented migrants with minor crimes are in some cases able to avoid deportation.But a review by The Marshall Project of more than 300,000 recent deportations showed that the majority of deportees had no serious criminal record at all. More than 40 percent had no criminal conviction, and another 18.7 percent only had an immigration-related conviction. Less than 20 percent had a criminal conviction that involved or potentially involved violence. After his initial round of deportations and efforts at border security, Trump said, his administration would assess its policy on the remaining undocumented immigrants residing here. “After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about who are terrific people, they’re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that,” Trump said. “But before we make that determination ... it’s very important, we are going to secure our border.”Apprehensions of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally have dropped to less than a quarter of what they were during their peak of 1.8 million in the year 2000.Trump’s comments appeared to contradict RNC Chairman Reince Priebus’ claims last week that Trump would not call for mass deportation, despite the president-elect’s hard-line immigration stance since the day he launched his campaign referring to Mexican migrants in broad strokes as “rapists.” “He’s not calling for mass deportation,” Priebus said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” last week. “He said, ‘No, only people who have committed crimes.’ And then only until all of that is taken care of will we look at what we are going to do next.”It’s unclear whether Trump could deport or jail that many people that quickly with the resources at his disposal. Deportations are often contested in court. And the ebb and flow of apprehensions at the border at times exceeds the 34,000 beds the federal government reserves on a daily basis to detain migrants.But his enthusiasm for removals suggests that deportations will likely rise when he takes office, after declining sharply last year. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 235,413 undocumented immigrants in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available ― a sharp decline from the Obama administration’s 2012 peak of 409,849 ICE removals. “The U.S. Constitution will be a hedge against any plan President-elect Trump has when it comes to deportations,” Chris Newman, the legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said in a statement. Despite whatever expectations are held among the xenophobes within his base, it is a fact that core civil rights protections are owed to all people living in the United States, regardless of immigration status. Any effort to violate those rights will be met with with immediate litigation. Immigrants might not have been born in the US, but they are now tasked with defending the country’s constitutional values.”This article has been updated to include a statement from Newman. "

As a kid, I used to make rounds with him at the local hospitals in Los Angeles and had the opportunity to witness the overwhelming appreciation his patients had for his work. Our home was inundated with dozens of homemade baked goods, knitted scarves, gift baskets, and colorful “thank you” cards carefully prepared by his patients. He never complained about his job. Even if he had to leave a family event or wake up in the middle of the night to do a trauma case ― he was never resentful. He felt invigorated by saving thousands of lives. He was grateful to be well compensated for his sacrifices. He worked extremely hard (sometimes putting in over one hundred twenty hours a week), but he was able to do his work the way he felt was best since he ran his own private practice. He was beloved, respected, and couldn’t imagine pursuing any other profession that offered greater rewards.Unfortunately times have radically changed. The best and the brightest simply don’t want to become doctors anymore. Physicians are burning out. They are leaving the profession. They are going bankrupt. They are selling their private practices to big hospitals. They are retiring early. We are facing a growing doctor shortage. Doctors no longer want to be a part of a health care system that doesn’t value them after decades of sacrifice, debt, and brutal training. Physicians now have the highest suicide rate of all professions.As an undergraduate at Harvard University, I was fortunate to be surrounded by some of the country’s most talented students. Back then (in the ‘90s), many of the students were on the fence as to whether to apply to medical school or join the dozens of consulting and financial companies that aggressively recruited us. After speaking to the new generation of Harvard seniors at networking events — I realize that they are no longer on the fence. Our country’s brightest graduates are simply not choosing to become physicians anymore.Of course, we cannot deny that we need to focus on curtailing health care costs. But we absolutely cannot cut health care at the expense of alienating physicians. Our talent pool is rapidly shrinking. Nearly every month now, another one of my most brilliant physician colleagues (from Stanford, Yale, Johns Hopkins, UCLA, and Harvard) leaves his medical practice. This is real. This is palpable. These talented physicians are quitting to join startup ventures, “concierge” practices for the ultra-wealthy, pharmaceutical companies, or the ranks of corporate America where they feel they are better compensated and respected for their brain power and sacrifice.Let’s look at some of the facts to help explain why becoming a physician in America is rapidly losing its appeal.1. Private practice medicine is increasingly unsustainable due to rising overhead costs and declining reimbursements2. Doctors spend more than two-thirds of their time on paperwork rather than taking care of patients3. Medicare reporting incentives do not reward over 99 percent of doctors4. The average debt doctors face after medical school is $183,0005. Many new doctors earn barely more than minimum wage when accounting for hours worked per week6. State governments are passing laws to limit the compensation of “out of network” physiciansDoctors are hurting, and they don’t have the time to reach out. They don’t have the time to lobby Congress. They are far too busy trying to help their patients and keep their practices afloat.Our country needs to figure out solutions to help preserve and encourage physician autonomy― not continually restrict it. With rapidly increasing government reporting regulations, new plans to move away from fee-for-service payments, growing patient complaints about high deductibles, Medicare audits, more complex documentation mandates, increasingly complicated coding requirements, payment denials, time-consuming prior authorizations, expensive Electronic Health Records mandates….why would our country’s top talent go through years of debt and brutal training to face over-regulation and exhaustion?We also need to continue to compensate physicians at a fair level that matches their skills, high level of education, and sacrifice ― not figure out ways to “bundle away” what they make. Should health care dollars be shifted away from those who are waking up in the middle of the night to save lives, who are spending countless hours researching cases after work, who are neglecting their families to study for re-credentialing boards, who are saddled with inexorable debt, or who are spending thousands of dollars to attend meetings all over the world to find out the best way to care for patients? Contrary to popular belief, physician reimbursements comprise only a small proportion of our country’s total health care expenditures.Whether we like it or not, we will all be patients at some point in our lives. What will our country be like if we have to rely on health care professionals who are not high achievers and have little incentive to go the extra mile for our care? Will we be satisfied seeing our doctor for five minutes because he will face a pay cut should he spend 20 minutes with you? Won’t we get frustrated when we cannot get an appointment with a quality internist for two months because so many great doctors have left their practices?America, this is serious. The brightest minds in this country are running away from careers in health care. Many of our best doctors are being forced out of business. We must start an open dialogue with doctors ― the individuals who are the most influential in advancing our health care system.

12,POLITICS,Comparing Donald Trump To Lord Voldemort Is Unspeakably Stupid.

It’s relatively identical.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58280af1180000180030db1f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For Americans on both sides of the political aisle, Wednesday’s announcement that Donald J. Trump would be the nation’s 45th president was shocking. In the days leading up to the election, all polls seemed to indicate that the honor would fall to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who ― even as the FBI leapt at the chance to rub very stupid salt in some very questionable wounds ― maintained a healthy lead. Her “firewall” of swing states was secure, pundits suggested. Hell, on the morning of the election, even Trump’s own campaign seemed to think it would take a veritable act of God to launch their candidate to victory. But by 10 p.m. that night, Americans were reminded that there’s nothing God can do that some good old-fashioned white bitterness can’t.Needless to say, the ensuing days have been overflowing with confusion, fear, and agony for many, across the country and worldwide. The prospect of a Trump presidency backed by a conservative Congress and enabled by a Conservative judiciary is rightly terrifying, and ― if the president-elect’s campaign rhetoric is to be taken at face value ― threatens to undo decades of social progress for millions of Americans. In the desperate scramble to cope with an outcome that now seems both shockingly perverse and woefully inevitable, the country has turned to a number of sources, all possible ways to make sense of what just days before seemed like a dark joke.Some have referenced history, noting the ways that media normalization of Trump’s behavior mimics similar language surrounding fascist leaders, such as Adolf Hitler, in their early days in power. Others have turned to the legal and legislative structures of the nation, beginning to conceive of the ways in which the worst possible actions of this looming administration might be preemptively neutered. Still many more have turned to art, the very essence of which one might argue is the making sense of calamities like this one, finding redemption in whatever meager package in which it might arrive.And some of us have turned to Harry Potter. In many ways, this might not be surprising. The generation for which JK Rowling’s Potter phenomenon was most immediate is now in their mid-to-late twenties, and even those who started reading the books around the publication of the final tome ― 2007’s The Deathly Hallows ― would be of voting age. With the added span of the accompanying films (the latest of which will premiere this coming Friday), Rowling’s epic fantasy universe is still a vital and potent kernel of pop culture. It’s hard to find someone who is not familiar with at least the basics of Potter lore, from its elevation of the generic “chosen one” cliche, to its spotty attempts to discuss corruption and the dangers of organized bigotry. Think of any recent global event, and you are likely to find a healthy swarm of fans and internet commentators positing a Harry Potter analogy.It is also impossible to overstate how stupid and how offensive attempts to use Harry Potter as a way to discuss the fallout of this election are, how inane and condescending they have been every day since Donald Trump declared his candidacy. While there are perhaps objectively worse pop culture comparisons to make, there is perhaps none more harmful than the Potter one, both to those who will be most profoundly threatened by a Trump administration, and―to a lesser extent―to those who buy into its laughable relevance.The most obvious reason, which other writers have already addressed, is pretty simple: the threats of a Trump presidency are very very real; the threats of a bloodline-obsessed, snake-charming, death-cult leader laying siege to a school of British kids practicing magic are far less so. The only benefit of the shallow childish comparison one might make between Donald J. Trump and JK Rowling’s Lord Voldemort are that they are both shitty demagogues who have weaponized the bigotry of a privileged group in a way that threatens the less privileged. If you’re calling Voldemort “Tom Riddle,” I guess you could also point out that both have kind of stupid names; but that’s where it stops.What benefit is there to stating a very obvious fact, and then saying that it also has basis in literature? Are the people making these comparisons saying that JK Rowling predicted racism? Are they suggesting we go on the hunt for a trio of preteens who can eventually come to blows with our Trump in the White House cafeteria? Have they just not read any other books?The fundamental issue here is that this comparison does nothing to provoke what is now most needed: action. No one who reads an article comparing the guy from The English Patient sans nose with our actual real president-to-be is any more spurred to put together some form of resistance, and if they are they’re going to be pretty shocked to find that there are very few enchanted items fit to stunt historically sustained systemic bigotry. They’re encouraged to go speak with the victims of some hate crimes, and inquire about a “boy who lived.”Ultimately, this comparison exists mainly to instill a sense of moral superiority in those who make it, to make them feel like they are up against some great timeless evil, the bravest of brave British kids, telling the Dark Lord where to stick it. In Rowling’s books, despite his popularity, Voldemort is unequivocally bad, and those who oppose him are unequivocally good. By virtue of this, opposing Voldemort’s real-life surrogate places you not only on the right side of history, but among the pantheon of culture’s most recognizable heroes.There is perhaps no better example of this than a study published in July, which stated “Harry Potter Readers More Likely to Dislike Donald Trump.” Sweet Jesus, where to begin? The gist of the study is pretty simple: “if you happen to be a fan of this thing, you are more likely to not like bad people.” Put more bluntly: fans of Harry Potter are kinda just better than everyone else. Which is a useless goddamn conclusion. It does nothing for the people who stand to lose the most in the wake of Trump taking office, and it does little to encourage a change of heart in Trump supporters. Like the basic comparison between Donald Trump and Snake Hitler, it has a single purpose: to make you feel better about yourself; to equate your taste with your moral fiber; and to―as you walk to the ballot box in November of 2020―give you the sense that it will be you, oh Chosen One, who stands up against, not just a political candidate, but the greatest force of evil this world has ever known.The second problem with this drive to compare Rowling’s work with our current political reality is one that has―to my knowledge―not been as widely discussed. Perhaps this is because it isn’t quite as obvious to many of the writers who have taken overzealous and self-righteous Potter fans to task at publications like Slate and Esquire. As opposed to my first concern, this is an issue of empathy rather than ego, and it cuts at one of the most profound failures of Rowling’s work as a means of discussing nearly any piece of American political history.Voldemort is not a threat to the people to whom Trump is a threat.No, I don’t mean because one is real and one is fake.I mean, because Voldemort is going after predominantly white straight boys. Trump is not.Much of the cause for Trump’s rise is an American inability and refusal to empathize with minorities. For those who are outright misogynist, racist, Islamophobic, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic, and ableist this amounts to a simple hatred for these groups, a shameless denial of the sort of basic compassion that makes bigotry impossible. More insidious, however, is the situation of those millions of Trump voters who now rage against being lumped in with David Duke and the KKK, the neo-Nazis, and the sexual predators. These men and women either try to erase the bigoted roots of much of Trump’s agenda, or they half-heartedly acknowledge it with the condition that it is not what drew them to the campaign. They have economic concerns or are passionate about Second Amendment rights. They don’t want anyone to be discriminated against.And perhaps, deep in their hearts, they mean this. For the sake of argument, we can allow them that because it ultimately makes no difference. They have signed off on a program of systemic racism and hatred that was loudly advertised by both its salesmen and its critics. In the past year, these men and women heard the pleas of minority communities, and they either tuned them out, or deemed them unimportant in comparison to their own need to hold onto an AR-15 or to work in a dying industry determined to take the planet with it. They held their comfort up to someone else’s survival, and they could not see why choosing the former over the latter might be seen as, at best, enabling and, at worst, endorsing. This is as boldfaced a failure of empathy as is imaginable.Which is to say that the way to combat the ravages of Trump’s ideology short-term, and to prevent its ability to reappear long-term, is to turn our focus to these men and women who are stunted in their ability to empathize with people of color, LGBTQ Americans, the disabled, immigrants, women, and those of other faiths. While we fight to defend those whose lives are directly jeopardized by this administration, we must also fight to show those who have bought into America’s historically devastating program to minimize the value of its minorities that the choices they make will have real effects on real Americans, whose safety and dignity they might not have even developed the capacity to truly feel the heft of.So, if this is our greatest challenge, conceiving of the bigotry we face through a lens that victimizes predominantly straight white men is foolish, and insulting. It sends the message to those already suffering in America and poised to suffer more that we can only see their pain as worthy of compassion when we transpose it onto bodies and experiences that resemble our own. It sends the message that bigotry is most despicable when it is directed at white boys chasing love with white girls in a fantastical Europe. It sends the message that―in the struggle to understand, diagram, and destroy American racism―the stories of men and women of color who have suffered these realities are less relevant and interesting to us than the stories of men and women who suffer a pantomime of these evils in a universe that doesn’t even exist (Even Rowling, who sort of tried to denounce the comparison, still found herself rating Trump’s potential for harm on “The Voldemort Scale of Shittiness.”). It insults those looking at what appears to be an oil-black horizon and says: “We wish to honor your story, but we don’t want you to tell it. We want to fight for you, but please don’t take the lead.”To decide that Harry Potter is in any way comparable to the horror of Donald Trump and the America he has galvanized is to perpetuate the violence of ejecting minorities from their own stories, and to―once more―place white people center stage. It is to refuse any authentic narrative that does not allow us to be either hero or victim, to refuse to conceive of a world in which our story is not either pivotal or at least parallel and pronounced. It is to doom minorities in America to years if not decades if not centuries more of a country that either hates them or will not pay the minor expenses to love them, all for the chance to make some cute tweet about how Chris Christie getting in bed with Trump is like Malfoy and Voldemort hugging, or some similarly stupid shit. If you’re feeling cheeky, calling it “magic-washing.” If you’re feeling honest, call it selfish and shameless erasure.For those of you who are going to say that Dean Thomas or Lee Jordan were black, that Pavarti Patel was Indian, that Hermione was a woman, or that Dumbledore was queer, I please ask you to stay quiet, less for the sake of my argument than for that of your self-respect. Harry Potter sidelined minority characters, and utilized its female prodigy as a workhorse. Furthermore, JK Rowling claiming Dumbledore was gay was a tasteless and shameless attempt to capitalize on the growing popularity of LGBTQ rights. If it was subtext it was so deeply inlaid that it provided no added depth to the character, and Rowling only chose to reveal it once her property was such a whirlwind hit that the new information (which was so absent from the text as to provide zero identification for struggling queer youth) wouldn’t do damage to the brand. Harry Potter is a literary fantasy for young readers who want to be wizards, and a political fantasy for white adults who want to position themselves as heroes overcoming the forces of prejudice in a world that offers only a couple narratives in which they are denied absolute dominance.So, please don’t compare this election to Harry Potter. It’s foolish and it’s gross. It’s an infantile and selfish comparison that does away with all of the nuance and specificity necessary to understanding the horrible outcome of November 8 and preventing its repetition ― and it replaces all of that particularly and dangerously American context with a banal and archetypal stance against bigotry, because bigotry is a bad thing, like making a child fight a giant snake beneath his school or murdering seven people so you can neatly stash your soul.In the days preceding Election Day, it was a cloying if stress-relieving premise for jokes (in which even I once participated). In the days following, it is an irresponsible and demeaning exercise in establishing easy moral dichotomies that do more to masturbate our sense of ethical exceptionalism than provide a meaningful plan to dismantle the threats we claim to oppose.We’ve most likely got four years of Donald Trump on the horizon. You don’t have some elder wand to ward that off; plenty don’t have the luxury of an invisibility cloak; and there will be many feeling the absence of anything resembling a resurrection stone.This is not the time for empty platitudes about the magic of love. This is the time for some difficult acknowledgements about the messy and painful labors of compassion."
13,POLITICS,Republicans To Attack Obamacare Through Regulation,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-plots-to-attack-obamacare-through-regulation_us_58272d3ae4b060adb56ea234,"“We could confirm someone on Jan. 20 who could come in immediately and could be working right now on rewriting rules and regulations.""",2016-11-12,"U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) signs a bill repealing Obamacare at the U.S. Capitol in Washington January 7, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58272d7e180000ca0330d9d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Congressional Republicans are looking for the quickest ways to tear down Obamacare following Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president, including rapidly confirming a new health secretary who could recast regulations while waiting for lawmakers to pass sweeping repeal legislation.Trump’s victory on Tuesday means Republicans will control the White House, Senate and House of Representatives. But congressional Democrats are expected to put up a huge fight against Republican efforts to repeal the 2010 law considered President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement.The Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, has provided 25 million previously uninsured Americans with health coverage. Republicans have launched repeated legal and legislative efforts to dismantle the law, which they call a government overreach.Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, a member of Senate Republican leadership, said one way for the incoming president and Congress to attack Obamacare immediately after Trump takes office on Jan. 20 would be to quickly confirm a new secretary of Health and Human Services, the official who writes the rules and regulations that enforce the law.“We could confirm someone on Jan. 20 who could come in immediately and could be working right now on rewriting rules and regulations to give more freedom and choice to the states, to insurance companies and to businesses that are trying to provide affordable care to their workers,” Barrasso said in a telephone interview.Barrasso noted that the Senate needs only a simple majority vote in the 100-seat chamber to confirm Cabinet members, as opposed to 60 votes to overcome procedural hurdles the Democrats could present to repeal legislation.Passing repeal legislation “is not a ‘Day One’ activity. But a new secretary of HHS going after the regulations can be a ‘Day One’ activity,” Barrasso added.Trump during the campaign called Obamacare “a disaster” and joined fellow Republicans in vowing to repeal and replace it with proposals like tax-free health savings accounts. His transition website says Trump wants a solution that “returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the states.”In repealing Obamacare, congressional Republican may have to resort to a special procedure known as reconciliation to get around Democrats in the Senate, where rules protect the rights of the minority party.Republicans in Congress used reconciliation to try to undo large chunks of Obamacare in January, but Obama vetoed the legislation. The bill would have wiped out tax subsidies provided to help people afford insurance coverage, as well as tax penalties on people who do not obtain insurance as required by the law, and would have eliminated expansion of the Medicaid insurance health insurance program.Republican Representative Chris Collins of New York, one of Trump’s earliest supporters on Capitol Hill, said he hopes Congress can pass a similar bill gutting Obamacare within Trump’s first 100 days in office, a promise Trump made during the presidential campaign. But some changes will doubtless be phased in over time, Collins said.“There’s nothing that we will be able to do or would want to do that would impact anyone’s health insurance plan for 2017,” Collins said in an interview.“From a replacement standpoint, our position has always been as Republicans to move forward in a step-by-step fashion,” Barrasso said.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Friday, Trump said he was considering retaining parts of Obamacare including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on their insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions.While waiting for Congress to act on legislation, the new HHS secretary could be reworking Obamacare regulations, Barrasso said. For example, regulations could give U.S. states more flexibility under a provision that lets states seek waivers from key provisions of the law, such as exemptions from the so-called individual mandate requiring Americans to obtain insurance and the employer mandate to provide it.Kim Monk, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, which provides policy research to financial institutions, said Trump’s HHS might be able to tighten up the rules governing special enrollment periods for Obamacare. Insurers complain that these periods have allowed some people who initially skipped buying insurance to sign up after becoming ill.HHS might also be able to alter the language on “essential benefits” that the law requires insurance plans to cover, which include trips to the emergency room, maternity and newborn care, and mental health services, Monk said.“The law requires they have to cover 10 essential health benefit categories, but how that gets defined, a lot of that is interpretative,” Monk said. “And of course, everything the Obama administration interpreted was more, more, more, more expensive coverage, and all these things lead to premium increases.”Collins, a member of the Trump transition team’s executive committee, said the job of HHS secretary or surgeon general “would be great for Ben Carson,” referring to the neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination and later endorsed Trump.(Reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Will Dunham)"

Eighteen attorneys, legal experts and law students field calls to the 866-OUR-VOTE hotline to make sure every eligible voter is able to cast a ballot. By the end of the day, the trained legal professionals and volunteers will have fielded tens of thousands of calls from voters and would-be voters across the country, part of a national Election Protection coalition that included more than 1,000 hotline and 3,000 on-site volunteers in 28 states.One of its partners, the nonpartisan Democracy North Carolina, had more than 1,000 volunteers and 200 lawyers working on Election Day. In addition to the people answering phones in Chapel Hill, there were legal monitors roving and available for dispatch to polling sites as issues arose.Isela Gutierrez, an associate research director for Democracy North Carolina, said the hotline’s goal was to prevent people from leaving a polling site without voting.“We are so committed to the exercise of democracy in North Carolina ― the intricate and the mundane as well as the exciting and dramatic,” Gutierrez told The Huffington Post. “It’s not just the stuff that national media is waiting to hear about.”If eligible voters faced long lines, no translated ballots, confusion about their registration or other obstacles, volunteers at the sites encouraged them to call the hotline. The Election Protection crew members, using laptops in the office, answered questions and could look up a voter’s polling site or advise what kind of ballot could be cast if the voter no longer lived at the address on the registration.On Tuesday, the center received a high volume of calls from Durham County, where check-in machines at some polling sites had glitches early Tuesday. The county board of elections then ordered all polling sites to transition to paper roll books to check in voters.The glitches caused concerns throughout the county, especially after the Bethesda Ruritan Club precinct in Durham ran out of paper authorization-to-vote forms and had to delay voting for more than an hour and a half.At Chavis Community Center, a polling site in a predominantly black corner of southeast Raleigh, poll monitors for Democracy NC recorded that at least 300 voters were turned away in 2014 because they were voting outside of their home precinct.The group also found that across the state, voters were inadvertently disenfranchised by poorly trained poll workers who didn’t know such things as who met the requirements to receive a provisional ballot. In some cases, voters traveled from precinct to precinct because poll workers couldn’t tell them where they were supposed to cast their ballots. On Election Day, a woman in Harnett County called the hotline to say she wasn’t going to vote because there was a 90-minute wait at her polling location.Lines at the polling site at North Carolina Central School of Law, a historically black college in Durham, took more than two hours. Election Protection volunteers encouraged students to stay in line. They also made sure students were at the right location, since some found out they couldn’t vote after waiting an hour.Even scissors were an issue. At the American Legion Post No. 7 site in Durham, poll workers had to cut names out of the paper poll books to put on the authorization-to-vote forms after the county mandated the use of paper books. But there weren’t enough scissors, and when Election Protection volunteers offered to buy more, they were told poll workers had to wait for county-issued scissors.“The disenfranchisement doesn’t always come in a dramatic and exciting package,” Gutierrez said. “It can come in a mundane and easy-to-overlook package.”About 50 miles west of Chapel Hill, former U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag saw many of the less newsy issues firsthand while standing outside a polling center in Greensboro. Haag, who lives in Northern California, was in North Carolina working as a poll monitor because the state had been “in the news as a place where people think there may be some challenges.”“We find it so easy to vote here in Northern California, and with my legal education, it’s just easy. It’s easy to vote,” said Haag, who prosecuted voter rights cases while working for the Justice Department and was a poll watcher in 2004 and 2008. She’s now the head of global business at the San Francisco-based law firm Orrick.“I understand it. I’m versed in it as a lawyer. I understand the system, how to use the internet, where to cast my vote.” Haag was among the volunteers helping people who had never voted, people who were nervous about voting and people who just didn’t understand the process. There were voters who didn’t know they couldn’t register the same day, and others with less flexible jobs who were trying to vote quickly on their way to work or on their lunch break.“The very last voters, they were two older African-American men. They drove up with seven minutes to spare,” Haag said. “They said they’d never voted and didn’t know how to do it. And they’d come straight from work.”She also encountered voters who didn’t know where their polling locations were, voters who needed rides and disabled people who struggled to get into the polling location.Despite her 28 years as an attorney, her work volunteering as a poll monitor this year showed her that voting can be a challenge for many people who haven’t been afforded the same privileges as her.“It’s intimidating to come and vote when you’re disabled and you know you can’t get into that school,” Haag said. “When legislatures pass laws about voting and there’s a cry from certain constituencies, saying you’re making it harder to vote and that it’s voter suppression, I have a better insight into that now.” Voting rights advocates were particularly worried about North Carolina, since the state has a history of deliberately trying to disenfranchise black voters. The state has also changed its voting laws a number of times since 2012.North Carolina also passed one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country in 2013. A federal appeals court struck it down in July, after three judges determined that GOP lawmakers in the state implemented specific ID requirements, reduced the number of early voting days and altered registration procedures in order to undermine black voters.During the 2014 midterm election, the state also barred voters from casting ballots outside of their home precincts and eliminated same-day registration. Democracy NC estimates that 30,000 potential voters were not able to cast a ballot in the 2014 midterms because of those two restrictions alone.Black turnout was low during early voting before this Election Day, and voting rights advocates say that is largely due to the efforts of the Republican-controlled Legislature and local officials to aggressively limit early voting opportunities. A memo sent out by the state GOP in August urged precincts to make “party line changes to early voting.” Twenty-three county election boards subsequently reduced early voting hours, and nine boards eliminated Sunday voting.The state had also shut down a number of polling sites ― at least 27 closed in North Carolina after the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down portions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.The North Carolina NAACP sued county election officials in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties for canceling voter registrations after campaign mailers sent to voter addresses were returned as undeliverable, which they said was an effort to suppress the black vote. A federal judge ordered county election boards to restore the registrations on Nov. 4. And still half of pending voter registrations in the state are from people of color, even though they only made up one-third of the registrants."

A memo sent out by the state GOP in August urged precincts to make “party line changes to early voting.” Twenty-three county election boards subsequently reduced early voting hours, and nine boards eliminated Sunday voting.The state had also shut down a number of polling sites ― at least 27 closed in North Carolina after the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down portions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.The North Carolina NAACP sued county election officials in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties for canceling voter registrations after campaign mailers sent to voter addresses were returned as undeliverable, which they said was an effort to suppress the black vote. A federal judge ordered county election boards to restore the registrations on Nov. 4. And still half of pending voter registrations in the state are from people of color, even though they only made up one-third of the registrants."

The army was called in to assist with rescue operations, given the remoteness of the site, Bugti said.It was not clear if the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber or a planted device, according to Bugti.The province has seen some of the worst militant attacks this year in Pakistan.Islamic State said in a statement via its Amaq news agency that its fighters had carried out Saturday’s bombing.The jihadist group also claimed responsibility for the last major attack in the province, at a police academy last month, that killed around 60 people.Muslim shrines have often been targeted by militant groups, many of whom adhere to a strict interpretation of Islam that regards veneration of saints at shrines such as Shah Noorani as heresy.Baluchistan is also a key link in a $46 billion transport and trade corridor between Pakistan and China, which hinges on a deep-water port in the southwestern city of Gwadar."

The plan urged that the party focus on Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. The cost: $3 million.“While a strong Democratic allegiance is good for the Party, less than half of eligible Hispanics cast a ballot in 2012,” the proposal reads. “The challenge is not persuading Latinos to vote for Democrats ― our challenge in 2014 is TURNOUT.” [Emphasis in the original.]The plan was ultimately nixed.The author of the proposal, then-DNC Hispanic Engagement Director Albert Morales, stayed at the committee until 2016, trying to cobble together a budget to build a robust Latino engagement effort. While Democrats publicly gloated about the country’s changing demographics, Morales worried his party wouldn’t capitalize on the shift. The Republican National Committee, despite later selecting Donald Trump as its presidential nominee, was devoting significant resources to Hispanic outreach, including permanent Hispanic staff in 10 states. “I just asked for what I needed,” Morales told HuffPost. “I ended up getting closer to $300,000 and it all went to radio. … It was just pitiful.” Trump’s surprising defeat of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has sparked spirited finger-pointing and soul-searching among party leaders. The question of whether Democrats should have done more to win Latino votes is high on the list.Media reports trumpeted a Hispanic voter “surge” in last week’s election. But it won’t be clear whether the Hispanic turnout rate rose significantly until the census releases its voter report in the spring, according to Mark Hugo Lopez at the Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends Project. Hispanic turnout has broken records for the last few presidential elections, based partly on population growth. Still, it continues to lag far beyond turnout rates for non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Both Morales and Pablo Manriquez, who worked for a year and a half as the DNC’s Hispanic media director, described an atmosphere in which their pleas to invest in Latino engagement often were met with disinterest. Manriquez said he at times paid his own bus fare and slept on friends’ sofas to meet with Hispanic television and news executives in New York.“There was only one other Hispanic in the entire third floor,” Manriquez said of his time at the DNC. “And when I did see one I had to speak to them in Spanish so people wouldn’t try to undercut us from doing our job.” Both Morales and Manriquez left the DNC during the presidential campaign, leaving the committee for weeks without a Spanish speaker on its media staff. The DNC did not respond to multiple phone calls and emails requesting comment. The rise of Trump, who campaigned using Mexican immigrants as a punching bag and promising draconian anti-immigration policies, offered Democrats a historic opportunity to bring a rising Hispanic electorate into their ranks. But confidence that Hispanics would recoil from the Republican nominee may have led to complacency when it came to traditional campaign tasks like canvassing, Spanish-language television ads and an aggressive media strategy.Trump’s election, according to critics of the party, shows that Democrats failed to prioritize Latino engagement where it matters most: boosting voter registration and a turnout rate that historically fails to top 50 percent.“The reality is the Democrats have not done enough,” said Simon Rosenberg, who helped pioneer Hispanic outreach efforts for the party and now serves as president of NDN, a think tank. “I hope that the perception that the Hispanic vote is really important to the Democrats helps change behaviors in the Democratic Party itself.” Outside the DNC, independent civic organizations like the National Association of Latino Elected Officials, Mi Familia Vota and Voto Latino organized national registration drives. A group of liberal donors, including billionaire George Soros, spent $15 million on turnout efforts in battleground states with large Latino or Asian-American populations. The Clinton campaign itself viewed Hispanics as a key constituency and made robust efforts to reach them. Clinton recruited Lorella Praeli, a prominent immigrant rights activist who was once undocumented herself, into the campaign to work on outreach. Clinton aired an ad early in the general election campaign featuring the candidate promising to take care of a young girl worried about her parents being deported. Her staff organized campaigns to reach Hispanic voters through text messages and Facebook Live chats. And the campaign sank $10 million into more traditional ads, including more than 50 that ran on television in both Spanish and English, and 30 Spanish-language radio ads. But even before Clinton’s stunning election loss, some critics wondered why her campaign’s Latino outreach strategy appeared to depart from what had served President Barack Obama well. Fernand Amandi, a pollster and political consultant, helped develop Obama’s media strategy in Florida for the 2012 campaign. His plan called for airing television ads in English and Spanish, beginning a year before the election, highlighting positive themes rather than negative ones, and having extended conversations on Spanish-language broadcasters like Univision and Telemundo. With just two months remaining before Election Day, however, Clinton had for the most part neglected Spanish-language television ads in Florida. She went on to lose the state, partly due to her weakness among Cuban American voters. “If you believe that [Obama’s 2012 campaign] was a successful approach, many of those rules were violated in this campaign,” Amandi told HuffPost. Lisa Garcia Bedolla, a political scientist who studied how the anti-immigrant politics of the Gov. Pete Wilson era turned California blue, said Clinton’s campaign erred in thinking that Trump alone would lead to greater Latino political participation. Her research shows the most effective way to mobilize unregistered voters by far isn’t radio ads, Facebook Live chats or media appearances. It’s old-fashioned neighborhood canvassing. “You have to be in a position of privilege to assume that insults will automatically lead to action,” Bedolla told HuffPost. “You have to have a sense of entitlement to some extent to think that it’s your right to have a voice. … If you are from a marginal community and don’t feel tremendously empowered and you feel like the system doesn’t work for you, it is irrational to take that insult and assume it will move people to action. It’s just as likely to make you more disaffected from the system.”A grassroots coalition called One Arizona succeeded in turning out the Hispanic vote by applying traditional campaign conventions. One Arizona registered 150,000 Latino voters this year, largely by sending volunteers to knock on doors. (For context, the multimillion-dollar, celebrity-studded nonprofit Voto Latino registered 177,792 people nationally, over a longer period.) One Arizona’s efforts played a major role in unseating Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a fixture of hardline immigration politics in the conservative-dominated state for two decades. “This is about community organizing rather than electoral campaigning,” Viridiana Hernandez, a board member of the People United for Justice group that led the anti-Arpaio campaign, told HuffPost. “When we were at people’s door, it wasn’t that people didn’t want to vote. It wasn’t that people didn’t care. It was that people didn’t know how, they didn’t understand the process.”Perhaps the greatest symbol of Democratic disinterest in cultivating the Hispanic vote came in Texas ― widely viewed as an incontestable Republican territory, despite being a majority-minority state. Battleground Texas, the political action committee founded in 2013 with the goal of turning the state purple, pulled in $3.4 million in the 2014 cycle to support Wendy Davis’s unsuccessful gubernatorial candidacy, according to data published by Open Secrets. This year, Battleground Texas raised just $324,000.It’s unclear whether a different Hispanic engagement strategy would have carried Clinton to the presidency in an anti-establishment year that bucked analysts’ expectations and made polls look less reliable than coin tosses. Even if Clinton had won Florida and Arizona ― the two states she lost with the highest Hispanic populations ― she still would have been two electoral votes shy of the 270 she needed to win. But there’s no doubt that increased turnout would have benefitted both Clinton and the Democratic Party’s down-ballot candidates. Exit polling data showed Trump winning 29 percent of the Hispanic vote ― a slight improvement over 2012 GOP candidate Mitt Romney’s abysmal performance. Latino Decisions, a polling group that specializes in surveying Hispanics and strongly criticizes exit polls’ measure of the Latino vote, placed Trump’s support well below that ― just 18 percent ― in a survey ahead of Election Day. The exit poll also showed that Hispanics made up only 11 percent of the electorate ― a modest increase more or less consistent with population growth. If that’s true, neither the Democratic Party’s efforts nor the fear of Trump paid the dividends many people expected. But Matt Barreto of Latino Decisions said the exit poll shouldn’t be trusted. While cautioning that it’s not possible to estimate Latino turnout without the actual data, he said he sees evidence of significant growth from heavily Hispanic precincts like the Rio Grande Valley in Texas and Miami. “We won’t know those numbers until we get all the precinct data,” said Barreto, a principal of Latino Decisions, which was a consultant to the Clinton campaign. “But so far, we don’t have any precincts where the turnout was lower. We’re seeing the opposite of that. All these areas have between a 2 and 16 percent increase over 2012.” If those numbers hold up, it would be good news for Democrats and might soften criticisms. But it wouldn’t mean the party can ease its efforts. In the last midterm election, Hispanic voter turnout fell to a record low.This story has been updated to include updated Voto Latino registration numbers.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Lorella Praeli was currently undocumented.

26,POLITICS,Even The World Chess Champion Can't Escape The Spectre Of Donald Trump,"Zach Young, ContributorPodcast Producer, HuffPost Politics",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/even-the-world-chess-champion-cant-escape-the-spectre_us_582779ffe4b02b1f5257a350,"Although it seems unlikely that Trump was referring literally to chess players, the statement got graded by Politifact as",2016-11-12,Woody Harrelson watches the opening moves of the world chess championship in New York,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5972ca8315000020008b30da.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As he now does in all things, Donald Trump reared his head yesterday in the first round of the World Chess Championship in New York.Things started normally. A celebrity guest, actor Woody Harrelson, played the ceremonial first move (a tradition akin to the first pitch in a baseball game). The move, chosen by Norwegian world champion Magnus Carlsen beforehand, was the reliable pawn-to-d4, one of the two most common opening moves. But after the reply from his opponent, Russian challenger Sergey Karjakin, Carlsen advanced his bishop in such a manner as to enter a line known by the chess cognoscenti as the “Trompowsky attack”.“Do you think he did this because of what happened earlier this week, with Trump?” asked one of the live commentators. “I think that is giving Trump a little too much credit,” replied another.The opening is one that Carlsen has played in the past, including in a game against the venerable ex-champion Vladimir Kramnik, so it seems safe to say that cheeky political commentary was not his intention. But the commentators had at least some reason to speculate; in October, the chess community became the latest victim of the president-elect’s talent for stirring up ill-will among groups normally untouched by presidential politics. At a rally in Ambridge Pennsylvania, while lamenting the difficulty of navigating America’s complex international trade pacts, Trump had opined, “you have to be like a grand chess master. And we don’t have any of them.”The comment sparked bemused rebuttal from a number of prominent players, like former world champion Garry Kasparov:… and US #3 Hikaru Nakamura (himself a bona-fide American “grand chess master”):Although it seems unlikely that Trump was referring literally to chess players, the statement got graded by Politifact as “pants on fire.”The venue was the Fulton Market Building in lower Manhattan, where a modest crowd had assembled for the first game of the 2016 world chess championship, which has returned to the US (and to NYC) for the first time in 21 years.Although it seems unlikely that Trump was referring literally to chess players, the statement got graded by Politifact as “pants on fire.”The venue was the Fulton Market Building in lower Manhattan, where a modest crowd had assembled for the first game of the 2016 world chess championship, which has returned to the US (and to NYC) for the first time in 21 years. The occasional bad Trump joke notwithstanding, the focus was squarely on the game. The first round of a world championship game is normally a quiet affair; the players are feeling each other out, probing like boxers circling one another in the ring, fists raised, for some hint of the other’s intentions. By 3 hours into the game it seemed clear that it was headed for a draw; Carlsen and Karjakin had a reached a stagnant position, with few pieces left on the board, and with few chances remaining to stir things up. Yet chess commentators have learned from hard experience never to prematurely declare a draw when Magnus is involved; his greatest talent as a player is in finding ways to preserve tension, to set his opponent little challenges that force them to keep thinking even in a seemingly lifeless position. The champion has won countless games by relentlessly grinding on long past the point when experts agreed that hope was lost, until his opponent, in the grips of the most intense mental fatigue known to man, makes some horrible blunder. That’s when Magnus pounces.Carlsen tried this approach on Friday, but he is up against an incredibly well-prepared opponent. Karjakin is renowned as a consummate master of defense, one of the most difficult players in the world to beat. Carlsen has nonetheless had promising results against him in the past; at their last encounter in Bilbao, Spain in July, Carlsen crushed Karjakin after the Russian made a few subtle errors. One intimidating display of attacking skill later, and Magnus had taken the lead in the tournament.One way in which a world championship chess game is not at all like a boxing match is the relationship between player and spectator. Avoiding distraction is absolutely crucial to playing in top form, and so the competitors are scrupulously insulated from the bustle of media and chess fans in the playing venue. The organizers of the 2016 match have taken this to a whole new level; the playing room is separated from the rest of the venue not only by a layer of glass, but by a long, pitch-black corridor and a set of thick blackout curtains. Walking down it feels like entering an exotic aquarium exhibit featuring a rare deep-sea creature that must be maintained in perfect silence and near-darkness. The attendees stood there in eerily dim light, peering through glass at the players. It resembled nothing if not scientists conducting some sinister behavioral experiment behind a one-way mirror.Meanwhile on the other side of that glass, Magnus Carlsen was wracking his brains to find a way of preserving his hopes of victory. By the end of the fourth hour, they looked all but gone. Tenacious defence by the challenger had reduced the position to a lifeless equilibrium. After a perfunctory handshake, it was all over.At the post-game press conference, FIDE press officer Anastasiya Karlovich asked the players what they thought of their isolation chamber-esque setting. “How did it feel to play in this black dark room? Do you actually feel that you were on another planet?”“We could still hear some sounds from outside,” said Carlsen. “hoping it will be even further from this planet the next time.” The crowd laughed. In a slightly embarrassing moment, Karlovich asked the players what they thought of having Woody Harrelson make the first move. From their answers it was clear neither knew who he was.And then came the inevitable Trompowsky question. “Can you talk a bit about your opening?” asked one reporter. “There was some speculation that it was typical Magnus humor.”“I talked a bit about that already,” said the champion, sounding annoyed. He changed the subject. A few minutes later, another reporter, presumably a late arrival, piped up: “You played the Trompowsky,” he asked. “Was there some connection with the election?”As a chorus of laughter spread throughout the room, Magnus gave a frustrated smile. “If I’d known how many of these questions I’d get about it I would’ve played something else,” he said.That morning, as I and the rest of the chess press were waiting to be let into the Fulton Market Building where the game would take place, a pair of twenty-something New Yorkers passing by noticed the signs for the championship and stopped to gawk. When they saw the text denoting the length of the event (“November 11-30”) they burst out laughing. “That is SO long!”By historical standards, though, it’s not really so long; under the arcane rules of the time, the 1984 match between Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov lasted for 48 games and 5 months before it was abandoned without result out of concern for the health of the players. The modern system allows for a maximum of 12 games, and in the event of a 6-6 tie, a rapid play tie-break round. That still means that the match could last until after Thanksgiving. As a championship match wears on, the players’ mental and physical stamina frays, and mistakes become more likely. The most exciting games often come later in the match, when some disastrous error brought on by mental exhaustion leads to swift punishment. We’ll see how Carlsen and Karjakin manage as the contest continues.Check back tomorrow for coverage of game 2."

During this part of discussion, the [White] lecturer told me that, ""although it’s worse in America… they like to believe that racism doesn't exist in our town but it does"". Although proof of this is clearly documented in local newspapers — it was all the confirmation I needed, to know that as a ‘minority’, it is not just a figment of my imagination, as many who have been called out for racist behavior will often purport.While I like to tell myself that maybe some people may be just having bad days, may have no manners or may simply lack professionalism — I think maybe I’d be ignorant to believe that racism doesn’t exist. Mmmhmm, contrary to Lil Wayne’s recent public statement on this topic.I believe that racism is universal [please understand that racism is in play beyond the USA]. Being Black British [born] with an American cultural background and going from living around predominantly Blacks to living around predominantly Whites. I can surely identify and explain racism beyond its surface as well as understand why some [not all] Whites — even some ‘minority’ groups — don't realize when they're exhibiting racist/prejudiced behavior. There is overt racism, covert racism and institutional [systematic] racism. Although there are other forms of racism, they usually fall under the umbrella of the main three mentioned here. I’m going to expound on institutional racism because institutional racism can fall under both overt and covert racism. This is for the reasons that many people are aware of institutional racism — but even more who are unaware of what, where or how it works and the ways it affects people like me.I hear: ‘“pull up your pants”, “rid your victim mentality”, “get a college education”, “stay out of jail”, “build your community”, “get married and raise children in a two parent household” — this will solve many of your problems’. I really wish it were this straightforward.It has been said that ‘numbers do not lie’. It is 2016 and current stats — both in the UK and USA — confirm that racism, specifically institutional racism, is still quite prevalent [you can see this in many other countries as well]. These stats show and have always shown how 'minorities' are treated unfairly: charged higher interest rates, paid less, own much less, racially profiled, denied loans, fair opportunities of advancement, access to the best healthcare and education, are overworked, underrepresented and simply treated inferiorly — in comparison to their White counterparts.In truth, because of this, there are many of us ‘minorities’ who sometimes feel subconsciously insecure when going to receive health care, contacting or trusting authorities, filling out ‘equality monitoring’ forms when applying for jobs, loans, sponsorship, grants and the like. There are many of us who feel defeated but bravely muster up the strength to bust our behinds in our persistent pursuit to get over meticulously placed invisible barriers: sacrificing, incurring student loan debt, attaining education and sometimes multiple degrees — still, only for job and advancement opportunities to be given to the preference of our White counterparts.I believe that it is the lack of these opportunities — along with a lack of proper community programs, outlets, community funding [in economically deprived areas], mainstream empowerment and awareness — that contributes to the disheartening [maybe even exaggerated] poverty, crime, imprisonment, and sexually related statistics that [FOX] Bill O’Reilly is known to report. I happened to see a short clip of the popular television show, Scandal, when Olivia's dad Rowan said to her, “You have to be twice as good as them to get half of what they have.” This is not just television — this is a reality, this is programming and further confirmation of the cold hard truth of what many ‘minorities’ like myself already know and have to face.Imagery, words and language matter because they help shape perception [of reality] especially for those who do not question their news and media sources! Further to the likes of FOX’s reporting, the mainstream media creates many exaggerated narratives of me and my people, as ‘minorities’, to others as being ‘lazy’, ‘uneducated’, uncouth, irrationally aggressive, welfare dependent, ‘babymamas’, ‘thugs’ and ‘niggas’ — perpetuating, promoting and glamorizing these lifestyles/slurs/stereotypes via rap, Hip Hop and pop culture. I mean for the most part, is it to subconsciously ‘condition’ the psyche and so, then justify being treated unjustly and shot down in the streets? Hmmm, something to make you think. Additionally, in movies, it appears that we are for the most part are only honored when we are exploited, play roles as slaves, sassy ‘mammies’, partners of a ‘superior’ race, maids, butlers and or immoral characters. Unfortunately, I do believe that this depiction can affect how some people [including ‘minorities’] of other races view and treat us or expect us to be[have].Afros? Cornrows? Locks? Cultural appropriation is fine but that’s as far as it goes. We as ‘minorities’ even must conform to Eurocentric beauty standards or identify with “exotic” [mixed] ethnicities to be either corporate, accepted, successful and or mainstream — for the most part.Prominent Black figures such Naomi Campbell, Tyrese Gibson, Will and Jada Smith [the list can go on] have all spoken out for the need of equality, diversity and more positive opportunities. Even White anti-racist activists Tim Wise and Jane Eliott confirm and speak out about racism. We have fought, we have marched, we have protested, we have boycotted and have done everything we could to help ourselves but the problem still remains. Tokenism is not appeasing nor does it distract from the obvious truth. The illusion of inclusion is just that — an illusion.The race controversy surrounding former NYPD officer Peter Liang, the 2016 Oscars [88th Academy Awards], and Beyoncé’s 2016 Super Bowl Black empowerment performance is further confirmation of where we, where I, where my Black and ‘minority’ communities stand. We only have to take a glimpse at history to see how Blacks have been treated and viewed. Racism is not an issue that only affects me or anyone else as an individual but Blacks as a whole.None of us are born racist, being racist is a learned and indoctrinated behavior.Many fail to understand and are even confused by not understanding racism beyond the surface. It’s more than being about slavery and not liking others because of the color of their skin. Racism is a multi-layered system still in effect today. In fact, I can see that racism, classism, elitism and capitalism are all intertwined.Racism is a power structure/system — White v.s. Black — where Whites profit from systematically oppressing Blacks [as well as other minority groups but mainly the Black race] and blocking access to wealth building [economic opportunities] and the sustainment of wealth [economic opportunities].Controversy sells. Topics on race are usually controversial and I feel as though these topics are used to drive ratings, revenue and perpetuate racial tension and division. Not really to change the system for the better and end racism but to have those at the bottom of the hierarchy fighting amongst each other and behaving in prejudiced manners — a distraction from the true, gloating system/policy makers and beneficiaries at the very, very top and often faceless/behind-the-scenes.The only thing that appears to have changed, regarding racism, is the way it is carried out, as aforementioned. Today, it is less overt [in many situations and more so to uninformed individuals].Where is the equality? All these years of public outcry for equality and prominent politicians have not yet put an end to racism? Perhaps is it because they do not have such power, although may talk like they do? Did [Black] President Barack Obama put an end to racism? Do votes really matter? Politicians carry out policies/agendas — but it appears that the [current] system always dictates, trumping all, period.What does it mean to ‘divide and conquer’ and what are the benefits to this?The poorly state of a people is only the reflection of an unjust system. Racism can only be truly eradicated at the very top and or from within the very core of our current system.Or can it not?Oprah Winfrey was criticized for saying: “Racists [Whites] must die for racism to end”. However, I remember reading an article by Kehinde Andrews. He mentioned that, “the truth is that no legislative change will end systematic discrimination… because racism is coded in to the DNA of the nation”.Unfortunately, Oprah and others — it is apparent that this [the latter] is the unfortunate truth.――――――――――――-Christie?

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582785cb180000ca0330da77.jpeg?cache=ngFD7zaReq&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Progressive filmmaker Michael Moore walked into Trump Tower on Saturday to try to meet with President-elect Donald Trump. Moore claims he wanted to present Trump with a simple request: Withdraw from the presidency.It was a political stunt by one of the entertainment industry’s most successful provocateurs. And if a platform for his anti-Trump message is what Moore was seeking, he appears to have achieved his goal.Moore, who was wearing a safety pin in solidarity with the ethnic and religious groups Trump has disparaged, streamed the whole 90-minute-plus affair on Facebook Live using his iPhone. As of Saturday afternoon, it had more than 1.5 million views.It took Moore some time to find the best person to talk to about meeting Trump. Along the way, ascending and descending the numerous golden escalators in the building’s atrium, he had many friendly conversations with fans, Trump supporters and journalists who spotted Moore and decided to tag along.Finally speaking to the right Trump Tower employee, Moore approached the task of setting up a meeting with Trump with the same wry nonchalance that made him famous as the narrator of his many hit documentary films, including “Fahrenheit 9/11” and “Bowling for Columbine.”“Secret Service sent me down here. I want to go talk to Donald Trump,” Moore told a clerk at the building’s front desk, about 35 minutes into the live stream.“Do you have an appointment?” the employee replied.“No. Can I make an appointment right now?” Moore responded.“Yeah, let me see what I can do,” the man answered before getting on the phone to call Trump’s office.“I wanna look my best,” Moore quips while the employee is calling.“Nobody’s picking up. He’s not in the office,” the employee says.After a skeptical back-and-forth in which the employee informed Moore that Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was not there either, the filmmaker accepted that the meeting would not take place immediately.Instead, Moore decided to leave Trump a note with the desk attendant.“I’m gonna see if I can go up there and talk to him and perhaps convince him not to take office on Jan. 20,” Moore told viewers as he jotted down his message.“Mr. Trump ― I’m here! I want to talk to you. Michael Moore,” the note read.Before that climactic, vintage Moore encounter, the filmmaker shared some of his colorful observations about the election.He told a reporter he is resolutely in favor of abolishing the electoral college, a cause many progressives have rallied behind in the light of Hillary Clinton’s popular vote victory. This election is the second time in 16 years that Democrats have won the popular vote but lost the presidency.“He’s only president because of a stupid idea from the 1700s that was meant to appease people in the rural South, in these slave states,” Moore said.“The irony that some 240 years later this man is elected and is in ― gonna take office not because he won the vote, not because the American people wanted him, but because there is this slave-owning idea from the 1700s,” he adds. “And that a man who is a racist, a misogynist, that he gets to go in the White House because of this idea from the slave era ― unbelievable.”Moore even spoke to a Trump supporter wearing a camouflage “Make America Great Again” hat, who said he had voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and was a fan of Moore’s films.“That guy is a fan of my movies and he voted for Trump. It needs to be examined, how he pulled this off ― and we shouldn’t run away from it,” Moore said after the man walked away.“I would do a lot of listening in the next few weeks ― in the midst of our activism, in the midst of us opposing everything that Trump’s doing, stopping him in any way we can, stopping the electoral college from committing what I think is a crime by putting him into office,” he went on. “But at the same time, we need to listen to our fellow Americans. Know the other side. Watch ‘Patton.’ He knew that.”Moore, who hails from Flint, Michigan, predicted in July that Trump would win the election ― claiming his victory would be “our Rust Belt Brexit.”“Calling it gives me no pleasure. I wanted to be wrong. I worked very hard to be wrong, trying to get people out to vote,” Moore said in Saturday’s livestream.In the wake of the election, Moore has emerged as something of a liberal folk hero, calling for a progressive takeover of the Democratic National Committee, joining mass protests in New York and predicting on MSNBC that Trump would resign or be impeached before his first term is up.In October, he released his latest documentary, “Moore in Trumpland,” which features Moore making the case for Hillary Clinton to a politically diverse group of voters in a conservative Ohio town."

October 14, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58272a07180000ca0330d9d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The recent arrest of three members of a Kansas militia group who planned to blow up an apartment complex occupied by over 100 Somali residents sent shockwaves through the small community of Garden City. In this rural corner of southwest Kansas, a diverse number of ethnic minorities constitute the demographic majority: a number of these are Somali immigrants. Garden City’s population of 30,000 includes nearly 500 Somali-American citizens and their American-born children. These Somali Muslims, and all residents in Garden City, have much to teach America and the world about community building, patience, hard work, and peaceful ways of living together even when we are most afraid.Somalis fled war, famine, and the struggles of life in refugee camps. As they began to arrive in Garden City to work in Tyson’s meatpacking plants, the city’s leadership, along with resettlement organizations, welcomed them and eased their transition to life in America. Even now, in the face of religious persecution and this horrific threat of violence, residents open their doors and lives to their neighbors and hold peaceful rallies to offer gratitude to law enforcement for ensuring their safety.For the many Somalis who have endured war and loss in Africa, security is worth everything. They understand the fragility of feeling safe because they have experienced firsthand the tragedy of losing security in their homeland. In the United States they work to overcome fear by remaining focused on building a bright future for themselves and their families. They continue to believe in the American dream even as others challenge their rights to claim it.Americans struggle with how to speak to and make sense of a changing world amidst growing feelings of fear and an overarching sense of threats that are both external and internal. Immigrant communities like Kansan Somalis who have settled here for a more secure life are caught up in the middle of American fears about change. Especially since the emergence of ISIL, the United States has witnessed a growing wave of intolerance in the forms of hate speech, Quran burning ceremonies, Mohammed cartoon conventions, armed rallies by militias outside of mosques and Islamic centers, and attacks on communities, homes, businesses, and individuals perceived to be Muslim.When placed in broader national and global contexts, the anti-Muslim sentiments that fuel the kind of counter-terror terrorism we just saw in Kansas are less surprising. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent “war on terror” we are experiencing a culture of fear unlike that of earlier realities that defined the world before the twentieth century. One deeply disturbing response to this state of fear is expressed in the racist sentiments that likely motivated three Kansan American men in federal custody to call themselves the “Crusaders” and plot an attack on a group of Americans because of their identity as Muslims.Current political debates about who may be granted entry into our borders, and who belongs here, translate into concerns for local communities as they confront the diversification of their familiar environments. Rhetoric surrounding the issue of ‘the wall’ is about much more than just tighter border security. Divisive assertions about migration reject an embrace of the differences among us and our history as a nation of immigrants. Today Somalis carry many labels, each of which conjures its own fears and stereotypes in the popular imagination: Refugee. Black. Immigrant. African. Muslim. The broader global context of these identities plays into the motivations of domestic terrorists.Narratives of threat often lend themselves to cycles of hatred and violence, and it is through abhorrent responses that human societies become catalysts for the realization of their own worst fears about the “other.” These three “Crusaders” were not residents of Garden City. None of the men, all in their late 40s, lived or worked there. They were outsiders – intruders – who sought to wreak havoc on Somali Muslims in order to ignite a religious war. Their logic shares much in common with that espoused by ISIL radicals. We are grateful that this terrorist plot was foiled, but we should be mindful of how their plans are a threat to our nation and all of its citizens.

Salim Toorabally is no exception, but it took him days to realize that he had experienced Nov. 13, 2015 differently from his colleagues.Toorabally, a French-Mauritian Muslim security guard, was stationed at the national stadium, Stade de France, when three suicide bombers blew themselves up nearby ― the first in a series of deadly terrorist attacks claimed by ISIS that left at least 130 people dead and hundreds wounded. Five days later, on Nov. 18, 2015, he walked into police headquarters in the town of Bobigny, in the northeastern suburbs of Paris, and studied photos of a dead man.

Approximately 80,000 spectators had gathered in the national sports stadium to watch France play Germany in an international soccer friendly. As a passionate soccer fan, it meant much more to him that just another shift.“It was a very powerful moment, and I was proud to be there,” he told HuffPost France, nearly a year after the Paris attacks. “It was a long weekend because of Nov. 11 [Armistice Day], and people were happy to be there. There were also German supporters, families and children present.”Hadfi tried to get in without a ticket, telling Toorabally, “I have to go in, I have to,” the security guard recalled.“He came to the L Gate, walking very closely behind one of the spectators,” Toorabally said, adding that Hadfi had looked “stressed and in a hurry.”After spending approximately 10 minutes trying unsuccessfully to get inside, Hadfi gave up and walked away, according to Toorabally. The first explosion occurred less than an hour later.A total of three explosions around the Stade de France killed one person and injured 56 others. Three of Toorabally’s colleagues were hurt ― one of them was hit with nuts and bolts all along the leg.As he tried to help the victims and calm the crowd down, Toorabally felt scared, and his family was constantly on his mind. “I thought I would not be able to go back home, and that I would never see my daughter again,” he confessed. His 16 year-old daughter, Yza, had been worried about him, telling Toorabally, “Be careful, Papa, something could happen,” before he left for the stadium that day.They were prepared to handle hooligans, he said, “but not this.” The media quickly declared Toorabally a hero for keeping Hadfi out of the stadium, and he was invited to speak at various international events.

Only three contestants made it to the finals, because a violent sneaker wave rose suddenly during the event, injuring three competitors.Paige Alms won the contest. But all 12 athletes made history as the first female big-wave surfers to compete in an official World Surf League event since the league was founded in 1976.“We’re making dreams a reality,” Alms told The Huffington Post after her win. “To all the little girls out there, you can live your dreams if you work hard and stay focused.”Below, see the power and skill female athletes can bring to the dangerous sport of big-wave surfing.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story indicated that there were six female surfers in the contest.

It’s a feeling I’ve only felt six times before, right before each of my bankruptcy filings.I’d like to also thank the GOP, ALEC and the Koch Brothers for the multi-year investment you made in rigging the system to ensure the triumph of my will. Specifically, the passage of Citizens United, your unprecedented gerrymandering to ensure losing the popular vote wouldn’t cost Republicans control of the House in 2012 and, of course, the terrific new voter suppression laws that made all the difference this year in states from North Carolina to Wisconsin.Finally, I’d like to thank all the voters who invested all of their hopes and dreams in me despite Little Marco’s warning I’m a con artist, Lying Ted’s claim I’m a pathological liar, and Speaker Ryan’s acknowledgment that I’m a textbook racist.One of the hallmarks of the Trump brand is I’ve always been terrific at making people buy what I’m selling at least once. Usually, I make a big promise, collect the cash, and skip town as fast as possible. It worked with Trump Steaks, Trump Airlines, Trump Vodka, Trump Ice, Trump Magazine, Tour de Trump and Trump University.

Trump is a real threat to the American democracy, the constitution and basic human rights.Following the destructive path of the Middle Eastern dictators, Trump is accusing every single protestor against him of being a ""paid protestor"" that is hired by some ""enemy"" to challenge the ""legitimacy"" of his ""regime"".This false accusation is a very dangerous one. It is not just an attack on a basic constitutional right but also it might work as a subliminal message to his hard core supporters to take to the streets to confront those ""paid protesters"" and put an end to this ""conspiracy"". I have seen that first-hand in the Middle East. Back in Egypt, I have been called a ""professional protestor"" by the Mubarak regime during the great Egyptian revolution in Tahrir square.

It is today the residence of President-elect of the United States and his family.Within hours of his election, the FAA made the airspace within two nautical miles of Trump's building a protected area and has ordered pilots to stay outside the protected airspace. The ban re-routes helicopter tours of the city, limit the work of news helicopters. Drones are also banned.The temporary flight restriction (TFR) are listed on FAA's website as due to ""VIP movement."" The TFR's are posted until January 21st, 2017, when the Trumps move into the White House. NYPD and Secret Service have coordinated street closings to protect the building's ground level access, with the perimeter being protected by a line of dump trucks filled with sand to prevent terrorist attacks with car bombs and suicide bombers.Deputy Police Commissioner Stephen Davis told Bloomberg News ""We will need to work with the Secret Service to provide security. There's no getting around it. It could be a major inconvenience."" But for New Yorkers who lived through 9/11 -- the questions about safety and security are hardly theoretical.And as Donald Trump now considers returning to Trump Tower on weekends, essentially using his New York home as the second White House, much as George Bush used his Texas ranch, it raises serious questions for New Yorkers as to the risks it brings.In Washington DC, the White House is protected by the US Army's ""Avenger"" system, an air defense system that uses FIM-92 Stinger missiles and a 50 caliber machine gun. At least one Avenger turret overlooks the White House at a nearby building. The Flight Restricted Zone extends 15 miles out from the center of Washington. There are Quick Reaction Alert F-16s at the ready at Andrews AFB, as well as Homeland Security helicopters. There is also the little-known National Advanced Surface To Air Missile System, or NASAMS for short, a product of Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace of Norway.So the question now facing the Secret Service, NYPD, and military officials is complex. In a post-9/11 world, New York never stopped being a terrorist target. But with Donald Trump as Commander-in -Chief, the power of Trump Tower as both a symbol and target creates real dangers for New Yorkers.Will New York airspace remain restricted? Will 5th avenue be closed to vehicular traffic? How will tenants, residents, and visitors be impacted at Trump Tower. In order to get zoning variances to build the 58 story building, Trump agreed to allow the atrium to be open to the public. Will those zoning restrictions be lifted?The question that that Donald Trump must face will involve his personal comfort with his family, and the risks and costs it will have for all New Yorkers if he continues to call Trump Tower his private residence and the second White House."

The election took place online on Wednesday and Thursday.Fusion employees celebrated the outcome on Twitter. The vote marks the close of a prolonged battle for recognition that began in early October, when a majority of editorial staff members at the progressive-leaning multimedia news site and cable TV channel signed cards choosing the Writers Guild as their collective bargaining representative.Fusion’s management refused to voluntarily recognize the union, however, trying to persuade employees in mandatory meetings that unionizing was against their interests.Fusion employees leading the organizing drive pushed back, raising awareness of their cause with the #FusionUnion social media campaign and confronting management in letters that found their way into news stories.Last week, the company and the union finally agreed to hold a union election, despite the fact that a majority of employees had already signaled their desire to join the union by completing cards.In a statement lauding the election results, Lowell Peterson, executive director of the Writers Guild of America, East, alluded to that. “The creative professionals at Fusion’s digital operation have spoken decisively - twice - in favor of collective bargaining,” Peterson stated. “We will work closely with these hard-working professionals to ensure that their real needs are addressed in the workplace, and in a collective bargaining agreement.”Fusion staff and the Writers Guild will now begin the long process of negotiating their first collectively bargained contract.Fusion joins a wave of unionization that has swept the maturing digital media industry in the past two years.Gawker Media, now known as Gizmodo Media Group and owned by Fusion’s parent company, Univision, kicked off the current unionization surge in June 2015, when its staff voted to organize with the Writers Guild of America, East.Since then, many other digital sites have unionized, including Salon, Vice, ThinkProgress, Law 360 and The Guardian U.S.The Huffington Post, which is also represented by the Writers Guild for America, East, became the largest such outlet to unionize when it won voluntary recognition from management in January.Staff members of The Root, a small, African-American focused news site that’s also owned by Univision, signed union cards choosing the Writers Guild of America, East, as their collective bargaining representative on Oct. 26, but have yet to receive a response from management. Fusion employees reiterated their calls on Friday for management to voluntarily recognize The Root’s unionization."

The social media giant announced Friday that its marketing tool allowing exclusion of viewers by “ethnic affinity,” which attracted heavy criticism after a ProPublica investigation in late October, would no longer be available for advertisers who promote industries that have a history of racial discrimination.Specifically, that means no more racial targeting for ads that pertain to housing, employment or credit offers.“There are many non-discriminatory uses of our ethnic affinity solution in these areas, but we have decided that we can best guard against discrimination by suspending these types of ads,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s vice president of U.S. public policy, explained in a blog announcing the changes. The tool permits advertisers to target certain demographic groups which Facebook determines based on an individual’s browsing habits. The social media site doesn’t ask users to state their race when they sign up. Regarding the possibility for misuse of the “ethnic affinity” categorization, Facebook says its “policies strictly prohibit discriminatory uses of this solution.”Facebook’s decision is smart, both in the sense that it no longer risks perpetuating inequity in three historically discriminatory fields, and that it helps the company avoid what could be very serious legal challenges, say legal experts.The policy shift is “a positive approach that moves them forward towards compliance with the law and that ensures they are not facilitating discrimination,” Jon Bauer, a law professor at the University of Connecticut who focuses on discrimination, told USA Today.ProPublica’s report compared Facebook’s racial targeting abilities to a modern variant of Jim Crow-era ads, since they could permit property managers, for example, to only advertise apartments to white people.The Fair Housing Act of 1968 explicitly prohibits making, printing or publishing ads “with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.”"

It feels, for a moment, like any other podcast intro, an average water-cooler conversation between two colleagues. And then you remember.“How am I,” Wortham responds, more of a statement than a question. “I’m here, looking at you. Happy for that, grateful for that.”Wednesday marks a new era in American politics that is extremely difficult to grapple with for many U.S. voters. The people spoke, and in doing so laid their prejudices bare, electing a man who we’ve seen, in the national arena, disparage women, immigrants, people with disabilities, people of color, LGBTQ individuals and other marginalized groups. As returns were coming in on election night, a CBC commentator called it “white supremacy’s last stand.”Where do we go from here? How do we continue to love, and survive, in a country where so many of our fellow citizens have placed their feet on the side of hate? How do white allies ensure the support and safety of their loved ones and colleagues whose safety has felt jeopardized in the last 48 hours?There’s no certainty that podcast hosts can tell us these answers, but we will see these and many more issues — such as the opinion bubble that shocked Clinton supporters find themselves in on social media, wondering how Trump could have possibly prevailed — play out before our ears. Shows like Morris and Wortham’s will serve as a record in the decades ahead, first-person accounts of what it was like to wake up in America as a black person on Nov. 9.As a straight, white woman, I have my own fears and sympathies in the aftermath of the election. I know the only way I can begin to know how the prospect of a Trump presidency feels for people of color, for Muslims, for the LGBTQ community, is to listen.Many podcasts have released episodes since the election was called. Along with “Still Processing,” there’s also BuzzFeed’s “See Something Say Something,” a relatively new podcast from the media company where host Ahmed Ali Akbar brings guests on to discuss being Muslim in the U.S. “Usually at the beginning of each episode we ask guests what they’re thinking about,” Akbar says at the top of the program, making it clear that this time around, there’s something that, without question, everyone is thinking about.WNYC tech podcast “Note to Self” released an addendum to its most recent episode. Host Manoush Zomorodi addresses listeners: “It would be so weird to pretend that things in podcast-land are just business as usual. Whoever you voted for, chances are you were surprised by the results. And the fact that no one picks up their phone anymore means that the pollsters were way off.” For a show that deals in the intersection between technology and human beings, it’s fair to imagine that it might continue to tackle the aforementioned opinion bubbles that contributed to the highly unanticipated election result. “We have an opportunity, and a responsibility, to do more,” she concludes.If you just need to hear some cool ladies talk it out, try “Call Your Girlfriend,” a podcast “for long-distance besties everywhere.” Hosts Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman took to the mics after the election, starting with a focus on self-care. “I just want to ask how you’re taking care of yourself today,” Friedman begins the first episode since the election. “I will say this: Having many of my closest friends ask me how I’m doing today has been the best part of the day,” Sow answers, suggesting that most of the day has been far less great.NPR’s “Code Switch,” a show about race and identity helmed by journalists of color, also convened to discuss their feelings post-election, with hosts Shereen Marisol Meraji and Gene Demby ready to discuss the sobering reality of President-elect Trump, while also hoping for some much needed comic relief. The brain can only handle so much trauma before it needs a reprieve: “I’m not sure our guests are in the mood to laugh, or make us laugh,” Meraji notes. Demby quips back, joking: “Um, they better get on it. ‘Cause I think we all need it.”Humor, empathy, information and bold storytelling: These are the things we can find in podcasts as we work together to act, organize and figure out how to proceed."

In her essay, Dunham describes the year and a half she spent campaigning for Clinton and what Donald Trump’s win means to so many minority groups in this country. Dunham’s letter serves as a somber yet encouraging reminder that although people need time to grieve, it is also the time to organize and fight back.“In this new reality, we have all been radicalized,” Dunham wrote. “It’s no longer a word for those living on the fringes. It’s a word for everyone who walks in pain with the results of this election, who feels their identity being crushed under the weight of the half of the country who voted for a man who denounces and denies the basic rights of women, the queer community, immigrants, Muslims, people of color and the differently abled.”During her time campaigning for Clinton, the “Girls” creator received more online vitriol and threats than she ever had before: Her phone was hacked, her Twitter mentions became violent and she was called horrific names. “My experience mimics that of so many women who organized for Hillary Clinton and against Donald Trump, most of them not celebrities,” she wrote. “We wanted a female president. We wanted guaranteed control over our own bodies. We wanted equal pay. That made us nasty. That made us targets.”Dunham also spoke to other white woman, 53 percent of whom voted for Donald Trump. “It’s painful to know that white women, so unable to see the unity of female identity, so unable to look past their violent privilege, and so inoculated with hate for themselves, showed up to the polls for him, too,” Dunham wrote. She pointed out that right now is not the time to try to understand the mindset of Trump voters: “It should not be the job of women, of people of color, of queer and trans Americans, to understand who does not consider them human and why, just as it’s not the job of the abused to understand their abuser,” she wrote. “It’s quite enough work to know about and bear the hatred of so many. It’s quite enough work to go on living.”Dunham wrapped up her essay by thanking Clinton:Thank you, Hillary, for bravely taking every shot and standing tall, for weathering assaults from every direction... Thank you for showing our daughters something beautiful to aspire to. Thank you for reminding us what we are capable of when we are focused and ferocious. Thank you for 30 years of that. Thank you for not abandoning us now.Head over to Lenny Letter to read the rest of Dunham’s essay. "

Recently released, the trailer takes viewers back to Wisconsin in 2014, when 12-year-olds Anissa Weier and Morgan Geyser attempted to murder their classmate Patyon Leutner by stabbing her 19 times.The two lured Leutner into the woods with a game of hide-and-go-seek, stabbed her and left her for dead ― all to please a fictional horror character called Slenderman.The upcoming documentary, described in the trailer as “a nightmare come true,” delves into the dark internet character as it covers Weier and Geyser’s court case. The now 14-year-old girls are charged with first-degree attempted homicide and scheduled to appear in court again Friday.“The narrative does not revolve around guilt or innocence,” director Irene Taylor Brodsky told BuzzFeed in a statement, “But instead the court’s deliberation whether the girls should be tried as adults or children.”“Beware the Slenderman” premieres on HBO on Jan. 23.

Everything shuts down around you,” the composer told Entertainment Tonight Canada, later adding that Bublé “will not sing again until his child is well.”“I’m certain of it,” he said.Many fans have reached out to the singer through social media, and Foster said that a few have contacted him wishing to extend their well-wishes and resources to Bublé. Though the diagnosis is heartbreaking, Bublé is “in good shape.” “He’s got good doctors around him. We will hope and pray for a good outcome, which I believe that they will have,” Foster said, suggesting his fellow Canadian’s “good karma” will come into play. Last Friday, Bublé and his wife broke the news about Noah’s illness in a Facebook post, asking fans to respect their privacy.“We are devastated about the recent cancer diagnosis of our oldest son Noah who is currently undergoing treatment in the US,” the statement read. “We have always been very vocal about the importance of family and the love we have for our children.

Just ask Seattle Seahawks linebacker Kevin Pierre-Louis, who recently discussed how his experience with depression threatened his ability to perform as a professional football player. “I dropped weight, I’m looking frail, school wasn’t going well, I wasn’t sleeping,” Pierre-Louis told ESPN. “And I guess I just bottled everything in.”After years of holding people at a distance through high school and much of college, Pierre-Louis opened up to his coach about his mental health difficulties.“All these things that I said, ‘Oh it’s just mental,’ you know, ‘I’m just sweeping it under the rug,’ they just ended up piling up and piling up,” he said.A doctor later diagnosed Pierre-Louis with depression and prescribed him medication as part of his treatment, which the football player says helped him tremendously. A round of applause is in order for the linebacker: Candid conversations in the public eye are needed in order for society to be more accepting when it comes to mental health issues. One in five people will experience a mental health disorder in a given year. However, research shows many don’t seek treatment due to stigma. Men, in particular, often stay silent when they’re dealing with a mental health issue for fear of being judged or shamed.“This conversation needs to be had and this complete sense of vulnerability is something that we all need to share,” Pierre-Louis said.Now that’s what we’d call a touchdown.

Understandably, they said “no.” When he was old enough to enlist without their permission, off he went to Marine boot camp at Parris Island and then to two combat tours in Afghanistan with Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment. By the time he returned home, he had killed many times, with different weapons and under different circumstances. In our conversations, he seemed awash in conflicting emotions of pride, remorse, bitterness and defiance. In combat, he said one day, there are things you know you shouldn’t do but everybody does them.Newton is a tall, rangy guy from Brooklyn with a fine ironic sense of humor. His dark hair, shaved down below stubble in Afghanistan, is now almost shoulder-length. He was skeptical at first about talking to me. But as a correspondent in Afghanistan, I’d been under fire with his battalion, and eventually he agreed to trust me with some of his reflections on war and killing. He is careful and deliberate, gathering his thoughts before he speaks, as if his words are precious and not to be wasted or misunderstood. He lets them out a sentence or two at a time and checks your eyes to make sure you’ve got it.“I wanted to kill people ― badly. In the same way you wanted the people responsible for the [9/11] massacres to get killed. And I went and did it. And thinking back on it, you know … that’s too heavy for one person to take on. I don’t know that there’s anybody who’s not psychopathic who isn’t hurt by it.”That’s the profound and unpleasant truth, and I suspect each us knows it. Under any circumstance, justified or not, killing another human exacts a moral cost. We send men and women into war knowing that they will collide with a moral dilemma no one can resolve: To be effective warriors, they must participate directly or indirectly in killing, but killing violates one of our oldest taboos.Rather than confront the morality of killing, we’ve surrounded it with a conspiracy of silence. Official Defense Department war dispatches speak of “kinetic events” and list targets destroyed in airstrikes, while the word “killed” rarely makes an appearance. The father of a new military enlistee doesn’t say with pride that “my daughter has signed up to kill.” Military recruiters studiously avoid the word. Many of the new soldiers I’ve talked with say they never thought about the moral consequences of killing. The Rifleman’s Creed memorized by all young Marines demands not that they kill, only that they must fire a weapon “true,” and adds, “We will hit.”  Asking a combat veteran if he or she ever killed someone is considered rude, and for the veteran, it’s a cause for excruciating discomfort. Most likely, the answer lies tightly wrapped in layers of pride and guilt and confusion, an experience hard earned and not lightly shared.In his blog, Thoughts of a Soldier-Ethicist, Army Lt. Col. Peter Kilner, who teaches philosophy and military science at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, acknowledges the point when he writes, “We don’t tell our family members and civilian friends that we killed in war. If they ask, we answer matter of factly and move on. When acquaintances and strangers ask if we killed anyone in war, we lie or ignore them; they have no right to know.” Kilner adds, “Those who haven’t experienced combat couldn’t possibly understand what it means to kill another human being, and we want to be looked at for the purpose we achieved (protecting them) not for the means we used (killing others).”No wonder so many veterans often feel misunderstood after returning to civilian society. No wonder so many come home and never talk about their wartime experiences. No wonder civilians are often reluctant to ask or say anything beyond a sincere but awkward “Thank you for your service.” People used to deal with this openly. Many ancient societies believed that killing in combat, even under legal and morally justifiable conditions, defiled the warrior. That’s a constant theme in Greek tragedy. In the Old Testament’s Book of Numbers, Moses directed anyone who had killed in battle to remain out of camp for seven days of purification. In the seventh century, by order of the archbishop of Canterbury, warriors who killed in battle underwent 40 days of penance and banishment from the church. After the Battle of Hastings in 1066, a gathering of bishops ruled that “anyone who knows he killed a man in the great battle must do penance for one year for each man he killed.” We’ve abandoned the practice of penance for wartime killing. But along with it, we’ve lost the principle of reckoning with the moral cost of battle. We send young Americans into war but no longer acknowledge what they do on our behalf. We no longer see a need, as our ancestors did, for cleansing and acceptance.The enduring silence of our veterans and our own denial of war’s realities speak volumes about the need for healing. We might start that long-overdue process by acknowledging openly that war imposes moral costs on our warriors. Then we must begin to talk to each other.Until then, Veterans Day will be an unfulfilled promise.David Wood is The Huffington Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning senior military correspondent. His book, What Have We Done: The Moral Injury of Our Longest Wars, was published Nov. 1 by Little Brown."

The eldest has marks all over his body from where [my father] would heat up a screwdriver and burn him with it.”To help women like Jamila – women with nowhere left to turn – the Superwoman Network brings together five civil society organizations. The group offers support to vulnerable women in contact with the law, such as current and released prisoners, as well as single mothers and survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).“We give them hope that life is still there,” says Amani Tabidi, executive director of one of the network’s members, the Babiker Badri Scientific Association for Women’s Studies (BBSAWS) at Ahfad University for Women in Omdurman. BBSAWS provides the women with skills training and basic literacy. It also offers “legal and psychological support to overcome stigma and economic empowerment,” says Tabidi, who is also a lecturer at Ahfad University and recruits peers to mentor the women.“Most of the women are coming from very poor communities, so they don’t have someone to help them,” she says.They also often see no way out. Last year, Rashida Manjoo, the U.N.’s Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women at the time, visited Sudan and voiced her concern about the culture of “silence and denial” when it came to the subject of SGBV. When Jamila told people about her father’s abuse, “they would tell me, ‘At the end of the day, this is your dad and may God help him,’” she says.Jamila and other SGBV victims who are trapped by violence have been able to use the Superwoman Network’s sessions on coping mechanisms to help deal with, and lessen, the abuse they suffer until they can get away from it. “The sessions changed the way I think,” says Jamila. “The situation at home is the same but I’m emotionally stronger.”Now, when Jamila’s father loses his temper, she says she uses breathing and meditation techniques to stop herself from shouting back and escalating the situation, and to calm herself afterwards.The Superwoman Network has also given Jamila cooking utensils and trained her on cookery and crafts to get her closer to her goal of freeing herself from her father’s support by setting up a baking business.Since launching last year with funding from the United Nations Development Programme and the Finnish embassy in Egypt, the Superwoman Network has helped over 30 women. The network hopes to have helped 100 women by May 2017. It’s an ambitious target in a country where public support and advocacy of women’s rights is routinely stifled.Fatima joined the network through an organization that helped her rebuild her life after female genital mutilation (FGM) nearly ruined it. The procedure made sex impossible, sometimes causing her to bleed, which traumatized both her and her husband. Through one of the other Superwoman partners, SEEMA Centre for Training and Protection of Women and Child’s Rights, which helps women affected by GBV, Fatima was able to have surgery to repair the physical damage caused by the FGM as well as counselling for her and her husband to overcome the emotional trauma.She now runs a small catering business and advocates against FGM in her own family and at SEEMA events. “This network opened my life,” she says. “Before, I was confined to my home and now I’m exposed to lots of different things and people.”The women also support one another through saving and lending groups to finance projects that will boost their status in their communities or at home.The effect trickles down to other women in their communities and to the next generation, too. Fatima’s community has stopped carrying out FGM after she found the courage to tell them what she went through.Tabidi cites other cultural changes: “Some of [the women] benefit from this project by pushing their daughters to education.”For Jamila, one of the most important things she has learned from the Superwoman Network is that she is not alone. “It taught me how to change my thoughts,” she says, “and now the life I’m living is completely different.”The names of some of the women have been changed to protect their identities.This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

The Democratic party had not only been defeated, but humbled. Its message had not resonated, and it had lost. Many of its most dedicated supporters felt lost, too. Soon after, people started widely sharing a blog post from July by documentary filmmaker Michael Moore. In it, Moore had provided five reasons why he was confident Trump would win the presidential election in November. Among them: the anger in the Midwest and of white men; the unambiguous unpopularity of Hillary Clinton; and the disaffection of Bernie Sanders supporters.In recent years, Moore has receded into the background somewhat, likely a result of a Democratic president running the show. Moore is at his best as a protestor, not a supporter, which is why his fame rose to its height during the George W. Bush administration, when he released films like “Bowling for Columbine,” “Fahrenheit 9/11” and “Sicko” and became a symbol for the everyman of the anti-war left. And it’s why his star faded during the Obama administration as well. But all the while, Moore has continued to quietly keep the pulse of Middle America in a way many others have not. It’s safe to say now that the mainstream media by and large missed or underplayed the factors cited in Moore’s blog post.We focused too much attention on tax returns and Trump’s business record, and not enough on a more general sentiment that Washington had forgotten broad swaths of the American people. Not Moore. A native of Flint, Michigan, he correctly realized the overwhelming power of feeling left behind. And now, after a few quiet years, there are signs he is returning to the spotlight with that understanding in hand, ready to fight back against the Donald J. Trump administration. While many Democrats woke up on Wednesday feeling dispirited, Moore woke up with a plan. Just after 10 a.m. ET, he published a five-point “Morning After To-Do List” to Facebook that provided a blueprint for action. The first item on that list: “Take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people.” In a moment when all felt hopeless for many Democrats, Moore’s message empowered. It resonated, too, garnering more than 416,000 likes and 211,000 shares as of press time.That night, he joined protestors in the streets of New York. Speaking to CNN’s Don Lemon later on, Moore said he felt as if the protests were “a wave of humanity” pushed along by people who are “scared for their future.” It was also clear that Moore understood the importance of seizing on the moment. “We had all those big protests before the Iraq War, and once the war started everyone stopped protesting,” Moore told The Huffington Post’s Andy Campbell at the protests. “We’ve got to keep this up. Just like Occupy Wall Street. [Except], this time, we keep it up, and we don’t stop until he’s out of there.”The next day, Moore released another to-do list. This time, there weren’t five points, but seven. After several years on the sidelines, it appears the documentary filmmaker is back where he’s comfortable: fighting the Republican establishment. And what a fight it will be. "

And I think you make good choices and bad choices in terms of lifestyle. Our expectation is that one’s genetic makeup might make one more inclined to be an arsonist or might make one more inclined to be a kleptomaniac. Do I think that they can be changed? Yes.”“What I said is that, in that regard, you can choose, people choose to be who they are, as they choose to break civil law and God’s law ... I think you can choose not to be homosexual,” he said in a 2008 interview. Blackwell, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, sought to become chair of the Republican National Committee in 2009.In 2014, he linked a mass shooting in California to the growing acceptance of same-sex marriage, saying the shooting was produced by “the crumbling of the moral foundation of the country” and the “attack on natural marriage and the family.”Trump may personally have a more moderate view on gay rights than most Republicans, but LGBTQ leaders told The New York Times they were alarmed by his victory because of the clear anti-LGBTQ stance of the Republican Party. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is now running Trump’s transition efforts, has long opposed LGBTQ rights and advocated that public funds be used for gay conversion therapy. "

55,PARENTS,Teen Told Cancer Survivor Shirt Violates School Dress Code,Taylor Pittman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teen-told-cancer-survivor-shirt-violates-school-dress-code_us_5820d62fe4b0d9ce6fbdc754,A minor detail meant he had to change clothes.,2016-11-11,A teacher told 16-year-old Tyler Powers that the logo on his cancer survivor shirt was larger than the school's dress code allowed. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5824c09f1800002a0030d3f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A teen in Florida who beat cancer and wore a shirt with the word “survivor” on it has been told his attire didn’t adhere to dress code at his high school.On Nov. 2, 16-year-old Tyler Powers wore a purple Relay for Life and American Cancer Society shirt that included the word “survivor” across the back of it to Ridgewood High School in New Port Richey, Florida. At 7 years old, Powers won his first cancer battle after being diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at age 5. He relapsed when he was 8, but was declared cancer-free at age 10.The teen told The Huffington Post he thought he grabbed a purple Ridgewood High School shirt that morning, but put on his “survivor” shirt instead. During second period, a teacher told Powers his shirt didn’t meet the school’s dress code because one of the logos on it was too large. According to the school’s dress code, logos cannot be bigger than a quarter. Powers told HuffPost the teacher then said he had to go in-school suspension to get a new shirt to wear.“I asked her where the ISS [in-school suspension] room was and she told me room 111,” Powers said. “I went down there where I had three options: I could get a change of clothes that they provide, a free Ridgewood shirt, and they would confiscate my shirt until the end of the day or I could call my parents and they would have their workday interrupted and bring me a change of clothes down or I could accept ISS and stay there all day.”Powers chose to wear a temporary shirt that the school provided for him.Linda Cobbe, communications and government relations director of Pasco County Schools, told HuffPost that Ridgewood has a modified dress code in place this year, an effort to improve academic performance and college preparation. She confirmed that the size of the logo was the issue for Powers’ shirt, but said that the teacher provided him with a different shirt and that Powers was not sent to in-school suspension.In a statement, she noted that Powers was only at school for part of the day (Powers takes classes at a local college) and that the faculty at Ridgewood “can’t discriminate by allowing one student to wear a special shirt” (emphasis hers):On November 2, a young man who attends the school for one period per day showed up in a shirt that violated the dress code. His teacher noted that he had a shirt with a logo that violated the logo size limitations and asked him if he had another shirt to change into. He said no. She then asked him if someone could bring him a different shirt and he said no, so she asked him what size he wore and then got him a school-provided shirt. She never noticed what was on his shirt and he never mentioned anything about being a cancer survivor; the school never knew he was a cancer survivor. If he had said something, the teacher would have listened empathetically and explained to him how the logo size limit applies to all shirts and that they can’t discriminate by allowing one student to wear a special shirt. In high school, they hold students accountable for knowing rules, processes and procedures.Since the incident, Powers has been speaking out about the “extremely strict” dress code at his school. He told HuffPost several students have said they disagree with the standards, including his friend whose brother is in the army and who was told to change out of his sibling’s platoon shirt. On Sunday, Powers wrote on Facebook that he is the junior class president at Ridgewood and noted that he wants to be a “voice” for his fellow classmates.“I was not elected by the staff of Ridgewood, I was elected by the students of Ridgewood High School,” he wrote. “With that being said, I represent the students, not the administration.”Along with the students, Powers’ mom, Dorothy Powers, stands by her son and supports his decision to speak out about his school’s dress code.“He has a voice and he is using it,” she said. “Couldn’t be more proud!”Powers said he met with an assistant principal at his school to discuss what happened, but that “nothing got resolved.” He plans to stand by his class and continue being vocal about Ridgewood’s dress code.“I in no way, shape or form see how an American Cancer Society shirt, a shirt that promotes a positive influence, from a nonprofit foundation that cures diseases would have more of a distraction than pulling a student out of class ... to get a new shirt.”"
56,POLITICS,The Democratic Party Has Exploded,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-party-future_us_5824caf6e4b0c56101d5ec05,The years in the wilderness will be brutal.,2016-11-11,"Hillary Clinton speaks during a post-election press conference on Nov. 9, 2016 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5824cc711500002600b0c2b5.jpeg?cache=RDATIzU8ah&ops=crop_163_207_3137_1257%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The Democratic Party exploded Tuesday night. There will be months of finger-pointing and internal reprisals over exactly what Democrats should have done differently. But the shocking thoroughness of the defeat is plain. Donald Trump ― a man who opened his presidential campaign by calling Mexicans “rapists” ― bested Mitt Romney’s share of the Latino vote by 8 percentage points. He performed better among black voters than his 2012 predecessor, and he swept four Rust Belt states that President Barack Obama carried twice ― Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin ― under a harsher economy than we face today. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, which should matter, but does not.How did this happen, and what now?The exit polls provide some clarity: A significant chunk of Obama voters flipped to Trump. Trump won 10 percent of voters who approve of Obama’s presidency and 23 percent of voters who think the next president should “be more liberal,” according to CNN data. Trump significantly outperformed Romney among union households. He did 14 points better than Romney among whites without a college degree, according to The New York Times, and 16 points better among households with less than $30,000 in income. The Trump Democrat turns out not to be a myth, but a meaningful constituency that just cost Clinton the presidency.Listen to The Huffington Post’s analysis of the 2016 election in the latest episode of the politics podcast “So, That Happened,” embedded below:Optimistic Democrats have long believed the voter coalition behind Obama ― young people, brown people, lower-income people and a sprinkling of white professionals ― was a stable and growing majority that could always put Democrats over the top. Instead, its success in 2008 and 2012 may have had more to do with a uniquely talented politician who also happened to be the first black president.Obama also glued together two otherwise hostile ideological factions within the Democratic Party. Time magazine hailed him as the second coming of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, while he declared himself a member of the corporate-friendly, free-trading New Democrat coalition. Millions of Americans who love Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) also love Obama. So do well-heeled technocrats who admire President Bill Clinton and economist Larry Summers. This was reflected in Obama’s policy achievements. He expanded access to health insurance for millions of people and signed trade deals that undermined workers and enriched CEOs.That same duality permeates Congress, where New Democrats have been battling New Dealers for 45 years. It is simply not clear that another politician is capable of keeping that team united. Here’s how things were supposed to work: Clinton would call the shots, but work with Warren on cabinet appointments and key administrative posts. Things wouldn’t always go Warren’s way, but Clinton would throw enough bones to the populists to keep them engaged. Clinton could pursue a centrist agenda with a few progressive items and the party would stick together. Instead, a dominance struggle between Sanders supporters and the Steny Hoyer wing of the party is already underway. Raul Grijalva, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is calling for a “complete restructuring” of the Democratic National Committee, and Sanders is promoting nominees.The Clintons have been on the national stage for nearly a quarter of a century. An entire generation of Democratic operatives has grown up in a world in which it was always understood that the family would be a nexus of political power. This cohort expected to inherit the levers of government and is now without a patron. That fact, for the moment, gives progressives the upper hand in directing the party’s future. But because Democrats are certain to suffer devastating policy defeats under Trump and a GOP Congress, there will be no legislative victories that either faction can point to as proof its worldview can work. And further electoral losses are on the horizon. The 2018 map is terrible for Democrats ― five of their senators are up for re-election in Republican-dominated states, and four more in swing states. The losing side in the party leadership battle will be pissed off for a long time.The American left, meanwhile, is a difficult beast to corral. The Sanders coalition wasn’t monolithic ― it included plenty of New Dealer populists, but it also brought in capital-S hammer-and-sickle Socialists who don’t really like the Democratic Party. Even under a progressive takeover, we can expect the bitter intellectual feuds between Bernie Bros and Hillary Bots to shift down the ideological spectrum.Many are interpreting Trump’s election as a white supremacist backlash against the first black president and misogynist fear of a first woman president. After Trump’s vile campaign, it is impossible to conclude these were not significant factors. But ugly attitudes don’t simply fall out of the sky, eternal and inflexible. A new paper from economists Rob Johnson and Arjun Jayadev looks at economic downturns from 1979 to 2014, and finds a tight correlation between unemployment and racism ― the higher the unemployment rate, the more ubiquitous the discrimination. A 2014 study from New York University psychologists found that racial animosity hardens under economic scarcity. Last year, three German economists found that “far-right” political parties almost always make significant gains after a financial crisis.This doesn’t mean that economic insecurity is the sole cause of racism, but it does suggest that it can be a cause. They call it the Rust Belt for a reason. If Democrats want to stamp out the views that made President Trump possible, they will have to do a better job delivering economic gains to working people.“We have been fighting out elections in general on a lot of noneconomic issues over the past 30 years,” Clinton recently told the New Yorker’s George Packer. “We haven’t had a coherent, compelling economic case.”Indeed.“So, That Happened” is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney and produced, edited and engineered by Christine Conetta.To listen to this podcast later, download our show on iTunes.

57,POLITICS,A Message For Muslims About Donald Trump's Election,"Harris Zafar, ContributorAuthor of Demystifying Islam, Adjunct Professor & National Spo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-message-for-muslims-about-donald-trumps-election_us_5825e77ae4b0852d9ec214d0,"The long, taxing, and often uncomfortable 2016 Presidential race has finally concluded. And although the majority of voters",2016-11-11,<p>Americans (including Muslims) have taken to the streets around the country to protest against the results of the 2016 Presidential Elections.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58289594180000180030dba9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The long, taxing, and often uncomfortable 2016 Presidential race has finally concluded. And although the majority of voters (52.5%) did not get the result they wanted, we now have a President-elect in Donald J. Trump who will be sworn into the office of the Presidency in just two months. The aggressive and divisive nature of this election cycle demonstrates that political discourse has grown increasingly polarized. And as the dust settles, while some Americans celebrate a victory, others feel unhappiness and some even grapple with considerable fear.For American Muslims, being a group that has been specifically targeted and vilified by the winning party’s candidate for over a year, Muslims have expressed fear that their antagonist will gain authority and power over this nation. Some Muslims have joined the thousands of diverse Americans who have taken to the streets protesting the election results, chanting “Not my President.” Others have expressed a confrontational willingness to stand up to the new President with the message that “American Muslims are here to stay.”As a devout Muslim born and raised here in the U.S., I would like to address my fellow Muslim sisters and brothers on paving a path forward with strength and dignity – one deep-rooted in pride of our identity as Muslims and grounded in the teachings of our Islamic faith. Do not worry about the result of this election or about a Trump presidency. Our job in a democracy is to give our support to the candidate we believe will do the best job. After doing our part as civic minded citizens, we put our trust in God, who is the greatest of protectors.God tells us in the Quran: “put thy trust in Allah. Surely, Allah loves those who put their trust in Him. If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, then who is there that can help you beside Him? In Allah, then, let the believers put their trust” (Quran, 3:160). Of course, putting our trust in God does not mean to disregard the material or physical means of making an effort. Instead, Islam teaches that trust means to first use all our resources to make our best efforts and then to place our trust in God to bless those efforts with the right or best outcome.Since Islam requires its believers to be loyal and law abiding citizens in whichever country they reside, it is incumbent for us to be the ones who respect and promote orderliness and unity. It’s no mystery that Muslims are targeted, as we even learned of the attack on a Muslim woman in San Jose. But there is no room in our faith to create unrest or disturbance in society. We are peaceful and law-abiding Muslims, which is why I will not take to the streets or protest against this election in any way. Confronting law enforcement, blocking streets for average Americans, or refusing to accept election results does not promote unity and orderliness.Certainly I, too, have spoken out many times against Donald Trump’s horrible comments about Muslims throughout this campaign – from suggestions of having a database where all Muslims should be registered to banning Muslim entry into the country. And I will continue to voice disagreement when anyone proposes to take away people’s rights. But with the nation (and the world) already in a state of perpetual chaos, disturbance and even uprisings, a sitting president of the United States could not implement such ideas as it would certainly lead to chaos and even a civil war. The likelihood is very slim that the president attempts to put into practice what he said in his campaign. And even if some vain efforts are made to usurp our rights, remember God’s words in the Quran that with His help, nobody can overcome you.Islam commands Muslims to “obey Allah, and obey His Messenger and those who are in authority among you” (Quran, 4:60). Obedience to the authority of our nation as constituted by our law is, in reality, an extension of obedience to God and His messenger. According to the Prophet Muhammad, “A Muslim has to listen to and obey (the order of his ruler) whether he likes it or not, as long as his orders involve not one in disobedience (to Allah).” Thus, anything short of being forced to sin should be met with civil obedience. The Prophet went so far as commanding his followers to listen to and obey their ruler, even if they may despise him. Of course this does not prohibit us from expressing dissent or disagreement, but we are expected to do so peacefully, without compromising peace and orderliness of society.The best course of action is to wait and see what President Trump’s policies actually turn out to be and what he actively seeks to implement. We should support any good policies and work with our elected leaders. If there are any policies in which he seems to discriminate against any group (whether Muslims or others), that is when we work within the lawful procedures to push back and protect the rights of all people. Instead of giving up or resigning to despair, we will remain loyal and active members of the American society and will continue to pray for this country.Ultimately our goal is peace and justice. As Americans, we can all work collectively across the religious, social, political and economic divides to get there together. If our new President commits to that idea, I’m ready to support my country."

Motherhood was not that way for me.It's late. I am working on a blog post and my oldest son is snuggled right beside me in bed. I look down to admire his fair skin and wavy blonde hair. He'll be three in January and I can hardly believe it; I swear I was just holding him in my arms for hours on end. The desire to become a mother first hit me in 2011. Before that time I was convinced that having kids wasn’t for me. Perhaps my time volunteering in orphanages contributed to my belief that the world had plenty of children that needed love. It may have been approaching thirty five years old, or my excitement about creating a business that was thriving. In any case, I felt the urge to have babies. As fulfilling as it was to have a booming business, the fast pace of downtown San Diego had taken its toll on me. I wanted more time to take care of myself so I could be in absolutely the best health before getting pregnant. The obvious next step for me was to get out of the U.S. and travel. Our plan was to move to Albania in early 2012, get pregnant, and raise our kids there. It felt like a solid plan. Surely spending my days lying on the empty beaches of Saranda would be enough to relax me. The slow pace of life was exactly what we needed, and we took time to explore not only Albania, but also Greece and Montenegro. We celebrated our fifth wedding anniversary at the Sveti Stefan. Having our first overseas adventure as a couple was incredibly bonding and a breath of fresh air. Our time there turned out to be everything we hoped it would be, except for the baby part. I never got pregnant and I was beyond disappointed. I was devastated. I lost my focus and gave up on my dream. As a result, we returned to the States in the fall and that alone threw me into depression. Being back in my home town was anything but comforting. Instead, it was a daily reminder that I was not where I wanted to be, both figuratively and literally. It was an extra cold winter that year and, as a way of lifting our spirits, we took a train ride in Durango on New Year’s Day. I can't stand to be cold but on this day I almost welcomed it. I wanted to be numbed from the pain I was feeling. There was a father with two little boys sitting front of us who kept taking their jackets off in spite of below zero temperatures, and had a fascination with sticking their heads out the rattling windows. I wondered if I would ever have two little boys, and if I would ever get back to traveling. A couple weeks later I had the idea to return to the practice that had soothed me in the past: I decided to open a yoga studio. There was no studio yet in Cortez, and it would give me a reason to get out of bed every morning. I found the perfect little spot on Main Street. The grand opening was in April, and immediately after the celebration I found out I was pregnant. I ran through our house unable to contain the joy I felt. I wanted to run through the streets and announce the news to every single person I met. My next thought was, We have to live outside the U.S. Having a family and traveling go hand in hand for me. It was my travels, after all, that showed me the value of family. It was outside of my home country where I witnessed how children and elders are to be treated. I felt a steel determination take over at that moment. The new life within me inspired me to find a way to create a lifestyle that was conducive to a rich family life. You see, these were the only circumstances under which I wanted to be a mother. I see how Americans do family, work, and relationships. I know what is accepted by the masses, but I was never willing to accept it. I do not want to raise my kids in the United States. There. I said it. Burn me at the stake but I won't change my mind. I am unwilling to send my kids to be taken care of by someone else all day long. I will not work for another person, giving them forty, sixty, or even eighty hours a week of my precious life. I absolutely will not sit in traffic for one or two or more hours a day so I can buy a big house, drive a nice car and appear to be living the dream. That is not my dream. I have one gift that I wish to give my children, and that is the gift of a happy mother. It's not easy being a happy mom when you are balancing work, marriage, and self all at the speed of light. I won't bow to a culture that insists I put a greater emphasis on material possessions than on anything else. I won't succumb to a norm that preaches success at any cost. I will put people first. I will put experiences high on my priority list. I will keep my children by my side in this adventure called life, and I will travel with them to every amazing and beautiful place that calls our name. I will give my husband the space in my life needed to cultivate intimacy and deep love. And last but not least, I will pave the way for other mothers. For those who are brave enough to say, ‘There must be a better way,’ I can assure you that there is. Today I'm watching my two little boys run through the hotel lobby as we vacation in Mexico City. I'm seeing my dreams in physical reality. Motherhood and the lifestyle I dreamed of did not happen on my timeline or according to my plan. I had to first learn that I could trust my body, the Universe and the desires of my future children. I had to give up control. I had to release my plan no matter how solid and well thought out it seemed to be. Now it doesn’t matter how it all came together. I am full of gratitude that we are traveling and that we are redefining what family, work, and relationships look like.I don’t know what dream you may be holding onto by a thread, but I want you to encourage you. Your dreams aren’t too much. They aren’t too complex. They aren’t too unconventional. Your dreams are in your heart because you have the capacity to manifest them. Some days the right thing may be for you to hang on and on other days, know it’s ok to let go. May you find comfort in a divine distraction and strength for the unique way the Universe delivers your desires to you."

The first notification read: Donald Trump to win enough Electoral Votes for U.S. presidency.I put my phone back down. I wasn’t sure what to do with myself. I wanted to go to the gym and workout my frustration. I wanted to get back in bed and call-out of work. I wanted to do anything else but accept this current reality. So I started to write.I watched the cursor blink at the top of the blank page, questioning what it was that I wanted to write about. I stared back at it unsure. The only thing I felt like writing was “I’m sorry.” I thought we were better than this.To the women I know, all of my female friends (who are most of them) and my female loved ones, I’m sorry. I’m sorry that the majority of the country you live in didn’t care about the chauvinistic, abusive language. I’m sorry that they didn’t care about the toxic masculinity and misogyny. I’m sorry that they didn’t care about your right to have a say in what happens to your bodies. I’m sorry that, for the 45th time, a man holds the highest office despite how qualified the woman was.To the people I know and love who belong to the LGBTQ community, I’m sorry. I’m sorry that the man who held a rainbow flag with his name poorly written on it in Sharpie is masquerading as your “champion.” Especially when his Number Two believes that you can be “converted.” I’m sorry that the argument over what fucking bathroom you have to use is only going to get worse. I’m sorry.To my friends whose skin is black, I’m sorry. I’m sorry that your President thinks you “come from the inner cities” and thinks “you already have nothing to lose.” I’m sorry that he believes that the solution to your problems is “law and order.” I’m sorry that the first Black American to be the president of the United States of America was replaced by a white man who thinks that $1 million is a “small loan.”To any Latina or Latino who may believe that this is no longer their America, I’m sorry. You make America great. Inclusion is what makes America great. My family came here as immigrants, albeit a long time ago. You don’t belong here any less just because the decade is different. I’m sorry if the man in the ill-fitting suit makes you believe differently. He’s wrong.To those of the Muslim faith, I’m sorry. You are not “a Muslim.” You are not “a terrorist.” You are an American. You are faithful. You are good. I’m sorry that we forgot that the First Amendment doesn’t just protect our right to say mean things to each other. I’m sorry that we started to assume the worst. I think it’s because we’re scared. That’s not an excuse. The actions of a minority shouldn’t speak for a quarter of the world’s population and I’m sorry that we think they do.Look, it may be odd that I’m apologizing on behalf of half the country ― I didn’t vote for him. But I don’t know what else to do. I won’t look for a way out or brush up on how to become a Canadian citizen. I will continue to take a stand on what I believe in. We’ve made a lot of progress over the last eight years. It was progress that we fought hard for. We’re just going to have to keep fighting.Here’s the thing though: When I checked my phone this morning, I felt one very odd realization... things will not change for me. As a straight, white, male, this doesn’t affect me like it affects you. And that’s shitty.And I’m sorry.This post originally appeared on Thread Lightly."

And at the risk of being whiny; mostly the female demographic has fallen victim to this misogyny, chauvinism or just utter ostracization for no good reason.We already knew this, but Trump (involuntarily?) reminded us that much hasn’t changed in the last decade or century or ever? Despite all the progress that’s been made with women’s rights and celebrity activists, you would think people would learn how not to be sexist. But apparently, not so much...Trump’s outdated (not to mention blatantly ignorant) views not only set women back 50 years, but reinforce that certain generalizations should remain “right” for a reason; such as women being disposable in the workforce because of their biological properties to become nurturers or stay-at-home moms (not necessarily correct), being to blame as victims of sexual harassment/assault (because of their bodies or sex appeal), and using such to blur the lines as to what he can pass off as “normal” groping i.e a form of physical invasion (”grabbing them by the ____”).In a way, Trump’s perspectives stimulate our minds and allow us to rebel with a cause; if you will. Our critical thinking gives us all the ammunition we need to break each dangerous stereotype; surrounding the health and well-being of women.First of all, Trump, you can’t just grab anyone by the (you know what)...or anywhere, for that matter. Unless you have their permission to, of course. Suggesting otherwise just imposes the idea on others that if you - all omnipresent, omniscient force in our nation - are permitted to do so, then it’s not only okay but glorified to repeat your behaviour as well. Secondly, it inadvertently challenges the boundaries as to what’s considered appropriate contact. And if it isn’t obvious enough already, touching anyone without their consent not only directly violates their privacy but diminishes the rights to their own body. Promoting such false logic doesn’t just condone men (or anyone) in general to manipulate or coerce anyone against their will (even if it is just touching); but encourages the ambiguity of what is deemed sexual assault so others can get away with doing it more and impede women with coming forward with their traumatic experiences. Describing women solely based on their appearances and bodies (including that of your own daughter) further demeans and degrades them to be perceived as objects void of emotion or voice. This talk strips away with their freedoms and rights to say “no”; blaming themselves on the way they dress, how sober they were, or if they were flirtatious...on something someone else did TO them. Establishing a codependency, a syndrome to protect or take accountability for another’s actions out of their control. This is the worst kind of crime against women, and we’re appalled that someone with this much authority to inspire difference is utilizing his power in this way.This not only specifically addresses such issues of sexual harassment and assault; but essentially speculates concerns of the role of the women in general...the injustice that is thrown at her every single day. Being paid less than her male counterparts, being treated as expendable in a heteronormative and patriarchal workplace, being automatically blamed as the next girlfriend or the other woman, being instantaneously casted as the cliquey female friend, fetishizing the woman’s body for its shape and shaming/blaming it for deserving certain incidents because of the way it appears - the list goes on!All of this is primarily due to the superficial assumptions and old-school ideologies of the “man”. At the risk of sounding hypocritical, this is the reality we created. We should know better than to excuse blaming women for a man’s initiation of occurrences; if even by participating in his advances, the ulterior motives of his were there. We need to stop segregating women and making them feel like second-class citizens. When we treat women a certain way because of the way they look, the way their bodies are shaped, or just being the gender they are...we are teaching our daughters that this is all right, and that’s the last thing we need."

In some sense, it is to fulfill a longing in our collective psyche. Humanity has dreamed",2016-11-11,"The Delta IV Heavy rocket with the Orion spacecraft lifts off from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida December 5, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5825e0801800002a0030d6e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Why should humans venture to Mars? In some sense, it is to fulfill a longing in our collective psyche. Humanity has dreamed of walking on Mars since travel above the Earth’s surface became feasible... Those dreams seemed to be on the verge of being realized with the dawn of the Space Age in the mid-20th Century, but for decades Mars remained out of reach to human explorers on site. That frustrating situation has resulted in what many have come to see as Mars being perpetually “20 years away.” In the terminology used for space launches, we have been in a “hold” for the past 30 years. Today, however, we can finally say that the countdown clock is running. We are going to Mars, twenty years and counting! If we stay the course, the first humans will set foot on the Red Planet by the year 2033.New technologies have become available that have allowed us to take a fresh look at how to approach human Mars missions and, as a result, to tackle the hardest technical problems that had previously led to a hold in the countdown. And these approaches have given us the ability to design an architecture that can be brought on line incrementally, which keeps the annual expenditures within a reasonable projected NASA human spaceflight budget.The key to this architecture is to separate much of the supplies and equipment and send them in advance of the crew. By prepositioning equipment, supplies, and even return rocket stages (more than 80 percent of the total mass), using propulsion systems such as solar electric propulsion (SEP) that are extremely energy efficient for long-haul cargo missions, we can save more than half the costs versus transporting everything using chemical propulsion systems that are needed to reach orbit.On the other hand, the Space Launch System (SLS) is the key to placing large blocks of payload into Earth orbit. An analogy here on Earth would be how intermodal shipping of supplies and manufactured goods is accomplished. Short haul is accomplished by trucks or rail, while long haul is accomplished by massive ships. In this same way, SLS accomplishes the short haul mission to orbit, whereas the cargo is transported over the much larger distance to Mars by solar electric transport ships. The two different propulsion systems, each of which is appropriate for its particular type of mission, are complementary. And to transport the astronauts, we add in a third element: the Orion multi-purpose crew vehicle as well as a deep-space habitat module, which together provide living space and life support systems.Once all the elements arrive in Mars orbit, the final two pieces of the mission come into play. Improved entry, descent, and landing (EDL) approaches will safely and precisely land larger payloads on the surface. The largest payload elements, such as the surface habitat and the ascent vehicle to return the crew to Mars orbit, weigh 30 to 40 metric tons. Today we know how to land only one metric ton on Mars, so this is one of the challenges that still need to be overcome. However, NASA is already working on improved decelerators and other techniques such as supersonic retro propulsion. Such technologies need to be perfected within the next ten years, because the most massive payload elements will need about four years to be prepositioned. Once all of these are safely in Mars orbit, the crew can launch for the roughly seven-month transfer to Mars using cryogenic chemical propulsion stages to propel Orion and the deep space transit habitat.The power of this approach is that we can use in-space technologies that we already know work well and scale them up to accomplish the first Mars missions. Other technologies, such as on-orbit refueling or nuclear thermal propulsion, can be proven and incorporated later as they are matured. The ultimate goal of manufacturing propellant from space resources, however, requires several steps before we can utilize such methods. First, we must locate the resources and determine their abundance. Next, methods of extracting and processing the material must be developed. Then the process of manufacturing the desired propellant, such as oxygen and methane, in the quantities required must be proven in either deep space or on the planetary surface. Therefore, while in-situ propellant production is a very attractive ultimate goal, it does not make sense to place in the critical path for the first missions.Mars is within our grasp. With a sustained program of risk reduction activities over the next 10 to 15 years, we will eliminate the knowledge gaps that still remain and we will build up an infrastructure that is capable of sustaining human missions of ever-increasing capability. As we mature approaches that improve upon this architecture, we will incorporate them into the overall structure. We need to take the first step that proves the possibility. Mars beckons us and we may be living now at the perfect time – a combination of technology readiness, public interest, and political will – to answer that call.Joe Cassady is Executive Director, Space, Aerojet RocketdyneThis piece is part of a special op-ed series, curated in partnership with Explore Mars, in which contributors from diverse fields such as science, education, policy, business and culture answer a simple question: “Why Mars?” For more, follow the links below or visit exploremars.org."
62,QUEER VOICES,So Much More than Sour Grapes,"Annie L. Scholl, ContributorWriter. Photographer. Human being who loves.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/so-much-more-than-sour-grapes_us_58251fdce4b02b1f52579ede,"Election night, my wife and I went out to eat at a Thai and sushi restaurant about 10 miles from our home in rural Central",2016-11-11,<p>The author (left) and her wife at their home in rural North Carolina. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5825233d1800002d0030d577.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Election night, my wife and I went out to eat at a Thai and sushi restaurant about 10 miles from our home in rural Central North Carolina. I had been there months ago to get a bowl of soup, but it was her first time. When we walked into the small restaurant, it felt like we had just walked into a private party — uninvited. Every face, except for the waitress, was white. Every head of hair was varying shades of gray.What were they seeing that caused them to stare, long after we were seated? Was it my wife’s beautiful, shoulder-length locs, tinged with their own grayness? My short platinum hair, in need of a touch-up? The two of us — white and black — together?We settled in this predominantly white, predominantly Christian, predominantly Republican county three years ago. We moved here from our apartment in Brooklyn, N.Y, so my wife could spend the last days of her mother’s life with her.We live on a piece of land that we’re told again and again is the most beautiful in the county. We have kind neighbors, helpful neighbors — neighbors who panicked when we told them we were considering moving closer to Raleigh-Durham last spring after my mother-in-law passed. They didn’t want to lose us, they said. “It’s hard to find good neighbors,” they said.After Trump’s vulgar “Access Hollywood” comments came to light in early October, one of my neighbor’s asked what I thought. We talked for over a half hour, each of us respectfully sharing our opinions. He thanked me for telling him I planned to vote for Hillary Clinton — I was the first who admitted that to him, he said. “I still love ya anyway,” he said before going home to watch the presidential debate that night.While my neighbor would later put two Donald Trump signs in his yard, I couldn’t bring myself to post a Clinton one. While she had my vote, Clinton didn’t have my adoration. My vote for her was a vote against him, plain and simple. I wasn’t willing to risk what felt like potential harm to myself, my wife, our home for someone I wasn’t passionately supporting.Now I’m left to wonder if I should have done more than vote.In the early morning hours after learning Trump had won, I sat in bed holding my wife as she cried. She wasn’t crying because her team had lost. She was crying because she feared that what has been gained through the hard work of so many for so long now has the potential to be lost.Civil rights. Gay rights. Human rights.Poof.The Pollyanna in me wanted to tell her not to go down that rabbit hole — to keep her focus on what she wants, not on what she doesn’t want. I even suggested that Trump’s victory must be for the highest good or it wouldn’t be happening, which rang hollow even as it was coming out of my mouth.My own tears and fears would rise up and spill out later in the day while I sat at my desk listening to people drive by honking and hooting at my neighbor’s pro-Trump signs. The sound gave me the same sickening feeling I had listening to Billy Bush and the other men on the Access Hollywood tape laughing as Trump talked of kissing and grabbing women by the “pussy” — because, as a “star,” he could.In the afternoon, one of my family members, a Trump supporter, called to check on me. She showed compassion when I cried and couldn’t talk. She tried her best to understand what was behind my tears, even though I found it impossible to explain.Today, this piece by John Pavlovitz, a Raleigh pastor, helps me to understand better what I am feeling — that this isn’t “just sour grapes” about losing an election. It’s about this:“Every horrible thing Donald Trump ever said about women or Muslims or people of color has now been validated.Every profanity-laced press conference and every call to bully protestors and every ignorant diatribe has been endorsed.Every piece of anti-LGBTQ legislation Mike Pence has championed has been signed-off on.Half of our country has declared these things acceptable, noble, American. This is the disconnect and the source of our grief today. It isn’t a political defeat that we’re lamenting, it’s a defeat for Humanity.”I, like Pavolvitz, feel now as though I’m living in “enemy territory.” I feel that especially so living in a county where 77 percent of the people believe that someone who has spewed hate and vulgarity deserves to lead our beautiful country.I find myself looking at the blue states, imaging a move to Vermont or back to Colorado, where I lived for about a year.“We wake up today in a home we no longer recognize,” Pavolvitz writes. “We are grieving the loss of a place we used to love but no longer do. This may be America today but it is not the America we believe in or recognize or want.”Like Pavolvitz, I am grieving, but I’m also hopeful. Hopeful that I’m wrong about Trump. Hopeful that my marriage remains recognized as just that — and that other same-sex couples won’t lose their right to marry. Hopeful that my Muslim friends and those they love are safe. Hopeful that my wife’s daughter and her longtime girlfriend, both black and lesbian, will be safe, too.Hopeful that Mr. Trump meant what he said in his victory speech: “We have to bind the wounds of division. We have to get together.”Hopeful, mostly, that love really does trump hate.This post originally published on anniescholl.com. "

Fitzpatrick’s career-topping year included 31 touchdown passes (tied with Aaron Rodgers for 10th in the league) and nearly 4,000 yards passing while leading the Jets to a near-playoff berth under first-year head coach Todd Bowles. However, for Fitzpatrick and Bowles, 2016 has been a completely different story. After holding out for much of training camp before inking a new contract, the 33-year-old Fitzpatrick has been nothing short of awful, and with no sign of improvement.First came his six interceptions in a Week 3 loss to Kansas City. Then came three more the next week in a loss to Seattle and, later, a 174-yard effort during an embarrassing 28-3 Monday Night Football drubbing by Arizona.Fitzpatrick, after being benched only to fill in for the injured Geno Smith and lead the Jets to a comeback win over Baltimore in Week 7, expressed his frustration with the organization: “When the owner stops believing in you and the GM stops believing in you and the coaches stop believing in you, sometimes all you have is yourself. That’s something I’ve had to deal with before, something I’m dealing with now.”Whether Fitzpatrick was right about owner Woody Johnson is debatable. What is not debatable, though, is that with him under center the team has amassed a measly 3-6 record, well on its way to a sixth consecutive season missing the playoffs. Fitzpatrick’s 13 picks, meanwhile, are the most by a landslide, and he ranks dead last in both completion percentage and quarterback rating.However, if there remains a silver lining to a string of losses, it’s that you can begin to take chances you otherwise wouldn’t consider if things were going well.Bottom line: It would behoove the Jets to start exploring this concept, namely at the quarterback position. While the Geno Smith experiment has been a flat-out disaster since Day One ― he’s now injured for the remainder of the season ― we cannot say the same about Bryce Petty.Petty, the team’s fourth-rounder in the 2015 draft, produced a highly prolific career at spread-happy Baylor in the Big 12, totaling a remarkable 62 touchdown passes and more than 8,000 yards in two years as a starter. At 6 feet 3 inches and 230 pounds, Petty possesses the trademark size and arm strength NFL general managers covet.Of course, like the heavily maligned Jared Goff in Los Angeles, Petty worked solely out of the shotgun in college without the distinct responsibility of calling plays from the huddle.Perhaps Petty is no more than a career backup at this level. Or, perhaps he is a hidden gem, who might just surprise us all. We will never know so long as the ineffective Fitzpatrick remains QB1.Maybe Bowles ― who has repeatedly said Fitzpatrick gives his team the best chance to win ― has received pressure from his front office to play Fitzpatrick, considering that just this past July he inked a one-year, fully guaranteed $12 million deal. Or maybe Bowles believes the 25-year-old Petty simply is not ready to command the starting position. But isn’t it time to find out, one way or the other, if Petty is that guy? Or, at the very least, if he can become that guy?At this point we know for certain what Fitzpatrick is ― and what Smith is for that matter. And neither is inspiring.The Jets ― despite losing receiver Eric Decker for the rest of the year ― still have viable offensive weapons at their disposal in running back Matt Forte and six-time Pro Bowl wideout Brandon Marshall. In other words, the cupboard isn’t bare for Petty, and with seven games left, the franchise can find out whether it needs to get another quarterback in the offseason. Remember, too, that the league has never before seen such an influx of young quarterbacks yielding such positive results. This isn’t to say that Petty will be nearly flawless like Derek Carr in Oakland or accumulate numbers like the impressive Dak Prescott in Dallas, but who’s to say he won’t.Fitzpatrick appears to understand just how inept he’s been too, particularly after tossing two more interceptions in Sunday’s 27-23 loss to Miami. “As the quarterback and the guy that’s making a lot of the final decisions,” he said, “whether it’s to throw the ball or whether to run or check to the pass or vice versa, a lot of it falls on the quarterback.”In the NFL at least, it always does. The “Fitzmagic” of 2015 is long gone. The Jets’ remaining schedule is brutal, with two tilts against New England left, along with games against quality defenses like the Rams and Bills. To be sure, nothing gets easier.For Bowles, for this franchise and for its fans, the time has come to turn the page and start fresh with the younger and possibly more electric Petty.

As such, the pieces on display are created with dull pencils, ballpoint pen ink tubes, letter-sized paper and other limited materials that prisoners are given access to. Other artists took to innovative methods, such as filling an asthma inhaler with Kool-Aid to produce an air-brushed painting, in creating their work. The show is a collaborative effort between Tatiana von Furstenberg and Black and Pink, an advocacy organization for LGBTQ inmates. An actress, writer and director, von Furstenberg ― whose mother is the famed designer, Diane ― first discovered Black and Pink’s newsletter four years ago. After being impressed by the artwork in the newsletter, she felt compelled to mount an exhibition after taking out an ad in the newsletter asking for submissions. “On The Inside” aims to give viewers a “human connection with our brothers and sisters behind bars,” as well as highlight inequality among LGBTQ people in America’s prisons, von Furstenberg told The Huffington Post. “The art in the show reflects so much talent and poetry and emotion,” she added. “My hope is when people attend the show and see the genuine expression of humanity and talent, that a human connection will be formed between those of us lucky enough to be on the outside to those of us who have been marginalized way before prison, who have lacked the privilege.” The statistics around prisoners who identify as LGBTQ are staggering. A 2014 report by the National Center for Transgender Equality found that prisoners who identified as “non-heterosexual” were three times more likely to report sexual abuse than those who did not. Other forms of mistreatment, including humiliation and degradation from both fellow prisoners and prison staff, were also common, according to the report. Take a look at a selection of pieces from “On The Inside” below.You can read more about the exhibit here. "

The right-to-farm question would have amended the Oklahoma state constitution to protect farmers and ranchers from any new local or state regulations that would limit their use of agricultural technology or livestock or ranching practices unless the regulations were deemed to be “justified by a compelling state interest.”Both chambers of the statehouse overwhelmingly approved putting the measure on the ballot last year.

Keith Ellison has been floated as a possible DNC chair by Sen. Bernie Sanders.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5824e0201800002d00503675.jpeg?cache=1CsvsKL23m&ops=crop_0_35_1998_1156%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Keith Ellison, a leading progressive voice in Congress and one of only two Muslim Americans in the House of Representatives, has his eyes on becoming the next chair of the Democratic National Committee.The Minnesota Democrat has been planning a run for weeks, and has begun informally talking to other party lawmakers and insiders about his prospects for the post, several sources have told The Huffington Post. His name was floated as a possible DNC chair by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday morning, giving him the type of institutional progressive support that would make his candidacy formidable. MoveOn.org, a major progressive network, also said in a statement that Ellison would be “an excellent DNC chair.” Ellison’s identity as a black man and the first Muslim member of Congress would serve as a symbolic rebuke to President-elect Donald Trump. And his ties to Sanders would give him credibility in the progressive community that feels the party has catered too much to elite interests. He is also regarded as a savvy television presence ― which seems likely to be a major requirement for the job in the age when Democrats are out of power in every branch of government. But Ellison will face his share of pushback, both because he is not known as a prolific fundraiser and because he wouldn’t be able to hold the chairmanship as his sole job. “What I think his biggest hurdle is is the notion that we will have another part-time chair,” said a top Democratic Party official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “It proved to be hugely problematic for a number of reasons this last time around. There are a number of reasons [former chair] Debbie Wasserman Schultz was wrong to begin with. But one of them is she had to pay attention to her work in Congress and any political blind spots she had to deal with.” Usually, the DNC chair is effectively selected by a Democratic president, but in years when the leadership changes to a Republican administration, the head of the party is chosen by a vote of state and local party officials and delegates. The overwhelming majority of Democratic officials supported Hillary Clinton in the presidential primary. The top Democratic Party official noted that President Barack Obama is not yet out of office and could weigh in with his own suggestion ― privately or publicly ― on who should replace interim Chair Donna Brazile, whose term ends in March 2017.

Trump is redefining the Republican Party's long-held core tenets.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – Republicans who for decades have venerated Ronald Reagan’s three-legged stool as a symbol for the party can probably chuck it now in favor of Donald Trump’s gold-trimmed jetliner.Because the amalgam of economic, social and foreign policy conservatisms that has defined the party for decades is now under the control of a thrice-married New Yorker who’s threatened to tear up trade agreements and suggested cutting back on the U.S. commitment to NATO.“We’re going to have to broaden the definition of conservative,” allowed one top Republican National Committee member who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He likened a political party to a kaleidoscope, changing colors and patterns depending on who was rotating it. “Trump has turned the kaleidoscope 180 degrees, so that pattern is going to evolve radically.”Trump has spoken casually during his 17-month campaign about imposing tariffs on products made by companies that move manufacturing jobs abroad. He has talked about the need to protect Social Security and Medicare entitlements. And he hardly spoke at all about same-sex marriage or accommodations for transgender people.All go against what had been orthodoxy for the Republican Party, right up until Trump accepted the nomination this summer. His voters, a significant plurality of the GOP base, apparently didn’t care.“What Donald Trump has done is to deliver to the Republican coalition a large class of working-class voters with populist attitudes. They are populist attitudes, not populist policies,” the RNC member said. He added that many Trump supporters have shaped their politics based on anger about their circumstances and a perceived lack of interest from “coastal elites” in the issues they care about. “Middle America, middle class, middle finger.”Ramesh Ponnuru, of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said conservatives will still have a strong influence within the Republican Party, and its defining mission will be that it’s not the liberal Democratic Party.Beyond that: “I think it’s up for grabs.”Ponnuru noted that the populist, anti-immigration tone is not unique to Trump. Both former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum have pushed those themes in their own presidential runs. Santorum frequently spoke about how the party had to cater less to business owners and more to ordinary wage workers.When the consensus view among most Republican leaders was that Trump would lose the election, a big question was who would lead the party in the coming years. Current Chairman Reince Priebus said he was interested in another term, but was likely to have faced challengers, particularly if Trump had lost by a wide margin.Now, Priebus is under consideration for a high-level role at the White House, possibly chief of staff. Also important: Running the RNC when the party holds the White House offers far less autonomy than when it does not. Trump will be the de facto leader of the party, regardless of who winds up chairman.In any case, the 168 RNC members will not vote to choose their next chairman until their winter meeting on Jan. 18-19 in Washington. Each state and U.S. territory has three vote: one each from its chair and male and female committee members."

U.S. vs. Mexico ― this is the biggest game that we play,” Bradley said.The American Outlaws, the largest unofficial group of USMNT supporters, also tweeted a message to its members ahead of the match.Trump’s statements about Mexico and Mexican immigrants played a role in the sports rivalry last October, when the two teams met in a final qualifier for the 2017 Confederations Cup.Before the match, a Mexican TV station taunted the USMNT with an ad that cited Trump’s statements about the country, and his insistence that “the American dream is dead.” Fox, which broadcast the match in the United States, responded with its own Trump-themed ad, a promotion that didn’t go over well with many American soccer fans.The match will mark the fifth consecutive World Cup qualifying cycle that the USMNT and Mexico have met in Columbus. The U.S has won each of the last four by the same 2-0 score."

But at least one of her critics has different plans.Oceanside City Councilman Jerry Kern, who continued to rally the public in support of Ernst after his death, hopes that Scott’s defeat will lead the City Council to appoint someone else.“Even though Gary passed away, he is still better qualified than she is,” he told the Voice of San Diego.If the city doesn’t appoint someone in Ernst’s place, the other option would be to hold a special election, which ABC 10 News reported would cost the city $500,000.Scott said Kern is entitled to his own opinion, but argued that she is certainly qualified for the position — especially over someone who is dead.“I have governmental experience, I have a law degree and a legal background, and I have also been a district treasurer for the last 20 years,” she told ABC News."

It is currently being addressed and will be fixed shortly,” a Trump transition spokesman told The Huffington Post in a statement. According to web developer and internet abuse specialist Izzy Galvez, the Trump campaign’s site contained a “glaring XSS vulnerability” in its code which allowed anyone who knew how to code to “write in any text to the header.” Galvez noticed the flaw on Wednesday afternoon.As he transitions from campaigning to governing, Trump is under pressure to moderate some of his more extreme policy positions in light of political or legal hurdles.PREVIOUSLY: A controversial statement by President-elect Donald Trump calling for an outright ban on Muslim immigration disappeared from his website in the hours following his unexpected presidential victory.The statement, released last December, called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” More than 1.6 billion people worldwide practice Islam, and the statement sparked an immediate backlash around the globe.As of late Wednesday, the page announcing the ban was gone from Trump’s campaign site and available only in an archived form, visible here and included below.The deleted language page was part of a sweeping purge of content from the Trump campaign site, which included removing all of Trump’s hundreds of campaign press releases as well as individual pages on the site that had featured endorsements and announcements. Also missing Thursday was a section titled “Issues,” which contained short video clips of Trump talking into the camera about an array of topics, including “Political Correctness,” “Trade War” and the opioid epidemic in New Hampshire. The issues page had also contained two videos of Trump defending Trump University, his failed real estate seminar program which is being sued for fraud.A spokeswoman for Trump did not respond to questions about what happened to the Muslim ban language or to the website overall."

A change would only come if New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who is currently steering Trump’s transition team, leaves the post he’s held since May. Two former top Christie aides were convicted last week for their roles in the 2013 closing of lanes on the George Washington Bridge as punishment for a political opponent. Christie has continued to be dogged by the scandal.The source spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to comment on the discussions. Thiel, a PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member, bucked the trend in Silicon Valley by enthusiastically supporting Trump. He spoke at the Republican National Convention and donated $1.25 million late in the campaign.It’s unclear whether Thiel, an iconoclastic libertarian, would accept the transition role if Trump offered. A spokesman for Thiel declined to comment.A Trump spokesman did not immediately respond for comment. Thiel signaled to The New York Times on Wednesday that he’d informally advise Trump on technology matters, but, according to the paper, was “unlikely to have a formal role” in Trump’s administration. Thiel indicated he had no plans to move to Washington, but was clearly pleased with the result Tuesday night. “A page in the book of history has turned, and there is an opening to think about some of our problems from a new perspective,” Thiel told the Times. “I’ll try to help the president in any way I can.”Thiel’s profile grew beyond the tech world this past year not only because of his support for Trump, but also following the revelation that he secretly funded wrestler Hulk Hogan’s invasion of privacy lawsuit against the now-shuttered Gawker.com. Thiel’s grudge with Gawker stemmed from a 2007 post about how the tech entrepreneur was gay before he’d spoken publicly about his sexual orientation."
74,POLITICS,Donald Trump Visits Capitol Hill In Advance Of Lame-Duck Spending Fight,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-ryan-mcconnell-spending_us_5824d698e4b0f616ef30221f,Our first look at how this is gonna go.,2016-11-10,"House Speaker Paul Ryan listens to President-elect Donald Trump in Washington on Nov. 10, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5824eb4f1800002e005036b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― This could be the beginning of a beautiful, terrifying, probably just temporary friendship.After sitting down with President Barack Obama in the White House on Thursday, President-elect Donald Trump made his way over to the Capitol to have lunch with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and to meet separately with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).Those meetings, which lasted a little more than an hour with Ryan and little less than an hour with McConnell, were an opportunity for GOP congressional leaders to clear the air with Trump and try to get on the same page. They also marked the first time that Ryan or McConnell had ever been seen in public with Trump.“We’re now talking about how we’re going to hit the ground running to make sure that we can get this country turned around and make America great again,” Ryan told reporters Thursday, citing Trump’s campaign slogan.Trump’s rocky relationship with McConnell and, particularly, with Ryan has been a focal point for nearly a year now. With Trump’s surprise win on Tuesday, GOP congressional leaders are no longer trying to distance themselves from the president-elect; they’re jumping right into bed with him. And we’ll soon get to see just how strong that relationship is as Congress makes some spending decisions in the upcoming lame-duck session.When Congress returns next week, lawmakers have to decide how they’ll handle a Dec. 9 government spending deadline. One option ― which Ryan and McConnell seem to prefer ― is to “clean the barn,” as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told his Republican colleagues on Wednesday, with a spending deal that would go until October 2017.Ryan has said the House wouldn’t do a so-called omnibus bill ― a 1,000-plus-page appropriations deal ― but he would be open to smaller bills, maybe just two or three, that functionally amount to that same type of deal. That would give Trump some breathing room to come into the White House and get settled before Congress and the White House are negotiating over the threat of a government shutdown.The other option is just a short-term continuing resolution. That measure would probably just fund all current government programs at current levels for two or three months, allowing the new Congress to come up with a more conservative spending deal to be signed by a President Trump in the early spring.Conservatives are already clamoring for that route, noting that voters clearly want to change business as usual in Washington. And how Trump responds to Ryan and McConnell’s entreaties on the upcoming spending decision will be our first indicator of just what sort of relationship he intends to have with them. If Trump goes along with Ryan and McConnell, he may be more willing to work with GOP leaders than voters ever thought, which may be a signal that Trump intends to be more of a politician than a hand grenade in Washington.And if Trump tells lawmakers he thinks they should do a continuing resolution, especially after everyone expects Ryan and McConnell made a pitch for a larger spending deal on Thursday, it could indicate whether Trump plans to change Washington, or if Washington will change him.Trump might be more of a politician than he let on during his campaign. After answering a question Thursday about his three biggest priorities ― which he identified as immigration, health care and “big-league jobs” ― Trump walked away when someone asked if he intended to follow through on the Muslim ban.Whether Trump will push for a continuing resolution or an omnibus could also signal whether the government is going to have four years of shutdown fights.The only reason to do a continuing resolution is so conservatives can load up an appropriations bill with riders that would cut spending and maybe even eliminate program funding. That would immediately test Senate Democrats and their resolve to block bills from getting to Trump’s desk.At that point, Trump may also call on McConnell to eliminate the filibuster, an obstructionist tool in the Senate that functionally requires 60 votes in that chamber. It’s unclear what Trump will choose to support the omnibus, continuing resolution or remain neutral ― but he appears to be leaving his options open. He didn’t bring staff in for his lunch with Ryan or his meeting with McConnell. Instead, lunch was just a buffet with Trump, Ryan, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, and Trump’s wife, Melania. His meeting with McConnell followed the same arrangement.That could have been a tactical move to avoid any real specifics, or it could just be a thoughtless decision that reflected the light tone of the day.

If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward,’” Cook wrote. “This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward.”The letter also acknowledges that there are “uncertainties ahead.”Trump said in January that if he were elected president, he’d force Apple to manufacture its products in the U.S. He repeatedly condemned outsourcing for the decline of American jobs during his campaign, criticizing companies from Ford to Nabisco. In February, Trump called for a boycott of Apple because the company had refused to help the FBI unlock the phone of one of the shooters who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, last year. Apple reportedly withheld support for the GOP convention because of Trump, in part due to his comments about minority groups, immigrants and women.Though the company has struggled to improve the number of minorities and women in its workforce, Cook’s memo said that they would continue to support diversity: Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world ― regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.Read Cook’s full memo on Buzzfeed.

Jerry Brown (D), who is expected to retire after this term. In a statement, Villaraigosa argued the stakes are higher than ever for California after President-elect Donald Trump’s victory Tuesday night. “We are a state that builds bridges, not walls. We are inclusive. We celebrate our diversity. And we welcome newcomers,” he said in a statement. “We know the answer to fear is hope. The answer to division is unity. And the answer to the millions who feel they have no voice is to make sure they are always heard.”Villaraigosa served as Los Angeles’ mayor from 2005 to 2013, following a long career in California’s state Assembly and a two-year stint as a member of the Los Angeles City Council. He’s gained some national attention for his ties to Hillary Clinton, and in 2012 served as the chairman of the Democratic National Convention. He also spoke at this year’s nominating convention. The former mayor will have stiff competition in Gavin Newsom, California’s popular lieutenant governor who announced his candidacy in February 2015. State Treasurer John Chiang (D) and former state education official Delaine Eastin (D) are also running.Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer has also been floated as a potential candidate, but is reportedly having second thoughts after Trump’s win."

Her condemnation of “diplomatic silence” is in keeping with this unconventional approach.It also echoes German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who pointedly noted in a Wednesday congratulatory message to Trump that U.S.-German ties rest on a shared concern for human rights and the rule of law.To hear these kinds of statements after a U.S. election is surreal. The U.S. and other nations in its orbit often issue messages like this following votes in less developed countries where democracy is fragile.With the election of a candidate who has endorsed using torture, banning individuals based on their religion and curtailing the freedom of the press, it’s America’s democracy that seems to be viewed as threatened.Leaders like Sturgeon and Merkel are signaling how badly they want to protect that system, which, warts and all, is seen by many abroad as an essential global force for good. Sturgeon noted that Trump won on the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall ― a moment when western democracy seemed more secure and successful than ever.The Scottish minister’s comments Thursday and Wednesday are especially interesting given that Trump has links to Scotland through his mother, his significant business interests there and his interest in deeper ties with the United Kingdom.Sturgeon’s SNP is the third most powerful party in the British Parliament. And she has added to her popularity in recent months by strongly criticizing the U.K.’s June “Brexit” vote to leave the European Union. Voters in Scotland overwhelmingly opted to stay in the EU. Trump supports Brexit and has presented the unlikely success of his “Make America great again” message as a parallel to those in the U.K. who wanted to take “their country back.”The move has weakened Britain’s currency, cast doubt on its future economic prospects and created an environment in which hate crimes have increased significantly. The plan’s future is currently in question because of a legal battle. But Brexit proponent Nigel Farage of the U.K. Independence Party has been cheered by Trump’s victory, seeing it as a vindication for the ideology he helped spread.Sturgeon’s party has remained committed to social inclusion even as fear-mongering has grown in Britain. It has actually expanded its power, in a sign that there are ways to gain politically without pandering to xenophobia. The SNP cheered a report of an increase in immigration to the U.K. in 2015, while the country’s two major parties argued over how best to keep people out, Stephen Daisley, digital politics and comments editor for broadcaster STV, noted in an essay on the SNP. In her Thursday remarks, Sturgeon noted that incidents of bullying in schools had increased after the Brexit vote.Anger about globalization’s effect on the economy is something politicians in the U.S. and the U.K. should reckon with, Sturgeon said, bashing policies of austerity that have fueled dissatisfaction across Europe. “However, we must never allow those legitimate issues to give a veneer of respectability to racism, misogyny or intolerance generally. We all have a responsibility to do that now, perhaps more than ever before.” "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5824dc281800002e0050365f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO (Reuters) - Adult women in Puerto Rico were significantly more likely to develop Zika than men, researchers said on Thursday, raising new questions about the potential role of sexual transmission of the virus from males to females.The study, published in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s weekly report on death and disease, evaluated more than 29,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika since the outbreak began in Puerto Rico in November 2015.The data show that of all Zika cases with laboratory evidence of infection, 62 percent were female. The results pattern similar observations from Brazil and El Salvador, the authors said.One obvious explanation might be that pregnant women are more likely than men to seek treatment for Zika because of the potential risk of birth defects.To account for that, the researchers excluded all pregnant women who tested positive for the virus. Of the remaining 28,219 non-pregnant women and men testing positive for Zika, 61 percent of these cases occurred in women over the age of 20.The Zika findings differ from prior outbreaks in Puerto Rico of arboviruses transmitted by the same mosquitoes as Zika. For example, in the 2010 dengue outbreak and the 2014 chikungunya outbreak, infections were equally distributed among men and women.“It is possible that male-to-female sexual transmission is a contributing factor to this skewing of the burden of disease toward women,” the CDC said in a statement summarizing the findings.However, the contribution of sexual transmission to overall Zika rates is just beginning to be explored, the CDC said. It could be that women are more likely than men to seek care if they are sick, or that women are more likely to develop Zika symptoms if they become infected.The CDC is conducting blood tests of individuals living near people with confirmed Zika to try to answer some of these questions.Zika infections in pregnant women have been shown to cause microcephaly ― a severe birth defect in which the head and brain are undersized ― as well as other brain abnormalities. The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last year in Brazil, which has since confirmed more than 2,000 cases of microcephaly.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Andrew Hay)"

A spokesman for Iraq’s federal police could not be reached for comment.A spokesman for the Kurdish regional government denied the HRW report, saying any delays in informing families were limited and due to limited resources.“Nobody has been kept in unknown facilities. They are kept in identified facilities,” said Dindar Zebari.The Mosul operation, involving a 100,000-strong alliance of troops, security forces, Kurdish peshmerga and Shi’ite Muslim militias and backed by U.S.-led air strikes, has entered its fourth week but has so far gained just a small foothold in the city.Amnesty’s report described several incidents on or around Oct. 21 in which separate groups of men were beaten with cables and rifle butts before being shot to death. In one case, a man’s head had been severed from his body, it said.Amnesty said that, without accountability, the alleged abuses risked being repeated in other towns and villages as the Mosul offensive continues."

Protesters hoisted signs like “Bad Hombre” and “Not My President,” and anti-Trump chants echoed through the crowd. Police made several arrests.Jackie Smith, 53, of Staten Island, said she was blindsided by the election outcome. “There’s a lot of blame to go around, but I blame myself,” said Smith. “Instead of laughing at Trump, I should have been out protesting.”Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, who attended the rally, told The Huffington Post that protesters must not falter in their opposition to Trump. “We had all those big protests before the Iraq War and once the war started, everyone stopped protesting,” Moore said. “This time, we keep it up and we don’t stop till he’s out of there.”Trump’s derogatory comments and allegations that he has sexually assaulted women loomed large for Emily Rems, managing editor of Bust magazine. She carried a sign that read “Don’t Grab My Pussy,” referencing vulgar comments Trump made in a 2005 video published by The Washington Post in October. “We’re pissed as hell that Donald Trump won this election,” Rems said. “Women should have equal rights in this society, and we don’t want Roe v Wade overturned.” Trump said in an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews in March that “there has to be some form of punishment” for women who have abortions. The prospect of Trump following through on promised anti-immigration policies worried Carmen Candelario, 23, who said she moved to the U.S. legally from the Dominican Republic. “I already knew I was fighting against a lot of hate just because of my background and skin color,” Candelario said. “The dream to move forward as a community is now gone.”Daisy Skelton, 22, of Manhattan, tried to grapple with Trump’s victory. “This election is unacceptable,” said Skelton. “I’ve been crying, and my friend said to me, ‘Optimism is the only way.’”Socialist Alternative, NYC, the group that organized the anti-Trump march, heaped criticism on the Democratic Party.“The Democratic Party has proven they are incapable of stopping Trump,” Socialist Alternative, NYC, said in a Facebook message announcing the protest. “The Democratic Party has failed. This is the result of the Democratic Party leadership backing Hillary Clinton instead of Bernie Sanders. It is time to build a new party of the 99%.” Protests and prayer vigils were held at other locations around New York City. In Austin, Texas, students from the University of Texas demonstrated on campus, then marched downtown. About 400 people blocked traffic on city bridges, but remained peaceful, according to the Austin American-Statesman.Similar protests erupted in Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, and Washington, D.C., shortly after Hillary Clinton conceded defeat early Wednesday. In California, Berkeley and Oakland authorities reported some disruption as well. About 250 people took to the streets and caused “vandalism on multiple businesses,” according to Oakland police. Small fires were set in city streets as marchers reached downtown Oakland. In Seattle, dozens of students at West Seattle High walked out of class, and hundreds of residents took to the streets in protest of the election results, the Seattle Times reported. Kshama Sawant, a socialist Seattle City council member, called on protesters to “shut down” Trump’s inauguration ceremony, KIRO 7 reported. And in Chicago, protesters gathered outside Trump Tower before taking to the streets, according to the Chicago Tribune.”The next four years are going to be hard for all of us, but this is an unprecedented chance for all of us to fight as one,” Jonathan Lovitz, a senior vice president of the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, told NBC News. “Think of the possibilities when all minorities stand together.”"

That means he could potentially alienate about half of Michigan and a chunk of the team’s fan base by speaking his mind. Van Gundy has not been shy with his political beliefs before, openly opposing North Carolina’s anti-LGBTQ “bathroom bill” earlier this year.On a day when New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said his wife had demanded that he stop talking politics, this public sports figure instead went all in.“I don’t know how you go about it, if you’re a person of color today or a Latino. Because white society just said to you, again ― not like we haven’t forever ― but again, and emphatically, that I don’t think you deserve equality. We don’t think you deserve respect.

We should be ashamed for what we stand for as the United States today.”Listen to Van Gundy’s full comments here:H/T For The WinThe Huffington Post receives a percentage from the purchase of tickets bought via a link on this page."
