0,BUSINESS,Starbucks Under Fire For Giving Less Parental Leave To Hourly Workers,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/starbucks-parental-leave_us_59cea755e4b05f005d3441f5,"""This is a moral issue.""",2017-10-02,"Jess Svabinek, a Starbucks employee, with her husband and newborn baby.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ced5012d00007c08307ee1.jpeg?ops=crop_0_167_768_661%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Why does Starbucks think it’s OK to give its well-compensated salaried employees far better paid leave benefits than hourly workers who are already barely scraping by? On Monday, some of the company’s shareholders filed a resolution demanding an explanation.At issue is a new Starbucks maternity and paternity leave policy that went into effect over the weekend. The coffee giant now gives salaried workers ― some of whom make six-figure salaries ― 18 paid weeks off for maternity leave. Hourly workers, who earn around $10 an hour, get six weeks paid time off if they physically give birth to a baby. Hourly workers who adopt also get six weeks off fully paid. Men who work hourly and whose partners give birth get 12 weeks off without pay; men and adoptive parents who work in corporate also get 12 weeks, but fully paid.Adoptive parents and men who work hourly get 12 weeks off without pay; men and adoptive parents who work in corporate get the same amount of time, but fully paid. The company has around 180,000 U.S. employees and the vast majority work in the stores, meaning the generous leave policy effectively goes to only a privileged minority.“This is a discrimination claim just waiting to happen,” said Pat Miguel Tomaino, associate director of socially responsible investing at Zevin Asset Management in Boston, the lead filer on the shareholder resolution, with four other social impact investors including Reynders McVeigh Capital Management, Arjuna Capital, Pax World Management and Friends Fiduciary Corporation. Not only is Starbucks’ reputation as a progressive company at risk, Tomaino said: “It’s a moral issue.”In an email, Starbucks spokesperson Jaime Riley emphasized the company offers extremely generous benefits to hourly employees who work 20 hours or more a week including health care, a stock plan, free college tuition and 401(k) matching. The company’s parental leave benefits are “exceptional” in the retail industry, Riley said. Indeed, only 14 percent of private sector employers have access to paid parental leave.When HuffPost asked how Starbucks squared the inequality between hourly worker and corporate parental benefits, Riley said, “That’s an interesting phrasing of that question.” She added that the company takes “a competitive approach and provide[s] benefits based on what our partners express as their needs and preferences.”Jess Svabinek, a 38-year-old barista at a Starbucks about 40 miles away from Seattle who makes $11.05 an hour, is out on unpaid leave now with her baby boy and certainly would have preferred more paid time off. “I can’t even grasp having to go back to work after just six weeks,” she told HuffPost. “I’m nine weeks out from a C-section and I couldn’t imagine getting up at 2 in the morning for the morning shift and leaving the baby. That’s when we’re up nursing.”Svabinek, who had her baby before the new policy went into effect, was able to take 8 weeks off at 67 percent of her regular pay. She is relying on her husband, who makes $20 an hour at Trader Joe’s, to get by on leave for as long as possible. She figures she’ll be back to work in January, if she can swing it financially. Already, her husband has put off some much-needed dental work to make everything possible.Starbucks is hardly the only retailer to offer better benefits to higher paid workers. Walmart gives women in its corporate office 12 weeks of paid maternity leave while its hourly workers get none, according to data compiled by Paid Leave U.S., a nonprofit advocacy group that also worked on Monday’s Starbucks proposal. Yum Brands, Taco Bell’s parent company, only gives paid leave to corporate full-timers; not to workers in its fast food restaurants. Other companies, including Ikea and Bank of America, provide equal benefits to all workers. This kind of class-based discrimination is baked into how companies do business, paying different workers different salaries based on their desirability. No one would argue that there’s anything wrong with those salary differences. But the issue of paid leave is trickier. It’s hard to seriously claim that a baby deserves less time with his mom because she couldn’t get a fancy white-collar job.And the issue isn’t really one the private sector is ever going to solve on its own. The problem is the United States has left what is essentially a public policy issue in the hands of private companies that are accustomed to doling out unequal benefits to workers. The Starbucks shareholder proposal emphasizes that these corporate paid leave policies are significant because the United States is one of only a handful of countries in the world without any paid maternity leave policy, placing companies like Starbucks at the center of a critical national policy issue.Yet the shareholders aren’t looking to start some crazy revolution. The resolution asks that Starbucks’ board look into the paid leave disparity and produce a report evaluating the discrimination risks that might arise.Tomaino wouldn’t say how he’d like Starbucks’ policy to change. “It’s not our role to be prescriptive,” he said, adding that he’d just like the company to re-evaluate the policy with an eye toward fairness, employee morale and the risks of lawsuits.The investor groups say Starbucks’ leave policy is particularly disturbing because over the years the company has developed a reputation for treating its workers well and providing equal benefits to all employees. Starbucks was also an early supporter of gay marriage, yet LGBTQ hourly workers are particularly hurt by the lack of paid leave for adoptive parents. Those workers are far more likely than their straight counterparts to adopt or foster children.Activist investors have increasingly been pushing companies on social issues, most recently urging companies to report on gender and pay, with some success ― convincing a handful of major tech companies to make public information on their pay gaps.“Investors now are stepping forward,” said Tomaino, who hopes to replicate those successes when it comes to paid leave. The Starbucks resolution is the first of its kind, but expect more. Tomaino said his organization is also talking to 11 other major retailers, including Target, Amazon, Costco and Apple about their paid leave policies ― or lack thereof.The group is looking at the issue of unequal benefits, as well as cases in which the amount of leave offered is simply inadequate. Without paid leave, many women are forced out of the job market. Others are set back in their career paths, by taking less-demanding jobs, declining promotions or dropping back to part-time work with the arrival of a child. That means many parents wind up tapping public benefits like food stamps to get by when a baby arrives on the scene. The lack of paid leave is one major reason women in 2017 still make just 80 percent of what men earn on average, according to federal data, and that the U.S. lags other developed countries when it comes to the percentage of women in the labor force. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Starbucks did not offer paid leave to hourly workers who adopt children. In fact, the company provides them with six paid weeks off."
1,POLITICS,Here's Why Authorities Aren't Calling The Las Vegas Massacre An Act Of Terrorism,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/terrorism-federal-law-las-vegas-shooting_us_59d26166e4b06791bb121828,"The federal government likely wouldn't have charged Stephen Paddock with terrorism, even if he'd lived.",2017-10-02,People run from the Route 91 Harvest country music festival after hearing gun fire.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d2627e14000020004929ea.jpeg?cache=ZlKFdo5CjD&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A 64-year-old man slaughtered dozens of people late Sunday night, firing hundreds of rounds into a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas. President Donald Trump called it an “act of evil.” But why, many wondered on social media, aren’t authorities using the term terrorism to describe a horrific attack that left at least 58 dead and more than 500 people injured? Was it because the shooter wasn’t Muslim? Was it because he was white?Similar questions came up after a left-wing extremist opened fire on a Republican congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, in June. And again when a white supremacist crashed into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. Weren’t those acts of terror as well?There’s a reason that law enforcement authorities are hesitant to label an attack like the one in Las Vegas as terrorism. Specific federal statutes target international terrorism and acts associated with groups that the U.S. government has labeled as foreign terrorist organizations. But there’s no specific federal statute aimed at acts of domestic terrorism, meaning acts inspired or carried out on behalf of domestic extremist organizations. Some federal laws are aimed at particular acts that might be carried out for terrorist purposes, like hijacking planes or assassinating government officials, but mass shootings are not on that list.So had Stephen Paddock lived, it’s unlikely that he would have faced federal terrorism charges. And unless authorities turn up evidence that his attack was motivated by hatred for a specific racial group ― which is unlikely, given that he fired indiscriminately into a crowd of thousands ― there’s a good chance he wouldn’t have faced any federal charges at all.HuffPost reported in August that the Justice Department had been discussing the possibility of asking Congress to pass a federal law against domestic terrorism. FBI Director Christopher Wray said last month that he was aware of such discussions in the executive branch. Yet even if such a law were on the books, it’s not clear the Las Vegas massacre would qualify as an act of domestic terrorism. There is a federal definition of the term ― yes, even though there isn’t a charge. An act of domestic terrorism must be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, to influence a government policy by intimidation or coercion, or to affect the conduct of government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping. We don’t know yet if Paddock had any of those goals in mind."
2,POLITICS,Training School For 'Resistance' Activists Expands To West Coast,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-resistance-school-expands-to-west-coast_us_59d12f7ae4b05f005d34f0b5,Lectures at Harvard and Berkeley aim to help progressives fight the Trump administration.,2017-10-02,"Protesters demonstrate against President Donald Trump as he delivers a speech on tax reform in Indianapolis, Indiana, on Sept. 27, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d131032d00009c173080e1.jpeg?cache=J5JbHOFB0y&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Harvard-based “Resistance School” is expanding to a second, West Coast campus at the University of California, Berkeley. Graduate students at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government opened “Resistance School,” which offers a series of free lectures available online, in March to help give progressive activists the tools they need to combat President Donald Trump’s policy agenda.Some six months and 175,000 participants later, Resistance School’s courses resume again this Thursday on Berkeley’s campus. Berkeley and Harvard will alternate hosting duties for eight weekly lectures ― double the number offered in the first semester.The Berkeley lectures are pre-taped with an in-person audience and will appear online at 6 p.m. EST on the alternating Thursdays when it formally hosts the lectures.“As students at Berkeley, we have access to some amazing experts and we want to make those opportunities available to a wider audience,” said Kori Anderson, a co-founder of “Resistance School @ Berkeley,” as the Berkeley branch calls itself. “We’re rooted in this area that has kind of been the center of a lot of progressive movements throughout history and continues to have this very vibrant organizing and activism community.”Policy experts and veteran activists will lead the courses. Participants are then welcome to take advantage of follow-up readings aimed at helping them apply lessons from the lectures and discuss strategy on a specified Slack channel.Berkeley’s courses are slated to focus on “effective communication,” while Harvard’s courses will address the idea of “leadership.”Here’s a listing of themes and speakers that will be covered in the Berkeley series:Thursday, Oct. 5, “Transforming Resistance into a Social Movement”: Saru Jayaraman, co-founder and co-director of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC United) and director of the Food Labor Research Center at University of California, BerkeleyThe videos of the lectures will be available at ResistanceSchool.org, the separate website for the Resistance School @ Berkeley.Harvard public policy expert Marshall Ganz is set to deliver the first lecture of the semester at the Harvard branch of Resistance School. Ganz’s presentation on “Public Narrative” will become available online on Thursday, Oct. 12. Aside from Ganz, Harvard’s Resistance School has not yet announced a complete lineup of its lecturers for the second semester. The first semester of courses, available at ResistanceSchool.com, featured presentations from Harvard historian and human rights specialist Timothy McCarthy; Sarah El-Amine, the former executive director of Organizing for Action; Harvard’s Ganz; and New York state Assemblyman and Democratic National Committee vice chair Michael Blake.Jennifer Rivera, a spokeswoman for Harvard’s Resistance School, emphasized that Resistance School organizers hope to create a “sustainable movement beyond Trump.”“We are training people to make progressive changes now and in the 2018 election and beyond,” she said.Although graduate students at Berkeley and Harvard created Resistance School, the program is not formally affiliated with either institution. In their capacities as student groups, however, the two branches of the Resistance School receive some funding from the universities. The websites of both branches offer people the opportunity to support their work with donations.Resistance School is one of many new groups founded to channel the progressive passion inspired by opposition to President Trump’s policies. Some of the most prominent new organizations include Indivisible, Flippable and SwingLeft, which each mobilize people around a different form of Democratic activism."
3,POLITICS,Anti-Sharia Group With Close Ties To Donald Trump Has A Nazi Problem,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anti-sharia-group-with-close-ties-to-trump-has-a-nazi-problem_us_59d2a231e4b048a44324852b,ACT for America is dealing with white supremacists showing up at its rallies.,2017-10-02,Anti-Sharia protesters gathered on the west steps of the Colorado Capitol in Denver on June 10.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d2a30d2d00009c17308457.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Billy Roper, a neo-Nazi and former high school history teacher whose father and grandfathers were Klansmen, saw that a national group was organizing marches on June 10 against Sharia. He wanted to get involved. So Roper and his wife, who sells $75 swastika quilts, contacted ACT for America about hosting a rally in Batesville, Arkansas. ACT for America, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as an anti-Muslim hate group, argues that Sharia, or Islamic law, is incompatible with Western democracy, and has spread conspiracy theories about Muslim refugees. The group has close ties to the Trump administration — its founder, Brigitte Gabriel, has boasted of visiting the White House, and Trump campaign and administration officials have sat on its board or spoken at its events. It’s hosting a national conference in Virginia this week and will be holding what it has billed as a “national security legislative briefing” Tuesday on Capitol Hill. But for such a high-profile nonprofit organization, ACT for America has had trouble recently keeping white supremacists and Nazis away from its events — and went so far as to accidentally coordinate with Roper before learning about his background. “Thanks for stepping up to the plate,” Scott Presler, ACT for America’s lead activism strategist, wrote Roper’s wife in a June 1 email, noting that he had created a Facebook event for the rally. “You are approved and good to go,” he added in a subsequent email to Roper. (Presler did not respond to requests for comment, but Roper showed HuffPost copies of the emails.) When ACT listed Roper’s event on its website, the Southern Poverty Law Center published a post noting his beliefs and that he was promoting the event on Stormfront, a neo-Nazi message platform. Presler sent Roper an “urgent” email and the group quickly moved to disassociate from him. ACT for America put out a press release saying it didn’t support or endorse Roper’s June event in any way. “ACT for America has never, and will never, tolerate any bias, discrimination, or violence against anyone, based on their religion, gender, race, or political persuasion,” the group said in a policy statement. (ACT did not respond to requests for comment for this story, though its founder has called the SPLC “pure poison.”) “They had no idea that I was the uncensored voice about neo-Nazism, as they say, they did not know who they were working with,” Roper, who was about to leave for a Stormfront conference in Tennessee, told HuffPost last week. “When they found out, they freaked, and they tried to disavow me and disassociate,” he said. “Too late.” But Roper isn’t the only extremist who has gotten involved with ACT’s rallies. A dozen members of Identity Evropa, a white separatist group, attended a June 10 ACT rally in New York, according to The Washington Post. In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Vanguard America, a fascist group, also made an appearance. A regional coordinator for Identity Evropa spoke at an ACT event in Indianapolis, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Nathan Damigo ― the leader of that group who once falcon-punched a female protester ― attended an ACT rally in Roseville, California. He later participated in the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that lead to the death of one woman. Augustus Sol Invictus, who attended the Charlottesville rally, spoke at an ACT rally in Orlando, Florida, according to the SPLC. ACT boasts of deep ties to the Trump administration. Its founder, Gabriel, a Lebanese-born Christian who has claimed she has a “direct line to Donald Trump,” bragged of going to the White House earlier this year and delivered what the group called a “national security briefing” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate last year. Former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn was listed on the group’s board of advisers. Former White House counterterrorism adviser Sebastian Gorka has given briefings at the group’s chapter meetings. And Mike Pompeo, Trump’s pick for CIA director, has been a “steadfast ally,” according to Gabriel.The Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment. ACT’s recent Nazi problems don’t seem to have damaged its relationship with Trump allies. Katrina Pierson, Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, spoke at ACT’s national conference this week. (When HuffPost reached out about attending the conference, Brian Glicklich, who has been reported as a spokesman for conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, wrote in an email that the “event is private.”)Anti-hate groups aren’t buying ACT’s attempt to distance itself from the people attending its rallies. “The bigotry and hatred that motivates violence and hateful demonstrations like what we saw in Charlottesville is no different from the bigotry and hatred that drives ACT for America’s anti-Muslim agenda,” said Madihha Ahussain, a staff attorney at Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group. “When groups like [ACT] are given access to the highest officials in the administration, it’s no surprise that the administration continues to propose discriminatory policies targeting people on the basis of their religious or ethnic background.”After the Charlottesville protests, ACT perhaps realized that it could not keep extremists away. It canceled rallies in 36 states scheduled for September and replaced them with an online event, telling Breitbart that, “in recent weeks, extremist and radical organizations in the United States and abroad have overrun peaceful events in order to advance their own agendas, and in many cases, violence has been the result.” "

Within about a week, more than 10,000 U.S. sailors and Marines were involved in the relief effort, the U.S. Air Force had delivered 55,000 pounds of food and water, and the hospital ship USNS Comfort had arrived at the capital city of Port-au-Prince. Two weeks after the quake, there were approximately 17,000 U.S. military personnel in and around Haiti.

Jeffrey Buchanan to lead recovery efforts.On his first day in Puerto Rico, Buchanan told reporters that although more troops were on the way, it was still ”not enough.” By Monday, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said about 7,200 troops were on the ground and added that much more help was needed.The Defense Department announced that the USNS Comfort and the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp would arrive in Puerto Rico on Tuesday, almost two weeks after Hurricane Maria hit. Eight MV-22 Osprey aircraft and two KC-130 Hercules transport planes were set to deploy for Puerto Rico on Tuesday as well.As of Monday, only a reported 5 percent of the island has power. The number of Puerto Ricans without drinking water continues to grow ― the Defense Department said 55 percent of islanders lacked access to water as of Sunday. Just 37 percent of residents have cell phone service, according to Rosselló.Congress has not yet passed a bill granting monetary aid for Puerto Rico, although it managed to move a $15.25 billion relief package in response to hurricanes Harvey and Irma in September. Additionally, the Trump administration waited several days before temporarily waiving the Jones Act, thereby making it easier to ship supplies to Puerto Rico.In spite of growing criticism of his administration’s efforts, President Donald Trump keeps touting the federal response. He said last week that it has been challenging to coordinate logistics because “this is an island, sitting in the middle of an ocean, and it’s a big ocean.

He studied the recovery efforts after the Haiti earthquake in 2010 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.“There’s no reason [Puerto Rico] should be treated any differently from any other place, New Orleans or Houston,” Mutter told HuffPost. “It’s almost being treated as if it’s a foreign country.”When Cruz accused FEMA of focusing on bureaucracy and paperwork instead of helping people, Trump attacked her via social media.“Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,” Trump tweeted while spending the weekend at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. “They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.”The president is scheduled to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday. “It’s the earliest I can go because of the first responders, and we don’t want to disrupt the relief efforts,” he said. Yet Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) visited the island a week ago Monday to see the situation on the ground. He called for the Defense Department to take over immediate relief efforts.The situation in Puerto Rico is truly precarious, Mutter emphasized. “It’s a very desperate situation for people there because they must be wondering if the U.S. cares about them at all,” he said.

And Carey Lohrenz would know. The country’s,2017-10-02,<p>Carey Lohrenz says all you need is 20 seconds of courage at a time.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d2665b14000026004929ef.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The inside of a F-14 tomcat cockpit is not that much different than the workplace.And Carey Lohrenz would know.The country’s first female fighter pilot in the U.S. Navy and now performance expert and leadership development trainer says, “Too often women try to conform and not tell people they are kicking ass. They try to blend in. It’s a huge challenge.”Lohrenz, who started her 10-year career in the U.S. military in 1989, and was the first female combat pilot flying in missions around the world in 1993, says, “I am struck by the parallels of military, aviation and business. Playing small serves nobody. You have to know your value and you must be willing to speak up and not fly under the radar.”Lohrenz laughs. She means that literally.A mother of four, who returned from the U. S. Navy with the title of lieutenant, Lohrenz is the author of Fearless Leadership: High-Performance Lessons from the Flight Deck, and agrees she has seen changes over the years for women leaders in many different arenas, from the military to business to global security.What Lohrenz has found in her career is that women in the military do not want to be defined by their gender. “They do not want to be known as a female tanks driver, they just want to be known as a service member.”That is true in any field—from journalism to businesses of all stripes. Why is the qualifier of “female” necessary?The author and leadership expert serves as the closing keynote at the ASIS 2017 conference for 22,000 global security professionals in Dallas September 28, following speakers who include Mark Cuban and former President George W. Bush. This aligns with the mission of the membership organization.“There’s a spotlight on diversity” in the global security industry, says Donna Kobzaruk, Women in Security Council’s chair at ASIS and vice president and security manager, Midwest at Chase.Global needs for security are very high, considering the very recent terrorist attacks in London, Paris, Barcelona, and even violence in Charlottesville and St. Petersburg, as well as the threat of Internet leaks and attacks, such as recently with Equifax.“Women in security are making outstanding inroads,"" she says, particularly in cybersecurity, where she says the percentage of women is about 25 percent. That is much higher than the physical security niche, with people protecting property, individuals and buildings or what Kobzaruk calls “guards and guns.”Women in the security industry need “support and inspiration,” Kobzaruk says, and that means every woman can create her own personal “board of directors” that includes mentors and supporters who coach, network and advise.“I don’t know how you look yourself in the mirror without supporting another woman,” Kobzaruk says.Lohrenz agrees in the value of mentorship, but says keen self-awareness is crucial. What keeps women from advancing their careers from entry level to mid-career to C-Suite, Lohrenz says, is fear.“You don’t need to be courageous all the time, just 20 seconds at a time. So what if someone tells you no?” asks Lohrenz. “Ask for it anway.”This aligns with Power Leadership Tool #3, created by Gloria Feldt, co-founder and president of Take The Lead. ""Use What You’ve Got,"" the third of nine power leadership tools states, ""What you need is almost always there. See it and use it with courage. Because power unused is power useless.""With the skills, instincts and passions, you can move forward. “You are lost when you are crippled by your fears and perceived limitations,” Lohrenz says.For instance, she says, if given the opportunity to take on a leadership role, feeling overwhelmed may get in the way. To counter that, Lohrenz says, “Build your ability to work through the fear and do what needs to be done.”Both men and women have that trepidation, Lohrenz suggests, but men may have a lower threshold of fear and do not feel they need to prepare as deeply as women feel they need to. “Men expect they will be successful and women prepare relentlessly. You have to raise your hand first,” she says.This is what Lohrenz calls the “bias to act.” The bias for action revolves around a woman’s inclination for hesitation and a man’s inclination to forge ahead.Counter this and “train yourself to act in scary situations. Train yourself to be a high performance leader,"" Lohrenz says.This is where her experience as a fighter pilot comes in. “We are high-level risk managers,” Lohrenz says. “If we act extemporaneously, chances of us coming home drop. We are well-prepared with a high level of situational awareness. We want to be as prepared as possible and knowledgeable and act decisively.”This is the opposite of acting quickly and impulsively.“Women need to understand that in order to get ahead, you don’t want to wait for the invitation to make a difference. Step into a challenging role when there is no guarantee for success,” Lohrenz says.Thinking of the global security issues, both Kobzaruk and Lohrenz agree this is a good time for women to be in leadership roles around the world.“We need diversity of thought, Kobzaruk says.A new study released at the United Nations General Assembly “questions whether policymakers in five countries are equipped with the basic information they need to advance gender equality,” writes Abigail Jones in Newsweek. “Equal Measures 2030, a global partnership of nine organizations, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, conducted a survey of 109 policymakers in Colombia, India, Indonesia, Kenya and Senegal. Half were men, half were women, and they worked at every level of power—in central government and parliament, at the state and local levels, and as senior civil servants or in other influential fields. The results revealed that, when it came to key issues affecting girls and women, those in charge were ‘largely not confident in their knowledge of the facts.’” Jones writes.“Even the best intentioned decision-makers can’t make the best decisions if they’re operating in the dark,” Katja Iversen, CEO of Women Deliver, one of the Equal Measures 2030 partners, said in a statement, according to Jones.“It’s hard to cite a statistic cold, but I think policymakers would be able to make a more educated guess on other issues, like economic growth last year or your biggest export industry in your country,” Alison Holder, director of Equal Measures 2030, told Jones.“Absolutely women will be necessary team members for us to meet the challenges of the future,” Lohrenz says. “There is a danger in women underestimating their potential.”And yes, naysayers are everywhere. This is not new.“There will always be people who say you can’t do something, and ask, “Who are you to think you are good enough?” Lohrenz adds, “Go for it anyway.”This post originally ran in Take The Lead.

The 76-year-old, who is also an avid environmentalist, told reporters at the Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood Spring 2018 fashion show over the weekend that she stays young by skipping the shower. “Don’t wash too much,” she said, via The Guardian. “She only takes a bath every week. That’s why she looks so radiant,” Kronthaler, who is also Westwood’s husband, said. He added, “I only wash once a month,” though it’s unclear if Kronthaler was joking. Westwood previously spoke about her shower habits (or lack thereof) in a video for PETA. “Normally at home, I’m not used to the habit of a shower,” she said. “I just wash my bits and rush out in the morning. I more often than not get in the bath after Andreas.” Westwood isn’t the only celebrity known for her eccentric hygiene habits. Robert Pattinson created quite the stir a few years ago when he admitted to not washing his hair.“I don’t really see the point in washing your hair,” the actor said in a 2009 interview with Extra.“If you don’t care if your hair’s clean or not then why would you wash it?” he said at the time. “It’s like, I don’t clean my apartment ’cause I don’t care. I have my apartment for sleeping in and I have my hair for just, you know, hanging out on my head. I don’t care if it’s clean or not.” In a very candid appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” singer and shoe mogul Jessica Simpson revealed she only brushed her teeth a few times a week. “My teeth are so white and I don’t like them to feel too slippery, but I do use Listerine and I do floss every day,” Simpson said in her 2010 interview. “But I don’t brush them every day. I’ll use a shirt or something … I know it’s gross, but I always have fresh breath.”Well, at least these celebs are saving water."

The remaining arrests were unrelated to the incident but have all been over the perceived sexual orientation of the defendants and came after it.At least 10 men were arrested between Sept. 28-30 and six others earlier that week, judicial sources said. All 16 went on trial on Sunday charged with “promoting sexual deviancy” and “debauchery,” euphemisms for homosexuality. A verdict is due on Oct. 29.One man has been sentenced to six years in jail over similar charges.Although homosexuality is not specifically outlawed in Egypt, it is a conservative society and discrimination is rife. Gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery, immorality or blasphemy.Those arrested are subjected to anal examinations to determine whether they have had gay sex, which rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say amounts to torture.Five such examinations have taken place, Amnesty International said on Monday. Judicial sources do not deny the examinations take place but say they are legally carried out and are not a form of abuse.“In a matter of days the Egyptian security forces have rounded up dozens of people and carried out five anal examinations signaling a sharp escalation in the authorities’ efforts to persecute and intimidate members of the LGBTI community following the rainbow flag incident,” said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty. In 2001, 52 men were arrested when police raided a floating disco called the Queen Boat."

11,POLITICS,New Document Shows Inner Workings Of Trump's Voter Fraud Probe,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-fraud-probe_us_59d2a80ee4b0f962988957f5,"A former Justice Department official says the new revelations ""raise serious concerns.""",2017-10-02,"President Donald Trump speaks as Kris Kobach, Kansass secretary of state, listens during the initial meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in Washington, D.C., July 19, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d2a95c1400002000492b31.jpeg?cache=sdMTuNFzOP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s opaque voter fraud probe released the most comprehensive look at its inner workings to date in court documents Friday, providing a clearer sense of how it plans to use the voter data it has collected and raising new questions about its scope and goals.The commission’s work so far has been unclear; even some commissioners have said they’re not exactly sure what the panel is working on. Friday’s disclosure is significant because it shows officials on the probe have contacted officials with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and the Social Security Administration ― which suggests the commission may be proceeding with a plan to compare the voter data it’s collected against federal databases.The commission is declining to release the email exchanges themselves, saying they are either administrative in nature or constitute individual research. Spokespeople for the commission, as well as for DOJ and the SSA, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.“The information released by the so-called Commission on Election Integrity as a result of our lawsuit paints an incomplete but alarming record about the Commission’s work and intentions,” Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement.The commission had previously indicated it was considering running voter data from different states through a DHS database. The log released Friday contains multiple exchanges between commission officials and the agency.On May 12, the day after Trump signed an executive order establishing the commission, a DHS official emailed the office of Vice President Mike Pence, who chairs the commission, asking about its scope. On June 28, Andrew Kossack, the panel’s designated federal officer, emailed Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the vice chair of the commission, and other officials in Pence’s office about “potential partnership opportunities with DHS.” About a week later, someone at DHS emailed Kossack about “potential coordination/overlap between entities.” The log also shows Kossack and Kobach emailing with DHS to set up a time to talk on the phone.Anna Franko, a DHS spokeswoman, confirmed that the agency had been communicating with the commission.“We have been in contact with commission members but have not yet provided any data,” she wrote in an email. Franko declined to provide any more details about DHS’ contact with the commission.Observers have noted that any attempt to use DHS data to detect voter fraud is likely to produce false positives. The commission also contacted the Social Security Administration in August, the log shows. Kobach had previously said the commission could compare voter data with Social Security databases to identify dead voters still on the rolls. The log also documents several exchanges between the commission and the Department of Justice, offering the first documentation of contact between the panel and that agency. The contact is significant because Eric Dreiband, Trump’s pick to lead the Department’s civil rights division, told Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of his confirmation process that he believed the commission and the department to be separate, and said he didn’t anticipate having a role in the probe. Senate Democrats are pressing DOJ to describe in more detail any collaboration the department has had with the commission.On May 15, a DOJ official emailed Christy McCormick, a commissioner on the panel, about the Chicago board of elections. About two months later, at the beginning of July, a DOJ official emailed McCormick about a “voting issue.” At the beginning of September, a DOJ official sent McCormick an email forwarding a link to a news story.On June 15, Kossack, the panel’s federal officer, emailed a DOJ official to set up a time to speak. A little over a month later, Kossack emailed a DOJ official about “collecting data from non-state entities.”The log also raises new questions about a controversial June 28 letter the commission sent out to all 50 states requesting voter information. In the week ahead of the letter’s release, Kobach and two other commissioners, Hans von Spakovsky and J. Christian Adams, exchanged emails about its contents. Von Spakovsky, Adams and Kobach are three of the most controversial picks for the commission, and critics of the probe say they intend to weaken confidence in American election systems and make it more difficult to vote. Von Spakovsky also emailed Adams, Kobach and Kossack about potential commission members.“It appears that known vote-suppressors Kris Kobach, J. Christian Adams, and Hans von Spakovsky, worked together without the input of other commissioners to develop the unprecedented June 28th letter to state election officials seeking personal voter information,” Clarke said.The commission has received proposals from third parties for data analysis. It’s unclear what data those groups would be analyzing, but a number of voting advocates and election officials have expressed concern about how the commission might handle and secure sensitive voter data.“These documents raise serious concerns about the potential coordination between the Pence-Kobach commission and government agencies, including the Justice Department, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security,” said Vanita Gupta, former head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, and president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.“As we noted in June when the Commission demanded information from Secretaries of State on the same day the Justice Department sent a letter to states covered under the National Voter Registration Act, it was highly suspect then, and it is highly suspect now,” Gupta continued. “The public deserves to know what was discussed in these communications, and just what this commission is doing and how it will undermine the right to vote.”Friday’s document can be seen in full below."
12,POLITICS,Trump’s Travel Ban Does Nothing To Stop The Most Deadly Form Of Terror In The U.S.,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-terror-travel-ban-vegas_us_59d26f99e4b09538b509d978,Gun violence kills tens of thousands of people in the U.S. every year.,2017-10-02,"President Donald Trump's travel ban would restrict travel into the U.S. in the name of national security, but many more people are killed by gun violence than by foreign-born terrorists.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d2854e200000fb15084a64.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump has repeatedly attempted to restrict travel into the U.S. in the name of national security, yet none of his administration’s travel bans would have prevented an attack like the one that took place in Las Vegas on Sunday night.At least 58 people were killed and over 500 were injured after a shooter opened fire at a music festival outside Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino — the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The alleged shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, was found dead near the scene. He lived in Mesquite, Nevada, a small town northeast of Las Vegas.The FBI said it has found “no connection” between Paddock, a white retiree, and an international terrorist group.The latest iteration of Trump’s travel ban, announced last week, is set to place new restrictions on travel to the U.S. from eight countries beginning later this month. The new ban removed earlier restrictions on Sudan, while adding Chad, North Korea and Venezuela to the list. Restrictions remain in place for Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, however.The American Civil Liberties Union is once again challenging the ban in court, calling the new version just as xenophobic as the earlier versions, which faced legal challenges as to whether the policies unconstitutionally discriminated against Muslims. As a presidential candidate last year, Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslims entering the U.S.Trump’s travel ban reflects his primary focus on conventional acts of terror as opposed to mass shootings, which studies say are becoming more frequent and deadly in recent years. The previous deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history occurred at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, just last year. The Pulse shooter, Omar Mateen, was born in the U.S. to Afghan parents.Between 1975 and 2015, foreign-born terrorists ― including immigrants and tourists ― killed a total of 3,024 people on U.S. soil, according to a 2016 Cato Institute report. All but 41 of those deaths came on Sept. 11, 2001, and in the following days. More than 30,000 people in the U.S. are killed by firearms each year.As a legal matter, it’s difficult to prove in court that a mass shooting constitutes an act of terror. In the most basic definition of the term, however, a mass shooting inflicts terror on a population, whether it be at a school, a church, a movie theater or a baseball field. If the goal is to prevent casualties of U.S. citizens, mass shootings such as the one that occurred in Las Vegas deserve as much attention from lawmakers as conventional terror attacks.“This was a horrific event to say the least,” Nevada’s Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said Monday, as casualty numbers continued to rise. “This was a classic WMD. This is a weapon, and a man, of mass destruction.”Addressing the shooting in remarks Monday morning at the White House, Trump called the attack an “act of pure evil.” He talked of finding comfort in Scripture and said Americans will join together. The president did not, however, mention terror or guns ― notable for someone who frequently criticized Democrats for refusing to use the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism.”Trump’s rationale for curtailing immigration and admission of refugees into the U.S. is also weakened by the likelihood of American citizens losing their lives at the hands of foreign-born terrorists and refugees. According to a 2016 study by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, foreign-born terrorists pose a very small risk to U.S. citizens ― far lower than dying by shark attack or asteroid strike. Moreover, according to Cato, the probability of being killed in a refugee-perpetrated terror attack is 1 in 3.64 billion per year.The threat of Islamic terrorism to Americans also tends to be exaggerated. Between the Sept. 11 terror attacks and the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, right-wing terror attacks ― defined by the government as motivated by principles of racial supremacy and embracing anti-government or anti-regulatory beliefs ― actually claimed more lives than those reportedly motivated by Islamic extremism, according to a recent study by the New America Foundation.Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who pushed for gun control legislation after a 2012 attack by a gunman in his home state in which the victims included 20 children, blasted his colleagues on Monday for refusing to take action to curb gun violence.“This must stop. It is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend there aren’t public policy responses to this epidemic,” he said in a statement. “There are, and the thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative indifference. It’s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something.”"
13,IMPACT,This Immigrant Teaches Sewing Skills To Empower Refugees,Alessandra Freitas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-immigrant-created-a-nonprofit-that-teaches-sewing-skills-to-empower-refugees_us_59cc72fae4b05063fe0f148b,An Indian immigrant in Ohio is helping Bhutanese women to be economically independent through her new program.,2017-10-02,Students are now able to produce a wide range of unique pieces.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cd8722180000f507c9d752.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When financial planner Manju Rastogi first arrived in the U.S. from India, back in 1969, she recalls that she had never felt more lonely. The 21-year-old former flight attendant had just gotten married and landed in Troy, Ohio, to start a new life with her husband at the time.“We were the only Indian couple in that city for three or four years, so it was very isolating having no family and no one to teach you anything,” she told HuffPost. The situation worsened after she started having problems in her marriage and found herself having to raise two kids while still adjusting to life in a new country.“I needed to find a job to make sure me and my children would be alright in case anything happened,” she said.The challenge of finding work that would fit into her skill set proved to be harder than she thought. In 1976, she left Troy and moved to Akron to pursue a teaching certificate ― but going back to school was soon ruled out, given the required time and monetary investment. An opportunity to work in financial planning came up ― and despite her lack of experience, she decided to give it a shot and “learn on the job.”“Eventually I would actually become very good at it, to the point that it became my entire career,” she said. The struggle to resettle in Ohio and find a place in the job market is not just a big hurdle for Indian immigrants like Rastogi. Stories like hers have been repeated on a larger scale since 2008 as Bhutanese refugees began to arrive in the state from United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) camps in southeastern lowlands of Nepal.This happened as a result of a 2007 offer under the George W. Bush administration to accept 60,000 Bhutanese refugees of Nepali descent. Although the refugees had fled to Nepal in the 1990s, when thousands were forcibly deported during the ethnic cleansing of Bhutan, they were never integrated in the country and remained isolated in the U.N. camps.Despite hopes that Nepal would offer the Bhutanese refugees citizenship, political instability made this an unviable option and third-country resettlement began to offer better living conditions to the refugees. Ohio was one of the main destinations for the Bhutanese, and data from 2015 shows that there were an estimated 4,000 Bhutanese refugees living in the Akron area.Watching refugees arrive reminded Rastogi of her own immigrant story.“I wanted to help people that were facing the same issues as I was 40 years ago,” she told HuffPost.Clueless about life in the U.S after just coming from camps in Nepal, most refugees had trouble getting settled in the city. They were initially concentrated in certain apartments, where Rastogi would go to offer help.“Their lives in camps were very restricted, especially for the women,” Rastogi explained. Although the young ones had a higher level of education, the older ones were not very literate.“By talking to them I realized that these women were in such great need for money that whatever help we could give them had to fit into a money-making project to keep them involved,” she said. “Some of them had sewing training from the camps, and that’s how we had the idea for Dawn Creations.”Developing Alternatives for Women in New Communities, or DAWN, was founded in 2013 with the goal of helping Bhutanese women improve their sewing skills at a competitive level in the U.S, while also providing community support, empowerment and a place of safety and acceptance. The idea was to give them the necessary resources so they could work as self-employed seamstresses.To get the organization started, Rastogi collected donations from the local Bath and Fairlawn communities, such as sewing machines, quilting fabric supplies and Indian silk. However, she soon realized that the secondhand gear wouldn’t be sufficient to produce high-quality material. The solution was to apply for grants such as the Knight Foundation and Hillier Family Foundation ― which awarded the organization $17,000 to buy new machinery, fabric and supplies. The nonprofit was then able to not only offer sewing classes for free, but to also pay the students for their time producing handcrafted material, giving them the opportunity to sell their items in fundraisers and local private parties. Despite the different levels of experience, students are now able to produce a wide range of unique pieces, such as felted soap, silk scarves, yoga mat bags, reversible yoga blankets made from cotton saris, kantha quilts, silk iPad cases, bed scarves and cushion covers. They get 80 percent of the sales profit ― and the remaining is used to pay for the nonprofit expenses. The price varies from $10 to $50 for each product. Dawn Creations equips each student with a sewing machine, table, cutting tools and supplies that she can take home. To keep the equipment they must attend at least two years of classes, held entirely by volunteers. The meetings happen twice a month on Saturdays, from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., at the Patterson Community Center in Akron’s North Hill neighborhood. The classes are not limited to sewing lessons. Bhutanese women also learn how to communicate, get over their shyness, talk to the local community and gain confidence to have a voice in their homes and be successfully self-employed. With the money from the products they sell, many women were given a chance to carve a path to a better life in Akron. According to Rastogi, one seamstress was able to buy an apartment with the money she got from selling her products. “We have to change their mindset in order to empower and encourage them to accomplish more things,” Rastogi told HuffPost. “In the camps they’re used to working for someone and being told what to do, now they have to be their own bosses and decide what they want.”As for next steps, Rastogi said she hopes to find more retail companies to sell the refugees’ products. Her program also recently started to accept refugees from other countries, such as the Congo, Pakistan and Afghanistan. For the upcoming classes, experienced students will get a chance to mentor and teach beginners.“This is a community effort, it’s a two-way street,” Rastogi added. “Akron has gone through an amazing change because of the refugee population that came in ― the refugees provide good quality service and the community returns them with acceptance and mentoring.”"

The outlet reported he was taken off life support the next day when he was found to have “no brain activity.”Several news outlets, including HuffPost, had announced the singer’s death earlier Monday after the Los Angeles Police Department “inadvertently provided [info] to some media sources.” The outlets walked those reports back, and the police apologized for the error.Late Monday, the band’s manager released a statement confirming the death of the music icon:Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released their self-titled debut in 1976, which included the Top 40 hit “Breakdown.” Over the following decades, the band turned out over a dozen studio albums and a steady string of hits that included “Don’t Do Me Like That,” “Refugee,” “The Waiting” and “American Girl.” Petty also kept busy with solo hits such as “Free Fallin’” and “I Won’t Back Down,” as well as performing with the band Mudcrutch and the Traveling Wilburys, a folk-rock supergroup featuring Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison. Dylan, reached by Rolling Stone, described Petty’s death as “shocking, crushing news” and said he would always remember his friend.“I thought the world of Tom,” he told the outlet. “He was great performer, full of the light, a friend, and I’ll never forget him.”Born in Gainesville, Florida, on Oct. 20, 1950, Petty’s childhood was marred by poverty and hardship. In “Petty: The Biography,” written by fellow musician and superfan Warren Zanes, Petty recalled being frequently beaten by his abusive father. “When my father got home ... he came in, took a belt and beat the living shit out of me,” he said. “He beat me so bad that I was covered in raised welts, from my head to my toes. I mean, you can’t imagine someone hitting a child like that.”Petty said he found solace and meaning through music early on. At the age of 11, he famously met Elvis Presley while the rock and roll star was in Florida filming a movie. In an interview with Esquire, Petty said he remembered Presley looking almost mythical. “I was really young and impressionable,” Petty recalled. “Elvis really did look ... sort of not real, as if he were glowing. He was astounding, even spiritual.”Petty said his meeting with Presley sparked his love for rock and roll, but it was The Beatles’ 1964 appearance on “The Ed Sullivan Show” that convinced him to make his own music.“This was the great moment in my life, really, that changed everything,” he said. Petty quit high school when he was 17 to join Mudcrutch, a rock group that would include two of his future bandmates, Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench. The pair would join Petty to become longtime members of the Heartbreakers in 1975. The newly formed group released their debut album, “Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,” a year later.The group had a slow beginning, but became a hit a few years later with the album “Damn the Torpedoes,” which sold 3 million copies and was certified multiplatinum. Petty and the Heartbreakers continued to tour for decades, releasing hit record after hit record, including several with Petty billed as a solo artist with backing from several bandmates. The hit song “Free Fallin’” came in 1989 as part of his debut solo album “Full Moon Fever,” which sold 5 million copies and went on to become his best-selling record.Following the end of his first marriage, to Jane Benyo, after more than 20 years, Petty fought and overcame heroin addiction in the late 1990s, spending time in rehab.“Using heroin went against my grain,” he told Zanes, his biographer. “I didn’t want to be enslaved to anything. So I was always trying to figure out how to do less, and then that wouldn’t work. Tried to go cold turkey, and that wouldn’t work. It’s an ugly fucking thing.”Petty went on to produce more hit records and tour the world, including two headlining spots at the Bonnaroo Music Festival ― in both 2006 and 2013.“I like to play these festivals. We’re one of those old, lucky bands,” Petty told Rolling Stone in 2013. “Young people come to see us. It makes a difference.”He added that the previous few years had been “so wonderful” for the band. “We’re such happy campers – sickeningly happy,” he said.Petty, who sold more than 80 million albums worldwide over the course of his illustrious career, was nominated for 18 Grammy awards and won three, including Best Male Rock Vocal Performance in 1995 for “You Don’t Know How It Feels.” He’s also considered one of the greatest songwriters to have ever lived. In 2002, Petty was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside the rest of the Heartbreakers. “A rock star is the single purest mainstream manifestation of the American dream,” he said at the time, expressing gratitude for the honor. “I marvel at this.”The Heartbreakers have continued to perform with few changes to the band’s original lineup, marking the 40th anniversary of their debut record last year. Their anniversary tour kicked off in April, but in an interview with Rolling Stone, Petty called it the group’s “last big one.”“We’re all on the backside of our sixties,” he said. “I have a granddaughter now I’d like to see as much as I can. I don’t want to spend my life on the road. This tour will take me away for four months. With a little kid, that’s a lot of time.”Mourning Petty’s death, some fans have been sharing a particularly poignant song on social media: The 1989 Traveling Wilburys’ song “End of the Line,” which was released after the death of band member Roy Orbison.“Maybe somewhere down the road a ways, you’ll think of me,” Petty croons in the song. “And wonder where I am these days.” This story has been updated to include confirmation Petty died, as well as to account for earlier mistaken reports of his death.Ed Mazza contributed reporting."

At least 800 people were injured in the crackdown, according to the Catalan regional government.The shocking scenes of unrest and violent tactics of the police brought international attention to Catalonia, with the subsequent chaos from the actions to stop the referendum giving additional weight to the symbolic independence vote. Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull told reporters on Monday morning that 90 percent of Catalans voted yes, but turnout in the disputed referendum was only around 43 percent of eligible voters.The violence threatens to deepen the longstanding divisions between Catalan separatists and the Spanish government, putting pressure on Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and ensuring that the issue of independence will only become more prominent in the days to come. Images and videos circulating from Barcelona, the capital of the autonomous region, and other cities across the area showed officers violently shutting down a peaceful referendum, albeit one banned by Spain’s central government and deemed illegitimate by the country’s courts. Footage captured police smashing through glass doors and dragging away dissident citizens attempting to protect polling stations. Some protesters tussled with authorities, leading to several arrests and reports that at least 12 officers had been injured. In a further sign of the divide between regional authorities, Spain’s riot police got into confrontations with Catalan regional officers and firefighters attempting to allow the rallies and referendum to proceed. Spain’s police closed nearly a hundred polling stations in all, and arrested several protesters.The clampdown also deepened political divisions between Catalan government officials and Spain’s leadership in Madrid. Tensions over the referendum have been rising for months as the vote approached, and as violence erupted on Sunday both sides blamed one another for the situation. Barcelona’s Mayor Ada Colau called for Prime Minister Rajoy to resign following the crackdown, saying “he is a coward who does not live up to his state responsibilities.” Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, meanwhile, claimed that the police actions would eternally shame the country.Several leftist Spanish politicians also joined in the calls for Rajoy’s ouster, adding to the prime minister’s political woes. He is currently the head of a relatively fragile minority government that has already run into trouble in recent weeks from political partners protesting his handling of Catalonia’s bid for secession.Rajoy defended the police actions on Sunday as a justified response to Catalonia’s attempts to break “the rule of law,” while denying that a referendum had taken place, emphasizing the lack of participation and the illegality of the vote. But although Rajoy has always had the support of the European Union and the courts in rejecting the legitimacy of Catalonia’s referendum, the harsh response from authorities could embolden the separatist movement.The level of support for independence in Catalonia is not entirely clear. Polling was scarce in the lead up to the election, but a survey from July showed that only around 41 percent of people in Catalonia favored independence. Most major European Union officials were largely silent over the events in Catalonia, although some figures including Belgium’s Prime Minister Charles Michel and the EU parliament’s Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt condemned the violence.Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon, who has pursued a second independence referendum for Scotland in the United Kingdom, called Spain’s actions “wrong and damaging.” This post has been updated with the Catalan government’s announcement of results and turnout figures.

Trump doubled down on his message a few hours later and argued that years have negotiations with North Korea have brought few results. “Being nice to Rocket Man hasn’t worked in 25 years, why would it work now?” Trump said. The president’s comments come one day after Tillerson disclosed the U.S. has direct lines of communications with North Korea. Tillerson told reporters in Beijing several diplomatic channels are open, and that the U.S. is seeking to engage in dialogue with North Korea.“We ask: ‘Would you like to talk?’ We have lines of communications to Pyongyang. We’re not in a dark situation, a blackout,” Tillerson said.A senior U.S. official on Sunday told Reuters that Trump, however, does not believe now is the time to negotiate with North Korea and that existing diplomatic channels are intended to negotiate for the return of American citizens who are detained in the country. Tensions between the U.S. and North Korea have escalated in recent months amid advancements in Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear programs. North Korea has launched provocative missile tests, including flying projectiles over Japan, and last month conducted its most powerful nuclear test to date.Trump has responded to North Korea’s actions with weeks of bellicose statements, including threats of military action and insults directed at Kim. The result has been an escalating war of words between Pyongyang officials and Trump, along with fresh international sanctions against North Korea as it continues to carry out missile tests.Tillerson has often taken on the role of walking back Trump’s volatile rhetoric and boasts about U.S. military power. After the president threatened in August that North Korean threats would be met with “fire and fury like the world has never seen,” for instance, Tillerson said that there was no dramatic change in relations between the two countries and that Americans shouldn’t worry.On Saturday in Beijing, Tillerson spoke of peaceful denuclearization of North Korea and offered assurances that the U.S. is not trying to topple Kim’s regime. ”I think the whole situation’s a bit overheated right now,“ Tillerson said. ”I think everyone would like for it to calm down.But as Trump and Kim continue to goad each other into possible reprisals, the prospects for diffusing tensions have been repeatedly scuttled.Trump’s Sunday morning Twitter post comes as the president is facing increasing domestic pressure and criticism over his handling of disaster relief efforts for hurricane-stricken Puerto Rico. The vast majority of the island is still without power, basic necessities are running low and thousands are homeless.This article has been updated with comment from a U.S. official on Trump’s view toward negotiating with North Korea."

I think it was a terrorist attack and the individual who was killed seems to have had several identities,” Marseille mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin told reporters.Paris was rocked in 2015 by multiple attacks that killed 130 people. In 2016 a gunman drove a truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, killing 86 people. Both of these attacks were claimed by Islamic State.Other countries, including Britain, Germany and Belgium, have also suffered attacks by militants using knives, guns, explosives and driving vehicles at crowds.Some 200 police officers cordoned off the area and all roads were closed to traffic.A witness told Reuters she saw a man take out a knife from his sleeve and then stab a young girl and then a second woman, shouting what could have been “Allahu Akbar.”“BARBARIC ACT”Speaking in Marseille, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said the man had initially killed one woman and looked to be running away before returning to attack a second woman and then rush towards soldiers from the Sentinelle force who arrived on the scene quickly and shot him dead.Two police sources said the attacker had been carrying a butcher’s knife, was around 30 years old and of North African appearance. One source said he was known to police for common law crimes, while another said digital analysis of fingerprints had come up with several aliases.“This could be an act of terrorism, but we cannot confirm it fully at this stage,” Collomb told reporters.French troops are part of a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and has thousands of soldiers in West Africa fighting al Qaeda-linked militants, operations that have made these groups urge their followers to target France.Security forces have increasingly been targeted by militants in knife attacks. A man wielding a knife attacked a soldier in a Paris metro station on Sept. 15.President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter he was “disgusted by this barbaric act” and praised the calmness and efficiency of security forces.French lawmakers are due to vote on a much-criticized anti-terrorism law on Tuesday, which would see France come out of its state-of-emergency in November, although some of the powers would be enshrined into law.The number of military personnel on the ground is also due to be reduced slightly, although the force is being adapted to make it more mobile and its movements less predictable.“The presence of Sentinelle soldiers, their speed and efficiency ensured that the death count was not bigger,” police union official Stephane Battaglia told Reuters.

Meanwhile, 95 percent of people were without electrical power as of Saturday, the DOD reported.At a press conference on Sunday morning ― 11 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island ― Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello expressed both confidence and frustration over the ongoing relief efforts.“Food and water are getting there, it is increasing, the logistics and the visibilities [of the aid effort] are increasing as well, although as I’ve stated before we recognize that we still need to do much more,” he said.Rossello went on to discuss the “disadvantage and inequality” that he said his island’s residents have faced for “more than a century” when compared to the U.S. mainland.“Even after the storm hit Puerto Rico, even when it was evident that it was a disaster in the U.S., only half of our U.S. citizens in the mainland knew that Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens,” he said.A poll by Morning Consult found that only 54 percent of Americans were aware of the citizenship status of Puerto Ricans.He went on to stress the poor health care received by the island’s roughly 3.4 million residents, compared with that available for those on the mainland. He also said that Puerto Rico’s military veterans “don’t get equal treatment,” despite the island having a storied history of military service.“I invite everybody to reflect on this situation,” he said.Relief efforts have been a point of contention in the days after the storm, with Trump having been criticized for repeatedly lauding relief work despite the dire conditions on the ground while also attacking Carmen Yulin Cruz ― mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico’s largest city ― who has publicly begged for more help.“The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday.He lashed out against such critics again Sunday on Twitter, calling them “politically motivated ingrates.”“We have done a great job with the almost impossible solution in Puerto Rico,” he tweeted.“People are now starting to recognize the amazing work that has been done by FEMA and our great Military,” he added, while reporting that “all buildings” have now been inspected ― something officials at Sunday’s press conference said they were unable to confirm or elaborate on.Cruz, appearing on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,” said the response by the Federal Emergency Management Agency was still falling short.“People have been told to register via internet for FEMA relief when we don’t have any internet or very little internet even in the San Juan metropolitan area,” she said.Rossello, who has received praise from Trump, defended the president as well as other government officials Sunday morning and asked that a “nonpartisan” solution to the island’s crisis be sought.FEMA Director Brock Long, speaking on Fox News Sunday, also tried to distance himself from criticism and complaints, but acknowledged much work remains.“Every day we have progress. Every day we have setbacks,” he said.“It’s not only a logistically complex event ― just getting to the island, and being able to support an island that was hit not just by one major hurricane but two within basically a 10-day period,” he said, referring to initial damage done by Hurricane Irma. “Do we have a long way to go? Absolutely,” he said.Trump and first lady Melania Trump plan to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday."

And just in case anyone was going to go after him for not paying attention to the disaster, he attempted to pre-empt the criticism: He dedicated the trophy to the victims of the storm. “On behalf of all the people in Texas and all of the people of ― if you look today and you see what’s happening, how horrible it is, but we have it under really great control ― Puerto Rico, and the people of Florida who have suffered over this last short period of time with the hurricanes. I want to just remember them,” Trump said.“And we’re going to dedicate this trophy to all of those people that went through so much that we love, a part of our great state, really a part of our great nation,” he added, before pivoting to talking about golf. “And I’ll tell you what ― I’ve been watching this thing from the beginning. And I have to say, our Team USA, wow, did you play well.”Trump made his remarks at the Presidents Cup golf tournament at Liberty National Golf Course in Jersey City, New Jersey. Trump’s attempt to appear engaged by giving a shout-out to the storm victims made the optics of the whole situation even worse.A person at the ceremony yelled, “You don’t give a shit about Puerto Rico!” according to reporters at the event. A golf trophy does nothing for the people who are struggling to recover after the devastating hurricane. Only 5 percent of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid is back up and running, and it could be months before residents get regular service back. More than half the U.S. territory remains without drinking water. Trump is the first sitting U.S. president to present the trophy to the winning team, and the first sitting president to attend since 2000. Trump, however, loves golf. Last weekend, as the crisis in Puerto Rico was unfolding, the president spent time at his own private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump was there this weekend as well. Although his administration received praise for its response to the hurricanes that hit Florida and Texas, Trump has appeared more out-of-touch for Hurricane Maria. He and his top officials have insisted that they are doing a superb job responding, attracting harsh rebuttals from people who are actually on the ground. Elaine Duke, the acting head of the Department of Homeland Services, called what was happening in Puerto Rico “a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths that have taken place.”That assessment was quickly hit down by the mayor of San Juan, who was disgusted by the comments. Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz said the hurricane was a “people are dying’ story.’” Army Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who is leading the military response to the hurricane, acknowledged that the response was so far “not enough.”Trump’s attempts to show his engagement in the recovery efforts have made him look even more out of touch. Besides dedicating a golf trophy, Trump tweeted an attack Saturday morning on the mayor of San Juan because she dared to criticize him: Trump has not yet been to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Maria, but he plans to visit the U.S. territory on Tuesday.CORRECTION: This article originally stated that Liberty National Golf Course was in Bedminster, New Jersey.

Sometimes the prizes were a “zonk” - a gag gift such as a live donkey or a wrecked car.Hall was the co-creator of “Let’s Make a Deal” and hosted more than 4,000 episodes from 1963 to 1986 (with occasional hiatuses) and then again in 1990 and 1991. The show drew good ratings even as it jumped from network to network and into syndication.“Let’s Make a Deal” became a part of American pop culture, with Hall one of the most recognizable stars on TV.Hall also produced other game shows, hosted variety shows and appeared as a guest star on television series. He was known for charity work for organizations including Variety Clubs International, which raised money for disadvantaged children.“Many people know my father as an icon on TV but he was also a tireless supporter of charities that meant as much to him as his TV work,” Richard Hall said by telephone from California.He was born Monte Halperin on Aug. 25, 1921, in Winnipeg, the son of a slaughterhouse owner father and an actress mother. After working in radio in Canada, he came to the United States in 1955.In the early 1960s, he was developing game shows and joined forces with TV veteran Stefan Hatos. They devised “Let’s Make a Deal” in which Hall picked people from the audience to become contestants in sort of a trading game. Initially, audience members wore normal clothing but started wearing costumes and carrying funny signs to get Hall’s attention.Hall would offer contestants a modest prize, then give them a chance to trade it for a mystery prize hidden by a curtain, stashed in a big box or concealed behind door No. 1, door No. 2 or door No. 3. That prize might be worth thousands of dollars or might be a “zonk” like a farm animal. Audience members jumped up and down, shouted, cried and kissed Hall when they won, and sometimes even when they lost.“In 4,700 shows, I got kissed 50,000 times,” Hall said in an interview with a classic TV website. “Even when they lost, they were very nice about it. But you know the law in game shows - if you go on a show and you win a donkey, that’s your prize. You’re entitled to it.”The show’s producers showed mercy on the “zonk” winners, however. After the taping of the show, they would be offered a substitute prize, such as a television, and most would take it.“In 1 percent of the cases, they didn’t,” Hall said. “There was a time when a farmer won five calves and he wanted the calves. That cost me a fortune because when you rent them from the animal place, they’re expensive.”Other members of the show’s team were studio announcer Jay Stewart and model Carol Merrill, who displayed the prizes.Hall made appearances on revivals of the show, including the version hosted by comedian Wayne Brady starting in 2009.In 1991, the New York Times published an article about what became known as “the Monty Hall problem” - a probability puzzle hotly debated by mathematicians centering on the advisability of switching choices when given options like those on his show. The conundrum was featured in the 2008 film “21″ with Kevin Spacey.Hall was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1973.In 1947, Hall married his wife, Marilyn, who became an Emmy Award-winning producer. Their three children include Tony Award-winning actress Joanna Gleason."

But following a week of heated public debate about the protests fueled by none other than the president himself, the movement seems to be losing momentum among some teams.Demonstrations on Sunday appeared to be primarily aimed at displaying solidarity between football players, owners and fans, and defending athletes’ right to free speech, rather than explicitly drawing attention to racial injustice and police brutality in the United States ― the initial goal of the protest movement. Here is a list of players and teams who demonstrated during Sunday’s games to kick off the fourth week of the regular season: SAINTS vs. DOLPHINSThree Miami Dolphins players knelt during the national anthem, in contrast to last weekend’s game against the New York Jets, when the entire Dolphins team stood with arms locked together. The entire New Orleans Saints team stood on Sunday. Last weekend, nearly a dozen Saints players remained seated on a bench during the anthem. PANTHERS vs. PATRIOTS:Both the New England Patriots and the Carolina Panthers stood for the anthem.Last weekend, 17 Patriots players opted to take a knee. All but one of the Panthers’ players stood during the anthem. Defensive end Julius Peppers opted to stay off the field.JAGUARS vs. JETS:The New York Jets stood with arms locked during the anthem. Joining them was team owner Christopher Johnson.Several players were seen kneeling on the field before the anthem played.The Jacksonville Jaguars took a knee as a team before the anthem played. In a statement released before the game, the team said they would kneel in prayer “for change, progress and equality for everyone who calls the United States their homes.”Once the anthem played, they stood with their arms locked together.Last week, about a dozen Jaguar players knelt during the anthem in London. Others stood arm-in-arm, two of the players with team owner Shahid Khan. TITANS vs. TEXANS:All but one of the Tennessee Titans stood for the anthem. Missing wide receiver Richard Matthews had said that he would kneel during the anthem until President Trump apologized for remarks he made last week against NFL players.Last week, the Titans decided to remain in their locker room during the anthem. Their opponent, the Seattle Seahawks, did the same.The Houston Texans all stood during the anthem on Sunday, but with arms linked together. They took the same stance during last weekend’s game against the New England Patriots. STEELERS vs. RAVENSThe Baltimore Ravens stood during the anthem on Sunday but took a knee in prayer just before, which prompted boos from the stadium.The team prayed “that we as a nation embrace kindness, unity, equality and justice for all Americans,” according to The Associated Press.Last weekend, several Ravens players took a knee during the anthem, joining at least a dozen Jacksonville Jaguars players.The Pittsburgh Steelers also chose to stand for the anthem on Sunday, in contrast to last week’s game when all but one of the players decided to stay in their locker room during the anthem. The lone player who ventured out onto the field, Alejandro Villanueva, later said he did so by mistake.BENGALS vs. BROWNSAt least nine Cleveland Browns players raised their right fists during the anthem before facing off against the Cincinnati Bengals, but both teams remained standing. Last week, 22 Browns players knelt before their game against the Indianapolis Colts, and a majority of the Bengals players stood with linked arms before their game against the Green Bay Packers.LIONS vs. VIKINGSTwo Detroit Lions linebackers, Jalen Reeves-Maybin and Steve Longa, took a knee on Sunday for the second week in a row while their teammates stood with locked arms. Last week, six additional Lions players knelt during the anthem.Many Minnesota Vikings linked arms during the anthem before playing against the Lions, but several players did not participate. The team held a similar demonstration last week.RAMS vs. COWBOYSAll Los Angeles Rams and Dallas Cowboys players stood during the anthem before their game Sunday. Rams outside linebacker Robert Quinn raised his fist for a second week in a row, and Cowboys defensive end Damontre Moore also did so as the song ended. Last week, the Cowboys briefly took a knee before the anthem began.BILLS vs. FALCONSSix Buffalo Bills players took a knee during the anthem on Sunday, while their teammates and the majority of their opponents, Atlanta Falcons players, stood with their arms locked. Several Bills knelt last week, as did two Falcons.EAGLES vs. CHARGERS:Both the Philadelphia Eagles and the Los Angeles Chargers stood during the anthem on Sunday.The Eagles stood with locked arms during last weekend’s game against the New York Giants. The Chargers for the majority also stood with locked arms last weekend, with the exception of one player who took a knee and five others who remained seated.THE 49ERS vs. CARDINALSMore than a dozen San Francisco 49ers took a knee during the national anthem.The team later tweeted out a video of the players standing and kneeling, all with their hands over their hearts. The caption read: “Together.” “For more than a year, members of our team have protested the oppression and social injustices still present in our society,” the team said in a statement. “While some may not have taken a knee or raised a fist, we have all shared the desire to influence positive change. Today, our team chose to publicly display our unity in a new way and, in turn, urge others to do the same.”The Arizona Cardinals, similar to last weekend’s game, stood during the national anthem.GIANTS vs. BUCCANEERSFor the second-straight Sunday, only one New York Giants player, Oliver Vernon, knelt during the national anthem, the New York Daily News reported. The rest of the team stood, two of them with their fists in the air. Last week, the entire Giants team, aside from Vernon, stood with linked arms.The game’s anthem was not televised, with broadcaster Fox Sports earlier announcing that they would only air the anthem ahead of the day’s first Dolphins vs. Saints match in London.The Giants’ opponent, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, stood normally during the anthem on Sunday. Last weekend, two of the team’s players knelt during the anthem as other teammates stood with linked arms.RAIDERS vs. BRONCOSThe entire Oakland Raiders team, minus one player, stood during the national anthem on Sunday.The missing player, running back Marshawn Lynch, chose to sit during the anthem. He made an earlier statement before the game by wearing an “everybody vs. Trump” T-shirt.The majority of the Raiders either remained seated or took a knee during last weekend’s game. The Denver Broncos’ entire team stood for the national anthem. More than half of the team knelt last week.COLTS vs. SEAHAWKSWhile the majority of the Seattle Seahawks players stood for the anthem, a handful of players, including defensive ends Michael Bennett and Frank Clark, sat down.The Seahawks organization did not participate in the anthem at all last week. Instead, the Seahawks announced on Friday that the team will launch a charity fund that will benefit education and leadership programs that fight inequality and promote justice. The Indianapolis Colts made a more subtle statement by standing with linked arms. Several Colts players kneeled during the anthem with locked arms last week, including receiver Matt Hazel, linebacker Jabaal Sheard and cornerback Rashaan Melvin. Trump himself invigorated a simmering protest movement when he called on NFL fans to pressure team owners into firing athletes who refused to stand during the national anthem to protest police brutality against African-Americans. The movement was spearheaded by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick last season. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick told NFL Media last year. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder,” he added. Last Friday in Alabama, Trump told his base the protests were an unpatriotic affront to the flag and the military. “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now,” Trump said at a rally. “Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’” NFL players and team owners across the country took offense at the president’s remarks, rallying in solidarity with the protesting athletes.Throughout all 28 NFL games played last Sunday, there were players, owners and staff participating in some sort of protest ― some athletes knelt during the anthem, many locked arms, a few teams even stayed in the locker room.The response from fans was mixed. Some were disappointed athletes refused to stand for the anthem, booing them from the benches or on social media, while others applauded their bravery.A recent HuffPost/YouGov poll found 48 percent of Americans believe it’s inappropriate for NFL players to kneel during the anthem. Fifty-four percent disapprove of Trump’s response to the protests ― which has included a barrage of angry tweets ―with 42 percent strongly disapproving.In the end, it was the Cowboys who first displayed the approach that many teams adopted this week. Together with owner Jerry Jones, team and staff took a knee in unison, but did so ahead of the anthem in Monday’s Cowboys-Cardinals game.Among the many statements about the protests published by teams throughout the week, including the 49ers’ fresh remarks on “oppression and social injustices,” only the Seattle Seahawks have specifically called out racial divides. Other teams have addressed the subject of their protests in more general terms.“The United States flag and our national anthem are both strong sources of inspiration and unity. Our respect for both is sincere,” the Jaguars said in a statement released Saturday. “Given recent events and remarks, however, we felt it was time last weekend to shine a light on the serious issues of inequality and social injustice that exist in our country.”"

Outside of his long career in Hollywood, Lear is also a political activist: He’s passionate about protecting the First Amendment and founded People for the American Way, an advocacy organization for progressive causes.“I didn’t set out to be a writer,” Lear tells Robert Scheer in the first of a two-part conversation, aired on this week’s episode of “Scheer Intelligence.”Lear begins by telling Scheer how his childhood and early experiences in the military shaped his political and moral views.“We were in love with what America was about then,” he says. But flying bomber planes in World War II changed his worldview. “We have to face our humanity,” he tells Scheer, after recounting his time in the war. “I think we, each of us, have the capacity for expressing, if not doing, the evil any other human being is capable of doing.”They discuss Lear’s rocky entrance into the television industry. “I was fired once because of the things that I caused to be printed,” he says.Scheer brings up “the impact of [Lear’s] shows … and the issues [he] dealt with,” to which Lear responds: “Those issues we dealt with were the issues American families were dealing with. … We did what we had to do.”“You were the force that changed television in America,” Scheer concludes.Lear has a new book out, “Even This I Get to Experience,” in which he chronicles his television career and decades of activism.Listen to the interview and to past editions of Scheer Intelligence at KCRW.com, and stay tuned for Part 2 of the conversation next week.RS: Hi, this is Robert Scheer with another edition of Scheer Intelligence, where the intelligence comes, hopefully, from my guests. In this case, no question: it’s Norman Lear. And--OK, the man’s a legend, the man has been a major force in making American life liveable. And I’m just going to read, he wrote a book recently, a terrific book. And it’s called Even This I Get to Experience. And the book came out, and you know, I hate to say it, I still buy my books at independent bookstores, but I was on Amazon, I got the electric version, electronic version. I read it, I read it straight through; and that’s not a great thing to do, ‘cause you should take a break and go to the bathroom or something. But I did; I couldn’t put it down. And I just--and then a message flashed and said, “Would you like to be the first one to review it.” So I’m going to read what I said then, impulsively, after reading his book. “Truly brilliant in its honesty, as one would expect from the man who transformed television from a myopic center of banality into a medium of accountability. All of the major controversies that confront us today, from war and peace on through race relations, gay rights, gender equality, freedom of and from religion, economic inequality, the right and obligation to challenge power and the powerful, and the reality that the American ideal would always be a work in progress was brought into the American home by this genius.”NL: If I was to be buried, I would want that on my stone.RS: Oh, there you go. [Laughter] I’m not paying for the stone, but I’ll talk to the people who are in the know. But I really, I meant it; I meant it, I wrote that at three in the morning or something, impulsively; I’ve known you for years. In fact, my wife warned me, don’t do these long introductions, but I do have to say, I met you on assignment from the Los Angeles Times; I was a young reporter. I think you had four of the top ten television shows: All in the Family--what else was on then, Sanford and--?NL: Maude, Sanford and Sons, Good Times, The Jeffersons. RS: OK. So you were this overwhelming figure dominating the ratings in television, and the amazing thing is you dealt with all the taboo topics; you had a gay football player long before anyone ever discussed the issue; the gay issue was not front and center, you dealt with gender inequality, as all the things I said before.NL: We just, only a few weeks ago, remembered that we dealt with transgender on a show called All That Glitters, which was a soap opera that was on five times a week. The show that followed Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, which was very successful. All That Glitters wasn’t as successful, wasn’t--I guess wasn’t successful. But in that show, Linda Gray, who became a great star, the company that the show was centered around, fictional company, was putting out a cigarette called--they had the Marlboro Woman. And this guy, played by Linda Gray, became a woman. RS: Ha--NL: Oh, my God, it was good. [Laughter] I loved that. RS: OK. So now, you know, people are used to seeing a lot of wild stuff because of cable and satellite and everything. But people should understand that we’re talking about a time when you had three networks--CBS was the most powerful--and they had programming practices, directors, and censorship was alive and strong. And here was this, this guy out there in California, challenging them in a very profound way. And you won because you got the ratings, but it was a--NL: Yes, may I--I would underline that. Because of the ratings. It wasn’t because I was this, that, or the other thing; it was because the shows delivered viewers.RS: Yeah, but it turned out you got the ratings because it turned out the American public was a hell of a lot more tolerant and serious and--even though this was largely comedy--and could entertain a range of ideas. And so--NL: Who was it, Bob, who said--the name is on the tip of my mind--nobody ever lost money underestimating the intelligence of the American people. Some wit said that. And I think the establishment, by and large, has gone by that kind of, you know, edict: Nobody ever lost money underestimating the intelligence--I never believed that. We probably are not the best educated people in the world, or country in the world; but we’re wise of heart. There’s enough smartness to go around, if that smartness is appealed to.RS: Well [Laughs], that’s an important reminder at a time when Donald Trump is president. And you’re going to be honored at the--NL: Well it applies, in my mind, more now than ever. ‘Cause I think of Donald Trump as the middle finger of the American right hand. They said a long time ago, as he was running, “We see leadership everywhere; we see leadership in the Congress, leadership running for, you know, the republicans or the democrats, or we see leadership in business and we see the automobile with the airbag, you know, killing people but they keep making them, and they keep making them. We see pharmaceutical companies and read stories about how badly they’re treating us. Leadership stinks, leader--there is no leadership. It’s all short term.” I could go on--I will go on. [Laughs]RS: You will go on. But let me say, by the way--so you’re going to be honored this year at the Kennedy Center on July 4th, right? Of next year--NL: Yes--no, no, December 2nd.RS: December 2nd, OK, at the Kennedy Center. And you’re going to be, this coming July 4th you’re going to be 96. And you’re--NL: No. I’m going to be 95. I will still be 95; it won’t be ‘til the 27th that I’m 96.RS: OK. [Laughs] NL: So this will be my 95th Fourth of July. RS: OK. But you’ll be at the Kennedy Center, and you actually said you wouldn’t go to the White House for a preliminary thing because you were disapproving of Donald Trump’s cuts on the programs for the arts, and so forth. But Donald Trump--and we’re recording this the week that Donald Trump spoke at the UN, and he stressed patriotism--patriotism, patriotism. Very similar in my memory to Richard Nixon stressing patriotism. And you have been, one of your great achievements in your civic achievements is you founded People for the American Way. And you challenged a kind of mindless appeal to patriotism, and you came out for diversity and dissent and questioning and so forth. And I was thinking, watching Donald Trump invoking patriotism, patriotism, the same as Richard Nixon--neither of these guys experienced war and the horror of war, you know, and so forth. You did! You did. You, like George McGovern, who Richard Nixon defeated, you both were up there in those airplanes, flying over Germany in the most dangerous of missions. I forget how many George McGovern had, the democratic candidate now somewhat forgotten. But a truly heroic figure in every aspect of his life, and a man of reason and common sense. And yet his patriotism was challenged by Richard Nixon, but it was George McGovern who won the distinguished Flying Cross, and who flew--I think it was 53 or something, really dangerous missions. And when Norman Lear--you--got involved with People for the American Way, you were attacked all over the place--who is this, you know, character, and he’s disloyal, and blah blah blah. And the fact is--and you at the time, it wasn’t until your book came out, you really addressed this question of your own war record. And I recall you never brought it up--when I interviewed you--NL: What do you mean, it’s not in the book? Of course it’s in--RS: Of course--no, I said, when I read it in the book--NL: Oh.RS: --but when I interviewed you some 40 years ago for the LA Times, you didn’t mention it.NL: Yeah.RS: And you didn’t mention it when you were in the middle of a lot of controversies, and so forth. And yet--NL: When World War II came along, that was the war where, without question, we were the good guys. I mean, there was no question about that war--that we had been attacked.RS: That didn’t mean you had to go. You were a kid--NL: But I had to.RS: --twenty-year-old kid at Emerson College, right? Back East. And your parents thought, you know, why you? Right? As I recall, you wrote that somewhere. And, ah, you--you went. You said--NL: Because I thought when--Norman, when you’re 95, you want to be able to say you fought in World War II. [Laughs]RS: Yeah, and you did.NL: And I did. And--RS: And so as long as we’re touching on that, tell us--you know, because you haven’t talked about it a lot; in the book you do a bit. What did it mean? And what did it do to your thinking? I mean, you were up there--NL: Well, let me--let me start by saying, this is all stuff you’ve read in the book, but when I was nine years old my father went to prison. When I was nine or ten years old my dad was away; I heard Father Coughlin on radio. He was a Catholic priest who was anti-Semitic, pro-fascist, as it turned out; I don’t know if we were using the word fascist at this time, but Hitler was coming along and he liked what was going on in Germany, and he hated Jews, and he said so in his fashion. And it scared the hell out of me. But I had one saving grace: I was, in school there were civics classes. I want to repeat that and repeat that and repeat that. We had civics classes. We were learning, in school, the promises that the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, the preamble to it, all of those words--meant and made, those promises that were made to all of us. Equal justice under the law, equal opportunity in America under the law. I often think we were in love with America because we understood this. We all love our country today; I wouldn’t challenge anybody’s patriotism. But we were in love with what America was about then. Because we were learning, as kids, what America was about. And those promises we have yet to deliver on are the promises that continue to sustain me. Someday, we’re going to get ahold of ourselves and deliver on those promises.RS: Such as?NL: We were rehearsing at Emerson College on a Sunday morning, a play called Two Orphans; I remember that so clearly. Gertrude Binley Kay was our director; she was, you know, a professor at the college. She wore huge hats and [imitating accent] she talked in a Boston Brahmin kind of fashion. That’s a pretty good imitation of Gertrude Binley Kay. And somebody came running in at 10:30 or so in the morning to say they’d just heard on the radio that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. And [Laughs], and Gertrude Binley Kay [imitating accent] wished us all to go down to Boylston Street to the Japanese antique store and throw rocks through the window. That was her eruption. My eruption was, I’ve got to join the military. I mean, we weren’t at war that day; we were going to be at war in two days, as it turned out, when FDR declared war. And I just had to be a part of it. RS: And so--NL: Out of everything that I said preceding that--out of what I think of as in love with what we were about. RS: When you say “part of it”--and your experience was really quite similar to George McGovern; McGovern was a divinity student, and he volunteered, and he was a pilot. And, you know, heroically crash-landed his plane to save the troops, and did all these bombing missions and so forth; you know, flying over Germany was the most dangerous thing you could do. And you ended up in that position--NL: Can I tell you a story about flying over Germany that’s very recent?RS: Yeah.NL: Two years ago, about two months before the Veterans Day parade in New York, the Air Force had learned that I had flown, that my group had flown the longest mission in the European theater. There were two theaters of war, the Eastern and the Western. And from Foggia, Italy, where I was stationed to Berlin--it was the longest mission--it was flown twice; I flew it once. They also learned that Tuskegee Airmen had flown with us to protect us; you know, they were in P-51s, we were in bombers, B-17s. And I loved the Tuskegee Airmen, because they seemed to fly closer to us; we felt more protection when we saw their red tails, and sometimes we saw their black faces. Tuskegee Airmen was the only African American group in the Air Force. They asked us--oh, and they found Roscoe Brown, was his name, university president, African American, had been a Tuskegee Airman, and flown that mission. So the two of us led the parade, the Veterans Day parade, two or three years ago. Roscoe has since passed, I’m sorry to say. But that was the thrill of thrills, to meet him, to stand there and shake his hand in front of that crowd and then, you know, travel up Fifth Avenue. But this is also a significant part of the story. Lynn and I, my wife and I, were in Europe a year after that. And our friends the Emersons were the ambassadors in Berlin, still sitting in, and they had--RS: John Emerson from--NL: John and Kimberly Emerson. And they invited us to come and stay with them for a few days. We were flying into Berlin, Lynn and I, commercially, and I was remembering the only other time I had flown--I didn’t go into Berlin; we bombed it. I was the radio operator and I had the top gun. The radio operator was the closest position to the bomb bay doors. So I was the guy who leaned over--I had to get up a little and lean over to see that the last bomb left the bay, and then I could tell the pilot he could close the bomb bay doors. On every mission, that was part of my job: to let the pilot know the last bomb had left the bay. So I had the experience, on every mission, of looking down and watching our bombs leave our bay, and then gather with all the bombs from all the other B-17s--hundreds of bombs dropping. And I remember thinking, hundreds of bombs--they don’t all hit a target. One of them hits a farmhouse. And I even imagined a family sitting around the table. And I have a tendency to want to bite my lip as I’m saying this, with the frustration of it. But I remember each and every time thinking, what if it hits a farmhouse? And thinking: “I don’t give a shit. I don’t care. I don’t care.” Then I also recall a day later, or hours later, I don’t know, but at some point thinking: If anybody came to me with a piece of paper and a pencil and said, “Mr. Lear, sign this, and forever you will never--you will never doubt yourself, you will always not care if a bomb hit a family,” and I thought to myself, “I could never sign that. I would never sign that. That’s not me.” But the fact of my life is, I’ve never been tested. I’ve never been tested, thank God. So all I know is, in my life, I’m on record, you know, 35 times we dropped bombs; I flew 52 missions, but 35 times, I didn’t care. In thinking about that, being utterly amazed by it--it still, it’s a big lesson about the human condition. RS: It’s a lesson that a lot of veterans from that war--that’s why it’s been called the best generation, and so forth--I remember my own brother, my half-brother--my father was German, from Germany. And my brother was also bombing Germany--my brother [inaudible]--andNL: Eighth Air Force? RS: Yeah. And he was bombing our home town, my father’s home town. And I’ve been to Germany many times; I’ve talked to my father’s brother, who actually was in the German army and fought on the Russian front. And I know my brother was so impacted by that experience, and other things that we saw during the war, that he became a pacifist; he wouldn’t even let his kids play with war toys after. You know, he felt very strongly about that. But it was interesting, because Japanese people were rounded up and put in camps, and certainly not trusted to fight unless they were translators that could be used in the war against Japan. German Americans, which were the largest immigrant group--there was no problem about their being in the Air Force, fighting. And yet they learned a lot of lessons, all the people fighting. And that was where we got the Civil Rights Movement, had some energy after that; there had been a Civil Rights Movement before, but that was a segregated armed forces, as you point out with the Tuskegee Airmen. And that contradiction--of we were fighting for freedom and so forth, and then you come back--I don’t want to say what motivated you, but I think you were certainly part of a generation that said, wait a minute; we were supposed to be on the side of freedom; why do we still have segregation? Why do we still have these problems in this society? And you in your television writing--NL: Well, that’s this point I was making about not caring as those bombs dropped. That’s--we have to face our humanity, who we are as human beings; our capacity--I think we, each of us, have the capacity for expressing, if not doing, the evil any other human being is capable of doing.RS: [omission] We’re back with Norman Lear, discussing an incredible life in the television industry, and a political life. So if we segue coming back from the war, and then your television career where you start as a writer, and basically writing what, comedy? And--NL: You know, I didn’t set out to be a writer. I came to Los Angeles to be a press agent. The only role model, or the only person I considered a role model, was an uncle who used to flick me a quarter. Or maybe he did it once or twice, and I had made a thing of it. But I remember clearly, I wanted to be a guy who could flip a quarter; he was a press agent; I didn’t even know what a press agent was at that time. But I wanted to be a press agent. So [Laughs] when I was overseas, I went into Foggia and I stood behind--because I spoke a little bit of Italian--behind a printer, and letter by letter, we did this one-page composition about Norman Lear, this press agent in the making who’s going to be out of the service and finish his missions, and wanted to be a press agent. Anyway, I sent this--I still have a copy of it, it’s florid [Laughs]--and sent it to my Uncle Jack; he sent it out to a group of press agent companies. And I had one offer to come to work and one offer to come to a meeting to talk about work. So I had a job before I got out of the Army, and I was a press agent for a while, and I was fired twice. I was fired once, and then a guy kept me for a reason and he fired me again, because of the things that I caused to be printed. [Laughs] RS: And what was that? I mean, were you--NL: Well, nobody remembers these names, but among our clients at the Ross Agency in New York were Moss Hart, who was a great playwright, and Kitty Carlisle, who was an actress and a bit of a singer, but a major person and a star of a television show called Guess My Line, or--RS: Oh, What’s My Line?NL: What’s My Line, What’s My Line. You guessed what that person’s occupation was. So I wrote of the two of them--they might have known each other, I didn’t know whether they knew each other or not--but I wrote of them, that Moss Hart was gifted with a pocket flask--was gifted by Kitty Carlisle with a pocket flask measured to his hip while he napped. And Dorothy Kilgallen, a famous columnist at the time, printed it. Somebody must have said to Kilgallen after it was in print, “What the hell is that?” And she called George Ross and she said, “Who wrote that? I want that kid fired.” So, I was making $40 a week; he took me [Laughs], he took me down to $35, but he kept me. Weeks later, or months later, we had another show--we had a show on Broadway called, a revue, musical acts and comedy acts and so forth; not a story, but a revue. And one of the acts was Buster Shaver and His Midgets. And the lead midget was a woman named Olive. So I wrote, and Kilgallen again printed, that Buster Shaver was seen shopping Fifth Avenue, he on foot, she on a Saint Bernard. This time Kilgallen called, and this time I was really fired. So we moved to Connecticut, stayed there for a little while, and then came out to California. Oh, and I started to say--I came out to be a press agent, like my uncle. But I ran into Ed Simmons, and our wives were friends, and they went to a movie one night when we each were babysitting our little kid. And he wanted to be a comedy writer. He was working on an idea he had; he asked me to help him, and I did. We wrote this thing that evening, the girls came back from the movies like 10:30, and I said, let’s go out and see if we can sell it. ‘Cause there were a bunch of nightclubs then. Four, five, six blocks away, at Beverly near Fairfax, there was a place called the Bar of Music. And there was a piano player, I used to remember her name well, who did insults and jokes and so forth, playing the piano, and so forth. And we sold it to her for $35 or $30 or whatever the hell it was. And we started to write together every evening. RS: And that was it.NL: That was it.RS: And so you then had a show--I mean, tell--you know, people don’t remember the impact of your shows on CBS. It was incredible. And I use them in teaching, I show some of the old shows, and the issues you dealt with. NL: But those issues we dealt with were the issues American families were dealing with. We didn’t invent them--we didn’t--RS: But they weren’t talking about them. And you dared--I mean, I remember, because when I came to interview you in the seventies, and I was working for the LA Times, and I didn’t know you personally and I went to see you, and you already--not already, you were this enormous legend at that point. You owned television; my God, you were the golden guy. And yet you weren’t doing it by cheapening, you weren’t doing it by pandering, you weren’t doing it by selling out. You were doing it by raising the bar. It was astounding. You know? Astounding is the only way I could describe it. And I wasn’t the only one that felt that way. The reason they sent me to interview you, the LA Times sent me out, is--who is this guy? I mean, with no exaggeration, you are the major person--force--that changed television in America. It was banal, it was boring, it was--NL: It’s hard for me to see it that way--RS: I know, Norman, I, but I want to--for people listening to this, I want to make it really clear. Television was boring. Now television is exciting; people expect television to be exciting, they expect it to be well written, they expect it to be provocative. But back then--NL: And it is. I think this is the golden age. You know, it’s so hard to imagine and believe. We had three and then four networks; nobody wanted for content. America [Laughs] didn’t want for content with four networks. And today we have, what, 400 networks? I don’t know. More content than I can keep up with. And I’m talking about content that people tell me, Norman, you mean you haven’t seen--? And I look at it and it’s terrific, just as my good friends suggested it would be. But I haven’t got the time. I don’t think life affords the time to see it all.RS: Right. But back then, in the day, when you were doing this, television--yes, we all were excited there was this image that had come along in the fifties. But--and it was getting, you know, it was color, it was moving and everything, but it was stilted; it was very safe--that’s the operative word. And at these three networks, you had these guys programming practices, and they were censors. They had to approve everything, right? And they did very much underestimate the audience. Could you just take us through some of those controversies? I mean, you know, like gay rights--for God’s sake, I mean, you dared to--you know, you had Archie Bunker confronting his best friend in a bar who was a football player and he admires this guy and everything, and they’re watching a boxing match, and the guy turns out to be a homosexual. You know, right? NL: [Laughs] I’ll never forget that scene. They are hand-wrestling at the moment [Laughs] the football player tells him, “Archie, have you ever seen me with a woman? Have you ever heard me talk about a woman? We’ve known each other a lot of years.” “Bah!” Archie just shakes his head, he can’t believe. The guy says, “No, no, really.” And O’Connor’s face as he understands that his good friend, the football player, is gay--oh, my God. Golden. [Laughs]RS: Golden! Of course. What was the response at the network? Any questions, or--?NL: You know, it’s one of those things where they were frightened to death of it, and I shouldn’t do it, and--anyway, we did it. And in that case, I think we were heralded. Of course there was some mail, some people didn’t like it, but for the most part, I don’t remember a big contest about that. The same thing with Maude’s abortion. You know, Maude’s abortion took place in, let’s say, October, the show went on the air. Nobody knew what the subject was until they saw it on the air. There was very little reaction to it. I mean, there was some mail, of course, but there was a lot of “Right on, Maude, thank God we aired this.” When the show went into reruns in June, and everybody knew that this episode about Maude’s abortion was coming, that’s when the far-right and the religious right knew it was coming, and that’s when they organized. And they laid down in front of Mr., what’s his name who owned CBS, Paley’s car in New York; they laid down in front of my car, they carried on and carried on and carried on, and it was a ton of mail, and you know. But that’s only--it didn’t come naturally, it came from pocketed groups who were there to complain.RS: You know, let me suggest something, and this is certainly true of George McGovern, and I want to take it back to that World War II veteran experience. No one could tell you you were un-American. I mean, we’d had a House Un-American Activities Committee; we’d had a blacklist in Hollywood. But there was a whole group of people, particularly these veterans from World War II, who said “Don’t you tell me what being an American is.” OK? And you had that confidence, just like George McGovern did. You know, “Wait a minute, I was there. I fought for this country.” And I had Ron Kovic in my class the other night, you know; he has three quarters of his body paralyzed from his wounds in Vietnam. And you can’t, no one’s going to intimidate Ron Kovic and tell him you can’t speak out and object to the Iraq War, object to the bombings. He’ll say, “Hey, I gave three quarters of my body to this, and I’m in this wheelchair, so don’t tell me.” Well, you guys had that confidence, that generation that came back from World War II; you weren’t going to put up with a lot of garbage, you know? I think there were a lot of--you stood out, but there was a whole group of people--NL: But it’s people like you who point to it. I didn’t operate from that base or think about that. We did what we had to do.RS: But you had a certain courage that you were going to do it your way, and no one was--I mean, look. I remember the atmosphere when the so-called religious right, and the Falwells and everybody went after you. It could be very intimidating. And you know, you just took it. And you started this incredible organization, People for the American Way; you got even Gerald Ford and republicans like that to--NL: Oh, you just reminded me when you said Gerald Ford. Something I want to do now, I’d love to do it on my 95th Fourth of July. I did a show when People For the American Way was one year old. And in 1982, or in ‘81 and we started People For in ‘80, I did a show on ABC called I Love Liberty. And the only way I got it on the air, proving it to be, in advance, nonpartisan--because I wanted to do the most patriotic show, take back the flag. And I think the flag and the Bible today, in America, is considered right. The far right owns the flag and the Bible, because they talk about it all the time. I don’t think you have to have a lapel pin to be a good American or to, you know, for people to know you love your country. So I got Gerald Ford--that’s what reminded me of this--and Ladybird Johnson to co-chair the event. On the screen, co-chair the event. I had Barry Goldwater and Jane Fonda on the same stage. I had John Wayne--oh, my God. It was, I think if I was to be buried, again, and I won’t be [Laughs]. But--is it 95 that causes me to think of that? [Laughter] No, I’ve told this story too often, and I’ve said it the same way: if I was buried with a piece of tape, it would probably be I Love Liberty. I love that so much. And we need it now, to take back those--to talk about America without sounding like Donald Trump.RS: OK, that’s it for Part 1 of this two-part interview with Norman Lear. My engineers are Kat Yore and Mario Diaz. The producers are Joshua Scheer and Rebecca Mooney. And see you next week with Part 2 of an interview with the legendary Norman Lear. "
27,POLITICS,UAE Faces Growing Scrutiny For Role In Bloody U.S.-Backed Campaign In Yemen,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uae-yemen-growing-scrutiny_us_59ce9b1ae4b05f005d34396c,"The country has kept a low profile as Saudi Arabia, the leader of the coalition, faces loud accusations of war crimes. But it bears major responsibility for Yemen's unprecedented pain, a new report argues.",2017-09-30,The remains of a house targeted by a Saudi-UAE coalition airstrike.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ce9b892d0000e608307e4d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A U.S.-aligned government stands accused of subjecting hundreds of civilians in the Middle East’s poorest country to forced detention in feces-smeared conditions, torture that includes being tied to a spit and roasted by flames, and airstrikes that have killed thousands at schools, hospitals and markets ― all while hindering aid deliveries as over 5 million people near starvation and an unprecedented cholera epidemic infects scores more daily.Saudi Arabia has been publicly recognized as responsible for the crisis in Yemen because of its two-and-a-half year military campaign there against militants tied to its regional rival Iran. But its chief ally in that effort, the fellow U.S. partner the United Arab Emirates, has long avoided shame or accountability for its role in what U.S. officials describe as hundreds of likely violations of international humanitarian law and the creation of a security vacuum benefiting Al-Qaeda, the self-described Islamic State and other militant groups.Now, the tide may be turning.On Thursday, military expert William Hartung of the Center for International Policy released the first comprehensive report on the many ways in which the UAE helps drive Yemen’s suffering. The assessment is designed to fill a gap in the growing debate about the wisdom of U.S. policy choices in the country. “The UAE’s role in the Yemen war has not received the attention it deserves,” Hartung said. ”They’re so dogged about controlling their image as the good Gulf state.”Both the Obama and Trump administrations authorized two separate but intertwined U.S. missions in Yemen.One is a small, constantly changing presence of American aircraft, including drones, and special operations forces, which targets militants linked to international terror networks and often work with the UAE, like during a botched raid soon after President Trump’s inauguration.The other is a U.S. support mission for the UAE-Saudi coalition primarily fighting Iran-allied Houthi fighters, which provides aerial refueling for bomber planes, and intelligence, including to defend Saudi territory from cross-border attacks. In the Trump era, officials have authorized far more U.S. counter-terror strikes in Yemen and mooted expanding support to the UAE-Saudi coalition despite its alleged war crimes.Hartung’s report ties the UAE to many of the most controversial aspects of the coalition’s track record since it first entered Yemen in March 2015 on the invitation of the Saudi-backed, internationally recognized government. It highlights American culpability in equipping and permitting the UAE to act as it has.He notes, for instance, that the UAE is training and commanding at least five Yemeni brigades that no longer report to the country’s government, damaging the chances of long-term stability. It is also contributing U.S.-armed ships to a coalition blockade of Yemen that international watchdogs accuse of keeping aid from a desperate civilian population and preventing the delivery of U.S.-purchased cranes intended to help unload relief material at an essential Yemeni port. The report also notes how inextricably linked the UAE is to the vicious bombing campaign that’s made the coalition notorious. Since 2009, the country has spent more than $1 billion on buying the kinds of American-made bombs it is using in Yemen, Hartung writes, and its air force is the primary recipient of American aerial refueling.The report’s findings complicate the narrative of the war that’s become popular in Washington, even among the war’s critics: that the UAE is doing the right thing, in targeting Al-Qaeda and other militants, and that the missteps of the aerial campaign are the fault of Saudi Arabia. Human rights advocates like Kate Kizer of the Yemen Peace Project say the UAE deserves its share of the blame because it is known to be running flights over Yemen with American help and weaponry and the coalition has provided no way to know whether the bombs killing civilians are dropped by Saudi or Emirati planes.The U.S. tried to distance itself from the Saudi-UAE coalition under President Barack Obama, at one point placing a hold on some weapons shipments to Saudi Arabia. But it always maintained ties, and Hartung noted that U.S. arms sales to the UAE since the war began suggest a clear pattern of trying to help the U.S. partner in its controversial Yemen operations.“I would say there has been a sharp uptick in U.S. offers of weapons relevant to the Yemen war since it started,” Hartung wrote in an email to HuffPost, citing four major U.S.-UAE deals involving bombs or missiles since May 2015. “What we don’t know for sure ― the Pentagon and the UAE won’t say ― is how many of these have been delivered so far. But there is certainly an intent to bulk up the UAE’s ability to inflict harm, and the kinds of weapons offered are tailored to the kind of war they are fighting in Yemen.”His report comes as some members of Congress and the human rights community continue to reckon with major allegations of torture by UAE forces and UAE-backed militias, made in June in separate reports from the Associated Press and Human Rights Watch. The investigations raised two major questions: Were U.S. officials aware of or even involved in human rights abuses by their partners; and is the UAE faithfully abiding by international and U.S. law on the treatment of detainees? Writing before those reports came out, legal experts Ryan Goodman and Alex Moorehead suggested that evidence of UAE-directed detainee abuse would put the U.S. government and specific officials in legal jeopardy. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.), who oversee U.S. military operations as the chair and ranking member respectively of the Senate Armed Services Committee, wrote to Defense Secretary James Mattis after the reports came out and asked for an immediate review.The Pentagon sees no merit in the allegations and Mattis has responded to the senators, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Adrian Rankine-Galloway told HuffPost in a Thursday email.“Before any correspondence between [the Defense Department] and Congress on this matter, we initiated an initial inquiry of the operations and activities in the [Associated Press] report, in particular the suggestions that US personnel had tolerated or condoned detainee abuse. [The Defense Department] does not and will not tolerate the abuse of detainees,” he wrote. “We have received no credible allegations that would substantiate the allegations in the AP report.”He did not respond to a follow-up question about the separate Human Rights Watch report, which said the UAE runs at least two secret detention facilities, moves detainees out of Yemen and subjects its prisoners to heavy beatings and electric shocks. Even if the concern that Americans were present while rights abuses were taking place has been put to rest, U.S. officials remain worried about illegal torture and other abuses in various UAE operations around Yemen. Those fears are difficult to assuage because the U.S. lacks the diplomatic or military presence in the country to conduct the kinds of investigations into its partner that it could do in a context like Iraq or Afghanistan.And the fact that Mattis’s response on the matter remains classified months later means that the U.S. remains publicly linked to those accusations and suspicions. Last month, Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups asked the Pentagon, CIA and FBI to make public at least some part of any reviews they have conducted into the UAE abuse allegations. On Friday, a Human Rights Watch official told HuffPost the group had received no response.“It’s kind of outrageous that they haven’t announced anything,” Hartung said. He recommends the U.S. immediately cease arms sales, refueling and other military cooperation with the UAE pending investigations of its alleged abuses, and ideally until the Saudi-UAE coalition agrees to jump-start the stalled peace process with the pro-Iran Houthi rebels who control Yemen’s capital. U.N. Human Rights Council members, including Saudi Arabia, agreed on Friday to establish their own independent inquiry into abuses by all sides.“As it is now, the U.S. is complicit in what many independent groups think are war crimes,” Hartung added. “Not only those are unacceptable, but it’s counterproductive to any notion of fighting terrorism or reining in Iran.”"

Following are edited excerpts.Is there pressure to live up to the show’s reputation?Sure there is. But I think its iconic reputation came later. It was only when we went off the air that people looked back and thought, “my mom hated gay people but now she’s the biggest ‘Will & Grace’ fan and now I can have a conversation with her.” That’s when the import became tangible.Eleven years on, are there things the show can do now than it couldn’t do before?We used to have to traffic in double entendre because we were on a network. But now we have got the president of the United States and his spokespeople saying things they are not supposed to say on television. So the rules are broken. ... I know we are going to push the boundaries because there is no fun if you don‘t. We’ll see what America’s up for.Where is Will in his life in the revival?Will is still a lawyer, he’s doing very well, he’s redecorated the apartment. It’s very beautiful, very upscale.And he’s still living with Grace?He found love, but he broke up. Grace, same thing. She was married to Harry Connick Jr.’s character, but they have split up. I think that’s a great story to tell. If you go off and split up and then come back to your best friend, what is that? For Will, I think it’s because he is comfortable and confident.And Jack?Jack does NOT like aging, so we’ll get to see his dates with younger men ― the power gay.Are you concerned about possible backlash to the show?No, but we want that water cooler effect, although now it’s the Twitter effect.Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Jonathan Oatis"

Simpson could be freed as early as Sunday from prison in Nevada, where he has been held since 2008 for a botched robbery, but the time and place of his release remain secret, his plans largely unknown.Simpson, 70, won his freedom from a Nevada parole board in July after nine years behind bars, at a hearing that did not take into account his 1990s trial for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and a friend, Ron Goldman.The onetime football star turned actor and TV pitchman nicknamed “The Juice” during his playing career was found not guilty in 1995 following that sensational, 13-month trial in Los Angeles, which was televised live daily, transfixing much of the nation.A civil court jury subsequently found him liable for the deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5 million in damages to the victims’ families, a judgment that remains largely unpaid.The Nevada Department of Corrections, seeking to avoid the kind of media frenzy that often accompanies Simpson, has declined to say exactly when and where he would be released.A department spokeswoman warned media not to try to chase his vehicle from the prison gates, saying officials could postpone the release for weeks if necessary to avoid “risk to the community” from such a frenzy.Also unclear is the former star athlete’s ultimate destination. He told parole board members he hopes to move to Florida, where he has friends and family, a plan that must be approved by probation authorities there.During the parole hearing, Simpson joked that he was willing to stay in Nevada, but “I‘m sure you don’t want me here.”His Las Vegas–based attorney, Malcom LaVergne, reiterated the Florida plans during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” program on Friday, adding that his client was looking forward to spending time with family members, eating steak and seafood and buying an iPhone.LaVergne could not be reached for comment by Reuters.Florida corrections officials say they had not received a parole transfer request for Simpson and had not been contacted by their counterparts in Nevada.Simpson is a native of California, born in San Francisco, and played his final years as a pro football player for that city’s team, the 49ers. He lived in Los Angeles at the time of the murders.But California corrections officials say he has not filed papers to live in that state, either."

The Alberta couple were longtime Edmonton Oilers season ticket holders and apparently couldn’t come to a resolution on who would get the precious seats in the divorce. Donald was willing to pay his former wife $15,000 a month in spousal support, but he wasn’t going to give up on his team. So Beverly filed for joint custody of the tickets and won. “The parties shall alternate choices for game tickets with the defendant choosing first the game for which he wants tickets, the plaintiff choosing second for her game, and the parties alternating choices thereafter until all regular season tickets have been assigned,” Justice Ritu Khullar ruled, according to CTV News. Edmonton Oilers fans are some of the most passionate in the National Hockey League, and season tickets are hard to come by. Some of the more affordable options for tickets range from $2,000 to $5,000, but seats with a better view and added luxury go from $8,000 to $23,000. People on social media were deeply amused by the situation, which is honestly pretty relatable to any rabid sports fan. And, apparently, Canadians. "

Part of the space even briefly became part of an Aeropostale.On Wednesday, days before “TRL” would raise its curtain once again, hoping to capture a new celebrity-obsessed generation, the space had been reclaimed wholly by MTV, with the newly constructed studio space stretching uninterrupted from one end of the building to another, 8,700 square feet in total. (The original “TRL” was filmed in just one corner, about a third of the size of the new space.)The question asked by many since MTV announced the return of the tentpole music video countdown series is simple: How will “TRL,” which captured its first fan base in a pre-smartphone, pre-social media era, appeal to today’s young superfans? If nothing else, the studio at least seems primed for selfies. One enters the space through a light-up tunnel, coming out to face a huge video screen that, during the tour, was set to a retro-cool palette of television test pattern bars. Giant red leather couches spelling out — what else? — “TRL” sit in the center, not far from a DJ booth shaped to look like a pair of headphones. A stage backed by another massive screen isn’t far off. There are plans, we are told, for a video screen on the floor.An important aspect of the staging — particularly for young fans who’ve already grown up with the ability to access their favorite stars on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and the like — is that there’s no clear barrier between where fans sit and where talent is interviewed. There’s no separation, no permanent seating to distance audience members from the day’s guests, as in a traditional late-night show stage. From the moment you walk through that lit-up tunnel, you feel like a part of the action.The return of “TRL” feels monumental to a generation that’s aged well past MTV’s main demographic.“For Americans who happened to be tween to college age between 1998 and 2008,” Rebecca Kinskey writes in We Used to Wait: Music Videos and Creative Literacy, ”‘TRL’ was inescapable. It aired from 3 to 6 p.m., those crucial after-school hours when the extracurricular energies of middle schoolers and high school students were most likely to be both unsupervised and unstructured.”The original show began in Times Square with a then-unknown Carson Daly as host, urging viewers to call in or vote online with their music video requests. At first, there was no studio audience, no horde of fans waiting on the street. The format was strictly a countdown; Daly would introduce each video in ascending order of popularity. And as the show’s popularity grew, celebrities began to stop by. Former VJ Damien Fahey tells Billboard in the outlet’s extensive oral history of the show that when Eminem showed up to promote “8 Mile” in 2002, 10,000 fans showed up to see him.“Times Square had to be shut down,” he said.Daly left “TRL” in 2003, replaced by a rotating cast of names including LaLa Anthony and Quddus. Viewership eventually declined from a daily average of 853,000 in 1999 to 373,000 in 2007. By then, the show played only excerpts of fans’ favorite videos, and competed against a variety of other music-on-demand platforms — YouTube, Myspace, illegal downloaders. “TRL” was no longer the sole arbiter of taste.“The program’s relevance began to slip among teens and young adults who were taking it upon themselves to decide what was popular to them, and knew exactly how to get that music into their hands and onto their hard drives,” Kinskey writes in her book.The team behind the new “TRL” promises “surprises,” though the exact format of the show remains unclear. Showrunner Albert Lewitinn says the plan to attract a generation of digital natives involves embracing social media. Twitter and Facebook feeds for the show are already active, sharing a mix of announcements about who’s performing during premiere week and first-person thoughts in the casual style of a brand operating in 2017.″‘TRL’ was social media before there was social media,” Lewitinn told HuffPost. “You came home from school and you turned on the TV and said, ‘Oh my god, oh my god, I just saw Britney Spears do that! Oh my god, Justin Timberlake just did that!’ and you’d talk to people — ‘Did you just see that?’”His aim is that fans tune in to the live program to avoid “that FOMO moment.” There are plans for Facebook Live pre- and post-shows, a daily livestream on Live.ly and a twice-a-week pop quiz on Musical.ly. (Clearly, they didn’t listen to former DJ Dave Holmes, who, in an Esquire article, advised MTV keep things simple and not to “attempt to be the internet.”)How exactly the show will take requests into account remains a bit of a mystery, though Lewitinn had this to say: “I can tell you that the show is ‘Total Request Live.’ We live in a request society as it is now. You request your Uber, you request your Seamless — what else can you request? Almost everything in the world now. Here’s you requesting your pop culture.” A press release Friday reiterated, albeit vaguely, that the show will “incorporate audience requests.”How about music videos? Will the new “TRL” incorporate those? “What can I tell you ...” Lewitinn paused. “There will be opportunities to do so. How we do it depends on the artist, depends on the time, it depends on the day.”For its new iteration, MTV has tapped musician and comedian DC Young Fly to host, leading a “squad” of influencers like Complex alum Tamara Dhia, social media star Amy Pham, and Vine breakouts The Dolan Twins, among others. The guest list for the first week is stacked: The network first announced Ed Sheeran and Migos as premiere day performers, adding on names including Noah Cyrus, Travis Scott, Demi Lovato and Lil Uzi Vert for later in the week. It was announced Friday that DJ Khaled will attend Monday’s showing as “The Godfather” of the program. While the VJs on the first “TRL” gained a following thanks to their hosting gigs, the hosts of today are coming into “TRL” with their own massive fanbases — who, MTV must hope, will follow them to their new gig. Plus, the new show has the distinction of bringing big names in the music business to kickstart its first week, while the opposite was true for the first “TRL”: Sure, *NSYNC, The Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears et al. would’ve been successful without the music-request show, but their presence on “TRL” allowed their careers to reach new heights. One hurdle for the new “TRL” is that the nostalgic pull of its name doesn’t register with the younger viewers it now seeks, who were likely infants when the original went off the air. Still, the team is optimistic. The premise, Lewitinn and company expect, will attract a following the same way the initial one did: by capitalizing on young fans flipping through channels (if their parents aren’t cord-cutters, at least) who want to feel older and cooler by tracking every step of the celebrities du jour.In Lewitinn’s words, “TRL” is a “cultural shortcut.”“I know exactly what it stands for: Total Request Live,” he said. “It’s powered by me, powered by the requests.”Being powered by fans in 2017 also means being susceptible to criticism — ahead of the show’s premiere, outlets are discussing how “TRL” might handle promoting musicians who are accused of abusing women. (It appears the show, via Lewitinn, hasn’t taken a hard stance on the issue.) It’s a discussion that might’ve been brushed aside in a pre-social media era, but consumers of pop culture raised on the internet are decidedly more “woke,” with the vocabulary to call out injustices.MTV has been embracing hot-button issues, recently inviting trans members of the armed services and Heather Heyer’s mother to speak at the VMAs. When asked whether “TRL” would pay attention to social issues that matter to its audience, Dhia, a member of the hosting “squad,” replied with an emphatic yes.“The cool thing about this ‘TRL’ is it’s not just going to be about music, though it will be a big part of it,” Dhia told HuffPost. “It’s about pop culture, and to me, pop culture encapsulates what’s also going on in the world. We would be remiss not to be bringing that up, ’cause kids are smart, and they are way more vocal and they understand what’s happening very quickly now because of the internet and because of social media. I think it’s important for us and it’s our duty to be honest, to talk to them and vocalize where we stand and to just see where they stand as well.”What do we know about the new “TRL,” really? Not a ton, except that there will be big stars, there will be fans, there will be requests of some form — but most importantly, there will be those iconic windows overlooking Times Square, the sight of which is enough to send any former teenager’s heart aflutter. Whether the curtains will stay up is anyone’s guess.“TRL” premieres on MTV Monday, Oct. 2, at 3:30 p.m."

33,POLITICS,Democrats Urge Oversight Hearing On Trump's Response To Puerto Rico Disaster,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-trump-hurricane_us_59ceb3afe4b06791bb1099da,"“More than a week since Maria impacted Puerto Rico, there is still no power on the island, very few places have water.""",2017-09-29,"Hilda Colon wakes up after sleeping in a shelter set up at the Pedrin Zorrilla coliseum, after Hurricane Maria destroyed the region in San Juan, Puerto Rico.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ceb5261800009d0ac9da13.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― All Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee are asking the chairman to hold an oversight hearing on the Trump administration’s response to the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands after Hurricane Maria.“Our members are often looked to for answers regarding the federal government’s efforts to assist the people of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in securing the help they need in this time of crisis,” reads a Friday letter to chairman Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah). “Accordingly, it is appropriate that we exercise our authority in this regard, to hear from officials of the Trump administration, in a hearing, on the sufficiency of their efforts.”Here’s the full letter, signed by 15 Democrats:Their request comes at a time when Puerto Ricans are pleading for more help as the days roll by without access to clean drinking water, food, power or medicine. It’s been more than a week since the hurricane decimated the island last Wednesday, yet most of the 3.4 million Americans who live there still don’t have vital resources.The stories on the ground are harrowing. People are painting “S.O.S.” on rooftops. Thousands of shipping containers with aid are collecting dust at the San Juan port, amid shortages of drivers and diesel. Doctors are being forced to set up temporary triage tents outside of destroyed hospitals to treat patients. About 40 helicopters are delivering aid, but that’s compared to 300 helicopters the U.S. dispatched for Haiti’s 2010 disaster. On Vieques, a neighboring Puerto Rican island, its 9,300 residents have only gotten water delivered in the last week.FEMA and the Coast Guard have been providing some crucial aid, but there’s a growing sense that the Trump administration’s efforts are falling short ― and that the death toll could rise. At least 13 people have died so far.“I am going to do what I never thought I was going to do. I am begging, begging anyone that can hear us to save us from dying,” San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, visibly exasperated, said Friday. “We are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy.”Bishop spokesman Parish Braden said it’s possible the committee will hold an oversight hearing, but right now Bishop is focused on holding a “member forum” next week to discuss potential legislative actions that could reinforce rescue and recovery efforts.“In Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the situation remains particularly dire as flooding, downed infrastructure and power outages impede food and water from reaching large populations,” Bishop said in a statement. “This forum is a starting point as we evaluate policies and programs within our jurisdiction to support emergency response, help mitigate the loss of human life and hasten the path to recovery.”Braden got testy when asked if Bishop was open to holding the kind of oversight hearing Democrats requested in their letter, specifically on the administration’s response to the crisis.“I don’t care about the letter. I saw it a couple of days ago,” he said. ”We’re probably not going to hold an oversight hearing as requested right now.”Want to lend a hand to fellow American in need? Here are some easy ways you can kick in a few bucks to help people in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.This story was updated with Bishop’s comments."

Robert E. Lee that sparked protests in August sits covered in plastic in Charlottesville, Virginia.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ce75fd200000c4070844f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. ― Mayor Michael Signer is still coming to grips with the violent events that took place in this quaint city last month. It hasn’t been easy, but he knows it’s important as he looks ahead to the community’s future.In mid-August, the normally quiet Virginia city erupted with deadly violence when white supremacists and neo-Nazis showed up to protest plans to remove the statue of a Confederate general from Emancipation Park and were met by counterprotesters. The clashes, which took place the weekend of Aug. 12, resulted in the death of 32-year-old paralegal Heather Heyer, who was killed when a white supremacist protester drove into a crowd. In the wake, countless news outlets swarmed Charlottesville, thrusting Signer and the city, the home of the University of Virginia, onto the national stage. “It was a surreal experience because at the end of the day we are a fairly small, very local city,” Signer told HuffPost during a stop on its Listen to America tour of 25 cities across the U.S. “And you have this experience of 30 satellite trucks parked here for a couple of weeks, shining a spotlight on every aspect of our city. When the nature of this city, is that it’s a very sweet, local, peaceful, soothing place.” But it has its own set of problems like any city, of course, he added. Signer felt relieved when the media left town. “I think we were all glad when everybody moved on and let us get back to our business,” he said.The national media may have moved on, but the real work is just beginning in Charlottesville.Following the violence, people questioned the way Signer, as well as local officials and authorities, responded to the protests. Was the leadership sufficient? Did law enforcement do enough? Were authorities prepared? Signer said that in addition to healing, rebuilding and memorializing, the city is examining what went right and wrong that weekend.“I think it’s really important that we have an independent review. That’s just getting underway right now,” he said.The evaluation, which is expected to take three months, will examine how the city prepared for and responded to the rallies. Tim Heaphy, a former U.S. attorney for Virginia who’s leading the effort, plans to interview agency representatives, law enforcement and government officials, along with members of the community, including protesters and counterprotesters.“That should provide the authoritative report on everything that went well and everything that didn’t go well and the truth of what we need to know and the accountability for what happened — and any bad decisions that were made and then reforms going forward,” Signer said. “I think it’s essential that we know exactly what happened here and that we be able to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”For now, Signer says, the City Council and the community will continue their efforts. Hundreds of therapists have been offering their services for free. And the city is moving “full-steam” ahead on other projects to tell the story of race through public spaces and “get the truth right.”“We have allocated a million dollars toward overhauling the parks and telling the full story of how those statues got to be there and putting in new monuments,” Signer said. “That process is starting very shortly. … We gave almost $1 million to the African-American Heritage Center here and almost $100,000 to the Daughters of Zion Cemetery, which is an African-American cemetery, which had fallen into disrepair.”Meanwhile, new plans are underway for the Gen. Robert E. Lee and Gen. Thomas Jonathan “Stonewall” Jackson statues.“City Council is unanimous. … Both the Lee monument and the Jackson monument will be moved out of the downtown civic space of Charlottesville — somewhere more appropriate for them to be recognized historically. And with what they represent now there’s been a unanimous will that they don’t belong here,” Signer said.The city is also working on a way to memorialize what happened last month, he said.“You’re seeing an effort in memory and history. You’re also going to see some progress coming up soon about how do we memorialize Heather Heyer,” Signer said. “How do we act to deal with what happened here and fold it into our living history in a way that brings us forward.”Signer, who wrote Demagogue: The Fight to Save Democracy from Its Worst Enemies, is still grappling with the tragic events, which shed light on national issues. He says that back in 2009, when the book was released, he never would have imagined that the country “would see a demagogue rise to the presidency.”“Donald Trump followed the classic toolkit of someone who plays to our worst prejudices, who has a fairly shameless way of putting together a political coalition that’s based on the lowest common denominator on manipulating people’s emotions,” he said. “I think you especially saw that in the coalition that was brought into the mainstream ... through the presidential campaign.“There was this confluence of the alt-right and the political outreach to them. And I think that’s really a shame,” he said, noting that many people who were in Charlottesville for the August protests were wearing “Make America Great Again” hats.Despite the tragedy, Signer is hopeful the recent events in his city will spark change. “It’s really important that in 2017 that we not just be complacent about the white supremacy and the systemic racism that are underneath our history, that built our history,” said Signer, who co-founded the Coalition for Progress on Race at the University of Virginia in 2003. “It’s an essential part of getting our future right and the present right to know our past.” For Signer and the city, it’s going to be an uphill battle, but one the community is determined to fight. “We are not going to be dissuaded,” he said. “We are not going to be defined by hate.”"

Thomas Jonathan “Stonewall” Jackson statues.“City Council is unanimous. … Both the Lee monument and the Jackson monument will be moved out of the downtown civic space of Charlottesville — somewhere more appropriate for them to be recognized historically. And with what they represent now there’s been a unanimous will that they don’t belong here,” Signer said.The city is also working on a way to memorialize what happened last month, he said.“You’re seeing an effort in memory and history. You’re also going to see some progress coming up soon about how do we memorialize Heather Heyer,” Signer said. “How do we act to deal with what happened here and fold it into our living history in a way that brings us forward.”Signer, who wrote Demagogue: The Fight to Save Democracy from Its Worst Enemies, is still grappling with the tragic events, which shed light on national issues. He says that back in 2009, when the book was released, he never would have imagined that the country “would see a demagogue rise to the presidency.”“Donald Trump followed the classic toolkit of someone who plays to our worst prejudices, who has a fairly shameless way of putting together a political coalition that’s based on the lowest common denominator on manipulating people’s emotions,” he said. “I think you especially saw that in the coalition that was brought into the mainstream ... through the presidential campaign.“There was this confluence of the alt-right and the political outreach to them. And I think that’s really a shame,” he said, noting that many people who were in Charlottesville for the August protests were wearing “Make America Great Again” hats.Despite the tragedy, Signer is hopeful the recent events in his city will spark change. “It’s really important that in 2017 that we not just be complacent about the white supremacy and the systemic racism that are underneath our history, that built our history,” said Signer, who co-founded the Coalition for Progress on Race at the University of Virginia in 2003. “It’s an essential part of getting our future right and the present right to know our past.” For Signer and the city, it’s going to be an uphill battle, but one the community is determined to fight. “We are not going to be dissuaded,” he said. “We are not going to be defined by hate.”"

I can’t ignore that.”,2017-09-29,<p>Patricia Arquette accepts the “Best Supporting Actress” Oscar at the 2015 Academy Awards.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ce8b392000001900084542.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Patricia Arquette remembers a time when Hollywood icons spoke their mind. There was Jane Fonda, blacklisted for years over outcry against the Vietnam War, and Marlon Brando, who infamously sent activist Sacheen Littlefeather to decline his Oscar for The Godfather in protest of big screen stereotypes of Native Americans. “I think people are afraid to be political [now],” Arquette opined on Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. “But that’s a decision I made.”Arquette stepped into the realm of such legends at the 2015 Oscars, where she was honored for her role in multiple nominee Boyhood. After rattling off the expected list of platitudes, the “Best Supporting Actress” victory became her platform to address the gender-based pay gap in America. “To every woman that gave birth, to every taxpayer in this nation, [women] have fought for everybody else’s equal rights,” Arquette famously declared as she clutched her newly-won statuette. “It’s our time to have wage equality, once and for all, and equal rights for women in the United States of America.”The choice likely cost her future roles, the star admitted. However, she stated emphatically: “I don’t care.”“I’ve had a great career, and I’m very grateful for it, but I’m not going to not be a human being,” Arquette told Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast. “I’m not going to not notice what’s happening to my brothers and sisters all over the place. I can’t ignore that.”During her lifetime, Arquette says, the movie industry has changed dramatically. She has watched Tinseltown transition from stand-alone “movie companies” to “giant, worldwide conglomerations.” Now with celebrities answering to companies like Sony – which produces everything from home electronics to feature films – far fewer are willing to rock the boat politically. She fears the shift toward silence on politics is going to increase as time marches forward.“It’s only going to get worse – that artists are going to be less and less verbal because there will be ramifications,” she maintained. “Even if it’s unspoken, they will happen.”Stars once used their power to call attention to injustices in the world, Arquette recalls. Now the number “willing to be really vocal political activists” has dwindled enough to be counted “on your hand,” she said. Certainly, the award-laden actress ranks among those. “I definitely see myself at odds in certain situations because of that, but I’m ok with it,” she said, noting: “I’m also in a really privileged position to be able to even say that. I’ve been successful for a long time.” A quick glance at the Emmy Award-winning Medium star’s social media proves exactly how aware Arquette is of the state of today’s world. Her Twitter feed (@PattyArquette) is filled with politically-charged subjects as far-ranging as outrage over the President to information about people of color who have gone missing with limited media coverage. WATCH: Patricia Arquette’s Oscar Acceptance Speech“We’re in a really critical time,” she said. “And, for me, I don’t feel correct not speaking up and being political.”Of particular interest to Arquette, of course, are issues relating to the queer community. Younger sister Alexis Arquette came out first as gay, then transitioned in the public eye before tragically passing away in 2016 as the result of complications of AIDS.During an often raw 45-minute interview, the first in a powerful two-part series the podcast plans for the star, Arquette seamlessly moved from laughter one moment to tear-inducing recollections of her younger sister’s life the next. She recalled how Alexis was embraced by siblings Rosana (Desperately Seeking Susan), David (the Scream franchise) and Richmond (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) each step of the way. “I really think Alexis’ personal journey of finding herself exposed our whole family to the LGBTQ experience,” said the elder Arquette, who will discuss the AIDS-related passing of her sister in-depth on the broadcast set for release Oct. 4. Though she is certain she “would still have empathy” for the queer experience, her long-standing interest in and commitment to the community would have been different without Alexis, Arquette admits. “It’s different when it’s someone you love,” she said.“It’s one thing when you read about a ‘political agenda,’” Arquette admitted. “But when you’re hearing about someone being discriminated against by a nurse or a doctor or trying to get a cup of coffee?” During her sister’s life, Arquette says she either witnessed first-hand or heard of “thousands” of such experiences Alexis faced. It opened her eyes in ways which would have been otherwise impossible.“All of these whittling away, dehumanizing experiences you see your loved one go through really educate you to how it is to be LGBTQ in America -- or how it has been,” she stated. “I think it is changing…for the better, but every time you turn around, there’s some new governmental push to take away basic human civil rights for the LGBTQ community and silence them,” Arquette acknowledged. “It’s pretty terrifying.”To that end, Arquette feels an obligation to continue to use her celebrity to shine the spotlight on causes of significance. Whether in interviews or via social media, she takes every opportunity to raise awareness, share information and inspire like-minded individuals .“Unless things change radically, I think we’re at the tail end of real free social expression,” Arquette concluded. “I want to experience it and be part of it as long as possible.”LISTEN: Patricia Arquette Discusses Queer Rights, Politics, Evolving Hollywood, Transgender Sister Alexis on Party Foul Radio."

It really isn’t difficult to scrape off the veneer of gleaming “progressiveness” that Ireland is now putting forward, and find the ugliness beneath. Ireland is a country that locks up asylum seekers in direct provision centres and gives them less than 20 euro a week to live on. It is a country led by a man who demonises the poor and calls them “welfare cheats”. It is a country with an ever-growing homelessness crisis exacerbated by greedy landlords and vulture funds and where 1 in 5 political representatives is a landlord. It is a country where a woman has no right to decide when, how and if she has a child.But it’s also a country where there is a palpable atmosphere of anger among my generation and a strong desire for change. For Irish women, this change has been a long time coming. Ireland’s history of woman-hating politics and attitudes has haunted it for a very long time, and to this date it is one of the most glaring examples of inequality in our country. In fact a culture of misogyny is still reflected in Ireland’s deeply sexist laws. For example, Ireland is one of the only countries in the world where the woman’s place “in the home” is still enshrined within constitution.Shocked? You shouldn’t be. Ireland doesn’t exactly have the best record when it comes to treating women well…or even treating women with a basic level of human respect or dignity. Ireland’s disturbing culture of woman-shaming is still alive and well. One need only look at the 8th Amendment (or Article 40.3.3 of the Irish constitution), still in place today, which equates the life of a woman with that of a foetus.That’s right if you’re a living, breathing woman in Ireland, your life is equal to that of a small bundle of cells the size of this full-stop. Ireland has some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe.Again and again, the archaic abortion laws in Ireland have done more than just fail women. Women have died, been put through torture both mental and physical, or have been sent off to the UK to be “dealt with” there. Between January 1980 and December 2014, roughly 163,514 women and girls travelled from the Republic of Ireland to access safe abortion services in another country (IFPA, 2014). And those are “the lucky ones” who can afford to or who are able to travel. The current abortion laws in Ireland are purposefully unworkable, making it difficult for doctors to know when they can intervene to save a woman’s life, as was the case with Savita Halappanavar who died in 2012 from complications of a septic miscarriage after being denied a life-saving abortion. And Miss Y, a young migrant woman who went on hunger strike after hearing she would have to give birth to her rapist’s child.If you’re Irish, you’ve probably heard all about these prolific cases, but they always bear repeating, because it illustrates, in the starkest possible way, just how little the Irish government cares about women. We are brood mares and nothing more, forced to bear unwanted children, or even risk dying in the process of trying to bear much-wanted ones.Abortion is a fact of life, it always has been. I guess it could be because of the generation I was born into, but this was something that my friends and I always accepted. Growing up in the early 2000s, the 8th Amendment wasn’t something that people talked about; indeed abortion was something that was still spoken about in a relatively hushed tone. But my friends and I had made pacts with each other that if we ever became pregnant and needed an abortion that we’d help each other get to England.Before identifying as a feminist or activist, I already realised then that an anti-choice atmosphere only forces people to do things in secret and with the weight of stigma. When people say they’re not “pro-abortion”, they’re just shutting their eyes to the reality of the situation. Abortion is going to happen, whether you like it or not, and all the Irish government are doing is making it more dangerous, more difficult, more costly, more complicated and more stigmatised.But we’re sick of it, we truly are. The past five years has seen an explosion of pro-choice activism among young women (and men) in Ireland. The mood has significantly altered at home—we no longer have to talk in hushed voices about abortion, instead we walk through the streets of Dublin in our “Repeal the 8th” t-shirts and can talk about abortion in the pub.We have a national organisation campaigning for reproductive rights that actually has the word “abortion” in its title, something that would have been unthinkable a decade ago.The March for Choice, now coming up on its 6th year, has grown exponentially each year. With over well over 20,000 people at last year’s march and this year’s promising to be the biggest yet. There’s even a global network of pro-choice Irish emigrants who are also campaigning in solidarity with those back home, many of whom will be hosting solidarity demos with the March for Choice on the 30th of September in London, Berlin, New York and even Melbourne. And most importantly, a referendum on the 8th amendment is actually finally on the cards, and is planned to take place next year.Yet despite the renewed energy around pro-choice activism in Ireland right now, we can’t underestimate the massive struggle that lies ahead in the run up to the referendum. Obviously we’re no strangers to hostility, and there have already been plenty of attempts to silence and intimidate the pro-choice side. Furthermore, the anti-choice side are always on hand to sink to new lows. There’s something particular sinister about their tactics; the way they try to co-opt the language of actual activists fighting for social change and make themselves out to be the ones who are oppressed.I don’t think anyone is operating under the illusion that this referendum is going to be anything other than a bitter struggle. Luckily pro-choice activists in Ireland have been preparing themselves for this fight for over 20 years, and as the slogan for this year’s March for Choice states: it’s time to act.Previously published as ‘Marching for Choice’ in Lorna’s ROAR column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays:The Dirty Little Secrets of Parenting by Jami IngledueWhy Democrats Need to Go Big and Go Home by Maria BehanWhy Jesus Would Want Us To Speak Out Against Prejudice by Reverend Rachel KesslerThe Lessons My Family Have Learned From the Past by Annie Mark-Westfall"
38,HEALTHY LIVING,Needle Phobia Keeps Many Americans From Getting A Flu Shot,Anna Almendrala,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flu-shots-needle-phobia-tips_us_59ce90e3e4b09538b5082e8f,Readers weigh in with their tips on keeping the fear at bay.,2017-09-29,Flu vaccine rates have plateaued in recent years. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cec3ee180000f507c9da37.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s time to get your flu shot. Does that scare you?The vaccine can keep you from getting influenza, but on the off-chance that you end up with the flu anyway, it can lessen its severity. And the shots are free for anyone with health insurance, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and they’re available at doctors’ offices, clinics, pharmacies and even many schools and businesses. However, flu vaccination rates have plateaued. Last season, only 43.3 percent of adults got the vaccine and only 59 percent of children. Among health care workers, only 78.6 percent got shots, similar to the 2015 to 2016 season’s 79 percent rate.Public health officials at the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases’ annual flu news conference were at a loss to explain the stagnant rate.But Patsy Stinchfield, senior director of infection prevention and control at Children’s Minnesota, had an idea: Nobody likes shots.“People don’t like needles,” she said at Thursday’s conference. “And health care professionals actually have needle phobia just like the general population does.” It’s safe to guess that most people don’t enjoy getting jabbed. But for a small minority of the population, it can grow into trypanophobia, or fear of needles, when the aversion to injections is so severe it produces a physical response, even fainting. Researchers estimate it affects 3 percent to 10 percent of the population. Sometimes the phobia is so intense that it prevents a person from getting much-needed medical care. In an article for the British Journal of Anaesthesia, clinical psychologist Kate Jenkins writes of three patients she worked with to overcome needle phobia: a 24-year-old man whose fear was so extreme he refused to have chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a pregnant woman who refused blood tests and a woman who had avoided medical care for so long she ended up with a 9-pound breast tumor. Addressing needle fear is the driving force behind efforts to research other methods of delivering vaccines, including patches and sprays. But until a reliable alternative for flu vaccine hits the market, people are going to have to rely on psychological coping strategies to get through their doctor’s visit. Jenkins writes that breathing exercises, relaxation strategies and controlled exposure to the thing they fear most are good ways to help people with milder needle phobias. But those who usually faint may need a more intense course of therapy. Stinchfield’s advice? Breathe through the mouth, let your arm hang limp like a “spaghetti noodle” and then “imagine your favorite place in the whole wide world.” Because needle phobia is so common, and because there are so many ways to approach the problem, we asked HuffPost readers what helped them get over their fear of needles. Here are four tips from readers that mirror doctors’ suggestions to dull pain, practice mindfulness or engage in immersive therapy. 1. Numb your skin with iceAfter having to receive and give myself a shot every day for 34 weeks and twice a day for four weeks, I’ve learned that if you take a deep breath and count to three, I can handle it. Numbing the skin with an ice cube helps too. Can’t even feel it. ― Morgan A. Flannery2. Listen to your favorite music I have them lay me down, I don’t look, I relax because tensing makes it worse, and I usually have my favorite music in my headphones. I have had a lot of needles in the last two years (chemo, iron infusions, high risk pregnancy, etc.), and that combination has helped me a lot. Lastly I’m a hard stick and letting the staff know ahead of time is beneficial! Don’t let anyone dig around for a vein ― have them find a phlebotomist who is good at sticking!!! ― Julie Conant Wallace3. Eat a snack before and afterI’m a fainter. I’ve started eating something, at least a granola bar, before AND after shots. I have to make a conscious effort to breathe in and out and to not hold my breath during the injection. I’ve also started telling the people drawing my blood or giving me shots that I’m a bleeder and I faint. It makes them be extra careful with me even if it’s been over a year since my last fainting spell. 💁🏼 ― Taylor Stoner4. Face your fear head-onGot over my fear of them in College when my friends made me type my blood for biology class, donate blood at the Red Cross, get my ears pierced and get my vaccinations all updated (had not been done since I was in grade school). This was all accomplished in the space of 4 hours! I used to break out in hives and get hysterical if the doctor even mentioned using a needle on me. Now I could care less. ― Nancy FoulkeOf course, there’s also the question of why some children grow up to develop extreme aversions to needles in the first place. A few studies suggest there are some risk factors, and they include parents’ anxiety about needles, painful past experiences with injections and a high number of same-day injections from ages 4 to 6.It’s worth it to get over the phobia to get that flu shot each year, though. It’s especially important for people with chronic conditions including diabetes, lung disease and heart disease; those who are more susceptible to the illness; and people who are in frequent contact with others who are too young or medically compromised to be vaccinated.And despite the myths, the vaccine doesn’t cause the flu, but it can come with some mild side effects, including fever, nausea and soreness at the injection site. So really, it’s nothing to fear."

This included her brother Zach, who at 14 had been through this same rite of passage a year before. While Zach enjoyed the ceremony, the heat of the day sapped him. Again. He’d been extremely tired and dealing with flu-like symptoms all week. Had they been home, his mom Allison probably would’ve taken him to a doctor. But, here, there were plausible reasons for him being worn out, such as the jet lag from crossing 10 time zones and the cramming he’d done for final exams in the days before they left.When the bus carrying the family and the rest of their tour group pulled into a hotel in Eilat later that day, Zach dragged himself off, took a few steps into the air-conditioned lobby and collapsed face-first on top of his backpack.“You can go to sleep when you get in the room,” Allison said, nudging him. Then she noticed he wasn’t breathing.What happened next continues to resonate, both to those who were there that day and to everyone touched by its fallout – a group so extensive that it will soon include most high school students in California.As we celebrate World Heart Day today (Sept. 29), and trumpet this year’s theme of “Share the Power,” it’s my pleasure to tell the rest of this story, one that underscores what this global event is all about: inspiring and empowering people to save lives.***The voices of Allison and her husband Randy echoed throughout the hotel: “Emergency! Emergency! WE NEED HELP!” Jerry Feldman, a member of their tour group and a doctor, arrived first. He checked for Zach’s vital signs and found none. The boy was in cardiac arrest, so Dr. Feldman started giving CPR. Two security guards soon joined Dr. Feldman. They brought fresh arms to the compressions and brought along the hotel lobby’s AED – an automated external defibrillator, a device that can jolt a malfunctioning or stopped heart back into rhythm. It took two jolts from the AED for Zach’s heart to start again – slightly. An ambulance took him to a nearby medical center. About a half hour later, his heart stopped again. Yet another AED jolt brought him back.Randy called a cardiologist back home, a friend since childhood. The doctor consulted with the caregivers in Eilat. They then gave Zach a medication to stabilize his heart through an ambulance ride to a university hospital two hours away.***Fast forward several weeks. After rehabilitating in Israel, Zach and the Gingolds returned to Los Angeles.Tests indicated he suffered from myocarditis, a viral infection that infiltrated his heart and caused sudden cardiac arrest.While many people consider cardiac arrest and a heart attack as interchangeable terms, they aren’t. A heart attack is like a plumbing problem (a clogged pipe), while cardiac arrest is an electrical malfunction (a power outage). If the power isn’t restored within minutes, the patient dies. Giving chest compressions – what’s known as Hands-Only CPR – can keep blood flowing to the brain and other organs. Research shows CPR can double or triple a person’s chance of survival. However, less than half of the 350,000-plus Americans who experience a cardiac arrest outside a hospital each year receive bystander CPR before medical help arrives. Only about one in 10 survives. That’s why it is so vital to arm people with the knowledge and confidence to become a lifesaver.If CPR alone isn’t enough, AEDs can be the last resort.***That summer, administrators at Zach’s private school purchased several AEDs to have across the campus. They also trained teachers and administrators in CPR and AED use.Allison felt grateful, of course. Then she wondered about all the places where her kids competed in sports events all over Los Angeles. What safeguards existed there?Her first instinct was to have her school take an AED on the bus. Better yet, she thought those facilities should have their own AEDs. And people trained to use them, of course.Not just adults, either. Students, too.Realizing how fortunate they’d been, the Gingolds became committed to raising awareness and education for CPR and AED training. Through their advocacy, their children’s school initiated CPR and AED training as a high school requirement. They then sought to initiate the same change in schools across California.Allison met with city council members, then connected with State Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez, a longtime EMT who sought to make Hands-Only CPR training a requirement for high school graduation. It’s part of the CPR in Schools campaign that my organization, the American Heart Association, has been pushing nationwide for many years.About this time last year, all the hard work by Allison, Rodriguez and many compassionate members of their community resulted in a law requiring the training for schools that require health education. That will cover about 270,000 of the 377,000 California high school graduates annually when it goes into effect next school year.***It’s amazing how one person’s story can improve so many lives. No matter how often I see it happen, I find myself inspired. I hope you do, too. There’s a power to it all, a power to move our emotions, to change laws and to save lives. This World Heart Day, I hope you find a way to share that power.“From our experience, we learned the power of connectedness,” Allison said. “We understood the value of providing our children with the tools to potentially save another person’s life. From personal experience, we understood that without the immediate action by people around us, our lives would be dramatically different today. We were one of the fortunate ones.“It’s our responsibility to save everybody who can be saved through education and awareness,” she continued. “After all, everybody is somebody’s family. Someday, somewhere, someone is going to live another day because of our efforts. I feel blessed that we are able to do that.”"

Shulkin flew commercial for the July trip, a notable difference from other officials who have recently come under scrutiny for opting to use charter or military planes for their travel. However, the government did pay for his wife’s airfare as well as some of the cost of her meals while abroad. Read the full report here.When asked for comment on the Post story and the agency’s ethics review process, a Department of Veterans Affairs spokesman pointed to a Friday announcement that the agency will now make all of Shulkin’s travel itineraries publicly available and will note what kind of aircraft he used on each trip. The revelations about Shulkin, a holdover from President Barack Obama’s Cabinet, are just the latest in a series of reports regarding Trump administration officials’ conduct and financial choices while traveling on official business. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has received by far the most criticism for his use of private planes and military aircraft to travel both domestically and abroad. According to a series of reports in Politico, the secretary’s travel has come at an expense of more than $1 million to taxpayers.On Thursday, after President Donald Trump said he was “not happy” with Price, the secretary announced he would no longer take private planes and vowed to reimburse taxpayers for the expenses he’s incurred. However, he plans to pay just for “his seat” — or about $50,000.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has also faced criticism for chartering a plane to travel from Las Vegas to Montana, costing taxpayers more than $12,000. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are also under scrutiny for similar travel expenses. The White House has said it’s looking into these expenses, and on Wednesday the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee announced it had requested information from 24 federal agencies on officials’ travel.“Under 5 U.S.C. § 5733, official travel on the part of federal employees must be ‘by the most expeditious means of transportation practicable’ and ‘commensurate with the nature and purpose of the [employee’s] duties,’ and by no means should include personal use,” reads a letter from the committee’s leadership to the agencies.

Since then, tens of thousands of villagers have abandoned their homes beneath the menacing volcano.The national disaster management agency said many people have fled because they are unsure of their proximity to a 7-mile exclusion zone imposed around the crater.Evacuees are being housed in tents, school gyms, and government buildings in neighboring villages.While there are plentiful stocks of food, water, medicines, and other supplies, evacuees fear they are in for a long wait that could disrupt their livelihoods.One farmer said he was worried that lava flows could destroy his house and farm.“If my house is destroyed I don’t know how to restart my life.

We urge tourists to continue visiting,” the letter said.The transportation minister said on Wednesday that Bali-bound flights could be diverted to 10 airports across the country in case of an eruption.Ash clouds from volcanic eruptions have disrupted tourism in Bali and other parts of Indonesia in recent years.

No one should be surprised by this, for Republican tax strategies have always benefitted the rich. It’s never been any different in my lifetime. Evangelical Christian ministries, however and despite Biblical admonitions to plead the cause of the poor, have actually grown to favor tax plans that benefit the wealthy, and it’s not only because they support the GOP politically today.My parents were adamant supporters of Adlai Stevenson during the two presidential elections of the 1950s. Even though my father served in the Army Air Corps during the war, he disliked Dwight Eisenhower on many levels, but most importantly, because Ike represented the “silk stockings,” the rich people, the overseers, the haves, the people who lived in the mansions and treated the rest of us like dirt. My father was a factory worker and supported labor. Election nights of 1952 and 1956 were not warm and happy in the two-bedroom bungalow we called home. I grew up quite aware that the GOP represented the wealthy and as a result, their agenda never really could represent the working man or the have nots. No matter what, it always came back to bettering the lives of those who, to us, already had everything anybody could want. More for them always meant less for us. Nothing has really changed over the years and yet there has been a remarkable shifting of allegiance by working families to the Republican Party since the late 1970s.There are many reasons for this, but perhaps the most significant is the almost complete assimilation of Evangelical Christianity into the party of the silk stockings, a circumstance in which I played a role as Pat Robertson’s executive producer during the 1980s. Among other things, Conservative Democrats in the South became Republicans in one of the most intriguing cultural shifts in our history, and today, it threatens everything from our most basic cultural foundations to our place in the global universe of nations. What’s painted as freedom is actually all about money and the selfish gain thereof. “How can I get more, and how can I protect what’s already mine?” That’s the tie that binds the have nots with the haves, and this blending is often most visible on Sunday morning. How much more important to the managing of a church or a ministry, for example, is the man who gives $10,000 every year than the single mother who gives $10-a-week? You’re probably thinking, “Well, that’s understandable at a certain level, but there’s no difference between the two spiritually, and that’s what matters!” This is naive and dangerous, for money is a corrupting factor no matter how hard we try to insist that it isn’t. Theologians write of this over and over again, but it’s amazing how our mirror doesn’t seem to produce a truthful image. So far down this road have we gone that the health of almost every church is tied to its ability to create financial growth. In this we have become worldly vessels, for our trust isn’t so much in God as it is in our own ability to manage things.Years ago when I lived in the Dallas suburb of Frisco, I attended Chuck Swindoll’s Stonebriar Community Church, and I was very happy there. It was big, comfortable, and Chuck’s preaching is second-to-none. The music was also spectacular with a full orchestra and choir. One day, while passing through the parking lot en route to my car, I came across a vehicle I’d never seen before. It was a Maybach 57, and it was utterly sensational, a big sedan that just dripped with luxury. I went home and looked for one on the net, and discovered it was one of the most expensive cars on earth! You could get one used for $250 thousand, and the new ones were far beyond that. It caused me to sit back and think about what kind of person would be able to spend that kind of money on a car to take to church? I mean, I knew that Stonebriar had resources and catered to those who could afford to live in the North Dallas suburbs, but this? This was beyond words. It was a demonstration of wealth beyond anything I’d ever seen up close and personal.Of course, there is nothing wrong with rich people going to church. In fact, good for them. How the church responds, however, is another matter entirely.The bigger the ministry, the more likely it is to cater to the wealthy. When I was Pat Robertson’s executive producer in the 1980s, I was responsible for fundraising on The 700 Club and its telethons, which was actually much more sophisticated, strategic, and scientific than you might imagine. We created levels of giving, and encouraged contributors to move from one level to the next. What was draw? The constantly emphasized blessing that came with giving. The more you give, the more God is likely to bless you. This was even one of Pat’s “laws” of the Kingdom of God. “We can never out give God!” Like any hierarchy, there’s a built in ladder for those who feel it’s necessary or desirable to climb above one’s neighbor. We knew what percentage of 700 Club members would eventually commit to the 2500 Club and how long it would take to happen. This provided the means for us to make accurate “revenue” projections into the future. Here’s the way that hierarchical ladder looks today, according to CBN’s website.Not revealed here is the very top of the heap, what’s known as the CBN Chairman’s Circle, those who give $10,000 a year. The ministry describes it in, again, terms designed to be attractive to one’s self: “For today’s philanthropist who sees Christian ministry as an investment in eternity.” Right. Give your way into Heaven. Again, it’s not that there’s anything inherently evil about giving money to ministries, but that all changes when the ministries enter into a shift in emphasis in order to secure those types of contributions in the first place. It’s within this hegemony that the politics of the wealthy influence the politics of the church, because the more they have to give, the thinking goes, the more we will benefit from their largess. And so the church courts those with wealth, and a selfish thread gets woven into its message of salvation in the form of a prosperity message that seems to apply to every believer. However, the Biblical concept of prosperity is that no one among us would be poor, not that every one among us would be rich, and this is one of the most pressing differences between mainline Christian denominations and the evangelicals.While so-called experts - likely with ulterior motives - have identified Scriptural justifications for God wanting us all to prosper, even a cursory study of the financial system that God gave the Israelites through Moses (Deuteronomy 15) includes clever governors that couldn’t be gamed by those seeking exorbitant wealth. It’s not so much that the system was designed to prevent avarice as it was designed to keep people from entering into poverty, an idea that is close to God’s heart, as evidenced time and again throughout the Bible. “He pleaded the cause of the poor and the afflicted,” Jeremiah prophesied to the unrighteous King Shallum about his righteous father, King Josiah, “and then it was well with him. Is this not what it means to know me, saith the Lord?” What we are witnessing today is nothing short of a breathtaking evil being perpetrated on people of lesser means by mislead people in the name of Jesus. If this continues, it will lead to a break in the foundation of Evangelical Christianity itself, for we cannot continue to pretend forever that God is in favor of this. There will be a great shaking, and it may have already begun with the presidency of one of the most visible representatives of avarice in the world today, Donald J. Trump. He may well have been put in office by Providence, but I promise it’s not for the reason his Evangelical supporters think. Each of us needs to stand in front of the mirror and look into the eyes of our reflection. We need to stare deeply into our own souls and ask ourselves a simple question. Why did Christ die for me? Was it so that my living conditions in this life would be better than most? Or was it so that I could use what I’ve been given to help lift others up? We can’t help everybody, but we can - each of us - help somebody. If we truly wish to make a difference in the world today, this is the formula."

Security Council this week. Their testimonies, he said Thursday, “point to excessive violence and serious violations of human rights.” The Rohingya have extremely limited rights in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, and are classified as illegal immigrants rather than citizens. They have long suffered from state-sponsored discrimination and possible crimes against humanity.But their plight rapidly and drastically worsened after Aug. 25, when Rohingya militants attacked government security posts. The military responded with extreme retaliation, prompting refugees to flee to neighboring Bangladesh ― now “the world’s fastest developing refugee emergency,” according to Guterres.In the past month, human rights groups have reported rape, arson, killings and other forms of abuse against Rohingyas and their villages by state actors.Desperate to escape by any means necessary, Rohingyas have fled Myanmar by land and sea, sometimes walking for several days without food. On late Thursday, a boat carrying more than 60 Rohingyas capsized off the Bangladeshi coast. Twenty-three are confirmed dead, including several babies. The rest are missing, unaccounted for or feared to have drowned.This tragedy “is a grim reminder of the extraordinary risks that desperate Rohingya are taking in order to escape the violence engulfing their homeland,” said UNICEF Bangladesh representative Edouard Beigbeder. “Dozens of others are believed to have perished making similar journeys” since the crisis erupted in late August, he noted. But Myanmar’s national security adviser, U Thaung Tun, denied accusations of persecution against Rohingyas in an address to the Security Council on Thursday.“I can assure you that the leaders of Myanmar, who have been struggling so long for freedom and human rights, will never espouse policy of genocide or ethnic cleansing and that the government will do everything to prevent it,” he said. “We are concerned by reports that thousands of people have crossed into Bangladesh. We would like to fathom the real reasons for the exodus.”His claims echoed those of Myanmar’s U.N. ambassador, Hau Do Suan, who insisted on Monday: “There is no ethnic cleansing. There is no genocide” of Muslims in Myanmar. He rejected all accounts to the contrary as “unsubstantiated allegations.”Myanmar’s civil leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has so far said little to address the crisis, despite heated international pressure to do so. Suu Kyi, who skipped the U.N. General Assembly this month, has also dismissed mounting allegations of state-sponsored atrocities against Rohingyas as “misinformation.”Myanmar has blocked all U.N. aid agencies from delivering urgently needed humanitarian supplies to Rohingya communities."

That evening, I was part of an audience of some 2,000 students and faculty packed into a large sports arena to witness Malala Yousafzai receive the annual Wonk of the Year award presented by AU President Sylvia Burwell, an award given to President Bill Clinton and former first lady Laura Bush. President Burwell described how Malala has lit a candle of knowledge for women around the globe and embodies courage and bravery in her humanitarian work.The audience gave Malala a rapturous welcome, frequently erupting into prolonged applause. Speaking without notes, Malala established an easy-going relationship with the audience at the outset in the way she described the “firsts” in the award ― “first foreigner... first Pakistani... first Muslim...first Pashtun.” With impeccable timing she added, “I’m also the youngest one to receive it. And I’m also the shortest one to receive it.”Malala talked of her goals in promoting women’s education around the world, particularly in regions where women’s education has long seemed taboo. She described the work of the Malala Fund, which seeks to empower local leaders to push for equal education in their communities, support women facing long odds in pursuing their education, and lobby governments to put forth resources so that more women around the globe can go to school.She recounted the time from her childhood under the Taliban when women’s education was banned in Swat: “I realized that when my education is banned, I would not be able to follow my dreams—to become a doctor, to become a teacher, to be myself.”To thunderous applause she said, “The terrorists had actually made a big mistake. They had made a big mistake because, first, I used to think about getting attacked or being harmed. But I had gone through this already, and now I knew that nothing can stop me.”She urged men to, “Think about your daughters. Think about your sisters. Think about your mothers. And allow them space, give them opportunity.” Malala took special care to honor her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, asking for him to rise from the audience so he could be applauded for his vital work and support for Malala and women’s education in Swat and beyond. She remarked, “I got the opportunity to be here because of my father—because he allowed me to speak. There’s nothing special in my story, but only that no one stopped me. So, girls can do anything.”Malala spoke extensively about her views on Islam, which she considered a religion of peace, kindness, and forgiveness. She also discussed the importance of understanding how the Prophet of Islam, taking care to add “peace be upon him,” empowered the women around him and demonstrated how Islam really does strive for gender equality: “We need to ... unite and say that those people who are misusing the name of Islam, they are not us. We do not stand with them.”After every question, each posed by AU students, Malala would acknowledge the student by name, gracefully thank them, and respond with her trademark wisdom beyond her years and incorporate the stories of young women she has met around the world fighting for their education.At the end she shared the story of her younger brother who enjoyed “annoying” her. Now contemplating her move to Oxford University, he asks, “‘Who am I going to annoy, and who am I going to tease?’ And now he’s telling me that after two years, he’s going to apply to Oxford. And that is shocking. I just do not want that. I might send him to American University.” The audience roared with laughter.Malala transcends the divide between Islam and the West because she reminds both of their common humanity. Patrick Burnett, who accompanied me to the program, remarked that, “People adore her. She is the best ambassador any country or faith could ever ask for. She is simply amazing.” My friend, retired Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, the former chief of staff to United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, replied when I sent a picture of myself alongside Malala and Ziauddin, “I am jealous. She is a special lady.”Malala today is no longer just a celebrity; she is a movement inspiring millions from London to Lagos. No other Pakistani has that star power. Yet many Pakistanis launched a hate-filled rumor campaign against her even suggesting that her father stage-managed the attack so as to defame Islam and Pakistan and get fame and wealth in the West.Nevertheless the hearts of the family are in Pakistan and they speak of Swat often and with pride. When I told Ziauddin of my intention of writing this piece, he responded, “That will be so kind of you. There is a big gap between Malala and her countrymen. They don’t understand her simple message or even don’t try to do so. They can’t see her compassionate heart and sublime soul. She has an immense love for her people. She literally doesn’t want anything for herself. All she wants is for them and especially for the women and girls of her country. I hope love, respect and peace will prevail in our land.”"

She is a special lady.”Malala today is no longer just a celebrity; she is a movement inspiring millions from London to Lagos. No other Pakistani has that star power. Yet many Pakistanis launched a hate-filled rumor campaign against her even suggesting that her father stage-managed the attack so as to defame Islam and Pakistan and get fame and wealth in the West.Nevertheless the hearts of the family are in Pakistan and they speak of Swat often and with pride. When I told Ziauddin of my intention of writing this piece, he responded, “That will be so kind of you. There is a big gap between Malala and her countrymen. They don’t understand her simple message or even don’t try to do so. They can’t see her compassionate heart and sublime soul. She has an immense love for her people. She literally doesn’t want anything for herself. All she wants is for them and especially for the women and girls of her country. I hope love, respect and peace will prevail in our land.”"

I saw one student literally crying in the elevator. If you’re undocumented, it’s not just rhetoric — it’s about survival.”Trump has pledged to build a wall along the Mexican border, end protections for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children, ramp up deportations of undocumented residents and greatly restrict immigration generally. In schools with large immigrant populations, these issues have eclipsed the usual business of reading-writing-and-arithmetic and put student welfare — and civics lessons — at the forefront, teachers said.Schools around the state are responding to students’ fears by offering counseling, lessons on the Constitution and immigrants’ rights and encouraging students to talk about their fears.At Oakland International High School, where the entire student body is immigrants, teachers have led art projects and government lessons, and paid special attention to students who appear stressed, said co-principal Carmelita Reyes.“We try to be vigilant in monitoring the pulse of students,” she said. “When a kid is acting out, what’s the underlying issue? We ask, are you OK? Is your family OK? Can I look at your Facebook news feed? Sometimes they won’t tell you what’s going on, but their social media news feed is filled with all this terrifying stuff.”The school has therapists who speak Spanish, Arabic, Cantonese, Farsi, Tigrinya and other languages, and teachers encourage students to talk about their family situations. The 11th- graders created “Know Your Rights” posters for the school, translated into students’ native languages, and the seniors led deportation teach-ins with younger students.Even the neighbors got involved. After Trump’s election, they bought breakfast for the staff and all 360 students. They did it again after Trump announced his Muslim immigration ban, and then set up a scholarship fund for seniors. They also sent dozens of postcards telling students they’re welcome in California and the community cares about them. The postcards line the hallway bulletin boards.“Trump has brought out the ugliness in America, but also this incredible warmth, charity and empathy,” Reyes said. “It’s made people really see immigrants, in a way maybe they didn’t before.”One student, 18-year-old Petrona Mendoza, who moved here six years ago from Guatemala, said that whenever Trump unleashes a new threat against immigrants, she has trouble sleeping and concentrating in school.“I have family members who don’t have papers, and it scares me they might be deported,” she said. “My aunt has a new baby. What if she gets sent back, and the baby stays? It’s scary to think about the future — if (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) goes away, it’ll be hard to go to college and work. I want to go to college and be a doctor, but I don’t know how I’ll do it.”What made her feel better, she said, were civics lessons on immigrant rights. Until then, she didn’t know she had any. Seeing a counselor helps, too.Her classmate, Ablel Alem, 19, moved to Oakland three years ago from Eritrea, after living in a refugee camp for several years. His family fled Africa because of a lack of adequate food and clean water, he said. After waiting so long to come to the U.S., Alem said he’s angered by Trump’s threats to curtail immigration.“It makes me mad, but it doesn’t just affect me. It affects all immigrants to the U.S.,” he said. “Refugees come here with a lot of hope. It doesn’t make sense to me because everyone in America is an immigrant. Immigrants made this country.”In Los Angeles Unified, the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant policies have led to a state of near-hysteria among some families, said Jose Navarro, principal at Social Justice Humanitas Academy, which serves primarily low-income Latino students.“All it takes is for one person to say, ‘ICE is on campus’ and I’ll lose 20 percent of my students,” he said. “So not only are these kids facing the trauma of racism, violence and poverty, but now they have these mental health needs. All of this has had a very traumatic effect on children, and makes it very hard for them to focus on school.”Navarro, a former California teacher of the year, encourages teachers to incorporate the immigration crisis into their Common Core curricula. By studying government, current events and law, students can learn narrative and expository writing, critical thinking and research skills, among other things.Teachers also encourage students to discuss their fears in class.“We tell the students, ‘This is a problem, so let’s problem solve.’ The students are hungry to talk about it and learn more — that should be embraced,” he said. “What are executive orders? What happens if your parents are deported? Let’s make a plan. Let’s not be reactive.”Journal exercises are also helpful, not just to enhance writing skills but to help students settle their nerves and learn to express themselves, said Acuna at Cal State Northridge.“The potential of losing a parent is one of the most traumatic things a child can experience,” she said. “It’s OK to talk about it. Expressing those feelings is better for a student’s health and well-being. And for teachers, sometimes you don’t need to do anything. You just need to listen.”This story originally appeared on EdSource.org"

And it takes France and Germany to propel Europe forward. But after recent developments, the powers that the continent usually relies on for a reboot are not ready to move together at the same pace.After pro-European French President Emmanuel Macron won the French presidential race in May, German elections on Sunday were supposed to clear out the immediate political horizon in the European Union, with no other major vote expected before the 2019 elections to the European Parliament. This was supposed to give the E.U. time to strengthen and to cool down Europhobic movements that have won popular support in various countries like Austria or the Netherlands ― not to mention the United Kingdom preparing itself for Brexit.But the outcome of the German elections was not what Paris ― or Brussels ― had hoped for. Not just because the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, has suddenly become number three in German politics, but also because the possible future coalition led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel will bring the pro-European environmentalist Greens together with the more reluctant ― yet by no means Euroskeptic ― pro-business liberals of the Free Democratic Party.Yet even if the more comfortable left-right “grand coalition” between Merkel’s center-right Christian Democratic Union and the center-left Social Democratic Party had remained in power, France and Germany would not have suddenly become less at odds in their approach to governing the euro zone. Today, the two countries require the help of the European Commission and willing allies like Spain and Italy more than before to overcome their differences.The current political situation in Europe is wobbly. On the one hand, there is an impatient, clear-minded French president crafting ambitious proposals through visionary speeches, such as the ones delivered in Greece and the Sorbonne, one of France’s most prominent universities. On the other side of the Rhine, there is a weakened German chancellor, trapped in long domestic negotiations to come up with a fragile governing coalition.So is the Franco-German engine already crippled? Not necessarily. In fact, it actually may be more balanced than it used to be.Under former French presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, France lost much of its political influence in European affairs, letting the euro crisis be mostly handled from Berlin. With Macron, Merkel is dealing with a much more German-friendly French cabinet in a country starting to deeply reform its labor market and lower its public deficit. With the U.K. leaving the E.U. and Poland isolating itself, the chancellor has no greater partner today in Europe than France. Under these new circumstances, Germany cannot afford to ignore French ideas for further European integration. Its duty is to consider them seriously.At this moment, the hardest task ahead is the ability to strengthen the governance of the euro zone with the creation of a separate budget, parliament and dedicated minister. But there are other areas to which France and Germany can give a fresh impetus. The most obvious one is defense and security. The migration crisis has proved to the German public that wars outside Europe can become domestic issues. The terrorist attacks that have occurred in various European cities are also leading European countries to tackle security issues more seriously and in unison. Progress in European intelligence, pooling of budget resources to fund the purchase of defense mechanisms and better border security can be expected, as well as new steps in defining a common European asylum policy. The political momentum to allow these achievements to be realized is there. German Greens, known to be pacifists, cannot alone block these developments.Regarding the euro zone itself, measures have been set up to prevent any future financial crisis from becoming a damaging sovereign debt crisis by way of a banking union. Another step that could be taken is to harmonize the taxation of company profits, which would be the beginning of some fiscal convergence. In the coming months, ideas to be discussed include protecting strategic assets from foreign investments while letting the E.U. remain open to trade, as well as other areas of deeper feasible integration such as unifying the European digital market, protecting private data or promoting innovation for a greener European economy. None of this requires redrafting a new European treaty. Once all of this is achieved, perhaps the mood will be politically suitable to return to the broader discussion of how to govern the euro zone. But the biggest challenge for France and Germany by 2019 is not just to agree together on these issues and convince their partners to follow, but to reconcile their public opinion with the very idea of European integration as well. To do so, any referendum is considered political suicide. But there are other ways to include civil society in the decision-making. Macron has called for “democratic conventions” to be set up in all willing E.U. countries next year. The European Commission supports the idea. If it were taken up seriously, European unity could be widely debated so that Europhobic movements like the AfD are not the only voices being heard. European integration was not a hot-button issue during the German election campaign season. But with the far right entering the country’s Parliament for the first time since World War II, it may become one now."

She hugged everyone she saw, who appeared to be wearing a uniform. She was giving out love. She was thanking them for everything. After hugging them, they couldn’t help but smile. “She saw me taking pictures, with my vest and pants, and I got my hug as well. I was very depressed, brokenhearted, and she cured my soul. Seeing that girl was medicine for the soul,” photographer Eduardo Feldman, told HuffPost Mexico.Feldman is the creator of the series #HéroesSinNombre or #NamelessHeroes, a project that documents people as they sought to rebuild their lives after the Sept. 19 earthquake in Central Mexico.“I put on a no-sadness filter. I didn’t want to photograph tragedy, but heroism; people who were working on picking up the rubble, on saving lives,” the photographer recounts.Feldman is a self-taught photojournalist and the founder of Fotopaseos, or Phototours, an agency that organizes trips from a photographic perspective. He knows that his responsibility as a photographer forces him to document but, “when this happened, I knew full well that I wanted to help.” He help build a shelter from an empty storage container and, by that night, there were already 12 people sleeping there. Afterwards, he set out to take pictures of some of Mexico City’s districts.Feldman added that he felt the social and emotional impact of the quake more in the days after the immediate aftermath, as rescuers talked less about survivors and more about “bodies.”“Close to the disaster area, I started to hear conversations about bodies and not about people. I got to see some rescue workers ready to go in, they were talking about ‘people’ on Thursday, and by Saturday they were explaining that they thought ‘bodies’ were there. That made my skin crawl,” he recalls.Feldman was surprised by the fact that, just hours before the quake, we were all going on about our lives and “suddenly you see people climbing over rubble, saving lives.”“My pictures are the legacy I want to leave for my country, so that they remember that in 24, 48, 72 hours’ time, people put their lives aside and put themselves at risk to save others,” he notes.He says he was impressed by people helping one another. It was the people’s drive and strength that helped him set the theme for his pictures. And that’s precisely what he wants his pictures to display to the Mexican people: “to see that that’s who we are.”On a Facebook post he published for the #HéroesSinNombre project, the photographer explains that he would love for the people in the pictures to find themselves “and feel proud that their work hasn’t gone unnoticed.” He also hopes the recognition will help inspire more people to take to the streets and help.You can see Feldman’s work on the aftermath of the earthquake below. And you can see his work as a travel photographer on his Instagram.This story was first published by HuffPost México."

One of the most difficult matters he deals with is helping parents designate a guardian to care for their U.S.-born children in case the parents are detained or deported.“The fears of the community are that at any moment ― when they go to work ― they could be detained by ICE,” Minor said, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. “Can you imagine that you live every day of your life and you don’t know if you’re going to come back and see your kids? I became a father recently ― and I cannot imagine my life being away from my child.”Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies ― including cracking down on undocumented immigrants and rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ― have generated great worry in immigrant communities. He has repeatedly referred to undocumented immigrants as criminals, while ICE is making headlines with its blunt enforcement efforts. In early February in Austin, Texas, ICE stopped undocumented immigrants in traffic, attempted to arrest them in their homes and patrolled around a grocery store. Later that month, school kids in the area told HuffPost that their parents were afraid to go food shopping or drop them off at school.Casa San Jose started the legal clinic in November after Trump’s election.Minor is an immigrant himself. Arriving in the U.S. from Mexico eight years ago, he considers himself “lucky” to have come here “with documents.” He initially attended law school in Mexico, ultimately earned his law degree in the U.S. and today is a lawyer focused on oil and gas consulting, immigration and family law. He’s now a U.S. citizen and is married to a woman from Pennsylvania.Minor told HuffPost he wants to “destroy the image of the immigrant” as a criminal. Research has shown that immigrants — both documented and undocumented — are less likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens.“I can attest to the good faith of the immigrants who come here,” he said. “They don’t come to steal jobs. They just come for a better life.” Navigating the complexities of the U.S. immigration system can be a challenge, particularly if English is not your first language. Attorneys and law students from the University of Pittsburgh’s Immigration Law Clinic participate in Casa San Jose’s near-monthly event, helping usually more than a dozen people, the nonprofit’s executive director Julian Asenjo told HuffPost. The four-hour sessions are generally booked solid, he said.With undocumented parents, Minor raises this question: If they are deported and choose not to take their U.S.-born children back to their home country ― which the children may never have visited and whose language they may not speak ― who will take care of the kids? He helps the parents to prepare a document that names their choice for their kids’ guardian.But the documents are no guarantee. In Pennsylvania, Minor said, any final decision on guardianship is up to a judge, who must consider the best interest of the child. Even if the mother wants her sister to take care of her kid, for example, the judge could decide that the child is better off in foster care.Minor’s clients are not alone: While custody rules vary by state, undocumented parents across the country have been developing plans for guardianship since Trump became president. Minor doesn’t know of any instance yet in which a parent getting deported had to leave kids behind without another parent or legal guardian. But he and others are seeking to avoid that worst-case scenario.“The system of immigration is destroying these families,” Minor said. “They are people who came to this country fleeing situations of poverty, violence in their home countries.”Although President Barack Obama carried out a record number of deportations and was even dubbed the “deporter-in-chief,” Trump’s policies have generated more fear because of their sweeping nature, Minor said. Under Obama, there were clear priorities: People with criminal records or gang affiliation were at higher risk for deportation, while those with no criminal records or with U.S.-born children were lower on the list. Under Trump, however, most undocumented immigrants are at risk.“They come here, they work really hard to provide for their family, they pay taxes, they do everything right, they have not committed crimes,” Minor said. “Suddenly you have the risk that the father can be deported, or the mother, and the kids are probably going to end up in the foster care system. It’s a very difficult thing.”A video of a 13-year-old girl crying over her father, who was detained as he was driving her to school, garnered widespread attention earlier this year.Besides guardianship, Minor has counseled undocumented individuals on a range of issues, from a domestic worker who was being abused by her employers to a woman whose partner was beating her. In both cases, the victim was afraid to turn to authorities for fear of being deported. In an April survey, immigration attorneys and advocates reported that immigrants are increasingly reluctant to complain to authorities about domestic violence and sexual assault.“This is what’s happening right now, what the Trump administration’s rhetoric is creating: marginalization of immigrants, specifically Latinos, driving people underground for fear of deportation,” Minor said. “These policies create fear and empower individuals who use this rhetoric to oppress the immigrant populations here.”For people who want to support undocumented families, Minor suggests donating to or volunteering at a community center, like Casa San Jose.

54,IMPACT,This Lawyer Works Pro Bono To Help Undocumented Families,Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/casa-san-jose-lawyer-undocumented-immigrants_us_596fc5dfe4b0110cb3cb6e94,Many undocumented people have been living in fear under the Trump administration.,2017-09-29,Kids in the Casa San Jose community participate in an after-school program at Beechwood Elementary in 2015.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5978ae0e210000a31afc8c09.png?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"With immigrants living in a climate of fear under President Donald Trump, lawyers like Cristian Minor are stepping up to help undocumented families.Minor volunteers at a Pittsburgh legal clinic run by local nonprofit Casa San Jose, where he provides free counsel to Latino immigrants. One of the most difficult matters he deals with is helping parents designate a guardian to care for their U.S.-born children in case the parents are detained or deported.“The fears of the community are that at any moment ― when they go to work ― they could be detained by ICE,” Minor said, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. “Can you imagine that you live every day of your life and you don’t know if you’re going to come back and see your kids? I became a father recently ― and I cannot imagine my life being away from my child.”Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies ― including cracking down on undocumented immigrants and rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ― have generated great worry in immigrant communities. He has repeatedly referred to undocumented immigrants as criminals, while ICE is making headlines with its blunt enforcement efforts. In early February in Austin, Texas, ICE stopped undocumented immigrants in traffic, attempted to arrest them in their homes and patrolled around a grocery store. Later that month, school kids in the area told HuffPost that their parents were afraid to go food shopping or drop them off at school.Casa San Jose started the legal clinic in November after Trump’s election.Minor is an immigrant himself. Arriving in the U.S. from Mexico eight years ago, he considers himself “lucky” to have come here “with documents.” He initially attended law school in Mexico, ultimately earned his law degree in the U.S. and today is a lawyer focused on oil and gas consulting, immigration and family law. He’s now a U.S. citizen and is married to a woman from Pennsylvania.Minor told HuffPost he wants to “destroy the image of the immigrant” as a criminal. Research has shown that immigrants — both documented and undocumented — are less likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens.“I can attest to the good faith of the immigrants who come here,” he said. “They don’t come to steal jobs. They just come for a better life.” Navigating the complexities of the U.S. immigration system can be a challenge, particularly if English is not your first language. Attorneys and law students from the University of Pittsburgh’s Immigration Law Clinic participate in Casa San Jose’s near-monthly event, helping usually more than a dozen people, the nonprofit’s executive director Julian Asenjo told HuffPost. The four-hour sessions are generally booked solid, he said.With undocumented parents, Minor raises this question: If they are deported and choose not to take their U.S.-born children back to their home country ― which the children may never have visited and whose language they may not speak ― who will take care of the kids? He helps the parents to prepare a document that names their choice for their kids’ guardian.But the documents are no guarantee. In Pennsylvania, Minor said, any final decision on guardianship is up to a judge, who must consider the best interest of the child. Even if the mother wants her sister to take care of her kid, for example, the judge could decide that the child is better off in foster care.Minor’s clients are not alone: While custody rules vary by state, undocumented parents across the country have been developing plans for guardianship since Trump became president. Minor doesn’t know of any instance yet in which a parent getting deported had to leave kids behind without another parent or legal guardian. But he and others are seeking to avoid that worst-case scenario.“The system of immigration is destroying these families,” Minor said. “They are people who came to this country fleeing situations of poverty, violence in their home countries.”Although President Barack Obama carried out a record number of deportations and was even dubbed the “deporter-in-chief,” Trump’s policies have generated more fear because of their sweeping nature, Minor said. Under Obama, there were clear priorities: People with criminal records or gang affiliation were at higher risk for deportation, while those with no criminal records or with U.S.-born children were lower on the list. Under Trump, however, most undocumented immigrants are at risk.“They come here, they work really hard to provide for their family, they pay taxes, they do everything right, they have not committed crimes,” Minor said. “Suddenly you have the risk that the father can be deported, or the mother, and the kids are probably going to end up in the foster care system. It’s a very difficult thing.”A video of a 13-year-old girl crying over her father, who was detained as he was driving her to school, garnered widespread attention earlier this year.Besides guardianship, Minor has counseled undocumented individuals on a range of issues, from a domestic worker who was being abused by her employers to a woman whose partner was beating her. In both cases, the victim was afraid to turn to authorities for fear of being deported. In an April survey, immigration attorneys and advocates reported that immigrants are increasingly reluctant to complain to authorities about domestic violence and sexual assault.“This is what’s happening right now, what the Trump administration’s rhetoric is creating: marginalization of immigrants, specifically Latinos, driving people underground for fear of deportation,” Minor said. “These policies create fear and empower individuals who use this rhetoric to oppress the immigrant populations here.”For people who want to support undocumented families, Minor suggests donating to or volunteering at a community center, like Casa San Jose.

55,WOMEN,The Contradictory Feminist Legacy Of Playboy's Hugh Hefner,Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/playboy-hugh-hefner-feminist-contradiction_us_59cd07c4e4b0210dfdfc822d,"The ""revolution"" he sparked was primarily in service of men’s desires -- and specifically his own.",2017-09-29,"Hugh Hefner surrounded by 50 of his Playboy Bunnies on June 27, 1966, in London.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cd09092d00007c083079c6.jpeg?cache=fS8uBkzP8T&ops=crop_10_371_2566_2466%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Hugh Hefner’s life and legacy are rife with contradictions. The founder of the Playboy empire, who died Wednesday at age 91, is hailed as a sexual revolutionary, a supporter of LGBTQ and abortion rights, a mogul and an icon who paved the way for modern ideas about sex-positivity. He’s also a man who built his extensive empire by capitalizing on idealized images of women’s bodies; a man who had a rotating cast of live-in young “girlfriends” who, by at least one account, were kept under his control.As The New York Times’ Brooks Barnes put it in 2009: “To his supporters, [Hefner] is the great sexual liberator who helped free Americans from Puritanism and neurosis. To his detractors, including many feminists and social conservatives, he helped set in motion a revolution in sexual attitudes that have objectified and victimized countless women and promoted an immoral, whatever-feels-good approach to life.” The truth is somewhere in the middle. Hefner was surely an advocate for sexual liberation, but that sexual liberation was always first and foremost about the desires of straight men. Put another way: His sexual revolution was self-serving.* * *When it came to politics, Hefner consistently aligned himself with progressive ideals. He was known for his early support of reproductive rights, civil rights and LGBTQ rights. In Hef’s eyes, sex of any kind ― and the health care and decisions that surround sex ― shouldn’t be attached to shame. (And the government certainly shouldn’t be a moral arbiter of its citizens’ desires.)Playboy began publishing articles advocating for abortion rights in 1963 ― nearly a decade before the seminal Roe v. Wade decision, and railed in 2016 against right-wing presidential candidates who “campaign on promises to eliminate access to birth control, ban abortion, pass discriminatory laws against gays, and regulate or outright ban any lifestyle or preference that doesn’t fit into their Christian crusade to eliminate all sexual activity that doesn’t lead to procreation.” Hefner supported the Equal Rights Amendment, and the Playboy Foundation, founded in 1965, funded the Kinsey Institute and rape crisis centers. Hefner was a vocal advocate for marriage equality, and, in a 1955 editorial, asserted that “if it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society, then the reverse was wrong, too.”Civil rights icons including Malcolm X and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. were interviewed in Playboy. In 1959, Hefner organized the Playboy Jazz Festival in Chicago, and gross receipts from the festival’s first day went to the NAACP. The Rev. Jesse Jackson even tweeted out a remembrance of Hefner on Thursday morning, calling him a “strong supporter of the civil rights movement.”But even progressive political bona fides don’t give powerful men a get-out-of-being-a-member-of-the-patriarchy-free card. Over the course of Hefner’s 60-plus years in the public eye, he was a contradictory and controversial figure within feminist circles, and with good reason. Perhaps the most well-known exploration of Hefner’s Playboy Clubs, a membership-based chain of nightclubs, lounges and resorts, was written in 1963 by a young Gloria Steinem. Before she was a feminist icon, Steinem was a journalist who went undercover as “Marie,” a 24-year-old on the upper edge of the acceptable age range for employment as a Playboy Bunny, and got hired as a Bunny at the New York City Playboy Club. She wrote a two-part exposé on the experience, detailing the hiring process, the pay and the work. In his clubs, wrote Steinem, the black women who worked for Playboy were not just Bunnies, like their white counterparts, they were Chocolate Bunnies. His female employees were expected to look a specific way that would be pleasing to the club’s male clientele and would encourage them to buy more drinks. The Bunnies received “demerits” for things like messy hair, bad nails, bad makeup, eating on the job and chewing gum. And despite the high wages boasted about on Bunny job listings, the club took 50 percent of the first $30 in tips each Bunny made per day, and Bunnies were on the hook for the cost of maintaining a Playboy-acceptable appearance.At the end of the second installment of Steinem’s exposé, she lists off things that she has overheard over the course of her day at the club.“He’s a real gentleman. He treats you the same whether you’ve slept with him or not,” one Bunny remarks about a client. An element of performance was inherent to the type of female sexuality that Playboy created and pushed. If the Bunnies at Hefner’s famous clubs, or his live-in girlfriends, appeared to be enjoying themselves, what else mattered? They all lived lives that looked glittery.More disturbing claims were levied against Hefner by his former girlfriend Holly Madison in her 2015 book, Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny. Madison paints Hefner as a controlling man who bordered on verbally abusive at times. Madison wrote about her initiation as a Hefner girlfriend in which she quickly learned that living in the Playboy Mansion came with chore-like sexual duties. She said she became isolated, going through bouts of deep depression over her years with Hefner. (She claims that Hefner wouldn’t allow her to seek therapy.)“During the end, I definitely recognized that he was verbally abusive, and that was what made me snap,” Madison told BuzzFeed in 2015. “There were so many things in the relationship I wasn’t fully comfortable with, but I was able to justify them in my mind because there were other advantages to being there.”In response to Madison’s book, Hefner said that she had “chosen to rewrite history” to try to “stay in the spotlight.”And just last year, Hefner was sued by model Chloe Goins, who claimed that Hefner had conspired to allow Bill Cosby to drug and assault her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008. (Hefner denied the claims.)To some of the women who worked with or for Hefner over the years, he was a godsend ― or at the very least a useful advocate. His magazine gave “Redefining Realness” author Janet Mock her first editorial internship. He groomed his daughter Christie Hefner to succeed him as CEO, which she did for 20 years. “Hef changed my life. He made me the person I am today,” former girlfriend Kendra Wilkinson told People.But for others, like Madison, he was something darker. * * *From the very first issue of Playboy ― the one with a radiant Marilyn Monroe on the cover, smiling next to the tagline “Entertainment for Men” ― it was clear that women’s needs were not core to the brand. “If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion,” Hefner wrote.To Hefner, sexual liberation meant the acceptance and visibility of male desire, coupled with the ability of women to publicly fulfill those desires and appear as outwardly sexual beings. But an opening of sexual mores on straight men’s terms does not mean an automatic upgrade for all women. As any woman who has had sex with a man knows, what works for his orgasm and general sexual fulfillment is not always what works for yours. And in a patriarchal society, an openly sexual man gets to play by different rules on an entirely different field than an openly sexual woman. This explains why he reacted so poorly to radical feminist critiques of Playboy’s nude centerfolds, typically featuring big breasts and seductive poses.“What I’m interested in is the highly irrational, emotional, kookie trend that feminism has taken in the last couple of years,” he wrote in an internal 1970 memo. “These chicks are our natural enemy and there is ... nothing we can say in the pages of Playboy that will convince them that we are not. It is time to do battle with them and I think we can do it.” Ultimately, Hefner never set out to create a true sexual revolution. He set out to create a sexual revolution that would benefit him. He used his own desires and frustrations as a lens through which to build out entertainment for other men like him, and to push the envelope of what was considered socially acceptable. Some of those desires and frustrations happened to help open up space for people who weren’t straight, white, rich men to more openly express their sexuality. Others did not.In 2009, Hefner reflected on his legacy in The New York Times: “We just literally live in a very different world and I played a part in making it that way.” It’s hard to argue with that.

In a span of almost three years, the family has given a new meaning to “spending quality time together” by sailing across a massive ocean, swimming with whales, hiking active volcanoes and more.After dealing with 90-minute commutes to work and paying nannies to help raise their girls, Phil and Aimee decided to make a change. They now live with their daughters on a 1978 45-foot Dufour ketch sailboat called SV Terrapin (SV stands for sailing vessel, and a terrapin is a species of turtle).“We felt that we were missing out on watching our children grow up,” Aimee told HuffPost. “After mulling around various ideas, we decided sailing would give us the greatest opportunity to see most of the world on our limited budget.”In 2014, Aimee and Phil sold their house in San Diego, California, and everything in it. They then moved aboard their boat and remained in San Diego for seven months, practicing for their voyage ahead. Aimee had no experience with boats growing up and Phil only had experience with smaller sailboats. (Aimee suggests anyone considering their lifestyle to take American Sailing Association classes, and the couple also learned many skills from trial and error before any of their long excursions.)At the beginning of 2015, the family headed south. For two years, Aimee, Phil, Jessica and Emma explored the Pacific coast of Mexico. This past spring, they sailed across the Pacific ― a 24-day trip ― and made their way to French Polynesia, continuing west to the Cook Islands and American Samoa. While traveling, they take breaks to swim, snorkel, explore the different countries and territories, meet fellow sailing groups and more. The family is currently in Tonga. “How long our visas permit us to stay and the weather windows between destinations dictate how long we can stay and enjoy a particular country,” Aimee said. “We definitely enjoy being at anchor in beautiful places more than we enjoy long ocean passages. We have been in Tonga now for about three weeks.”Their next stop? Fiji. The family plans on staying there for six to seven months to wait out cyclone season. While traveling the world, Emma and Jessica have their own cabins, “an important feature for a teen and preteen,” Aimee said. Emma especially loves snorkeling, kayaking and swimming on a daily basis, while Jessica enjoys exploring the geography of the places to which she and her family sails and learning about the various ecosystems and cultures.Aimee and Phil, a high school teacher and scientist, have made their daughters’ education a priority within their unconventional living conditions. “It was very easy for us to find free textbooks, workbooks and other online materials in a PDF format that we could transfer onto a dedicated homeschool hard drive,” Aimee said. “From the hard drive we load each item as needed onto our daughters’ Kindles.”Aimee noted that their lifestyle has allowed the girls to sometimes learn more than they would in a classroom.“While touring pyramids near Mexico City our daughters acted as our tour guides and were responsible for explaining the significance of what we were exploring based on curriculum we had taught,” she said. “Science projects often come to life with our onboard microscope and access to rich ecosystems.” The family documents their travels on a blog called Sailing with Terrapin, on which they chronicle everything from what they spend to what they do after anchoring at different locations. To fund their travels, Aimee and Phil saved money for a year and a half and used the money they received from selling their house. About a year ago, they returned to the United States and worked for six months.One misconception many people have about the idea of sailing for extended periods of time, according to Aimee, is that several years of experience are required. In the two years the family sailed near Mexico before crossing across the Pacific, Aimee and Phil faced significant learning opportunities by simply being on the boat and on the water. She said she has met more families out sailing than she ever expected. For Aimee, though there are obstacles, the best part of her family’s sailing adventure is that they are all together. “We have swum with whales, hiked to the top of active volcanoes, sailed across an ocean and experienced many different cultures,” she said. “Since our first day, our girls have written in their daily journals with the anticipation that twenty years from now we’ll read from them and reminisce about our amazing experiences.”"

In a span of almost three years, the family has given a new meaning to “spending quality time together” by sailing across a massive ocean, swimming with whales, hiking active volcanoes and more.After dealing with 90-minute commutes to work and paying nannies to help raise their girls, Phil and Aimee decided to make a change. They now live with their daughters on a 1978 45-foot Dufour ketch sailboat called SV Terrapin (SV stands for sailing vessel, and a terrapin is a species of turtle).“We felt that we were missing out on watching our children grow up,” Aimee told HuffPost. “After mulling around various ideas, we decided sailing would give us the greatest opportunity to see most of the world on our limited budget.”In 2014, Aimee and Phil sold their house in San Diego, California, and everything in it. They then moved aboard their boat and remained in San Diego for seven months, practicing for their voyage ahead. Aimee had no experience with boats growing up and Phil only had experience with smaller sailboats. (Aimee suggests anyone considering their lifestyle to take American Sailing Association classes, and the couple also learned many skills from trial and error before any of their long excursions.)At the beginning of 2015, the family headed south. For two years, Aimee, Phil, Jessica and Emma explored the Pacific coast of Mexico. This past spring, they sailed across the Pacific ― a 24-day trip ― and made their way to French Polynesia, continuing west to the Cook Islands and American Samoa. While traveling, they take breaks to swim, snorkel, explore the different countries and territories, meet fellow sailing groups and more. The family is currently in Tonga. “How long our visas permit us to stay and the weather windows between destinations dictate how long we can stay and enjoy a particular country,” Aimee said. “We definitely enjoy being at anchor in beautiful places more than we enjoy long ocean passages. We have been in Tonga now for about three weeks.”Their next stop? Fiji. The family plans on staying there for six to seven months to wait out cyclone season. While traveling the world, Emma and Jessica have their own cabins, “an important feature for a teen and preteen,” Aimee said. Emma especially loves snorkeling, kayaking and swimming on a daily basis, while Jessica enjoys exploring the geography of the places to which she and her family sails and learning about the various ecosystems and cultures.Aimee and Phil, a high school teacher and scientist, have made their daughters’ education a priority within their unconventional living conditions. “It was very easy for us to find free textbooks, workbooks and other online materials in a PDF format that we could transfer onto a dedicated homeschool hard drive,” Aimee said. “From the hard drive we load each item as needed onto our daughters’ Kindles.”Aimee noted that their lifestyle has allowed the girls to sometimes learn more than they would in a classroom.“While touring pyramids near Mexico City our daughters acted as our tour guides and were responsible for explaining the significance of what we were exploring based on curriculum we had taught,” she said. “Science projects often come to life with our onboard microscope and access to rich ecosystems.” The family documents their travels on a blog called Sailing with Terrapin, on which they chronicle everything from what they spend to what they do after anchoring at different locations. To fund their travels, Aimee and Phil saved money for a year and a half and used the money they received from selling their house. About a year ago, they returned to the United States and worked for six months.One misconception many people have about the idea of sailing for extended periods of time, according to Aimee, is that several years of experience are required.

Ten-year-old Jaden Watts was wearing Colin Kaepernick’s number.The heartwarming moment, which took place in Dulles earlier this week, captured the current spirit of the NFL. In recent months, many players across the league have followed Kaepernick’s lead and peacefully protested against police brutality, racial injustice and in defiance of President Donald Trump. In comments posted to Facebook, Saundra Watts said her grandson Jaden walked into a GameStop while she was next door at a makeup store. He then ran back to her saying that some guys wanted to buy him an Xbox One.“So I go next door and as I am walking over there I am thinking what pervert wants to buy my grandson an Xbox,” Saundra wrote on Facebook. “I am thinking he is going to be in for a rude awakening when I bust through these doors. (I am an advocate for abused and neglected kids).”But the two men were Washington Redskins players Keith Marshall and Rob Kelley. Jaden said they complimented his jersey, noticed he was asking about an Xbox for his birthday and offered to buy it for him.“Me nor my granson [sic] had a clue who they were,” Saundra wrote. “They now have 2 fans for life.”Jaden told the Washington Post he was a Cowboys fan but liked the 49ers and Kaepernick because of his decision to kneel during the national anthem last season. The former 49ners player remains unsigned this year.“I liked how he wasn’t afraid to show what he thought,” Jaden said. “I don’t know if people agree with it, but he just doesn’t care what people say and that’s inspired me and probably inspired other people.”A man who observed the encounter posted about it on Facebook and the story soon went viral. The Washington Redskins also tweeted about the moment as did GameStop.Since describing players who kneel during the national anthem as “sons of bitches” last weekend, Trump has continued to double down on his criticisms. He’s even called for team owners to fire protesting players.Trump’s reaction has prompted players in many sports to speak in support of the peaceful protests and against racial injustice and police brutality."
63,POLITICS,How The GOP Tax Plan Could Radically Reshape U.S. Housing Policy,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-tax-reform-housing-policy_us_59ce7bf9e4b05f005d3421d0,Donald Trump's tax agenda undercuts a major subsidy for homeowners.,2017-09-29,House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) and other Republicans unveiled their tax reform plan this week. It could have a big effect on the mortgage interest deduction.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ce7e4f180000f507c9d923.jpeg?cache=BBMGJcVgji&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The tax reform blueprint Republicans unveiled this week would upend U.S. housing policy if it becomes law. Even though the plan maintains a special tax break for homeowners called the mortgage interest deduction, other provisions of the framework would basically make it useless for all but the richest homeowners. “This proposal will take away any tax benefit for owning homes for the vast majority of people who own homes,” said Gregg Polsky, a tax expert at the University of Georgia. Mortgage interest and property tax deductions cost the U.S. Treasury more than $100 billion a year in lost tax revenue, expenditures that are bigger in dollar terms than any other housing program. The federal government spends about $50 billion annually on housing assistance for people with low incomes, an amount that still leaves millions of people on waitlists for rental assistance. The mortgage interest deduction, meanwhile, overwhelmingly benefits homeowners with incomes above $100,000.The National Association of Realtors, a powerful real estate lobbying group, commissioned a study earlier this year finding the proposal would increase taxes on middle- and upper-class homeowners and reduce incentives for homeownership, thereby shrinking home values by about 10 percent. “Plummeting home values are a poor housewarming gift for recent homebuyers and a tremendous blow to older Americans who depend on their home to provide a nest egg for retirement,” NAR President William Brown said in a press release this week. Lower housing prices can be bad for homeowners but good for renters, roughly a third of whom deal with unaffordable rents, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. Most American households are owner-occupied, though ownership rates have declined from a high of 69 percent in 2004 to 63 percent today.The Republican tax reform outline actually maintains the mortgage interest deduction, but other parts of the plan seriously undermine it.“They really leave it in name only,” Polsky said. Current policy allows tax filers to choose whether they would like to reduce their taxable income by deducting the value of various expenses ― which is known as “itemizing” ― or would rather take a so-called standard deduction. For a married couple the standard deduction takes away $12,600 of their taxable income. The vast majority of filers go with the standard deduction because their expenses that would be itemized don’t exceed $12,600. The Republican plan would raise the family standard deduction to $24,000 while eliminating most itemized deductions, including ones for local taxes. Homeowners could still itemize their mortgage interest payments and charitable donations, but only about 5 percent would have itemized deductions that exceed the value of the $24,000 standard deduction, according to NAR.The doubled standard deduction would not necessarily be a better deal for all middle-class families, however. The Republican plan also calls for eliminating the “personal exemption,” which allows taxpayers to deduct $4,050 per family member from their taxable income. Some families with multiple children would benefit less from the higher standard deduction than they currently do from being able to claim multiple personal exemptions. In other words, the Republican tax plan could hike taxes on some middle-class families, a possibility one presidential adviser has acknowledged. And some Republicans in Congress are already chafing at repealing the deduction for state and local taxes. It’s unlikely that the tax framework released this week can get through Congress without a lot of changes. Liberal policy groups have advocated converting the mortgage interest deduction into a credit that more narrowly targets homeowners with lower incomes. Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said the Republican plan would only make the mortgage interest deduction “even more regressive than it is today.” "

Patrons can sit at the bar and watch the mill’s gas flare light up the night sky.Growing up in another mill town on the Monongahela, Sousa watched the region’s economy collapse and his father struggle to make do in his own small Italian restaurant. After generations of steady employment (except for strikes and recessions), the local high school kids of the 1980s saw few prospects for a middle-class job.Sousa studied art and then tattooing. Then he fell into addiction: mostly alcohol, but also drugs.“It was pretty bad,” he told me one night recently, taking a break from the kitchen at Superior Motors. “I was in pretty deep.”So, as many Pittsburghers did ― those who didn’t just leave for good ― he hunkered down and reinvented himself by returning to his roots. “I grew up in my dad’s kitchen,” he said.Sousa quit drinking, got serious about cooking and looked for edgy, all-but-abandoned storefronts in Pittsburgh. He opened a series of restaurants with simple but innovative cuisine, fresh local ingredients and an ambience of homage to the city’s gritty past. He started in city neighborhoods that he helped to gentrify out of his price range.And now he’s in Braddock. “And I’m eight years sober,” he added proudly.Just as important, he’s now a leader in an urban movement that sees food as one part of a much larger social and economic revival. His landlord has given the community access to another Braddock building for use as an experimental theater. Sousa himself runs a program for youths to learn culinary and hospitality trades while they work at the restaurant. And he’s partnered with other locals who have created a large urban farm nearby.“Braddock actually has great soil and growing conditions,” he said. “If you clean up the old sites and acreage properly ― and we have ― you can grow almost anything here.” All of the vegetables at his restaurant come from the urban farm.“I’m an optimist,” Sousa said. “This is all about the people here. I know it sounds real corny, but they have true grit. And we’re just beginning.”Besides true grit and 40 years of steady effort to come back, the Pittsburgh region ― the city and surrounding counties that together constitute the nation’s 26th largest metro area ― has benefited from a host of special circumstances. They include geography that kept the focus on a downtown that did not collapse and on neighborhoods that did not lose their communal identity; two top-flight educational institutions, the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon; a tradition of family philanthropy that includes names such as Mellon, Heinz, Frick and Carnegie; a world-class bank, PNC, heavily committed to the city; the world-class University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; abundant energy sources, including frack-able natural gas; an infrastructure of parks, libraries and other cultural institutions left over from the city’s wealthy heyday; and, of course, pro sports teams such as the Steelers, Penguins and Pirates, who style themselves as emblems of the city.“Pittsburgh may not be exactly a blue-collar town now,” said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin, a Virginia native who settled his family in a city neighborhood. “But the blue-collar mentality survives,” he told me during training camp late this summer.The challenge now is to translate that mentality into what Mayor Bill Peduto called “a fourth industrial revolution,” focused primarily on human capital ― through education, housing and jobs that lift people out of poverty ― and the environment. “The fourth revolution is about people fulfilling their potential and about giving those who’ve been left behind a full chance to be part of the future,” Peduto said.That means focusing on the low-income neighborhoods that are too often ignored (in Pittsburgh they tend to be on hard-to-reach hilltops) and on other neighborhoods that are gentrifying long-term residents out of their homes.Another focus: the dozens of small and often bereft mill towns that dot the rivers and valleys far from the shiny downtown core. “We need better public transportation and roads to reach them and to allow them to have access to our improving quality of life,” said Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald.“There’s no higher priority in any of these places than job training,” said Sy Holzer, a top PNC Bank official who has long concentrated on city revival. “The jobs are here, but we need to train our people to fill them.”The Pittsburgh area’s changing demographics offer perhaps the biggest challenge. The region had remained a bastion of the white working class much longer than other Rust Belt places, but the pressures of population growth and persistent poverty are now reshaping the area. The city’s black community ― which has a long and distinguished history, from baseball’s Homestead Grays to The Pittsburgh Courier to playwright August Wilson ― is pushing to be fully and finally heard in the region’s politics. The small Asian and Latino communities are expanding quickly.These changes exploded into view nationally over the issue of what the Steelers did ― or did not do ― in response to calls for protest during the playing of the national anthem at NFL games last weekend. The Steelers chose to wait in the locker room, although one player, U.S. Army veteran Alejandro Villanueva, could be seen standing for the anthem at the end of the tunnel. A white volunteer fire chief, angry over the Steelers’ choice, used a racial epithet to describe Tomlin, who is black. Shortly afterward, the chief was pressured into resigning.Not surprisingly in a sports-mad town that calls itself “The City of Champions,” the NFL protests have dominated local talk radio, sports radio and every other form of conversation. Inadvertently adding to the controversy, the Pittsburgh Penguins announced that they would accept an invitation from President Donald Trump to toast their Stanley Cup win at the White House. The metro area’s top two leaders, Peduto and Fitzgerald, said they would not go.Peduto said he plans to hold forums for residents who want to discuss the controversy and the issues it has raised.In the meantime, the Steelers have a big game this weekend in Baltimore, and Kevin Sousa is preparing for the Sunday crowd."

Now, granted, nothing can truly prepare you. And clearly I didn’t listen when people tried to warn me.But it seems to me that it would not have come as such a shock if we would just talk about everything more openly, especially the dark stuff, the stuff that makes a mom feel like a failure and a loser and a crazy person.Well, you know what? I’m sick and tired of moms feeling like half-insane failures. Here’s a very partial list of parenting realities that resonate with me and many other parents that you probably won’t find in the baby books.- You will lose whole parts of yourself. Things that you used to love, that excited you, now just seem like one more thing you have to do. Somebody said to me, “You’ll come back to yourself in a few years.” Here’s hoping.- You will have dark, dark thoughts. Like throwing your baby out the window at 4 am after they have been crying for hours. Like getting in the car and just driving away and not coming back. There is a reason they make you watch the baby-shaking videos before you leave the hospital. Nobody thinks they could ever do that. After your first colic all-nighter, you get it. Everybody has those dark thoughts, it does not make you crazy or evil. (But do keep an eye out for postpartum depression or postpartum psychosis if those thoughts continue and are intrusive.)- This can’t be said enough: breastfeeding is really, really hard. For some women it really does come naturally and easily, and often after the initial bumps it does become very easy. But it DOES hurt, and yet we hear over and over again, “It shouldn’t hurt if you’re doing it right.” This is complete and utter bullshit, and almost every mom I’ve talked with agrees. For nearly everyone it will hurt at some point. It is usually temporary. And I’m definitely in favor of breastfeeding. But we SHOULD NOT prioritize breastfeeding over bonding with our baby! If we dread feeding them, if we dread them waking up, if we become completely sleep-deprived and depressed, this is damaging to the bond. And the bond is what everything else is built on. And most importantly, YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE AS A MOM if breastfeeding doesn’t work for you.- You will feel like you never accomplish anything, not even the dishes. You will feel like a loser. You might be jealous of the moms who have a profession after their name. You will feel like a failure so many days.- You will hate your husband sometimes. Especially when he sleeps soundly while you're up in the night for the fourteenth time and then he says ""I'm tired"" the next day. When he can just walk out the door in the morning and go to work and not deal with poop or vomit for an entire day. There is no better way to ruin a perfectly good relationship than to have kids.- Sex with your husband can feel like yet one more person needing something from you. Plus, you can't take anyone else touching you for One. More. Second.- You will not likely “fall in love” with your baby right away. It takes time. It’s ok if you feel like an alien has taken over your life for a while. And it’s also ok if you don’t particularly enjoy some stages of childhood. Some stages for some kids are so hard, both for the kids and parents, that only a raving lunatic would enjoy them.- You will feel more lonely than you have ever felt, when you are actually never alone. Even when peeing. Five minutes alone in the shower is glorious, and a trip to the grocery store alone is like visiting a 5-star hotel, especially if it has a Starbucks. But you will feel completely isolated for days at a time.- Your kids will watch more TV than you ever thought possible.- Sleep is a total shitshow. If some parents have great sleepers, it's probably because THEIR KIDS WERE BORN THAT WAY. They will take credit for it nonetheless. Just do whatever works for your family to make it less of a shitshow. Your kids are probably wired to sleep the way they are and there’s not a damn thing you can do about it anyway.- I think every parent I know has co-slept at some point. Those who say they never do just might be lying. Do what you need to do, and remember, sleep deprivation is a real actual TORTURE TECHNIQUE. And co-sleeping is the number one shared parenting technique across cultures and socio-economic levels.- There is so much you can’t really “fix.” You’ve just got to ride it out. This too shall pass.- Having kids will not necessarily make you “happy.” A sense of purpose in life like never before? Absolutely. The deepest connection you will ever experience? Definitely. But that does not equate happiness. In fact, all of my feelings seem to be more raw after having kids, and I regret making fun of my grandma and mom for crying at everything, because now I’m right there with them.- Similarly, parenting is not necessarily “fulfilling.” I thought it would make me full of love and joy and contentedness, and sometimes it does. But often it feels draining. I give and I give and I give until I feel sucked dry, and then I have to go elsewhere to refill my own cup. It is essential that we do that refilling.But the biggest revelation is, if we did a better job connecting with other moms in a real and authentic way, these dirty little secrets would not be so secret, or even dirty anymore. And maybe then there would be less moms feeling shame and guilt for never being good enough. But first we have to make ourselves vulnerable enough to tell the truth. So, you tell me your (not so dirty) little secrets and I’ll tell you mine, and our burdens might be just a little lighter.Previously published as ‘The Dirty Little Secrets of Parenthood’ in Jami’s BEHIND DOMESTIC LINES column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comCome join our “Behind Domestic Lines” Facebook group, a safe community for parents to share their experiences and support each other.SUPPORT JAMI’S WRITING BY BECOMING A PATRONFor more great Wild Word essays:Why Democrats Need to Go Big and Go Home by Maria BehanWhy Jesus Would Want Us To Speak Out Against Prejudice by Reverend Rachel KesslerThe Lessons My Family Have Learned From the Past by Annie Mark-WestfallHow My Mother Saved Summer by Irena Ioannou"

The institution, which oversees the San Juan branch, is helping to deliver cash across Puerto Rico in armored cars and helping to make sure banks get up and running. Yet the primary issue is the inability for banks and ATMs to function without power.Photos show long lines outside the few ATMs that haven’t stopped working. At least half of the island’s bank branches are still closed, Zoime Alvarez, vice president at the Association of Banks of Puerto Rico, told CNN Money. “We cannot transport cash to the ATM that’s off premise if we don’t have enough security to do it.”“Of course I took out money before the hurricane, but it’s gone already,” Cruzita Mojica, a treasury employee, told The Associated Press. “We’re without gasoline. Without money. Without food. This is a disaster.” She said she’s unable to return to work because she has to care for her ailing mother. President Donald Trump is set to visit the U.S. territory on Tuesday.“Puerto Rico needs a lot of money,” he said in a news conference earlier this week.Puerto Rican officials have repeatedly detailed the “apocalyptic” and “near-death” conditions afflicting the territory. More than 90 percent of cellphone sites are off the grid. About 97 percent of residents were still without power and half didn’t yet have water as of Wednesday, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said. “The energy grid has been destroyed. And we need to rebuild it. That does not get rebuilt in days,” he added.Federal aid has been streaming in regularly, but it’s still proving grossly insufficient. More than 8,000 federal staff are on the ground and have already provided more than 4.4 million meals and 6.5 million liters of water, among other things. There are food and water distribution points set up across the island.Part of the problem is the Jones Act, which imposes high tariffs on goods being shipped to the island. Trump waived it late Wednesday on request from Rosselló, which should hopefully streamline the aid delivery process.Yet another component is the extent of the damage to the island’s infrastructure. Without a way to deliver aid across the territory, Puerto Ricans have no choice but to wait.“You know, the gas and fuel issue is not a matter of how much do we have — it’s a matter of how we can distribute it,” Rosselló said Tuesday. “We need bus drivers, we need gas station operators and some of them have devastation and are still locked down.”"
67,POLITICS,Here's All The Expensive Nonsense Trump's EPA Chief Is Wasting Your Taxes On,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-pruitt-spending-epa_us_59cc2a95e4b05063fe0ef9b3,That swamp is looking mighty cushy.,2017-09-28,"EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt spent $36,068.50 to fly on a military jet to and from Cincinnati in June.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cc578d2d0000dd0230787d.jpeg?cache=C0zqJprsXS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt — a climate change denier who is pushing for sweeping budget cuts at the agency — apparently has no qualms about loosely spending some of that budget on himself. In his first seven months on the job, the former Oklahoma attorney general has racked up a questionable tab that includes non-commercial airfare, an unprecedented security detail and a soundproof booth for making confidential phone calls.CBS News reported Wednesday that Pruitt and other EPA staff took a private flight July 27 from Tulsa to Guymon, Oklahoma, where Pruitt spoke to farmers about his plans to nix the Obama administration’s Waters of the United States rule. The flight, booked by the Interior Department as part of an inter-agency program, later took the group to Oklahoma City. The total cost: $14,285.71. In all, Pruitt’s non-commercial airfare has cost taxpayers more than $58,000, according to reports by CBS and The Washington Post. That includes a $36,068.50 flight aboard a military jet to and from Cincinnati, where he joined President Donald Trump for a speech on infrastructure, and a $5,719.58 chartered flight from Denver to Durango, Colorado, to visit the Gold King Mine, where two years earlier the EPA caused a wastewater spill that polluted waterways in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. During the visit to Colorado, Pruitt blasted the Obama administration for failing to protect local communities and the environment.EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman told HuffPost that Pruitt has taken one charter flight and three government flights; however, she did not respond to questions about what those flights’ costs were and why they were required. She did, however, tell The Washington Post that Pruitt usually flies commercial and that the private flights stemmed from unusual circumstances, including flight delays.News of Pruitt’s costly travel comes as other members of Trump’s Cabinet — namely Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price — are facing similar backlash over the use of private or military aircraft for government business. The EPA also came under fire this week after it was reported that the agency is spending nearly $25,000 on a soundproof “privacy booth” in Pruitt’s office. While Bowman told The Washington Post that the booth “is something which a number, if not all, cabinet offices have,” a salesman for the company installing the room told The New York Times it was unusual and ended up costing nearly four times that of comparable booths.Liz Purchia, the former head of communications at EPA, told CNN the expenditure is “the height of paranoia.”Pruitt has also made headlines for maintaining a round-the-clock security detail that cost more than $830,000 for his first three months on the job, nearly double that of his predecessors, as E&E News reported in July.Last month, the EPA’s office of inspector general launched an investigation into Pruitt’s travel after it was revealed that he spent 43 out of 92 days in March, April and May in or traveling to or from Oklahoma. On Wednesday, in light of Pruitt’s use of private aircraft, Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee requested the office of inspector general expand its investigation. “Administrator Pruitt’s reported use of private aircraft is just the latest example of repeated and blatant abuse of taxpayer funds by the Trump Administration,” Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.) and the others wrote in a letter to EPA Inspector General Arthur Elkins. “American taxpayers deserve assurances that their tax dollars are not wasted by the government’s highest officials.”Pruitt has also traveled to states including Pennsylvania, Missouri and Indiana, where — on the taxpayer’s dime — he has blasted the Obama administration for its so-called war on coal and accused it of mishandling the EPA’s Superfund program. The seemingly frivolous spending by Pruitt comes as he and Trump are looking to ax the agency’s funding to just $5.65 billion ― a 31.4 percent reduction — and eliminated up to one-fifth of the agency’s staff.Pruitt, who has deep ties to the fossil fuel industry, said in February that those who want to see the EPA eliminated completely are “justified” in their beliefs. He has defended Trump’s proposal for a reduced agency, saying it “supports EPA’s highest priorities.” “I believe we can fulfill the mission of our agency with a trimmed budget, with proper leadership and management,” he told members of a House Appropriations subcommittee in June, The Washington Post reported.

71,POLITICS,Trump: 'A Lot Of Shippers' Don't Want Me To Waive The Jones Act To Help Puerto Rico,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-puerto-rico-jones-act-maria_us_59cc281ee4b05063fe0ef7ec,It appears he's considering an industry's profits over aid to 3.5 million Americans facing a humanitarian crisis.,2017-09-28,"People fill containers with water in an area hit by Hurricane Maria in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, on Tuesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cc2bb01800008e02c9d376.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: Sept. 28 ― The White House announced Thursday that Trump waived the Jones Act for Puerto Rico for 10 days, effectively immediately.PREVIOUSLY:WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he’s considering waiving the Jones Act for Puerto Rico ― an arguably outdated law that imposes exorbitant shipping costs on the island ― but tempered his support for it because he’s getting pushback from the shipping industry.“We’re thinking about that,” he said at a White House press event. “But we have a lot of shippers and … a lot of people who work in the shipping industry that don’t want the Jones Act lifted. And we have a lot of ships out there right now.”The 1920 law requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by American-owned and operated ships, which are more expensive vessels than others in the global marketplace. That means Puerto Rico has to pay double the costs for goods from the U.S. mainland compared with neighboring islands ― and that U.S. vessels are making bank. The law costs Puerto Rico hundreds of millions of dollars every year, and now, in the midst of a humanitarian crisis, the costs to import food, fuel and other supplies will spike amid the island’s economic devastation.Trump’s comments are a galling admission that he’s weighing an industry’s profits against the needs of 3.5 million Americans facing “apocalyptic” conditions in Puerto Rico. Most people there haven’t had water, power or cell service since Hurricane Maria decimated the island last week. Roads are washed away or covered in debris. Many Americans still haven’t heard from loved ones after a week, and at least 13 people have died. Adding to the situation, it was just two weeks earlier that Hurricane Irma hit the island and caused up to $1 billion in damages.The president’s comments suggest shipping professionals are telling him they’d rather keep their financial advantage over Puerto Rico in the midst of a life-threatening situation than cede money they arguably shouldn’t be getting in the first place. HuffPost reached out to a handful of U.S. shipping organizations to ask if they oppose Trump waiving the Jones Act for Puerto Rico’s recovery efforts.Requests for comment from two offices of National Shipping of America ― one in Puerto Rico, another on the U.S. mainland ― were not returned. A request for comment from North American Shippers Association was also not returned. A man who answered the phone at American Import Shippers Association said their organization “is not really involved” in Jones Act matters because their members only import goods from the Far East.Thomas Allegretti, chairman of the American Maritime Partnership, said he is not in favor of waiving the law because he said there are too many cargo containers piling up at the port of San Juan and not enough trucks and clear roads to distribute the goods.“So, the problem at the port is a lack of trucks and delivery routes, not a lack of vessels,” Allegretti said in a statement.A number of lawmakers are urging the Trump administration to waive the law and to do it immediately. Among them is Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who wrote a letter Tuesday to acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke demanding she take action.“It is unacceptable to force the people of Puerto Rico to pay at least twice as much for food, clean drinking water, supplies and infrastructure due to Jones Act requirements as they work to recover from this disaster,” McCain wrote. “We must treat this emergency relief with urgency ― every day that business owners are unable to recover their assets and account for lost business, the economy will retreat even further into devastation.”The Department of Homeland Security has gotten emergency waivers to the Jones Act twice in the last month to help with recovery efforts in Texas and Florida after hurricanes Harvey and Irma. But during testimony Wednesday before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, Duke said DHS can issue waivers only if they are related to national defense matters. The waivers for Texas and Florida were to help aid fuel shortages, she said, which fall under the category of national security.“We don’t know of fuel shortages on the island of Puerto Rico,” Duke said. “If there are fuel shortages, we are looking at the Jones Act. … We will use it appropriately.”One senator on the committee, Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), read aloud an email she got this week from former Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro García-Padilla, who described the scene on the island as “critical,” with “hospitals on the verge of collapse” because they have run out of gas or diesel to run their generators, and “patients dying in their homes because they cannot fill their prescriptions” or “have access to keep their insulin cool.”“Many thousands could die,” Hassan read from the end of Garcia-Padilla’s email. She asked Duke for her response.“The president, vice president and I talked with the [current] governor yesterday,” Duke said. “He had no unmet needs at that point.”Hassan appeared stunned. “I know others in contact with the governor of Puerto Rico. They are not hearing that all their needs have been met,” said the New Hampshire senator. “I am concerned why there were not more assets on the way to Puerto Rico as soon as the storm hit. We’re almost a week out now.”Duke conceded it’s “been a challenge” responding to Puerto Rico but said the agency is doing everything it can right now.“We will never stop,” Duke said. “We will never be satisfied.”"
72,POLITICS,The Trump-Russia Probe Made Things A Bit Awkward As The FBI Welcomed The New Boss,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-director-chris-wray-sessions-trump-russia_us_59cd1af4e4b03b0879cfeb6f,"FBI Director Christopher Wray, who replaced fired former Director James Comey, said the bureau must embrace change.",2017-09-28,"Former Deputy U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates arrives for the ceremony at FBI headquarters on Sept. 28, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cd610920000026080842b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― His name was uttered just once, as the eighth director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation rattled off the names of his seven predecessors. But former bureau chief James Comey loomed large over the swearing-in of new FBI Director Christopher Wray on Thursday, as employees and alumni gathered in the courtyard of the FBI building to formally welcome the boss replacing the man the president fired.President Donald Trump unceremoniously fired Comey in May, about two months after the former FBI chief confirmed that the bureau was investigating ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, and a few days after Comey said the idea he swayed the election made him “mildly nauseous.” The official reason for Comey’s firing was that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had made a recommendation to get rid of Comey based on his public disclosures about the Hillary Clinton investigation. But Trump revealed in interviews that he was going to fire Comey no matter what Rosenstein and Sessions recommended and said he was thinking about the Russia probe when he made the decision.The White House claimed that FBI agents had lost faith in Comey’s leadership, but the former acting head of the FBI said that wasn’t true. And surveys of FBI employees released last month in response to a public records request shows agents consistently gave Comey high marks. Moreover, Comey said during congressional testimony that the White House lied and defamed him and the FBI by saying the bureau was in chaos and that agents had lost faith in his leadership.So Thursday’s event for Wray was a bit of an awkward affair. The audience was greeted by Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who previously came under criticism from Trump on Twitter because his wife’s political campaign received donations from a group affiliated with an ally of Clinton. Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who was fired by Trump a few days into his presidency for refusing to defend the travel ban, was in the crowd. So was Rosenstein, who wrote the letter used as the official excuse to get rid of Comey.But Comey wasn’t present, nor was former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who was appointed by Rosenstein to oversee the special counsel investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The circumstances of Comey’s firing are now part of that wide-ranging special counsel investigation.Wray was nominated in June and confirmed on Aug. 1 after saying all the right things at his confirmation hearing, promising senators to keep the bureau independent and saying he would quit before breaking the law for the president. Former colleagues say Wray is “cut from the same cloth” as Comey.Wray’s speech made little reference to the circumstances that placed him in the position of the head of what he called the “finest law enforcement and national security agency in the world.”Instead, he focused on the challenges that the bureau will face in a fast and changing world. He said terrorist threats were becoming “more agile, and more challenging to detect,” and that U.S. economic secrets and values were being targeted by foreign entities.“So we know that we’re going to have to up our game and adapt through innovation with new ideas, new strategies, and especially new technologies,” Wray said. “We’re going to embrace those changes. We’re going to evolve to stay one step ahead, just as the bureau has done so many times before.”Also speaking was Sessions, who previously recommended that Wray’s predecessor be fired and who himself came under blistering criticism from the president and reportedly even offered up his resignation. The attorney general said that Wray is a patriot who was committed to the rule of law and that Wray had “no hidden agenda.” Sessions’ speech made only a passing reference to the turmoil inside the bureau in recently months after Comey’s departure. “In the days to come, Chris, they’ll be many controversies. There seem to be a lot of them these days,” Sessions said. “It’s the nature of the job, I suppose. But I’m sure that the American people will see their confidence in you and your leadership and the FBI grow steadily.”"
73,POLITICS,Rep. Keith Ellison Defends Bernie Sanders' Single-Payer Bill Rollout,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/keith-ellison-defends-bernie-sanders-single-payer-bill_us_59cc1c52e4b053a9c2f63a48,"The Minnesota congressman dismissed criticism about the timing of the bill, given the subsequent GOP Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal effort.",2017-09-28,"Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), left, is a longtime ally of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cc1dc62d0000dd023077f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) extolled Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as an “awesome” health care advocate in an interview with HuffPost on Wednesday, dismissing those who questioned the timing of Sanders’ rollout of single-payer legislation.Days after Sanders introduced his “Medicare for All” bill earlier this month, it started to look like the Graham-Cassidy bill, a final Republican bid to repeal the Affordable Care Act, stood a chance of passing.Prior to Graham-Cassidy’s death on Tuesday, some Democrats complained that Sanders had created an opening for a last-minute GOP health care push by distracting attention away from the party’s nightmare scenario of an Obamacare repeal. The griping peaked when CNN revealed that Sanders had agreed to debate Graham-Cassidy on live television.Asked whether those charges had any merit, Ellison responded, “Of course not.”“We create the time, by pushing the issue. The issue becomes ripe because we push it,” Ellison said. “If we sat around waiting for the most opportune moment then we wouldn’t have been able to gain the support we acquired.”Rather than undermine efforts to fight Obamacare repeal, Sanders’ single-payer push had merely expanded the bounds of the debate, shoving a once fringe cause into the mainstream, according to Ellison. “Bernie is changing the national conversation,” Ellison said.As evidence of Sanders’ success, Ellison pointed to support for the idea among one-third of the Senate Democratic Caucus and more than half of the House Democratic Caucus. As recently as Tuesday, Annette Taddeo, a Florida Democrat who backs single payer, won a GOP-controlled state Senate seat, he noted.“There was a time in our nation’s history when you couldn’t even get in the door to discuss it,” Ellison said. “Now it is a well-researched, often-discussed policy proposal. It’s an idea whose time has come.”Ellison added that progressive activists, himself included, had been pushing for single-payer for decades, implying that Republicans would find a way to attack Democrats for it one way or another. “It’s not a new idea,” he said.And Ellison brushed off a question about whether it would be better if Sanders formally affiliated as a Democrat, rather than merely caucusing with the party. Sanders’ ongoing independence, despite a spot in Senate Democratic leadership, is a frequent sore point for his moderate critics.“No thoughts on that. It’s more the substance than anything,” he said.Ellison, who serves as deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is perhaps the highest-ranking Democratic official to publicly defend Sanders against recurring criticism that he has either harmed the fight to protect the ACA, or otherwise proved insufficiently loyal to the Democratic Party.Hillary Clinton gave new fuel to the intra-party feud in recent weeks with the release of What Happened, her book about the 2016 election, and a series of interviews in which she suggested that Sanders was still not pulling his weight for the party. Sanders is “not supporting Democrats now,” Clinton said in an NPR interview earlier this month.Sanders’ fans in the progressive movement have chafed at what they regard as disingenuous attacks from Democratic opponents who use tactical criticism to mask their ideological disagreements with Sanders.Some of Sanders’ defenders noted that few of the Democrats concerned about his participation in the CNN debate with the ACA repeal bill’s co-authors ― Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (La.) ― spoke up when the Vermont senator delivered a strong and spirited defense of Obamacare alongside Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).Over the course of the debate and in many other public appearances, Sanders repeatedly made it clear that despite his long-term goal of single-payer, his priority in the short term is to preserve protections and coverage expansion enacted by the ACA.“These gentlemen have on five occasions tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, throw tens and tens of millions of Americans off of the health insurance they currently have, and make it impossible or very difficult for people with pre-existing conditions to get the health care that they can afford,” Sanders said, in one of many memorable lines from the debate stage.Members of Sanders’ staff have been keen to point out that Sanders has used his own campaign funds traversing the country to hold rallies in defense of Obamacare. But few Democrats volunteer praise for these efforts.Last week, HuffPost asked the Democratic National Committee and the offices of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) whether, contra what Clinton said, Sanders helps Democrats.Only Schumer gave a definitive reply, stating that Sanders has “been a good member of our leadership team in the Senate.”Xochitl Hinojosa, communications director for the DNC, did not address Sanders directly at all. “All of our leaders should want to do more to help Dems win in Virginia, New Jersey, Alabama and races up and down the ballot,” she said.The other offices either did not respond or declined comment.Ellison declined to indict his fellow Democrats for failing to appreciate Sanders’ contributions the way he does. Senate Democratic leaders have acknowledged Sanders’ importance, Ellison argued, by naming him outreach chair.Besides, Ellison reasoned, “I don’t think Bernie’s in it for credit.” “Bernie is answering to a higher call,” he concluded. “He is motivated by the noblest ideals of our country.”"

How will Europe’s future be shaped after this election? Expectations are high and unknowns numerous. After years of crisis management and muddling through, a renewal is, to use the name of Macron’s movement, en marche.Macron’s fundamental breakthrough consists in openly admitting the need to change scale in public policies. He dares to talk about “European sovereignty” when it is the nationalists who usually defend a formal (but everyday less consistent) national sovereignty.Even as nationalist and right-wing parties grow stronger than ever in the polls, Macron believes he has a clear mandate to boost Europe, which does not mean that European integration should be a goal in itself. On the contrary, he insists that concrete issues need to be tackled urgently: unemployment, security, border control, innovation. He recognizes the need for dramatic change.Macron is relentlessly positive, presenting Europe not as a bitter medicine you have to swallow, nor as a set of procedures. Instead, he sees it as a new frontier, a way to enjoy the benefits of scale and diversity, including from a cultural point of view. He recognizes both the appeal and the mystery of intercultural dialogue. What makes him even more convincing is that he is himself fascinated by this journey into a shared future.Macron is committed to putting French public finances in order and to delivering much-needed structural reforms. This is a huge endeavor since the single market and free trade — even in reformed versions — are not in the French tradition. Neither is the French presidential political system the best model for multilevel, decentralized governance.In my opinion, France’s transformation under Macron will push the Germans to change as well. If bold reforms are implemented in France, German skeptics lose their strongest argument: the lack of a reliable partner. Macron’s insistence on democratic accountability is also an important gesture towards Germany. Seventeen years after Joschka Fischer’s Humboldt speech, Macron echoes his main request. Macron’s approach is pragmatic, not ideological. In his eyes, each and every improvement is useful “at the same time,” as he likes to say, to the whole European Union (27 member countries) as well as to the eurozone (19 countries) or informal coalitions of willing partners. He called on all 27 governments to shoulder their responsibilities. No one is excluded, but free riders should not enjoy any complacency.Despite all its flaws and weaknesses, the E.U. remains, above all in the eyes of many Germans, the most solid pillar of the world’s post-war order. Germans expect that Europe will provide solutions regarding refugees and migrants. Their own borders are now in the Mediterranean Sea, not in the Alps. And the E.U. provides a rules-based market, labor mobility and trade agreements from which German industry has benefitted. Although the public has vehemently criticized European Central Bank policies, low interest rates and an under-evaluated euro have contributed to a thriving economy.Europe has become even more important to Berlin as the transatlantic relationship falters. Germans used to be very close (and grateful) to the U.S. for the NATO umbrella, relying on America to defend security and liberal values. Today, Donald Trump’s declarations are a source of concern. In 2003, Merkel was on Bush’s side on the Iraq debate. Now, she is clearly maintaining her distance.For many Germans, stability is a top priority. Last year, the so-called Islamic State attacked German territory. The Turkish president violates basic principles of democracy at home, insults German authorities and openly tries to manipulate dual-nationals. Russian President Vladimir Putin does not share Germany’s Kantian vision of the international order. Trump’s America-first and protectionist narrative, as well as the extraordinary power of U.S. technology companies and the tendency for American laws to have extraterritorial effects, require joint European answers, even for the largest European country, Germany.At this stage, it is too early to say which coalition will rule in Berlin. The negotiation might well last two or three months, but whatever the coalition will be, Germany’s national interest remains the same: a stable Europe, based on a stronger France than in past years.No matter which parties join Angela Merkel’s coalition, the Bundestag will continue to exercise close control of the executive branch and the Federal Constitutional Court. These institutions are enshrined in the sacrosanct Basic Law. Any government will face these constraints, especially in a Bundestag which will include around 90 representatives of the right-wing Alternative for Germany party. In a nutshell, while Macron’s pro-European plea represents a quantum leap forward, it does not close the debate. It opens it. In the coming months, the main challenge for European politicians will be to take risks and shake up the old ways of thinking. That’s what Francois Mitterrand did in the early 1980s when he overcame the opposition of his European and national socialist friends on the Euromissiles in support of an untested German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. And that’s what Kohl himself did when he upset his own party and the majority of fellow citizens to create the euro.Europe needs more democracy, not more demagogy."

For the Carter family, this extremely rare scenario became a reality.Haley Carter was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, or bone cancer, after discovering a bump on her left shin. During her final rounds of chemotherapy, her brother, Austin, began complaining about his knee. Following a sports physical, doctors discovered he had the same cancer as Haley.Both children turned to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital for treatment to put their cancer into remission.I am happy to say that today both Austin and Haley are cancer free and are thriving college students at Missouri State University.But the question remained of why two siblings were found to have the same cancer within the same year. Their results came back as inconclusive even after genetic testing. Did cancer run in the Carter family?Our goal is that we can use the information from the Carters and families like these across America to gather more data to help us crack the genetic code that leads to familial cancers.Through our cancer predisposition research, St. Jude investigators have shown that nearly 1 in 10 children with cancer has a genetic bias towards developing cancer.The clues for understanding cancer predisposition are hidden within the genetic code of every human cell.Now we have the technology to precisely sequence, or read, all the genetic information in a person’s body. And we can do it from a simple blood sample.This advancement in science and the hope of helping other families led the Carters to take part in a new groundbreaking study at St. Jude.The SJFAMILY study is one of the most comprehensive genomic evaluations to date of families with a cancer history.Through SJFAMILY, we collect and store samples and health information to study and learn about familial cancers—ones that occur in families more often than expected by coincidence.By reading the genetic code and using advanced computational biology methods from family members who do or do not have cancer, we can compare the information and identify genetic changes that are unique to those with cancer. This helps us find clues to the causes of cancer, especially when it appears to run in families.Our genetic makeup can reveal changes in DNA that give clues for how diseases like cancer may develop.When we understand how those changes place individuals at risk for cancer, we are able to use this information to develop new ways to predict whether cancer will occur, to treat cancer or even to prevent it from happening.Genetic information can also help us to identify other family members who might also be at risk for cancer.You, a family member or someone you know can help us solve the cancer riddle.Anyone who has been diagnosed with childhood cancer and who also has a close relative diagnosed with any cancer before age 50, can join our study to help find those answers.Our goal is to identify more cancer predisposition genes that can help scientists identify cancer signals earlier and help monitor individuals affected by changes in these genes.For more details on how you or someone you know can take part, visit stjude.org/sjfamily.By Dr. Kim Nichols"

In just a few weeks since its purchase of Whole Foods closed, Amazon has made its ownership known as it cuts prices and indicates that Whole Foods will be a linchpin in its quest to lead local food delivery.2017 is on pace to be one of Amazon’s most acquisitive years ever, with eight transactions completed at the close of Q2. 1999 remains its most active year, with 16 transactions closed, since its founding in 1994, a remarkably brief 23 years ago.The general assumption is that acquired companies will be brought under the corporate umbrella, and the existing brand will be replaced by Amazon’s powerful consumer brand. But on a closer look at a number of Amazon’s largest acquisitions, it’s clear that the highest profile ones have been given remarkable freedom to build independent brands and cultures rather than be subsumed by their powerful parent brand.Here are a just a few relevant examples. Just four years after Amazon’s launch, the still-book-focused retailer purchased the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) for $55 million. Clearly this purchase signaled the future ― for folks who were paying attention. In the press release announcing the acquisition, Amazon stated it expected IMDB “to support its eventual entry into online video sales.”While it’s clear that Amazon has made relevant use of IMDB data to help build its database of knowledge about film and television properties, the IMDB site and its filmmaker-centric focus have remained largely untouched. British film fan and computer programmer Col Needham remains in place as the CEO, almost 20 years after the purchase.In 2009, Amazon acquired Zappos, the popular and quirky retail shoe site whose CEO, Tony Hsieh, was outspoken and well-known within startup tech circles. The deal was valued at a reported $1.2 billion. Most interesting, Zappos’ Hsieh clearly said that Zappos would remain “fun and a little weird” with its own culture, and stay in Las Vegas. Eight years later, Hsieh remains at the helm.A year after the sale, Hsieh wrote that the deal was “governed by a document that formally recognizes the uniqueness of Zappos's culture and Amazon's duty to protect it.” And despite a sometimes bumpy road as Hsieh implemented a management philosophy called “holacracy” -- in which authority and decision-making are distributed through self-organizing teams rather than a management hierarchy -- Amazon has remained hands-off, at least as far as anyone can tell from the outside looking in. Other transactions in which Amazon has left the consumer brands relatively untouched include Love Film in 2011, Goodreads in 2013, and Comixology in 2014 -- though Comixology does now say: “An Amazon Company” in its header.But the deal that may provide further clues about Amazon’s M&A strategy is the 2014 acquisition of Twitch. Amazon paid just shy of a billion dollars for Twitch, a streaming site that then had 55 million users playing and watching others play video games -- live. Google wanted the site to add to YouTube’s gaming audience, but lost out after the Twitch founders determined that they’d have more freedom and running room with Amazon. Kevin Lin, Twitch's co-founder and COO, said that the Amazon purchase was ""frightening, at least at first."" But rather than be pushed out, or subsumed, Lin is nothing but happy with his company Twitch inside of Amazon. ""So far it's been great,"" Lin told CNBC. ""We're still in San Francisco. Amazon is super-excited about what we're doing. We're doing more and more with different teams there. So far so good.""The facts back him up. Twitch has had extraordinary growth, added offerings, and done it without scaring away its base of young, notoriously finicky users. In fact, it’s launching TwitchCon, a conference of Twitch users and fans. It seems that Amazon has extraordinary discipline -- both in what it acquires and how it chooses to approach those acquisitions. The purchases for technology or data are incorporated. But when a company's value lies in teams, culture, and community, Amazon has been able to keep the spirit of the brand intact, while bringing its own resources to grow the business.What’s next for Amazon M&A? With pressure from the executive suite looking for more traction and footprint in video, the next focus will probably be on video. No doubt there are some juicy targets in that space. So, as they say: Stay tuned."
79,POLITICS,Democratic Super PAC Steps Up Push To Fight 'Conservative Dark Money',Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/forward-majority-outpsent-report-democrats-state-legislatures_us_59cd3932e4b0ef0694271f33,And they're focusing on oft-forgotten state legislatures.,2017-09-28,"Ed Gillespie, GOP gubernatorial nominee in Virginia, helped engineer the Republican takeover of state legislatures in 2010.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cd39672d0000e608307aa1.jpeg?cache=3WvPt8t94E&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Left unchecked, the influx of “conservative dark money” into state legislative races and partisan redistricting poses a critical threat to the Democratic Party’s future, according to an analysis released Thursday by Democratic super PAC Forward Majority. The analysis, “Outspent,” does not provide new data on the impact of both party-led and outside spending on the makeup of state legislatures and the congressional districting process they control. Instead, drawing on the findings of a 2012 ProPublica report, it highlights some of the strongest evidence of the phenomenon in the hopes of galvanizing Democratic donors and activists.Focusing on the pivotal 2010 elections, when Democratic losses allowed the GOP to redraw congressional districts, the report identifies a 3-to-1 Republican spending advantage that year between the respective political nonprofits erected by the two parties. It also notes the rise of the billionaire Koch brothers’ political group Americans for Prosperity, which invested in state legislative races in 2010 in an unprecedented fashion with six-figure radio ad buys for individual candidates.“The report highlights the urgency of the moment less than six weeks before Virginia voters head to the polls,” Ben Wexler-Waite, a spokesman for Forward Majority, said in a statement. “For too long, Democrats have allowed the Koch Brothers and their vast network of conservative dark money groups to go unanswered in state legislative elections.” An item that is likely to be of particular interest to Democrats is the key role played in the transformation of state legislatures by Ed Gillespie, the Republican nominee for governor of Virginia. As chairman of the Republican State Leadership Committee in 2010, Gillespie spearheaded the creation of the Redistricting Majority Project or REDMAP, an offshoot of the RSLC, aimed at winning state legislative seats and shaping the subsequent redistricting process. REDMAP raised $30 million in 2010. The same year, the RSLC’s Democratic counterpart, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, raised just $10 million to influence redistricting.Barack Obama campaign veteran David Cohen launched Forward Majority earlier this month with the goal of providing the kind of outside support in state legislative races that the Senate Majority PAC and House Majority PAC already provide Democrats in U.S. Senate and House races. The group plans to begin its efforts with a $1 million investment in Virginia House of Delegates races, and it will ramp up its investment to $100 million in 12 states over the next four years. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), and Democratic Reps. Joseph Kennedy and Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, serve as the organization’s honorary co-chairs.This November, only Virginia and New Jersey hold statewide elections for their lower legislative body. Since Democrats have a comfortable majority in New Jersey’s general assembly, the party has focused its efforts on picking up seats in Virginia.“Forward Majority is fighting back and our work is starting right now in Virginia,” Wexler-Waite said.The super PAC has not yet announced the form of support it plans to provide and which races it plans to get involved in.The chances of Democrats gaining control of the Virginia House of Delegates are slim; Republicans enjoy a 66-34 majority that Democrats blame on partisan gerrymandering.Still, the party sees a major opportunity to erode Republicans’ lead, given Hillary Clinton’s victory over Donald Trump in 17 legislative districts. In the unlikely event that Democrats can flip all 17 of those seats, they would gain control of the lower chamber.Forward Majority is one of several new Democratic groups that have cropped up to focus on the less sexy arena of state-level electoral politics. The National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a new group led by former Attorney General Eric Holder with the backing of former President Obama, raised $10.8 million as of the end of July to elect Democratic state legislators and governors. It is focusing its first efforts on electing Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) as governor of Virginia.And after losing in Virginia’s Democratic gubernatorial primary, former Rep. Tom Perriello founded the Win Virginia PAC to bolster Democratic candidates for the state House of Delegates.The surge of Democratic interest and investment in state-level races is an attempt to reverse the party’s devastating loss of governorships and state legislatures. Since 2009, Democrats have lost roughly 1,000 state legislative seats and 27 state chambers. The losses, which included 675 seats in 2010 alone, allowed Republicans to redraw legislative and congressional districts based on new census data, laying the groundwork for lasting Republican control of state governments and the U.S. House of Representatives.Republicans have also used their political majorities at the state level to at once undo key Democratic priorities and undermine the party’s political infrastructure, through anti-union right-to-work laws and voter identification requirements.The renewed Democratic attention on the states has started bearing fruit in special elections for open state legislature seats. With two more wins on Tuesday in Florida and New Hampshire, the Democratic Party has already flipped eight GOP-controlled seats this election cycle."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).Who cares if she had little to nothing to do with it?Warren is a hard-charging progressive advocate of consumer rights and government intervention in the economy. She’s exactly the type of politician who makes Republicans’ hair stand on end. So why not blame it on her? That’s what it looks like one corporate lobbying campaign did in an effort to protect its profits.Oracle, the California-based software company, appears to be behind the lobbying campaign using Warren as its foil. The campaign targeted Warren as the supposed source of a provision added to the National Defense Authorization Act that would encourage the Department of Defense to use open-source software for non-battlefield purposes.“Open-source software” refers to computer programs for which the source code is both transparent and available for use and reuse by anyone, for any purpose, under the conditions defined by a given license. This is different from the proprietary software often purchased by government agencies, where the agency does not have access to the source code.For proprietary software, the agency must go back to the company that sold the software and pay for any upgrade, update, patch or fix needed to maintain continued operations. The proprietary model often means that one company has a monopoly on knowledge of military and government systems.In fiscal 2017, Oracle and its subsidiary companies received nearly $100 million in contracts from the Department of Defense for the use of their proprietary software. In a 2013 white paper, Oracle publicly stated its position against the use of open source by the Department of Defense. The adoption of open-source software preferences could very well provide cheaper and more flexible options for government agencies ― and thus threaten the company’s bottom line. Recently, Britain’s National Health Service dropped Oracle’s proprietary database software for an open-source alternative, saving 21 million pounds ($28.1 million). This discussion of government procurement and open-source preferences is probably boring you to tears right now. That’s why this corporate influence effort simply tried to enrage heavy partisans by invoking someone they wouldn’t like and calling it “socialism.” Like many stealth lobbying campaigns over the years, this effort was done through the careful placement of inflammatory articles on conservative media sites, claiming that liberal socialists were trying to destroy private industry and make it easier for North Korea and Iran to hurt the United States.In The Daily Caller, Cesar Conda, a registered lobbyist for Oracle, said that the provision “snuck in to the NDAA by Senator Warren... will actually make America less safe and grow government bureaucracy.” An article at RedState by Dean Chambers, who once sought to “unskew” the 2012 presidential election polling, said the provision was “pushed by arch liberal Senator Elizabeth Warren” and called it “a socialist idea ― plain and simple.”Brian Darling, the head of the public relations and lobbying firm Liberty Government Affairs, wrote that “progressive hero” Warren was leading a federal government takeover of “the development of software in defense contracting.” A reporter for Breitbart said Republicans shouldn’t be supporting “the socialist cause of liberal Democrats.” And an article by Andrew Langer ― the head of the Institute for Liberty, which is known for parroting causes for corporate lobbying efforts ― asserted, without any evidence, that “it is unlikely that Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), the manager of the NDAA bill on the Senate floor, even knows this provision has been snuck into the base text of the bill.”The problem with this particular lobbying campaign is that practically none of it was ever close to true.The provision at issue was originally introduced as a bill in June by Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). That’s the conservative Republican senator from South Dakota, not Elizabeth Warren. The idea was to increase open-source software adoption by the Pentagon to reduce contracting costs and increase the flexibility of software use. The provision was then added as an amendment to the NDAA by Rounds in the Senate Armed Services Committee.There was one near-truth in the lobbying campaign: Warren was the Democratic co-sponsor of Rounds’ committee amendment. But it was agreed to in committee by unanimous consent, which means that McCain, the committee chairman, knew about it.Later, when the bill was debated on the floor of the Senate, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) ― another person who is not Elizabeth Warren ― introduced an amendment to Rounds’ open-source software provision, which was then also adopted by unanimous consent.Spokespeople for both Rounds and Tillis confirmed that the provision originated from Rounds’ office and was amended by Tillis on the floor of the Senate.When asked if the company was behind the stealth lobbying campaign, a spokeswoman for Oracle wrote in an email to HuffPost, “We decline comment.”The adoption of open-source software by government agencies, it should be noted, is not a socialist plot to take over private industry. In fact, government agencies have been using open-source software for years. Large tech firms like Google and Facebook are built on open-source software, and governments around the world use open-source software for a variety of programs. In 2016, the White House chief information officer directed government agencies to preference open-source software adoption.One of the main purposes behind the adoption of open-source preferences is to allow the easy reuse of code across all of government without every individual agency paying for it. One would think conservatives would be in favor of reducing government spending.“That’s a ludicrous contention,” Alex Howard, the deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation, a pro-transparency nonprofit that advocates for better use of technology by governments, said of the idea that open-source software adoption is a front in a socialist war against free enterprise. “I’m going to assume good faith and hope that the people who are reporting on it as if it’s a real issue are just ignorant.”The Department of Defense has used open-source software for years, and has both a policy and a manual for its use. So does the Central Intelligence Agency. Howard, a former HuffPost editor, noted that when he talks to other agencies considering the adoption of open-source software or standards, he points them to both the Pentagon and the CIA as exemplary models of open-source software use.Conda, who was not identified as an Oracle lobbyist in his Daily Caller article, argued that open-source software is less safe than proprietary software. He pointed to the use of open-source software by Equifax, the consumer credit reporting company that was hacked this year and lost user data for 143 million Americans.The Equifax hack was not, however, the fault of open-source software. It was caused by negligence on the part of Equifax’s security team, which failed to patch a known vulnerability for months.“The arguments around security are ludicrous and completely divorced from what the world’s top [information technology] security experts would say at DefCon [an IT security conference] or any other gathering,” Howard said.This particular lobbying effort clearly failed. The NDAA passed with the provision included. But this wasn’t the first time Warren has been used to try and scare up opposition, and it won’t be the last."

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) ― another person who is not Elizabeth Warren ― introduced an amendment to Rounds’ open-source software provision, which was then also adopted by unanimous consent.Spokespeople for both Rounds and Tillis confirmed that the provision originated from Rounds’ office and was amended by Tillis on the floor of the Senate.When asked if the company was behind the stealth lobbying campaign, a spokeswoman for Oracle wrote in an email to HuffPost, “We decline comment.”The adoption of open-source software by government agencies, it should be noted, is not a socialist plot to take over private industry. In fact, government agencies have been using open-source software for years. Large tech firms like Google and Facebook are built on open-source software, and governments around the world use open-source software for a variety of programs. In 2016, the White House chief information officer directed government agencies to preference open-source software adoption.One of the main purposes behind the adoption of open-source preferences is to allow the easy reuse of code across all of government without every individual agency paying for it. One would think conservatives would be in favor of reducing government spending.“That’s a ludicrous contention,” Alex Howard, the deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation, a pro-transparency nonprofit that advocates for better use of technology by governments, said of the idea that open-source software adoption is a front in a socialist war against free enterprise. “I’m going to assume good faith and hope that the people who are reporting on it as if it’s a real issue are just ignorant.”The Department of Defense has used open-source software for years, and has both a policy and a manual for its use. So does the Central Intelligence Agency. Howard, a former HuffPost editor, noted that when he talks to other agencies considering the adoption of open-source software or standards, he points them to both the Pentagon and the CIA as exemplary models of open-source software use.Conda, who was not identified as an Oracle lobbyist in his Daily Caller article, argued that open-source software is less safe than proprietary software. He pointed to the use of open-source software by Equifax, the consumer credit reporting company that was hacked this year and lost user data for 143 million Americans.The Equifax hack was not, however, the fault of open-source software. It was caused by negligence on the part of Equifax’s security team, which failed to patch a known vulnerability for months.“The arguments around security are ludicrous and completely divorced from what the world’s top [information technology] security experts would say at DefCon [an IT security conference] or any other gathering,” Howard said.This particular lobbying effort clearly failed. The NDAA passed with the provision included. But this wasn’t the first time Warren has been used to try and scare up opposition, and it won’t be the last."
82,POLITICS,The Storm That Crushed Puerto Rico Isn't Getting As Much Attention As Harvey Or Irma,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-attention-poll_us_59cd77afe4b06791bb0f7e0f,Only 19 percent of Americans know anyone who was affected by Hurricane Maria.,2017-09-28,"Post-Hurricane Maria, a woman carries buckets to be filled with water from a tank truck in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, on Sept. 26, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cd780f200000c40708430a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans aren’t paying as much attention to the hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands as they did to the storms that hit Texas and Florida, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey shows.Hurricane Maria swept through Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and other parts of the Caribbean that were already reeling from the brunt of Hurricane Irma, leaving conditions that local officials described as “apocalyptic.” A week later, Puerto Rico remains largely without power and thousands are still living in shelters. Many mainland Americans are desperately searching for loved ones.Just 27 percent of Americans say they’ve closely followed news about the effects of Hurricane Maria, the survey found. That’s down from 39 percent who say they watched Hurricane Harvey very closely and 43 percent who say the same about Hurricane Irma.Only 19 percent report knowing anyone who was affected by Maria, compared to 33 percent for Harvey and 44 percent for Irma.Other metrics suggest a similar drop-off. Google Trends, which tracks the level of interest in various search terms, shows that Maria never saw the same sort of steep spike in interest that Harvey and Irma did at their peaks. By comparison, here’s what searches from Puerto Rico looked like over the same period:According to analysis from FiveThirtyEight’s Dhrumil Mehta, Hurricane Maria ― and Puerto Rico ― saw far less coverage in TV and online news than those predecessor storms.Much of the media “has been occupied with other things: a health care bill that failed to pass, a primary election in Alabama, and a spat between the president and sports players, just to name a few,” Mehta wrote, noting that the phrase “national anthem” came up in TV news more often last Sunday than “Puerto Rico” and “Hurricane Maria” combined. According to another recent HuffPost/YouGov survey, just 14 percent of Americans said they’d heard more about the disaster in Puerto Rico than about the NFL protests or the GOP’s efforts to repeal Obamacare. Many Americans also don’t realize that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. Three polls in the past few years put the percentage aware that Puerto Ricans have U.S. citizenship at between 43 and 54 percent. A new Morning Consult survey found that those who were reminded that Puerto Ricans are Americans were modestly more likely to support giving aid to their recovery efforts.Some critics of President Donald Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria have alleged that it pales in comparison to his administration’s actions after Harvey and Irma. The public gives positive ratings to both Trump specifically and the federal government as a whole for the handling of all three hurricanes, according to the HuffPost/YouGov survey. But they’re less strongly approving about the response to Maria.Just 14 percent of those who say they or someone in their family was personally affected by Harvey and 13 percent of those affected by Irma disapprove of the federal government’s response to those hurricanes. While the sample size of those similarly affected by Maria is small, nearly 40 percent in that group say they disapprove.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey by choosing the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 26-27 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

After Playboy founder Hugh Hefner died on Wednesday at the age of 91, tributes from bunnies of yesteryear came pouring in on social media. But fans eagerly awaited reactions from three in particular — those who gave a human face to the pornography empire. For five years, camera crews followed the lives of Hefner’s live-in girlfriends, including Kendra Wilkinson, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, for the E! reality show “The Girls Next Door,” which gave viewers a peek inside the walls of the storied Playboy mansion. The three became synonymous with the Playboy brand in the mid-2000s. Although the women largely parted ways with Hefner by 2009 ― some with fonder memories than others ― they remain part of his enduring legacy. Wilkinson, who moved into the mansion shortly after graduating high school, remembered Hefner as the man who made her “the person I am today.”“Hef changed my life,” Wilkinson told Entertainment Tonight in a statement. “I couldn’t be more thankful for our friendship and our time together.” Marquardt, 43, shared a throwback photo of herself and Hefner, writing in the caption, “So sad but forever grateful for all the wonderful memories and amazing experiences.”Madison, who was often billed as Hefner’s No. 1 girlfriend at the time, has yet to make a statement regarding his death, but has repeatedly spoken about her time living in the mansion since exiting in 2008. In her 2015 memoir titled Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny, Madison largely describes her experience as Hefner’s girlfriend as negative, revealing that she even contemplated suicide at one point. “It was a constant struggle,” Madison told People about her life with Hefner. “I was trying to sell this image of ‘Oh, everything is so great here,’ but I was miserable inside.”“We were constantly reminded that the show was Hef‘s show – our contributions were irrelevant,” she added. “We were the decorative icing, not the cake. According to our boyfriend, he could have splashed any three blondes on-screen and found instant success.”Hefner’s death was announced Wednesday by his son Cooper, who became the new face of the company in August 2016. “My father lived an exceptional and impactful life as a media and cultural pioneer and a leading voice behind some of the most significant social and cultural movements of our time in advocating free speech, civil rights and sexual freedom,” he said in a statement. “He defined a lifestyle and ethos that lie at the heart of the Playboy brand, one of the most recognizable and enduring in history. He will be greatly missed by many.”"

85,HEALTHY LIVING,Doctors See A Surge In Babies With Syphilis-Associated Birth Defects,Anna Almendrala,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syphilis-pregnancy-babies-std-rates_us_59cd309ce4b0300a59abee4b,Public health experts say something has gone terribly wrong with prenatal care in the U.S. and that babies are paying the price.,2017-09-28,Congenital syphilis cases spiked by 28 percent from 2015 to 2016.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cd31bd200000c407084181.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last year, over 600 pregnancies in the United States were affected by syphilis. Of those, 45 babies were either stillborn or dead within the first month of life, while many others may have been born with serious defects, some of them irreversible.While these cases represent a tiny fraction of the approximately 3.9 million births that occurred in the U.S. in 2016, public health experts say that they’re a sign that something is deeply flawed about prenatal health care in the country, and that not a single one of these pregnancies needed to be marred by syphilis, a treatable and preventable sexually transmitted disease.“When you have congenital syphilis occurring, it means there has been a breakdown in the whole medical system ― that these cases are not being diagnosed until a baby is born, when they should be diagnosed antenatally or even before then,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America and a senior associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “It’s unfortunate that we’re seeing a resurgence of a disease that should basically be gone.”Syphilis is a bacterial infection that can be treated easily with antibiotics, but can cause sores, rashes, dementia and blindness if left untreated. In addition to causing miscarriages and stillbirths, babies who contract it in the womb can be born blind, deaf, or have deformed bones, skin rashes and enlarged livers and spleens.It was on the brink of extinction in the U.S. just 10 years ago, but today is surging. Cases of congenital syphilis, which is when a fetus contracts an infection from the mother in the womb, rose 28 percent last year ― from 492 in 2015 to 628 in 2016.The spike mirrors a record high number of STDs in the U.S. in general. Officials recorded more than two million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis last year (although officials estimate the true number is around ten times as much) and young people made up the bulk of the infections. For syphilis specifically, of which there were 28,000 reported cases, rates among women increased by 36 percent. “Each case of congenital syphilis is a sentinel event reflecting numerous missed opportunities for prevention within the public health and health care system,” said Dr. Sarah Kidd, of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s division of STD prevention. “These missed opportunities can include women who fell out of the system, either due to poverty, a lack of health insurance or other contributing factors.”According to the CDC, about half of moms who give birth to babies with congenital syphilis either had prenatal care late in their pregnancy, or no prenatal care at all. Fifteen percent of them were initially tested for syphilis early in pregnancy but then contracted it afterward. Still others may have tested positive for syphilis but dropped out of prenatal care before receiving positive results or starting antibiotic treatment. But more broadly, the U.S. is seeing more congenital syphilis cases because there are more syphilis cases in general ― especially among women of reproductive age, Adalja points out. Some people may have the bacterial infection but not have any symptoms, so it’s up to doctors to make STD testing a routine part of prenatal care. “We know how to treat these sexually transmitted infections, from chlamydia to gonorrhea to syphilis,” he said. “But you have to diagnose them in order to do that, and it has to be done very routinely, the way that some people get tested for blood pressure.”Indeed, both the CDC and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that STD testing be a routine part of prenatal care in the first trimester, and that women who have multiple sexual partners, a partner with STDs or who live in an area with high rates of syphilis be tested again later on in the pregnancy. Despite these recommendations, a recent CDC analysis of 2013 data found that only 85 percent of privately insured women had a syphilis test while pregnant. Another CDC analysis found that among women who had stillbirths in 2013, about 35 percent of women on Medicaid and 30 percent of women with private insurance had no syphilis testing, either during the pregnancy or at the stillbirth, and that syphilis testing among all women after stillbirth was less than 10 percent, suggesting that stillbirths caused by congenital syphilis could be underreported. Improving access to maternal care for the poorest and most vulnerable women in the U.S. would help close some of these gaps in care, but Adalja points out that shame, fear and misunderstanding about STDs are still major medical barriers, even for doctors who may decide not to test a prenatal patient for STDs because she doesn’t “seem” at risk.“Physicians have to be more in tune to the risks of syphilis and realize this hasn’t gone away,” he said."

Hefner will be buried next to the actress at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, People reports. (The cemetery is also the final resting place for stars like Natalie Wood, Dean Martin and Truman Capote.) The famous publisher purchased the vault next to Monroe back in 1992 for $75,000, according to The Guardian.Details regarding Hefner’s memorial service have not been released at this time.Monroe was laid to rest at the cemetery after she died at the age of 36 in 1962. The “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” star appeared on the cover of Playboy’s debut issue in 1953. As People notes, Hefner scrounged together enough money to purchase the photos of Monroe, which were originally taken for a calendar. However, Hefner may have published the images of Monroe without her consent. In a 2012 article published by Vanity Fair, photographer Lawrence Schiller recalled asking the star about the images, for which she said she received no compensation. Monroe also told Schiller she had never met Hefner. Hefner nonetheless was enamored of Monroe. During a 2012 interview with CBS Los Angeles, he admitted he would have loved to have dated her. “I’m a sucker for blondes,” he said, “and she is the ultimate blonde.”Hefner also said he felt a connection to Monroe, whose photos are partly responsible for Playboy’s early success, even though he never really knew her. He noted that his decision to be laid to rest beside the actress “has a completion notion to it.”“I will be spending the rest of my eternity with Marilyn,” he said. Hefner died of natural causes, surrounded by loved ones in his home, according to a statement released by Playboy Enterprises. “My father lived an exceptional and impactful life as a media and cultural pioneer and a leading voice behind some of the most significant social and cultural movements of our time in advocating free speech, civil rights and sexual freedom,” Hefner’s son Cooper, who serves as Playboy Enterprise’s Chief Creative Officer, said in a statement. “He defined a lifestyle and ethos that lie at the heart of the Playboy brand, one of the most recognizable and enduring in history. He will be greatly missed by many.”Following news of his death, plenty of stars, former Playboy bunnies and the “Girls Next Door” mourned the loss on social media. Hefner is survived by his wife, Crystal Harris, and four children, Christie, David, Marston and Cooper."

It’s meant to be a time set aside for prayer, repentance and spiritual renewal.For one Jewish synagogue in Houston, Yom Kippur will be a day filled with reflections on the past and particularly focused questions about the future.The United Orthodox Synagogues of Houston sits just a few hundred yards from Brays Bayou, which flooded by several feet as Hurricane Harvey dropped record rainfall on the city in late August. The modern Orthodox congregation has weathered its fair share of storms ― the synagogue’s complex has flooded three times in just the last three years. But nothing prepared Rabbi Barry Gelman for the destruction that touched nearly every corner of his synagogue this time. The building took in 4 to 5 feet of water, Gelman told HuffPost. All the rooms were affected, including the main sanctuary, classrooms and the rabbi’s office. Prayer books and Bibles had fallen off shelves and were soaked. Chairs were toppled. The Torah scrolls had been taken out of the building before the storm hit, but water had crept close to the ark where the scrolls are typically kept ― missing it by inches. “It was very sad to walk through,” Gelman told HuffPost about the first time he saw the synagogue after the hurricane. “Primarily because it came with the realization that we’ll likely never see the synagogue in its full beauty like that [again]. We have to figure out what to do next.”Harvey made landfall near Texas’ Gulf Coast on Aug. 25 as a Category 4 hurricane, eventually dropping 40 to 65 inches of rain in parts of southeast Texas. The storm claimed the lives of at least 50 people across eight counties and caused billions of dollars in damage to homes, businesses and places of worship. Harvey was worse than previous storms, Gelman said, because so many congregants’ homes were affected. Many members live near the synagogue, so they can walk to services on Sabbath. At least a third of its 320 families’ homes took in water. Many families, including Gelman’s, had to find temporary lodging in hotels or apartments. “We’ve been focusing ever since the flood on being positive and first helping people through the initial stages of this, which is very complicated,” he said. “You walk into your home and see 1 or 2 or 5 feet of water, and stuff is ruined. It’s paralyzing and demoralizing.”Because the hurricane hit just a few weeks before the start of the busy High Holidays, synagogue leaders needed to scramble to figure out how to prepare the building for Rosh Hashanah on Sept. 20. Thankfully, they had help. Gelman said that his congregation received both financial and physical donations from volunteers and wellwishers from around the country. Neighboring congregations donated chairs. Publishing companies and other synagogues donated prayer books. Youth groups pitched in and Gelman’s rabbinical colleagues from other states flew in to help for a few days. Some people even showed up at the rabbi’s house.“There was a guy in my house cutting out wet bookshelves and sheetrock from Hawaii. I didn’t know him. He just called me and said, ‘Do you need help? I’ll be at your house in 10 minutes,’” the rabbi told HuffPost. “A wonderful group of Mormons helped me get wet furniture and other items out of my house right after the flood.”As Rosh Hashanah drew near, Gelman said he was focusing on telling his congregants not to succumb to quick solutions and to be thoughtful about what the future holds.UOS was able to clear the water out of a social hall in its complex that was slightly more elevated than its main sanctuary. On Rosh Hashanah, the congregation met there to observe the holiday.“It was very emotional,” Gelman said. “It was wonderful to be able to be all together, but there are so many members of our congregation who are still affected.”As Yom Kippur approached, he said that UOS will have to think deeply about the congregation’s next steps. They are holding services in the social hall for now, but the future remains unclear, Gelman said.“The big question mark that we have is what’s next for our community and our synagogue, as this neighborhood has a tendency to flood. What are we going to do to avoid that in the future?”In the meantime, he’s trying to focus on the good. “People have responded with great strength and great resilience, and our community, which is very united and very tight, was able to provide wonderful support for the members whose houses were flooded,” Gelman said. “To me that’s a testament to the strength of a faith community, and a community bound by thousands of years of tradition and common history.” "
