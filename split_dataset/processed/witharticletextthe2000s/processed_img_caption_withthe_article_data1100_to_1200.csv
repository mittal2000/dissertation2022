2,ARTS & CULTURE,How 'The Mindy Project' Embraced And Transcended The Traditional Rom-Com,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-the-mindy-project-transcended-the-rom-com_us_58dd0322e4b05eae031d75f4,"At first, Mindy Lahiri was an unconventional heroine of a very conventional show.

Her character, a Manhattan OB/GYN with a romantic comedy addiction and an endless parade of hot (and white) boyfriends, had no concerns outside of getting introduced to NBA players at clubs and running into her ex at a friend’s Thanksgiving. But over the course of five seasons, a move to Hulu, and myriad exclamations of “exsqueeze me??”, the picture has changed. “When we first started the show, I think, at first, we weren’t talking about [social issues] as much,” writer Ike Barinholtz, who also plays the delightfully awful nurse Morgan Tookers on the show, told The Huffington Post in a phone conversation. “But I think the world’s changed a little bit.” Season five of “The Mindy Project” wrapped up on Tuesday with (spoiler alert!) Mindy Lahiri’s just-okay proposal to boyfriend Ben (Bryan Greenberg). Soon after, EW reported that the sitcom would be returning to Hulu for a sixth season, which will also be its last.In five seasons, “The Mindy Project” has been through more ups and downs than the average TV show; cancelled by Fox after three seasons on the air, the show was picked up by Hulu as a streaming series. There’s been no shortage of drama on-screen as well. Mindy Lahiri, the OB/GYN played by show creator Kaling, has been engaged (several times), had a child, split up with her son’s father, started her own fertility business, and now is poised to be a stepmother to a tween girl. In its first season, the show took flak from critics for being too surface-level, too girly and, oddly enough, too white (especially Mindy’s parade of pale boyfriends). On the verge of its final season, the show has quietly become a consistently political one.That’s not to say that the show traffics in “Saturday Night Live”-level satire. The presidential election didn’t become a plot point on the fifth season, or even fodder for copious jokes. But increasingly throughout its run, and particularly during its post-Season-3 incarnation on Hulu, “The Mindy Project” has specialized in bold, high-concept episodes that push its protagonist and audience to grapple with race, gender and class privilege. “I think in earlier seasons of the show, Mindy Kaling wanted to just present a normal sitcom about dating, when she is sort of a nontraditional sitcom lead,” “Mindy” writer Lang Fisher told HuffPost. In the show creators’ eyes, Kaling taking on the role of an adorable rom-com lead, when she doesn’t resemble the typical tiny blonde American romantic heroine, constituted the show’s most potent political message. Not all critics saw it that way. “When she did come under fire for being conventional and yada yada, I think that was upsetting because she’s not conventional. No one else looks like her on TV, particularly when this show started,” said Lang. “I think it was very hard for her to be criticized for that when many other shows with all-white casts were never criticized.”The show’s early treatments of race bear a whiff of defensiveness, or at least hyperawareness of its detractors. Barinholtz cowrote one of the first episodes that explicitly addressed race: “Mindy Lahiri Is a Racist,” which appeared in Season 2 ― after the show had been knocked around by critics of Mindy’s exclusively white male fellow doctors and romantic interests. “I remember in the writers room that summer, Mindy was like, let’s do a really really funny race episode,” he said.The result: An installment in which an expecting mother endorses Mindy’s practice on her white supremacist parenting blog, inspiring the crunchy liberal midwives in an adjoining office to lead an anti-racism crusade against them. It turns out that it’s being accused of racism that brings out the doctors’ worst impulses: Dr. Danny Castellano (Chris Messina) indignantly protests that (unlike Mindy) he’s dated many non-white people. Mindy thinks her own race precludes the possibility of her racism, even as she talks down to the practice’s black nurse, Tamra (Xosha Roquemore). “Sometimes you can get a little ‘Downton Abbey,’” Tamra points out. Somehow, it’s fratty white doctor Peter (Adam Pally) who salvages the practice’s reputation ― he wants to start a mobile service to bring women’s healthcare to underserved communities.The episode teased out Mindy’s own deeply conservative (“she kind of notoriously thinks Chris Christie is right on,” said Barinholtz) and even racist tendencies. “I went to second base with my friend Korean Justin!” her character brags in front of a PR consultant brought in to fix the practice’s racist reputation. “His hands were so small, they made my boobs look enormous.”But the episode also highlights the hypocrisy of the virtue-signaling white liberals around her. “Sister Tamra, you work at Shulman & Associates,” one of the white, male midwives urges Tamra at a rally. “Tell us how much it’s like 1950s Birmingham.” He’s not so much offering her a chance to speak as he is pushing her to ventriloquize his own talking points. And while the episode lightly jabbed at critics who seemed to expect far more from her than her white showrunning peers, it also honestly and hilariously explored the problematic beliefs that lie behind the tolerant, egalitarian faces social progressives put out into the world.It turned out, though, that “The Mindy Project” had more to say about race ― on its own terms this time. Even as headlines about Mindy’s lily-white boyfriends were supplanted by hot takes on newer show, the sitcom was getting more pointed in its social commentary. The show was ready to expand its scope. “We’ve already made the point that she can have a conventional sitcom,” Fisher said. “So… what other points can she make as this character?”For one thing, the show is ready to get a little weird. “The Mindy Project” follows the romantic comedy model, right down to Mindy’s own conviction that she’s perpetually moments away from finding herself the star in a real-life iteration of the form. The show has always been littered with bizarre meet-cutes and dramatic confessions of long-festering love. “We’ve paid homage to these different rom-com tropes, and we kind of have just wanted to have a little more fun with some of the weird ones, like the ‘Sliding Doors’ and ‘Groundhog Day,’” Fisher added. Sometimes the lessons are romantic ― forcing Mindy to relive one day until she understands what she did wrong to lead her boyfriend Ben to dump her ― but other times, those tropes are repurposed completely.In “Mindy Lahiri Is a White Man,” she’s passed over for a second interview for head of obstetrics at the hospital. All the second-round candidates are white men. Even though she eagerly assured the board ― in response to some truly horrifying and possibly illegal questions ― that she could balance the job with motherhood by working instead of exercising, and that she could keep her emotions in check to lead, she was ignored in favor of less-qualified male candidates. “I wish I was a white man,” she sighs before bed that night. And so she wakes up as a white man: Michael Lancaster, played by Ryan Hansen. Suddenly, her life is awesome. Michael’s ex takes care of their kids, and no one is worried that he can’t balance his role as a father with a demanding job. He can get ready for work and look professional in five minutes. He can pee standing up. Her coworkers listen to him respectfully and laugh at his jokes.Unfortunately for him, Michael can’t really enjoy all this privilege; he’s too aware of the flip side. After another doctor, Dr. Irene Lee, covers for a procedure while Michael is hungover, he realizes that quiet, self-effacing Dr. Lee is a supremely competent and qualified candidate for the head of obstetrics job. As an Indian-American woman, Mindy asked Dr. Lee not to sit near her in the waiting room so people wouldn’t think they were an “Asian clique”; as a white man, he feels thrilled to have the power to get his colleague noticed. Michael coaches his new friend on speaking confidently, grooming herself and dressing herself more attractively, and insists that the board give Dr. Lee a second interview. Still, Dr. Lee doesn’t get the job ― in fact, the board tries to offer it to Michael, impressed with his dedication to diversity. Apparently it takes more than one woke white man to fix systemic injustice.“There’s a million great things about being a white guy, and that’s just counting the things you can do with your penis,” Michael/Mindy reflects that night. “But the sad thing is having the ability to help other people, and most of the time just not doing it. It’s just so easy not to. Your life is so carefree.” Unusually for a protagonist dealing with a body-switch scenario (see: “Freaky Friday” and “The Switch”), she’s realized that the other person’s life really is as amazing as it seemed to her. Nonetheless, she wants her life back ― despite the disadvantages, she realizes, she likes being an Indian woman.The episode explores how being a white man both is and isn’t a silver bullet ― even a white doctor who’s losing it mentally and may have killed his wife is more likely to get a management job than an Asian-American woman (after all, his late spouse was “a difficult woman”). But a white man can’t fix oppression with the force of his convictions; it takes more work than that. Plus, it’s hard to remember to do the right thing when the world around you seems relatively pleasant and welcoming.Ultimately Mindy takes a lesson away from the experience: She befriends Dr. Lee. Only hanging out with white men seemed safer, cloaking her with an aura of simultaneous chillness and importance in a way that being in an “Asian clique” wouldn’t. Now, she’s done playing that game; it didn’t work anyway.In many ways, as the show takes pains to uncover, Mindy’s problematic views come from a misguided desire to identify with society’s power brokers, to shine as the one worthy woman. She’s driven to be hot, stylish, popular, chill and successful, all in one package; to be Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, and the Gillian Flynn-esque Cool Girl. In another Season 5 episode, “Mindy Lahiri Is a Misogynist,” the male doctors at Shulman & Associates set out to hire another doctor ― a female one. Worried about losing her special spot as the only female doctor in the practice, Mindy tries to push a sweaty, sloppily dressed male doctor who has lost his medical school diploma as a superior choice. “Mindy, every one of the female candidates was far more qualified than that walking MRSA infection,” Dr. Jeremy Reed (Ed Weeks) points out with withering calm. “Let’s face it: You’re kind of a misogynist.”A new doctor is hired ― Anna, a gorgeous, chilly blonde ― and Mindy immediately clashes with her new competition, noting in a burgeoning rage that her devoted fan Morgan has already begun sucking up to the new woman doctor. When Mindy misses an appointment, Anna takes her favorite patient; Mindy’s supposedly egalitarian male colleagues snicker over the “catfight” between the two. By the end of the episode, she realizes that she’s only jostling with Anna because the patriarchy has socialized her to do so.“I was raised in a system, created by men, that has pitted women against each other,” she proclaims. (You could imagine this Mindy flaunting a brightly colored “The Future Is Female” T-shirt.) She decides to forge a consciously feminist but tenuous peace with the new doctor. It’s not a friendship, but a small, determined step toward smashing the patriarchy. In “Mindy Lahiri Is a Racist,” she goes one step further: Not only is cutting down other women selfish and wrong, she realizes, it’s painfully clear that taking the side of white men didn’t offer her the status she thought it might. All it accomplished was cutting her off from having a support system of other women like her.Barinholtz told HuffPost that the show tries to avoid “coming off preachy” when incorporating more serious issues into storylines. “I think that’s kind of the death of a sitcom,” he said. But Mindy’s awakening isn’t always subtle. Sometimes, if not most of the time, there are monologues. Mindy’s speech apologizing for mistreating her female colleague is perhaps the least subtle approach to a pro-feminist monologue possible. “I was taught to believe that men can only handle one woman at a time,” she declares. “So it’s not my fault that I was threatened by Anna. It’s the fault of the patriarchy.” It’s impossible to miss and difficult to misconstrue the point the show is trying to make when Mindy delivers the moral; the humor comes mostly from hearing moral preaching from a character who is gleefully shallow, politically incorrect and often selfish. “The fact that she is on the wrong side of the issue is what’s surprising and kind of funny about her as a character,” said Fisher. “The moral is always correct, even if she has a hard time getting around to it.”The essential flavor of the show has remained unchanged, despite its more serious bent. “I think the character is such a deeply ingrained creation of Mindy Kaling that it’s hard for her not to be consistent,” Fisher told HuffPost. “We all have absorbed that character in our bones at this point.” Season 5 of “The Mindy Project” opened with a typically flippant joke: The premiere episode dropped in the midst of election season, and was titled “Decision 2016.” It was about Mindy’s decision between two hot, white male love interests. The show barely touched the election, though other politically minded sitcoms did. Outside of the show, Barinholtz has suggested Mindy Lahiri might be a Trump voter ― and what about Morgan? “I could see him getting very easily fleeced by Jill Stein,” he suggested. “I could see him writing in someone, writing in, like, Cesar Millan, the Dog Whisperer.”After five seasons, “The Mindy Project” has never been more well-positioned to take on Trump-era politics. But how can the show make that funny? “Honestly… it’s just so sad,” said Barinholtz. “I think we had a joke last year where [Jody] was like, ‘And for the record, I think Donald Trump would be fun as president.’ That joke worked in like, October of 2016. In March or April of 2017, we’re seeing just how much has changed.” It’s not just the political context; the show has changed too. Perhaps making the Trump presidency funny in a sitcom universe is impossible, but “The Mindy Project” has a good shot.You can be highbrow. You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow?

Mindy’s speech apologizing for mistreating her female colleague is perhaps the least subtle approach to a pro-feminist monologue possible. “I was taught to believe that men can only handle one woman at a time,” she declares. “So it’s not my fault that I was threatened by Anna. It’s the fault of the patriarchy.” It’s impossible to miss and difficult to misconstrue the point the show is trying to make when Mindy delivers the moral; the humor comes mostly from hearing moral preaching from a character who is gleefully shallow, politically incorrect and often selfish. “The fact that she is on the wrong side of the issue is what’s surprising and kind of funny about her as a character,” said Fisher. “The moral is always correct, even if she has a hard time getting around to it.”The essential flavor of the show has remained unchanged, despite its more serious bent. “I think the character is such a deeply ingrained creation of Mindy Kaling that it’s hard for her not to be consistent,” Fisher told HuffPost. “We all have absorbed that character in our bones at this point.” Season 5 of “The Mindy Project” opened with a typically flippant joke: The premiere episode dropped in the midst of election season, and was titled “Decision 2016.” It was about Mindy’s decision between two hot, white male love interests. The show barely touched the election, though other politically minded sitcoms did. Outside of the show, Barinholtz has suggested Mindy Lahiri might be a Trump voter ― and what about Morgan? “I could see him getting very easily fleeced by Jill Stein,” he suggested. “I could see him writing in someone, writing in, like, Cesar Millan, the Dog Whisperer.”After five seasons, “The Mindy Project” has never been more well-positioned to take on Trump-era politics. But how can the show make that funny? “Honestly… it’s just so sad,” said Barinholtz. “I think we had a joke last year where [Jody] was like, ‘And for the record, I think Donald Trump would be fun as president.’ That joke worked in like, October of 2016. In March or April of 2017, we’re seeing just how much has changed.” It’s not just the political context; the show has changed too. Perhaps making the Trump presidency funny in a sitcom universe is impossible, but “The Mindy Project” has a good shot.You can be highbrow. You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow?

4,WOMEN,Over 90 Organizations Demand Trump Administration Enforce Title IX In Powerful Letter,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/over-90-organizations-demand-trump-administration-enforce-title-ix-in-powerful-letter_us_58dd2325e4b08194e3b7cb05,“We will not rest until the rights and protections of all students are guaranteed.”,2017-03-31,"A Stanford student holds a sign reading ""rape is rape"" during 2016 graduation ceremonies.

Title IX is “a comprehensive federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity,” according to the United States Department of Justice. While Title IX is best known for demanding equal treatment of female and male student athletes, it also offers other important protections in areas including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and protections for trans and parenting students. Addressed to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the letter details specific requests including prevention programs for gender-based violence, implementing proper channels for survivors to get justice and protecting undocumented students from being targeted for their immigration status. The letter was released on Friday which the group is calling a national day of action in support of Title IX. The campaign titled #CantTrumpOurTitleIX will be accompanied by rallies on over a dozen college campuses across the country. “As students, faculty members, and advocates for survivors across the country, we strive each day to reduce instances of gender-based violence, yet the number of students who experience violence is still too high,” the letter begins. “Because it is our collective responsibility to work toward creating communities that will support survivors of violence, we urge you to strongly enforce Title IX.”The number of undergraduate college students who experience gender-based violence is astonishing: An estimated 24 percent of trans students, 23 percent of female students and 5.4 percent of male students report being sexually assaulted on campuses across the country.Emily Dunlap, a University of Kentucky student and organizer for the school’s Feminist Alliance, explained to The Huffington Post why her university’s Feminist Alliance program co-signed the letter.“We want all survivors of sexual assault to feel comfortable and be protected when reporting to the proper authorities,” Dunlap said. “We want to make sure survivors receive proper accommodations, both medical and educational, and do not feel punished in any way for coming forward; we want no report to go without an investigation.”Most of the organizations that co-signed the letter are feminist groups and/or anti-sexual violence programs on college campuses. Colleges and universities on the list include Columbia University, Duke University, Notre Dame, Louisiana State University, George Washington University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Kentucky and many more. Other national organizations outside of colleges include Trans Youth Equality Foundation, Safehouse Progressive Alliance for Nonviolence and One Billion Rising. “No student should experience gender-based violence, nor should schools ignore threats to a student’s safety or ability to learn,” the letter reads. “We will not rest until the rights and protections of all students, especially survivors of gender-based violence, are guaranteed.” The demands included in the letter are particularly relevant now, as the Trump administration has begun to roll back protections originally included in Title IX.In February, Trump announced that his administration will no longer bar schools from discriminating against trans students in K-12 schools and college campuses across the country. The level of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests in the past few weeks has also been unprecedented, with law enforcement detaining multiple undocumented college students in February. Just last week, a second year student at Columbia University sued the school for violating her rights under Title IX. Sarah Gutman, a Harvard Law student and member of the graduate program’s Harassment & Assault Law-Student Team, told HuffPost she hopes DeVos takes note of their demands.“We hope the administration, and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos in particular, realizes the fundamental importance of Title IX and its promise,” Gutman said. “Every student deserves equal access to education and that can only happen through the enforcement of Title IX.”Brandee Blocker, an organizer for No Red Tape and third-year law student at Columbia, told HuffPost she became involved in the anti-sexual violence organization after Columbia allegedly mishandled her sexual assault case in April 2015. When she joined No Red Tape in October 2015, Blocker says she felt empowered to call out the very systems that failed to bring her attacker to justice. Now, she’s leading the charge to demand that Title IX ― and all of its protections ― stay intact. “When universities fail to protect and adequately respond to these crimes, the impact reverberates beyond the incidents of sexual violence themselves, into students’ academic, economic, emotional, and physical lives and wellbeing,” Blocker told HuffPost.Blocker said she hopes the Trump administration is listening and acknowledges the 90-plus organizations demanding that Title IX be enforced. “By asserting the right to be free of gender-based discrimination and harassment early on,"" she said, ""college students are in the best position to create and promote a future world and culture, where sexual violence is not tolerated.”Read the full letter and list of demands here.

According to the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, root crops such as yam, taro, manioc, sweet potato are fundamental to the diet of Ni-Vanuatu for over 2000 years. Mr. Pakoa Leo, an agricultural expert and Coordinator of the Vanuatu Coastal Adaptation Project (VCAP) said that the crops are cultivated because of their ability to withstand weather extremes, diseases and pests. “But there are new challenges as a result of climate change and as a result some of the crops of sweet potato are not as resistant.”According to the Pacific Climate Change Science Program temperatures have increased for Vanuatu with annual maximum temperatures increased at a rate of 0.17°C per decade in Port Vila. The findings which were jointly researched by the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-hazard Department, Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) show a grim picture for Vanuatu. By 2030, under a high emissions scenario, this increase in temperature is projected to be in the range of 0.4–1.0°C. These will result in the rise of more hot days and warm nights and a decline in cooler weather. “Vanuatu crops have been impacted by climate change, with some varieties of taro and sweet potato now challenging to grow in certain areas,” said Leo. Higher carbon dioxide levels can affect crop yields. Factors such as changing temperatures, ozone, and water and nutrient constraints, have a direct impact in crop yields according to scientific research. According to the Leo, more extreme temperature and precipitation can prevent crops from growing and extreme events, especially floods and droughts, can harm crops and reduce yields. “It is becoming harder for farmers to rely on the same varieties of crops they have always planted, so we are experimenting with other varieties to ensure we get the most resistant crop for the current conditions,” he said.Leo and fellow experts from the Ministry of Agriculture in Vanuatu have been cross breeding over 50 varieties of sweet potato to see which will survive through prolong droughts. “We have used sweet potato from Solomon Islands, Fiji and other island along with Vanuatu varieties, to test which will be preferred by our farmers,” Leo said. The cross breeding has led to successfully identifying preferred varieties by farmers which can survive drought conditions. “Once we successfully cultivate a certain variety, we bring the farmers in to taste and select which they prefer, then we distribute them to the farmers for their use,” Leo said.The sweet potato takes three months to grow and Leo and his colleagues are constantly monitoring the crops.When Cyclone Pam hit Vanuatu in 2015 – the researchers had to start their experiments from scratch again as the facilities and crops they had developed were all damaged. “We have just rebuilt this greenhouse last year, and we are continuing with the work,” he said.Climate change will continue to have adverse impacts on the crops of Vanuatu, but for now, climate solutions are being developed by local experts to respond to the threats to the livelihoods of Ni-Vanuatus.The challenge however is not limited to Vanuatu - other Pacific islands are also facing food security issues as extreme weather conditions starts to impact stable crops.According to the World Food Programme, food availability, access, utilization and stability are all some of the issues caused by the adverse impacts of climate change.Climatic variability produced by more frequent and intense weather events can upset the stability of individuals’ and government food security strategies, creating fluctuations in food availability, access and use.For now, the work of people like Leo are integral to ensuring that at least for places like Vanuatu, that there are locally based climate solutions in place.

Masses of people in the Resistance movement must make it loud and clear that any Democratic Senator who votes to break the filibuster will face a primary challenge.This is the most consequential vote of the year in the Senate. Senators come and go, but Supreme Court Justices sit on the Court for decades.Gorsuch may be good looking and well spoken, but he’s a product of the hard right, pro-corporate, Koch-funded Federalist Society, that is also responsible for the other most right-wing Supreme Court Justices: John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and the late Antonin Scalia, who was Gorsuch’s mentor.If anything, Gorsuch may be to the even farther to the right than Scalia. A close look at his record shows him to be closely aligned with the Chamber of Commerce, the Federalist Society, and the Christian right.As a Supreme Court Justice, Gorsuch is likely to vote to further loosen remaining restrictions on campaign donations by billionaires and corporations, restrict voting rights, allow partisan gerrymandering, close the courthouse door to workers and consumers, overturn environmental and financial regulations, and make it more difficult for women to control their bodies and their health. .In addition, Gorsuch is being named to the seat that rightfully belonged to Merrick Garland, and he’s being appointed by a President whose campaign was assisted by Russia. Moreover, he’s backed by tens of millions of dollars in right-wing “dark money”.As Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said, if Republicans can’t get 60 votes for Gorsuch, they should change the nominee, not the rules. Schumer should enforce party discipline on any back-sliding Democratic Senator who votes to end the filibuster.Wavering Democratic Senators cannot be allowed to get away with voting to end a filibuster of Gorsuch.And this coming week, the Resistance movement must use every tactic in its book to be sure that they don’t."

And I bet you didn’t even know this was a problem. At the beginning of 2016, four female friends and I-- all experienced aid workers, some very senior professionals working for the United Nations and NGOs – began talking about experiences of gender-based discrimination, harassment, and abuse in our professional lives. We decided to see how much of our personal experiences was mirrored by other women across our industry. We put together a survey, sent it to everyone we knew and asked them to do the same, and over 1,000 women responded in 60 days. As it turned out our experiences were not unique, and the responses gathered collectively described systemic and frequent discrimination, harassment and even physical abuse in the work place. Top-line results indicated that:o 48% of humanitarian female workers have been touched in an unwanted way by a male colleague and 4% have been forced to have sexual relations by a male colleague.o 26% of women report that the experience of discrimination, harassment or sexual assault had a medium to strong impact on the course of their career – 16% quit their jobs and 7% left the humanitarian field altogether.o 69% of women who experienced sexual harassment did not report it officially.o 51% of women feel their organization does not do everything in its power to make them feel safe as a woman.I always knew that my workplace sometimes mirrored a bad episode of Mad Men, but I didn’t realize others experienced the same and, in some instances, worse. And here we were, all suffering in silence. Our first question was, how was it that a system designed to help others was failing to help its own? And second, how is it that no one knew about this? The more things change, the more they stay the sameHumanitarian aid work involves going to very dangerous places, including war zones or natural disaster areas, during or immediately after a calamity strikes. Hence, in our industry, interaction with military and security personnel is frequent, conditions are tough and salaries are high, so this is largely the recipe for a male-dominated industry. While the number of women in the humanitarian industry has grown over the past three decades, their stories don’t seem to change much. Whether speaking to women about their experiences in the Balkans response in the 1990s, or in The Sudan in the 2000s, or in the Ebola response of last year, we hear variations on the same themes, namely, discrimination, harassment, and abuse of our female colleagues by their male co-workers. Until we change something fundamental about our industry, these stories will persist.The ResponseThe IASC has taken the first and very important step of recognizing that the aid system has a problem with how it treats its female workforce. The Zero Tolerance statement indicates that “Everyone has the right to live their lives free from discrimination, sexual harassment and abuse, including in the workplace” and that the “[IASC] will redouble [its] efforts to ensure that all… staff are aware of, and comply with, their rights to, and their responsibilities in maintaining, a workplace free of discrimination, harassment or abuse.” While women are not the only ones experiencing harassment and assault, this is an issue that disproportionately affects us. With this statement, Stephen O’Brien, the UN’s Relief Chief, and his colleagues at the IASC have acknowledged that women in aid deserve better than what we are experiencing now— and this is a critical first step.Doing our Part So now that the IASC has acknowledged that there is a serious problem in our industry, what can we do to encourage this effort forward and turn it from a statement into action? We organize ourselves amongst ourselves. Ladies in the aid sector are just one of a growing number of women-led initiatives across all professions demanding our fair shot. Movements across the world reveal a growing resistance to the status quo, including the most recent outing of systemic discrimination, harassment and abuse of female professionals in Silicon Valley. The Women’s March on Washington showed our strength in numbers. Now, women at the top of their professions should organize across industries to develop a platform to contribute to that momentum.Let’s Talk We are not alone and we are no longer silent, so let’s speak to each other. This post is a call to women around the world already part of a movement or keen to get involved. Let’s work together to build our base and develop our platform. Let’s pool our data and see where we have similarities or differences. Let’s share what has worked in reforming our respective industries and what has not. Let’s share pitfalls and opportunities on this long road to gender equality that I sincerely believe letter is well within our grasp.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) announced Thursday that he will vote for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, making him the first Democrat to announce support for President Donald Trump’s court pick.“Senators have a constitutional obligation to advice and consent on a nominee to fill this Supreme Court vacancy and, simply put, we have a responsibility to do our jobs as elected officials,” Manchin said in a statement. “After considering his record, watching his testimony in front of the Judiciary Committee and meeting with him twice, I will vote to confirm him to be the ninth justice on the Supreme Court.”He noted that Gorsuch, who is currently a judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, has received praise from Democrats and Republicans.“He has been consistently rated as a well-qualified jurist, the highest rating a jurist can receive, and I have found him to be an honest and thoughtful man,” Manchin said. “I hold no illusions that I will agree with every decision Judge Gorsuch may issue in the future, but I have not found any reasons why this jurist should not be a Supreme Court Justice.” Minutes later, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) announced that she will vote for Gorsuch too.“He has a record as a balanced, meticulous and well-respect jurist who understands the rule of law,” Heitkamp said in a statement. “During our meeting and at his hearing, he reinforced the importance of a judiciary that remains independent of the executive and legislative branches of government ― and that acts as a proper check and balance on the other two branches of government. I expect him to follow through on that critical tenet.”Gorsuch’s Senate confirmation vote is set for Friday, April 7. Democrats have largely lined up against him and plan to filibuster him, meaning they’ll require that his nomination get 60 votes in order to advance. Republicans have signaled they’re prepared to change the Senate rules to get rid of the 60-vote requirement in retaliation. It’s messy. "

Private prison contractors run both facilities as for-profit enterprises.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dd56b61d0000f42c7d16ef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas ― Republican state senators took a first step toward licensing two controversial family detention centers as child care facilities on Wednesday, selling the possible change as a way to keep the Trump administration from splitting up immigrant mothers and children at the border.  At a hearing of the Texas Senate’s Veterans Affairs and Border Security Committee, Republicans said a bill relaxing standards for child care licenses would help the family detention centers skirt problems posed by ongoing lawsuits.But critics ― including legal groups, members of the Catholic Church and immigrant rights advocates ― described family detention centers as little more than “baby jails.” Citing the fact that most of the mothers and children in detention are Central Americans fleeing violence who apply for asylum, they say there’s no need for family detention centers at all. A Honduran woman named Norma who spent more than a month detained at the Karnes County Residential Center told the committee her daughter turned 5 while locked up there. “My daughter knew she was a prisoner,” Norma said. “I don’t think that a place full of cameras and security guards is a place for children.” Reed Smith ― the regional vice president of GEO Group, the private prison contractor that runs the Karnes facility where Norma was detained as a for-profit enterprise ― praised the bill. He insinuated that failing to approve it would force the company to convert Karnes into a detention center for adults, leading the Trump administration to separate asylum-seeking mothers from their children at the border. “There’s nothing in the immigration laws that says the mother and the children have to be housed together,” Smith told the committee. “There would be nowhere to put the children together [with their parents].” Republican members of the committee heeded the warning, describing the bill as a humanitarian measure. “What we are trying to avoid is the potential to have parents separated from their children,” state Sen. Donna Campbell said.But opponents, who have long questioned the need for any family detention, viewed Reed’s comments as a threat. Several who testified pointed to GEO Group’s own 2016 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that described Karnes as a “short-term processing facility” seeking a child care license only to “allow for longer lengths of stay.”“Texas should not be complicit in pretending that baby jails are licensed child care facilities,” Astrid Dominguez, an immigration expert with the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, told the committee.The Department of Homeland Security is likely keeping close tabs on the bill’s progress. Some 1,500 miles away on Wednesday, DHS Secretary John Kelly met with Democratic lawmakers and made only vague remarks about whether he’s still considering splitting up mothers and children at the border.The Obama administration hastily expanded the all-but-abandoned family detention policy back in 2014, as tens of thousands of Central American migrants crossed into the United States. Two family immigrant detention centers, both run by private prison contractors, currently operate in Texas. But the policy of detaining mothers with their children for extended periods has prompted lawsuits.U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee ruled in 2015 that locking up immigrant children with their mothers violated the Flores settlement, which requires children to be detained in non-secure facilities and generally favors their release. The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services issued emergency rules that year to reclassify the state’s detention centers as “child care” facilities under state law to help them comply with the ruling.But in a case brought by former detainees and the activist group Grassroots Leadership, a state judge later ruled that family detention centers simply don’t fit the definition of a child care facility under Texas law.The bill, filed in late February by Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes, specifies that family detention centers can be licensed as child care facilities without meeting all the state’s requirements.Like the GEO Group, GOP lawmakers argue that without the licenses, the family detention centers would eventually have to be converted into adult immigrant detention centers, leaving nowhere to put families.In fact, both family detention centers in Texas currently operate without licenses. To comply with the federal ruling, most women and children are released after three weeks. And authorities wouldn’t actually have to separate mothers and children at the border if the family detention centers became adult facilities. Nothing in immigration law requires them to be detained at all. In practice, many of the undocumented women and children apprehended by authorities never see the inside of a detention center after crossing into the United States. Instead, they receive a notice to appear in immigration court and fight their cases from outside detention. Most of them petition for asylum or some other permission to stay in the United States for humanitarian reasons. In December, for example, more than 16,000 mothers and their children crossed into the United States, according to Customs and Border Protection. The three family detention centers the federal government operates have a combined capacity of fewer than 4,000 beds. (Like the two Texas facilities, the third center in Pennsylvania also lacks a child care license.)“It’s crucial for you to understand that family detention is not necessary,” Manoj Govindaiah, the director of family detention services with the legal group RAICES, told the committee. It’s unclear whether issuing child care licenses will resolve the centers’ ongoing legal problems.

11,POLITICS,New York State Inches Closer To Single-Payer Plan With Pickup Of New Support,"Ryan Grim, Daniel Marans, and Jeffrey Young",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-idc-single-payer-health-care_us_58dd34c6e4b0e6ac709300e1,But critics wonder whether the additional backing is merely symbolic.,2017-03-30,"New York State Sen. Jeffrey Klein, leader of the breakaway Independent Democratic Caucus, has announced his support for a single-payer health insurance bill.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dd36d72c00002000ff1594.jpeg?cache=57atJNubPm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The push to implement a “Medicare for all”-type system in New York state just took a significant step forward Wednesday. Sen. Jeffrey Klein, who heads the Independent Democratic Conference in the state Senate, plans to co-sponsor the measure, and will bring along the remaining holdout in his caucus, his spokeswoman Candice Giove told The Huffington Post.That gives the measure the unanimous support of the IDC, a crucial, and often recalcitrant, bloc of lawmakers. “All members of the independent conference will become cosponsors of that bill,” Giove said.In a statement, Klein cited President Donald Trump’s attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the protections it provides as a reason he is backing the creation of a single-payer health insurance system in New York.“A single-payer system would create the peace of mind that residents could have access to quality medical care including outpatient and inpatient medical care, primary and preventive care, prescription drugs and laboratory tests,” Klein said.The New York Senate is a strange place. With 63 seats, 32 senators are needed for a majority. Republicans have only 31, but an additional Democrat, Sen. Simcha Felder, caucuses with Republicans, giving them control of the chamber. Meanwhile, the eight members of the IDC do not caucus with the rest of the Democrats.Sen. Michael Gianaris, the deputy leader of the state Senate’s mainstream Democratic conference, welcomed the IDC’s support, even as he lamented that their collaboration with Republicans helped prevent the bill’s passage.“It’s nice that they are putting their names on the bill, but their partners in government are the ones with the power to prevent it from seeing the light of day,” Gianaris said.Although Republicans have the majority without the IDC, thanks to Felder, Gianaris believes the breakaway caucus has made the problem worse.“With the Democrats being divided in the Senate, we lose the ability to pressure Felder to come back or grow the conference in other ways, because we’re too busy dealing with each other,” Gianaris said.But the support of the IDC is a critical development in the push for single-payer health care, as the state assembly is expected to easily pass its version of the bill in April or May, said one of the bill’s lead backers, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, who represents the northwest Bronx.The New York Assembly, the state’s lower legislative chamber, passed the same measure in 2015 and 2016, but it wasn’t considered in the state Senate, which Republicans control with the support of the Independent Democratic Caucus.Despite being within striking distance of passing the single-payer bill in the New York Senate, victory for its proponents seems unlikely given GOP opposition. Rallies are planned in support of single-payer health care in New York City Saturday and Albany, the state capital, Tuesday.It is not clear why IDC members chose this time to get behind legislation introduced by Sen. Gustavo Rivera, a member of the mainstream Senate Democratic caucus ― particularly since Republican control of the chamber forecloses the bill’s passage.  There are signs that the IDC is feeling pressure from a progressive Democratic base newly energized by Trump’s election. Over 100 protesters booed Sen. Jose Peralta for his IDC membership outside a February town hall in Queens. Anti-IDC activists have even formed their own group, “No IDC NY,” to oppose the renegade Democrats. “The IDC has been feeling enormous pressure since the inauguration from voters in their districts who were shocked to find out the Democrats they elected have been propping up Trump Republicans in the state Senate,” Bill Lipton, the Working Families Party’s New York director, said in a statement. “Now they’re backing legislation that their own support of Republican leadership ensures will never even make it to the floor. That’s the height of cynicism and just more evidence of the heat they are feeling from the resistance.”Whatever the outcome in New York, the failure of President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with an alternate plan that would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 24 million has given a boost to progressives seeking to go beyond Obamacare.Legislators in California have launched a new push to implement a single-payer program in the most populous state in the nation, although Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown has expressed misgivings about its cost. The Affordable Care Act contains a provision that would allow states to make sweeping changes to their health care markets, including instituting a single-payer program that would replace the current private system, so long as the state programs cover as many people with equivalent benefits at no additional cost to the federal government. Vermont worked for several years after the Affordable Care Act’s passage to design a single-payer program, but abandoned the effort over its expense. Excluding the IDC, the mainstream Democrats hold 22 seats in the New York state Senate and will soon hold 23 once a special election is held in a Democratic district.But even with all mainstream Democrats and the IDC on board, they would remain one vote short, meaning Democrats need to either pick up a seat before 2018, persuade a Republican or win the chamber outright in 2018. This being New York, a Republican senator was coincidentally indicted just last week, so it’s always possible a new seat could become available.If not, said Dinowitz, his hope is that the newfound energy among grassroots Democrats can translate into some Senate seat pickups in 2018. “We need to add one more person. I believe the only way to get to 32 is through the election process,” Dinowitz said. “There is a lot of energy now in my area and other areas. Meetings are attracting huge numbers of people, and a lot of people are coming out, most of whom have never been involved in this way. If it’s sustained it could really change the dynamics of the elections come 2018.”Controlling the chamber is also crucial because the party in power controls the floor schedule. Even if Democrats persuaded a Republican to sign on, they’d need to similarly persuade the Republican leadership to allow a vote.Dinowitz said that groups affiliated with Indivisible, a grassroots activism network that arose after the election, have been particularly active on the single-payer issue, and that in meetings with new activists, the number one issue they care about is health care, followed closely by immigration.“In the wake of Trump being elected, the issue of health care has moved to the top of the agenda for a lot of people. If people think we can rest on our laurels because repeal of Obamacare collapsed, they’re mistaken. Obamacare was a compromise of a compromise,” Dinowitz said, noting that not only was it not the single-payer system many prefer, but the public option was traded away.If both California and New York can implement a single-payer heath care system in the next few years, he added, something like a fifth of the country will be covered just by those two states."

While that means change for a host of issues, we’re here to talk about chocolate. Because of Brexit, Cadbury must raise its prices or shrink the size of its goods, according to Glenn Caton, the president of the northern Europe division of Mondelēz International (a U.S. food and drink corporation that owns Cadbury, which has employees in the U.K.). In a recent interview with The Guardian, Caton said the company will “put the consumer at the heart and never compromise on quality and taste,” in order to keep the chocolate the same. Already though, Cadbury has raised the prices of its beloved Freddo chocolate frogs by 20 percent, which Mondelēz International attributed to rising commodity costs, the falling value of the pound since the Brexit vote last year and an increase in cocoa prices. There’s also an increasing cost to do business with other countries.“There are obviously challenges and there are three things that we really care about in the context of the Brexit negotiations. First of all is making sure we have a stable and thriving U.K. economy,” Canton said. “If the economy is growing all businesses benefit from that. The second is ensuring that there is no new, more complex regulation and that there is free movement of goods and minimal barriers to trade. Regulation impacts complexity, complexity impacts costs, as do trade barriers and tariffs.” Fiona Dawson, global president of Mars, recently told the American Chamber of Commerce to the EU that under Brexit, tariffs on chocolate could be as high as 30 percent. That means extremely high prices for consumers. “The absence of hard borders [in Europe] with all their attendant tariff, customs and non-tariff barriers allows for this integrated supply chain, which helps to keep costs down,” Dawson said, according to BBC. “The return of those barriers would create higher costs which would threaten that supply chain and the jobs that come with it.”Mondelēz International, which also owns Toblerone, already experienced a barrage of criticism back in October, when it announced that it was changing the iconic shape of its chocolate. The company made the triangles on Toblerone bars narrower and widened the gap between peaks. At the time, the company said the high cost of ingredients, not Brexit, was responsible for the change in the chocolate bar’s shape. Below is a picture comparing the difference in the original bar (top) and what it looks like after the changes: "

At least not today.The high court on Wednesday confronted complicated First Amendment issues when it ruled on a puzzling New York law that penalizes merchants that tell customers they’ll be charged higher fees for using credit cards. But the justices sidestepped the final question by punting the case back to the lower court.So-called “swipe” surcharges, imposed by some small businesses on people who pay with plastic, are not uncommon. New York has a law that explicitly bans such surcharges. It does not, however, prohibit discounts for people who pay with cash.A group of shops challenged the measure as unconstitutional because it limits their speech. They argue that the law effectively prevents them from informing customers that they have two options — paying with cash, which is cheaper, or using a credit card, which will cost more.The Supreme Court, in a decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts, concluded that the New York law regulates the speech of shop owners because it directs how they may or may not communicate prices to their customers. It does nothing to actually set price controls, which the government has the power to do.Using dollars and cents, Roberts explained how the New York scheme plays out in the real world.“A merchant who wants to charge $10 for cash and $10.30 for credit may not convey that price any way he pleases,” Roberts wrote. “He is not free to say ‘$10, with a 3% credit card surcharge’ or ‘$10, plus $0.30 for credit’ because both of those displays identify a single sticker price — $10 — that is less than the amount credit card users will be charged.”“Instead,” Roberts wrote, “if the merchant wishes to post a single sticker price, he must display $10.30 as his sticker price.”Precisely because the New York law doesn’t allow businesses to be transparent and advertise both the lower and the higher price, the court concluded that it’s not “like a typical price regulation” and thus the First Amendment should apply.But the justices didn’t take the last step in Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman and decide what should happen to the law. Instead, they sent the case back to the federal appeals court to determine whether the law is constitutional.Confused yet? Justice Stephen Breyer, who during oral argument had expressed concern that weaponizing the First Amendment in this area might encourage judges to become price regulators, wrote a separate opinion agreeing with the majority’s result. But he emphasized that the law’s “operation is unclear” and that New York’s top state court may be best equipped to determine what it means.He also cautioned that “it is wiser” not to get too hung up on what exactly the government is trying to regulate in any given case. “But that is because virtually all government regulation affects speech,” Breyer wrote. “Human relations take place through speech. And human relations include community activities of all kinds — commercial and otherwise.”Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined in an usual pairing by Justice Samuel Alito, also wrote separately to concur in the result. But she argued that the main ruling didn’t do enough and would leave the issue bouncing around in the lower courts.“This quarter-loaf outcome is worse than none,” she wrote.Sotomayor said that she too would have asked New York’s highest court to clarify exactly what this “elusive” law does. But she preferred that the Supreme Court do that in the first place, “rather than contribute to the piecemeal resolution of this case.”A spokeswoman for Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said that the state respects the court’s ruling and that they would continue to defend the credit card surcharge law in the lower courts."

They’re demanding that President Donald Trump put forward a new nominee. Republicans, eager to fill a court seat they held open for Trump for a year, are signaling they may retaliate by changing the rules so it only takes 51 votes to advance a Supreme Court nominee, which would shut Democrats out of the process entirely.This doesn’t sound like the chamber of Congress that traditionally prides itself on collegiality and bipartisanship.As senators gird for this fight, they don’t feel very good about what they’re doing to the Senate. Even the prospect of getting rid of the filibuster rule for Supreme Court nominees has them on edge. The whole point of the rule is to force both parties to reach a consensus on important matters. It’s how the Senate proudly differentiates itself from the House, where a simple majority rules. Democrats nixed the filibuster rule for lower-court nominees in 2013 (to the ire of Republicans), but it still takes 60 votes to advance a Supreme Court nominee and to pass bills.If Democrats hold their ground on Gorsuch, and Republicans get rid of the filibuster rule to confirm him, lawmakers in both parties worry it’s a slippery slope toward eliminating the filibuster rule altogether.“Lets face it: We’re one hair away from doing the same thing on legislation,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). “Both parties have helped take us on this downward spiral.”“We can turn the Senate into the House of Representatives with six-year terms. Does that really benefit anybody?” grumbled Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.).Gorsuch’s confirmation vote is set for April 7, and his fate is coming down to eight votes. There are 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats (including two independent senators who caucus with them), meaning Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) needs to find eight Democrats willing to vote with Republicans. For the moment, McConnell doesn’t appear to have those votes. That’s where the “nuclear option” comes in. Republicans can go around the 60-vote requirement by using a rarely invoked procedural maneuver to change the rules, so it would only take 51 votes for move forward. They could confirm Gorsuch by doing this, but down the road, it means whichever party is in the majority can confirm a Supreme Court nominee without needing any votes from the minority.That’s a “seismic” change, warned Sen.

The former first daughter did not address the rumors in recent months, instead focusing on her role as an activist and leader of the Clinton Foundation.In an interview with Variety released on Wednesday, she made it very clear that she had no immediate plans to follow in the footsteps of her parents, former President Bill Clinton and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.“I really am constantly surprised by the stories of me running for, fill in the blank—Congress, Senate, City Council, the presidency,” Clinton told the magazine. “I really find this all rather hysterical, because I’ve been asked this question a lot throughout my life, and the answer has never changed.”She said she thinks people wanting to run for office should ask themselves if they have a vision and could do a better job.But she added, “If someone steps down or something changes, I’ll then ask and answer those questions at that time. But right now, no, I’m not running for public office.” Clinton announced this month that she had written a children’s book called She Persisted.

20,POLITICS,Chuck Schumer Warns GOP Not To Change The Rules To Confirm Neil Gorsuch,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/schumer-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate-filibuster_us_58dc0767e4b0e6ac7091d047,"The Senate change would have a ""seismic impact"" on future Supreme Court confirmations.",2017-03-30,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) says Republicans will regret it if they change the rules to require 51 votes, instead of 60, to confirm Supreme Court nominees.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dc07d02c00002100ff1270.jpeg?ops=crop_189_0_2811_1869%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As Democrats cement their opposition to Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, it’s increasingly looking like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will have to go “nuclear” to get him confirmed. That is, change the Senate rules to require 51 votes, instead of 60, to advance a Supreme Court nominee.On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned Republicans against going that route, saying that they’ll regret it in the long term, and that the better option is to demand a more mainstream nominee from President Donald Trump.“They’re acting as if a rules change is inevitable, like it’s their only choice if 60 senators don’t agree Judge Gorsuch should be confirmed. They’re wrong,” Schumer said at a press conference. “The answer is not to change the rules. It’s to change the nominee.”Democrats argue that Gorsuch, currently a judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, is too beholden to corporate interests to be a fair Supreme Court justice. Progressive advocacy groups have been torching Gorsuch, too, highlighting his record of opposing reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, civil rights, workers’ rights, immigrants’ rights and environmental protections.“He was handpicked by special interests, is supported by special interests and has a record of siding with special interests,” Schumer said. “This is no down-the-middle, neutral judge.”But their criticisms haven’t slowed GOP momentum around Gorsuch’s confirmation. His Senate vote is on track for Friday, April 7, and McConnell has exuded confidence that he will be confirmed.“We are optimistic that they will not be successful in keeping this good man from joining the Supreme Court very soon,” McConnell said Tuesday.It may not be that simple. McConnell needs to cobble together 60 votes so Gorsuch can clear a filibuster. There are 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats (including two independent senators who caucus with them), meaning he will need eight Democrats to vote with Republicans. For the moment, the Senate leader doesn’t appear to have those votes.That’s where the “nuclear option” comes in. Republicans can go around the 60-vote requirement by using this rarely invoked procedural step to change the rules, so it would only take 51 votes to move forward on a Supreme Court nominee. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took this step in 2013, when, in the face of ongoing GOP obstruction of President Barack Obama’s lower court nominees, Democrats changed the rules to require 51 votes for them. But they left the 60-vote requirement in place for the Supreme Court.The question is whether Republicans have it in them to make a rules change that could permanently alter the Supreme Court confirmation process. It would take 51 Republicans to agree to make the change. Some don’t like the idea of eroding the institution of the Senate, which, unlike the House, specifically has rules like this to require bipartisanship and consensus. Others worry such a change could come back to bite them when Democrats regain the majority and a Supreme Court vacancy opens up.Schumer is hoping those concerns will weigh heavily on GOP senators. “If they decide to change the rules, it will be on their back,” he said.Republicans are publicly signaling they’re prepared to do whatever it takes to get Gorsuch through. Even moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) has suggested she’d go along with a rules change. Privately, though, GOP senators may be more uneasy about it.“I’ve had conversations with them. They certainly have strong reservations about it for all the the obvious reasons,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told The Huffington Post. “They certainly know the institutional seismic impact that this change in rules would have for future generations of Senate colleagues.”The path ahead for Gorsuch is still a guessing game. McConnell may find eight Democrats willing to vote with Republicans to get to 60 votes. That would avoid the specter of a rules change. Or, Democrats may decide to present a united front and deny McConnell 60 votes, which would put pressure on him to change the rules and require nearly all Republicans to agree to change a rule they like.Either way, it’s about to get messy."

(Note: “Stand for Rights” is being held in partnership with The Huffington Post and Funny or Die.) That second event, “All Star Deportation Jamboree,” will similarly feature celebrities, but will also raise money for the International Rescue Committee.“The ACLU is doing the thankless job of defending the rights of people that have been deported, of immigrants,” Mandvi said. “And this work is so necessary right now and it’s so important. These people are sort of on the front lines of fighting for the victims of these deportations and Trump’s policy around immigrants.Amid protests against travel bans, the ACLU has recently earned more attention and donations than is typical for the organization, raising $24 million in a single January weekend. At the Oscars in February, many nominees wore blue ribbons to support the non-profit.Mandvi told Variety in January that he believes protests will keep happening to resist Trump. When asked whether he feels his upcoming events are a part of that movement of protest, Mandvi responded, “I think it’s less about Trump personally as it is about, giving these people the tools and the money that they need in order to do their job effectively.”For his event at City Winery, Mandvi said that he extended an invitation to the president.“We actually invited him. He’s not going to come. But I would love him to. I’ll tweet out at him.”After the election, Mandvi wrote a New York Times op-ed expressing his frustration that the president was attacking groups such as artists and journalists rather than hate groups.“My op-ed that I wrote for The New York Times is really about how the anger and outrage that he seems to have for ‘SNL’ and the cast of ‘Hamilton’ and, you know, a ninth grader somewhere that tweets something about him or whatever,” Mandvi said. “That outrage could be directed at actual Nazis and hate groups. I was sort of making the point that there doesn’t seem to be the equal level of outrage against actual people who are perpetrating prejudice or racism and hatred.”In Mandvi’s view, the events he’s a part of aren’t so much about opposing any political figure as they are about raising support for the “organizations that are fighting for [people’s] rights.”“Ultimately this is going to come down to, like, who can fight the hardest,” he said.Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks, Tracy Morgan, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Moore, Padma Lakshmi and a whole host of other stars are teaming up for Stand for Rights: A Benefit for the ACLU.

The murder suspect was a white man, charged with committing an act of terrorism in Caughman’s fatal stabbing.On Sunday, Sikh journalist Angad Singh stood in the middle of Times Square with a message of grief and anger that such a thing would happen in the city he calls home.“In New York City ― in our city ― hate crimes are up 24 percent in just the last year,” Singh said to those gathered. “I believe hate crimes come from ignorance, from fear. So I’m here in front of you to challenge that today.”James Harris Jackson, 28, was indicted Monday on one count each of first- and second-degree murder as an act of terrorism for the March 20 stabbing of Timothy Caughman, 66. Authorities said Jackson came to New York from Baltimore to kill as many black men as he could.The incident carried frightening echoes to the killing of nine members of the historically black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church during a Bible study in 2015. In that attack, too, the suspect admitted to wanting to kill black people.As a member of a minority group often falsely profiled and attacked over the perception of its alignment with extremist views, Singh knows better than most the perils of racial and religious prejudice.“If a Muslim, or someone who ‘looked like me’ had slayed an innocent person in the streets of New York ― especially if that person had been white ― I believe the whole United States would’ve been crying ‘jihad,’ and this would still be trending in the news,” Singh told The Huffington Post. “I believe the outrage this event called for is not present. I believe the discussion on the issue of domestic terrorism is not happening as loudly as it should in my country.”In a powerful statement of solidarity, Singh tied his turban in front of those gathered in Times Square to honor Caughman’s life. For many Sikhs, the turban is a sacred article of faith and a symbol of equality. “Every day I know when I put this turban on my head I’m putting myself in hate’s way. But I’m not scared to do so because for me putting my turban on is the most American thing I can do,” Singh said.Watch the powerful video below:"

In 2014, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called for the legalization and regulation of sports wagering nationwide. Last month, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said his league is re-evaluating its position on legal gambling.Now, Sin City will be home to franchises in the other two major leagues, as the Raiders will join the National Hockey League’s Vegas Golden Knights, an expansion franchise that will begin play next season.Gambling advocates and gaming law experts see the NFL’s decision to join the NHL in Vegas as a potentially significant moment for sports gambling ― one that highlights the broader acceptance of the practice and could provide momentum for the growing movement to legalize and regulate it.“It’s a pretty big symbolic breakthrough,” said I. Nelson Rose, a professor at Whittier Law School and gaming law expert who has advised governments and the industry. “The sports leagues used to be unified against anything that could conceivably lead to betting on sports.”The question is whether that symbolism is powerful enough to help pave the way for legalization. In Washington, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) hopes it will. Pallone, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees regulatory issues in sports, introduced legislation last year to roll back PASPA and called on the NFL to join him in the effort after Monday’s vote.“This move is a clear sign that the league owners’ attitudes toward sports betting has changed,” Pallone said in a statement. “I hope that following today’s vote, I can count on the support of the NFL and the NFL team owners for my efforts to legalize and regulate sports betting.”He may have to wait awhile for a friendly response.Even before NFL owners voted on the move, Commissioner Roger Goodell attempted to quash the idea that the Raiders’ relocation plans marked a change in how his league sees gambling.“We are not changing our position as it relates to legalized sports gambling,” Goodell told The MMQB. “We still don’t think it is a positive thing.”New Jersey state Sen. Ray Lesniak (D), though, doesn’t need the NFL’s help advancing legislation in Congress.In 2012, Lesniak led the push to legalize sports gambling at New Jersey’s casinos and racetracks. All four major leagues and the NCAA immediately challenged the law that he sponsored and that Republican Gov. Chris Christie signed. The leagues argued it violated PASPA, and the law was defeated in federal court.When New Jersey took another crack at it in 2014, the leagues won in court again. The state is now appealing its case to the Supreme Court, and in January the court asked the U.S. solicitor general to weigh in on the fight, an unexpected development considering most legal observers thought justices would decline to hear the case (which they may still do).Lesniak, who is now seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, sees the Raiders’ move to Las Vegas as a boost for the state’s case. The government has traditionally supported the four sports leagues’ position on PASPA, but Lesniak said Monday that he was preparing a letter to the solicitor general’s office to argue that having a team in Las Vegas helps invalidate its core opposition to legal gambling.“It’s very, very, very difficult now to argue that legalized sports betting undermines the integrity of the game,” Lesniak told The Huffington Post.To Lesniak, the NFL’s actions on gambling render its words on the subject almost meaningless. He points to other embraces of gambling that, at this point, make the NFL’s public opposition border on hypocrisy. The NFL has benefited from gambling, it knows it has benefited from gambling and everyone else knows it has benefited from gambling.The league eagerly embraced fantasy football as a way to help drive interest in its sport ― and while fantasy sports aren’t considered gambling under federal law, that’s because of the NFL, which lobbied Congress for a “carve out” in gaming laws that kept them separate from traditional gambling, and thus legal.The NFL has a similarly symbiotic relationship with daily fantasy sports, which have further blurred the lines between fantasy games and actual sports gambling. At least 28 NFL teams have partnered with daily fantasy companies, and the league didn’t back away from the industry even as its murky legal status came under scrutiny in states and in Congress last year (the league claims it does not view daily fantasy games as gambling).In 2012, the NFL lifted its ban on casino advertisements in stadiums. Five years prior, it began playing annual games in London, where sports gambling is legal. It expanded its London schedule to four games last season and has invested in a stadium there to host future games. NFL owners publicly share their desires to have a franchise in London sooner rather than later.A team in Vegas “is the final straw” in the NFL’s argument that gambling poses a threat to its game, Lesniak said.Rose believes it’s “too late” to save the New Jersey case. But, the law professor said, New Jersey’s fight could embolden efforts to legalize sports wagering at the state level: Pennsylvania, Maryland and Michigan are already considering such legislation.If those become law, they will likely run into challenges under PASPA, too. But added to its past moves toward gambling, the NFL’s entrance into Las Vegas could make it hard for the league to clearly articulate to a court why exactly it opposes legalized sports betting, said Daniel Wallach, a Florida-based attorney and gaming law expert, especially given its earlier embraces of gaming.“It’s going to be more difficult for the leagues to continue to argue in court that sports betting undermines their games,” Wallach said. “They can no longer claim that they would be irreparably harmed by betting on sporting events when they are participating in that activity and are directly involved in supporting it.”“The next time a state tries to legalize sports betting,” Wallach said, it will have “an even more powerful argument concerning the leagues’ hypocrisy than New Jersey ever possessed.”Aside from legal fights and legislative battles, the presence of major professional sports in Las Vegas for the first time should go a long way toward showing leagues like the NFL that legalized and regulated gambling serves them better than the alternative, said Jennifer Roberts, the associate director of the International Center for Gaming Regulation at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.“It will highlight how highly regulated our environment for sports wagering is, that it’s able to maintain the integrity of the sport, and provide for responsible gaming and consumer protections,” Roberts told HuffPost. “Sports wagering is going to happen. So it’s better to happen in a regulated environment.”Goodell hinted at that in a Tuesday press conference, saying that the league likely won’t try to keep Vegas sports books from taking bets on Raiders games, “in large part because you have the regulatory environment there, which actually could be beneficial in this case.”The federal prohibition on sports gambling, Roberts noted, hasn’t stopped the practice from flourishing. Though exact figures are impossible to come by, Americans illegally wager an estimated $80 billion to $380 billion a year on sporting events.That’s a huge potential market ― one the league will now see up close every Sunday ― and nothing changes the NFL’s opinion on any given subject like cash. The allure of money is how the NFL got in bed with daily fantasy sports companies and what ultimately landed the Raiders in Vegas. And in the end, it might be what finally convinces Goodell to complete the NFL’s shift on gambling, too."

So it’s better to happen in a regulated environment.”Goodell hinted at that in a Tuesday press conference, saying that the league likely won’t try to keep Vegas sports books from taking bets on Raiders games, “in large part because you have the regulatory environment there, which actually could be beneficial in this case.”The federal prohibition on sports gambling, Roberts noted, hasn’t stopped the practice from flourishing. Though exact figures are impossible to come by, Americans illegally wager an estimated $80 billion to $380 billion a year on sporting events.That’s a huge potential market ― one the league will now see up close every Sunday ― and nothing changes the NFL’s opinion on any given subject like cash. The allure of money is how the NFL got in bed with daily fantasy sports companies and what ultimately landed the Raiders in Vegas. And in the end, it might be what finally convinces Goodell to complete the NFL’s shift on gambling, too."

Billy is a person of color who has autism, a move director Dean Israelite said was “important” to ensure his take on the popular franchise was diverse. Israelite told Teen Vogue he wanted to show the impact of Billy and his abilities on his team of fellow Rangers.“We wanted to take a character like Billy and celebrate those abilities and manifest in a movie the idea that without Billy and without the qualities he has, this team would never be victorious,” he said.Along with having a character with autism, “Power Rangers” features a queer superhero, played by singer and actress Becky G. Since the film debuted on March 24, many fans took note of Billy’s disorder and shared their praise online. At the movie’s premiere, screenplay writer John Gatins explained to Variety the motivation behind its characters and said that the creators kept in mind the sort of social issues teens face now, including “the LGBTQ community, the autism spectrum, cyber bullying and social media.”“I feel like, it’s 2017 and we need to reflect 2017,” he said. In another huge win for representation, “Sesame Street” announced earlier this month that its Muppet with autism, Julia, would make her TV debut.The character’s puppeteer, Stacey Gordon, said she wished Julia had been around for her son with autism when he was younger to let him know that playing “in a different way” is OK. Similarly, Israelite told Teen Vogue he hopes Billy will let others with autism know that “they too can be superheroes metaphorically.”The HuffPost Parents newsletter, So You Want To Raise A Feminist, offers the latest stories and news in progressive parenting.

Last month, PricewaterhouseCoopers took full responsibility for giving actor Warren Beatty the wrong envelope to announce the final and most prestigious award of the night.The mix-up led to massive confusion with Beatty’s co-presenter Faye Dunaway incorrectly awarding “La La Land” as the Best Picture winner, instead of “Moonlight.” Pictures surfaced showing PwC accountant Brian Cullinan, who was responsible for giving Beatty the wrong envelope, breaching protocol minutes before handing over the results to post a photo of actress Emma Stone to Twitter. Since the debacle, the firm removed Cullinan and colleague Martha Ruiz from all Oscars-related dealings. PwC has been the official Oscar ballot counter for the past 83 years.After a board meeting Tuesday night, the first in-person gathering since the blunder, the group decided to keep PwC as its accounting firm with necessary changes, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Going forward, a third person will be added to the team of accountants that manage the ballot counting and results. This additional person will sit in the control room during the production to rapidly respond to any errors. PwC added that accountants will have to give up their mobile devices for the entirety of the show. The accountant who managed the Oscar ballot counting process from 2002 to 2013 will return to the role.Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Mahershala Ali, Amy Poehler and a whole host of other stars are teaming up for Stand for Rights: A Benefit for the ACLU.

The viral effort, along with sharing facts regarding the missing teens, encouraged others to question why cases about missing black women often go uncovered by the nightly news and other mainstream media sources. “As a society, we only pay attention when a particular type of woman goes missing,” artist Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle told The Huffington Post. For years, Hinkle has used her artistic practice to explore black female bodies ― how they navigate multiple geographies simultaneously and how they react to the narratives and perceptions thrust upon them. Her current exhibition, titled “The Evanesced,” features 100 drawings, which Hinkle describes as “un-portraits,” evoking black women who have gone missing, whose bodies and lives have been erased. The show has been on view at the California African American Museum since early March, before the recently heightened scrutiny over D.C.’s missing girls. But for Hinkle, the work’s timeliness is far from surprising. “It’s not a strange coincidence because this erasure happens every day, all over the nation,” she said. “It has been a state of emergency for a long time. It just depends on who is looking at it and who is talking about it.”Before “The Evanesced,” Hinkle created a series called “The Uninvited,” based upon 19th-century photographs of West African women taken by French colonialists. The images depicted their subjects monolithically and aggressively, propelling myths of black women as hypersexual and primitive, coercing their bodies into poses that fit the fantasy. Using intricate lines and watery clouds of color, Hinkle disrupted the colonialist narratives, transforming the photographed women into goddesses, monsters and hybrid creatures in between. The images simultaneously alluded to the violence being enacted within the photos while eclipsing it with power, beauty and wrath. “I could feel things from those photographs,” Hinkle said. “I’m an empath.”The colonialist photos, which were printed on postcards and widely distributed throughout Europe, plainly communicate the degree to which men assumed ownership of and agency over black women’s bodies. Not much has changed, Hinkle believes, between the 19th century and today. “I have this mantra of looking at the historical present,” Hinkle said. “I’m always between these two places, where our past and present collide. If we don’t recognize our history, we’re constantly going to be in the residue of it.”Hinkle began formulating her concept for “The Evanesced” after learning about the case of Lonnie Franklin Jr., also known as the “Grim Sleeper,” a serial killer convicted of killing at least 10 black women in the Los Angeles area between 1985 and 2007. “He amassed a private archive of almost 1,000 photos of women,” Hinkle said. “Police are still trying to identify what happened to them.” Franklin’s photo trove triggered memories of the unnamed, unidentifiable black women depicted in the colonial postcards. “I started thinking about what it means to be erased in a contemporary context,” Hinkle said. “What does it mean to emerge from this kind of erasure?”The deeper the artist dug into her research, the more horrific the findings were. Hinkle claimed that in 2010, 64,000 missing black women remained unfound, citing a number that made its rounds on the internet in the years since; she described the number as “unfathomable, sublime.” When her peers learned she was researching missing black women, they shared stories of other cases and names. The black female bodies kept piling up. For Hinkle, “The Evanesced” is about more than the Grim Sleeper, or the missing D.C. girls, or any one person or case. As she put it: “If I draw these women, then what about the others?” Additionally, the artist didn’t want to portray a real person, a real life ripped away, without doing the proper legwork. “I would want to spend time with the families and get to know them,” Hinkle said. “I am very critical of someone who comes into a community and makes work about it. I wouldn’t want someone to say, ‘That doesn’t look like Rachel.’ Then you are further erasing her.”The sentiment rings especially true following the controversy surrounding Dana Schutz’s painting of Emmett Till’s open casket, currently on view at the Whitney Biennial. Schutz, who is white, has been accused by some artists and critics of erasing Till’s image by rendering it in paint, and exploiting black suffering by painting a story that is not her own. And even if Hinkle wanted to render portraits that were grounded in real life, the numbers are just too high. “Sixty-four thousand missing women,” she said, “there is no way I could make a picture of that.”The drawings, then, don’t represent 100 actual missing women, but evoke what it means to be a black body erased. “It’s about this idea they are shrouded in erasure,” Hinkle said. “These cases, we don’t talk about them, or we focus on the killers. But these women, these presences, are more than that.”In her studio, Hinkle lined up pieces of blank, recycled paper. She then turned on music ― Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Kanye West’s “Life of Pablo” were favorites ― and began to dance.Using India ink and a brush she fashioned from Spanish moss, Hinkle let her intuition guide her as she put marks on paper, dancing figures ― or as she called them, presences ― into being. “I wanted to make this kind of being that is flesh and not flesh,” Hinkle said. “Becoming and unbecoming, defined and not defined. There is this push and pull between both worlds.”The gestural figures that emerged from Hinkle’s body and subconscious mind look like apparitions as much as real people, their trembling bodily outlines giving way to ink-stained abstraction. The black lines veer from fine and airy to coarse and wet, resembling rays of spirit from one angle, bodily scars from another. Some women dance, some braid hair, some curl up in a ball as if cowering in fear.“I wanted there to be this gamut of expressions — joy, pain, love,” Hinkle said. “These imagined movements that can’t be contained.”In his review for The Los Angeles Times, Christopher Knight likened Hinkle’s minimalist style to that of 20th-century Austrian artist Egon Schiele. The mythic woodcut prints of Alison Saar also come to mind, as do the ghostly drawings of Alina Szapocznikow. Lined up in five rows of 20, the delicate drawings are devastating in their abundance, though they pale in comparison to the number of real women whose bodies have disappeared. “It’s kind of unfathomable,” Hinkle said. “The exhibition is about what I can never really grasp. For every woman there is a family, a mother and a father. For every image there is an infinity of erasure.”On opening night, Hinkle watched as viewers entered the space, stopped short and sighed, as the weight of the work hit them. In the days since, black women have reached out to Hinkle on social media to let them know how much the work affected them. “People have told me about coming to the show and crying in the space,” she said. “That gives me chills because I’ve spent so many nights crying.”“Kenyatta A.C.

Harris, will lead group discussions on episodes from the first two seasons as well as additional assigned topics. Students are also required to “invest a significant amount of time outside of class watching the series” and to submit two papers focusing on issues “The Wire” tackles. “The Wire,” created by David Simon, first aired in 2002 and lasted for five seasons. The show starred Wendell Pierce, Michael K. Williams, Idris Elba, Mack Wilds, Michael B. Jordan, Andre Royo, Dominic West, among others. It explored riveting themes that are still relevant today, such as the city’s relationship with law enforcement, the drug trade, politics, corruption and the media.And it’s still heralded as one of the greatest TV shows of all time. “The Wire” was raw, un-cut and ahead of its time at taking a deep dive into actual issues plaguing inner cities.

31,POLITICS,Trump Threatens To 'Fight' Freedom Caucus In Midterms If They Don't Fall In Line,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-threatens-freedom-caucus_us_58dd0fc6e4b0e6ac7092b2db,The House hardliners played a key role in tanking the GOP's Obamacare replacement bill.,2017-03-30,President Donald Trump is upset that members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus objected to the GOP's Obamacare replacement bill. Their opposition helped kill it.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dd102f1400002000072592.jpeg?cache=Sh7O1ACfPX&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump warned the House Freedom Caucus on Thursday that he would work to unseat them in the 2018 midterm elections if they did not cooperate with the broader Republican agenda.The Freedom Caucus’ objections to the GOP Obamacare replacement bill, known as the American Health Care Act, proved decisive in killing it last Friday. The legislative defeat was a major humiliation for Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) who had repeatedly promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act.Trump threatened the roughly 32-member group of ultraconservative Republicans with electoral reprisal on Twitter “if they don’t get on the team, & fast.” Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), one of the Freedom Caucus’ staunchest members, responded defiantly to Trump, tweeting that it “didn’t take long for the swamp to drain” Trump.With the Republicans’ Obamacare replacement bill on life support last Friday morning, Trump tried to shame the Freedom Caucus on Twitter into getting on board with it by appealing to their anti-abortion views. The group of lawmakers, Trump alleged, would “allow [Planned Parenthood] to continue if they stop this plan!”After Trump and Ryan decided to pull the bill on Friday afternoon, the president continued to lambaste the Freedom Caucus for undermining the Republican agenda.The House Freedom Caucus is not the only faction of the Republican Party responsible for sinking the GOP health care proposal. The last-minute exodus of moderate Republicans sealed its fate.Republican leaders’ attempts to assuage the Freedom Caucus by letting states regulate which “essential benefits” insurance exchange plans had to cover contributed to these defections and likely doomed the bill in the Senate.The president has also pointed his finger at others. He first attributed the loss to Democrats’ unwillingness to cooperate, despite never reaching out to them.On Saturday, Trump also directed his Twitter followers to tune into a Fox News segment in which his friend Judge Jeanine Pirro faulted Ryan for the bill’s demise and called for his resignation.For their part, Freedom Caucus members claim that Trump’s lack of interest in the policy details of the bill prevented him from accommodating their demands.If Trump in fact plans to proceed with a plan to dislodge the notoriously independent members of the House Freedom Caucus in primary elections, he has his work cut out for him. The members are almost entirely clustered in extremely conservative congressional districts where their ideology-driven stubbornness is a political asset.Asked on Thursday afternoon whether Trump appreciated the significance of starting a fight with one of Congress’s most cohesive voting blocs, White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested Trump was seeking ways to circumvent the Freedom Caucus or dilute its power. Some individual Freedom Caucus members might be willing to break with their leaders to work with the president on legislative priorities, he implied.“At the end of the day, [President Trump] recognizes that he has a bold and robust agenda that he is trying to enact ... and he is going to get the votes from wherever he can,” Spicer said.This story has been updated with comment from Sean Spicer.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated that Trump had not previously blamed members of the House Freedom Caucus in public for the GOP health care bill’s demise."
32,ENTERTAINMENT,The National Review Just Coined The Phrase 'Conservatives for Chappelle’,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dave-chappelle-conservatives_us_58dd25c0e4b05eae031daff6,What a weird week it has been for comedian Dave Chappelle.,2017-03-30,Dave Chappelle's recent comments have ostracized many in the left and found him new fans on the right.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dd2c6d2c00002100ff1551.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The year is 2017. Donald Trump is president of the United States of America, xenophobic nationalism has gone global and the National Review has coined the phrase “Conservatives for Chappelle.”Scary as it might seem, this is not the plot for the latest B-rate dystopian novel available at a bookstore near you. This is your life. The conservative National Review published an article Thursday with the aforementioned title in which author Michael Taube explains how Dave Chappelle came to have “his share of conservative fans.”It is just one article, but the piece feels like the climax of what has been an odd few days for Chappelle. Since Netflix released two of his specials last Tuesday ― his first since 2004’s “For What It’s Worth” ― the comedian has faced criticism for comments made in them about the LGBTQ community and sexual assault.Of Bill Cosby, he joked, “He rapes, but he saves.” Of the “Q” in “LGBTQ,” he said, “It’s for gay dudes that don’t know they’re gay.” He laughed about missing Bruce Jenner and pronouns and transgender women “tricking” people into having sex with them.The comments angered many left-leaning Americans, leading to headlines like “A Study on How Dave Chappelle Isn’t Nailing 2017,” “The World Changed, but Dave Chappelle Didn’t,” and “Dave Chappelle’s Disappointing Reliance on Easy Provocation.”“Chappelle’s reputation rests heavily on the notion that he’s smarter and funnier than anyone else in the game. This … is not smart. It’s ignorant. It’s lazy. It’s cruel,” wrote Seth Simons in Paste. “If Chappelle indeed made $20 million for each of these specials, then he made $1.7 million to call someone a tranny.”Meanwhile, conservative publications like the National Review have celebrated him. The website ChicksOnTheRight.com ran the headline, “Dave Chappelle Lays Down A Truth Bomb About Planned Parenthood.” Tweets like this happened:The push on the right to claim Chappelle didn’t start last week. Before the election, the conservative New York Observer ran the headline “Dave Chappelle Defends Trump, Rips Clinton: ‘She’s Not Right and We All Know It.’” When TMZ later asked him about it, he angrily stated, “Jesus Christ, I’m not a Trump supporter!”It’s an odd turn of events for man who was once something of a hero to the left, or at least one of its voices. As recently as last November, he arrived at “Saturday Night Live” just days removed from the election and gave a stirring monologue about the then-president-elect. In March, he showed up at his village council meeting in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and called for a more progressive police force. Yet here we are. It is 2017, and Dave Chappelle, due to his trouble keeping up with the world around him, has ostracized himself from his base, and started to gain a new one entirely on his right. What a world.

He later claimed to have killed 18 others while working at a veterans’ hospital in Cincinnati. His most common method of killing his victims was by using arsenic and cyanide. The string of the deaths began as mercy killings, he claimed. Eventually, he said he simply enjoyed killing and the power of choosing who would live and who would die.He ended up pleading guilty to the crimes to escape the death penalty, he said.According to online prison records, his first opportunity for parole was 2043."

The ongoing violence has displaced 2.4 million people throughout Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger, and has exacerbated dire food shortages in the region.The U.N. children’s fund, UNICEF, warns that an estimated 450,000 children under five years old will suffer from severe acute malnutrition in northeast Nigeria this year, while 90,000 children are at risk of dying.In December, the U.N. estimated that 55,000 people are living in famine-like conditions in Borno State, and that number could double this year. But many Nigerians are living in areas where no aid agencies can reach, so the true figure may be much higher.“These are numbers that you don’t see, they don’t exist,” said Arjan de Wagt, UNICEF’s chief of nutrition in Nigeria. “I don’t see that there are many places in the world where you’ve got these kind of levels.”Although the Nigerian military has recaptured swathes of territory from Boko Haram, the group continues to conduct attacks, including suicide bombings using women and young girls. These often deadly assaults cause people to flee their homes and farmlands in increasing numbers, further destabilizing communities and the local economy, quashing hopes for those already displaced to return home and rebuild the region.“The scale of displacement is really overwhelming,” said Stephanie Puccetti, the International Rescue Committee’s Senior Emergency Program Coordinator in Nigeria.This continued insecurity also piles more pressure on local communities in northeast Nigeria, where 75 percent of displaced people are sheltering, according to Puccetti. The years-long displacement of millions of people has further strained the northeast, where food insecurity and poverty have been exacerbated by conflict.“I think [it’s] striking just how communities have really worked to accommodate these IDPs (internally displaced persons), and to provide support when they have so little. People have been so generous,” said Puccetti.The lean season, the period between harvests, is approaching soon. Many people in the region are worried about how these struggling communities will cope.While there have been many food aid distributions by humanitarian groups, the coming lean season means people will soon exhaust their food supplies, says Malik Samuel, Nigeria field communications manager for Doctors Without Borders (MSF).“This is what’s really complex about this crisis,” says Puccetti. “You have an emergency IDP population that requires 12 months a year of support, [and] you also have really vulnerable families who either have returned back home to their areas and are trying to rebuild their lives, or who just never left and are still there who are much more reliant on farming and their own food production.”In response, organizations like IRC are not only providing medical care but also trying to support the local community in the northeast to boost farming, cope with food insecurity and recover from severe acute malnutrition.Humanitarian organizations have however struggled to get the necessary funding for a crisis that receives infrequent media coverage.At an international conference in Norway last month, $672 million was raised to help the region over the next three years.

President Donald Trump’s zeal for the rule of law, however, appears to wane dramatically when he discovers those rules place any constraint on his own executive powers.Since his inauguration, President Trump has made notorious comments about the judicial branch, mocking the “so-called judges” who threaten to limit any of his executive power. These remarks suggest that, for President Trump, the rules and laws which govern our land are not the guidelines and parameters that give definition to our common life as a society. Rules and laws are just obstacles to his ability to achieve his, and his advisors’, agenda without restraint. Initially, it looked like judges would be able to keep the more blatant elements of white supremacy at bay. Unfortunately, it seems that over the past several weeks Trump and his team have learned to become more effective exploiters of rules.Take, for example, the revised Executive Order on immigration that the White House released on March 6. Federal judges easily struck down the original executive order for its blatant violation of the Constitution and its disregard for the welfare of many legal U.S. residents. In the days—indeed, hours—after the original order came through, stories circulated around the world about individuals turned back at airports, families divided, and refugees stranded in limbo. On the surface, it would seem the updated order addresses some of these issues. The new order will not go into effect for ten days, giving travelers and visa-holders time to make arrangements rather than being stranded and possibly stateless. The writers even omitted the language indicating the government would give priority to non-Muslim asylum seekers (when and if the country starts accepting refugees again).This new travel ban admittedly seems to play by the rules that govern our society. All the same, “playing by the rules” is not the only metric by which we should evaluate the policies that shape our common life. Being legal does not make this new order moral. The updated version remains as immoral as the original. Yes, those who drafted this new order have done a better job of obscuring the fact that the aim is to target and inhibit as many Muslims as possible from entering the United States. For a government run by a party that cries out for religious freedom at every opportunity, one gets the distinct impression that religious freedom applies predominantly to those who are white and Christian.As problematic as the basic travel ban may be, the treatment of refugees remains utterly indefensible. For the most powerful nation in the world to close its doors to asylum seekers—even for a matter of months—is unconscionable at any point. It is morally repugnant when our planet is experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis since 1945. What I cannot and will not understand is how so many Christian leaders support closing our borders to families and children desperately in need of sanctuary. All in the name of security—as if preserving our safety is a greater moral and spiritual imperative than helping those in acute, desperate need. I spend my life as a Christian leader urging my congregation to follow the example of Jesus. Our entire faith is centered on a teacher who willingly sacrificed his life for the sake of other people. I must confess I find it hard to see the moral imperative to turn away those in need out of concern for our own well-being.No one needs me to recount all of the ways in which this immigration policy will fail to achieve its stated purpose of ensuring the safety of American citizens. On the other hand, one might reasonably assume that the order will achieve the underlying purpose of protecting Americans from encountering those from diverse perspectives and backgrounds. It will achieve the dubious benefit of sheltering Americans from coming face to face with those who have suffered first-hand the horrors and atrocities of global warfare. The executive order will protect many Americans from being put in situations where we may need to form first-hand personal relationships with men and women who faithfully practice Islam.All of this is perfectly legal. There are no rules or laws that restrict our government from placing a hold on refugees. Our president and his administration are playing by the rules to get their “Muslim ban” in everything but name alone. President Trump certainly has learned how to exploit the rules to get his own way. The trouble is he can only do so by violating unspoken rules of democracy at the expense of the common good. “America First” is not a rule which I want to follow.Previously published as ‘When the Law of Land is Immoral’ in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:McCarthyism 2.0: Trump’s First Two Months In Office by Maria Behan10 Things Parents of “Normal” Kids Should Know by Jami IngledueThe Key to Success for the Resistance by Mike Hembury"

At ABH, we focus on ensuring decision-makers fulfill their promises on a wide range of domestic health issues, including human resources for health, access to medicines and commodities, health financing, and delivery of high-quality services. Our slogan is: “Where everyone is accountable, everyone wins.”While “accountability” can mean different things to different people, at ABH it means turning up the volume of citizen voices. We achieve this by building the capacity of civil society organizations (CSOs) to advocate to decision-makers at both the local and national levels. As ABH’s community empowerment officer, I have the privilege of empowering citizens with knowledge of their health-related rights and responsibilities. This enables citizens to speak out and engage their leaders on issues affecting their health and social welfare. Our citizen empowerment and advocacy approach has brought a number of successes. Due to the vigilance of citizens, in many health facilities, health workers are no longer perpetually absent from duty. In other facilities, district officials have stationed more health workers, especially midwives, and decision-makers have committed to address gaps affecting the delivery of high-quality services. In some communities, new cadres of health care workers have begun work in facilities that were previously understaffed. All of this means better healthcare for the citizens in those communities — and a more accountable government. Averting a health crisis by holding government accountableIn late 2015, we faced one of our greatest accountability challenges when a stock out of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) drugs threatened health facilities across the country. Because of several factors – including a weak health supply chain system, rising drug prices due to fluctuating currency, and an unexpectedly high enrollment in the country’s treatment program – the health of millions of HIV/AIDS and TB patients was at risk.In response, our CSO partners sprang into action to develop a campaign: “Drug stock-out kills! Stop it.” The campaign urged our government to address this crisis, and our coalition prioritized three actions: gathering the best evidence available; communicating one “voice;” and engaging in solution-oriented outreach with key decision-makers. To do this, our CSO partner, the National Forum of People Living with HIV Networks in Uganda, worked with district and community partners to develop a regularly updated evidence dossier on stock-outs. We also executed a coordinated media blitz of radio spots, press conferences and journalist study tours to bring attention to the dwindling supply of drugs. During one of our engagement meetings, a Ministry of Health official conceded, saying: “The stock-out of HIV drugs is no longer looming; it is real.” To keep pressuring for a solution, the coalition collected citizen petitions and mobilized powerful community champions. This included a popular performing artist, Matovu Joy, who publicly disclosed his positive HIV/AIDS status during the campaign. As a result, our campaign gained the attention of many powerful decision-makers, and led to face-to-face meetings with the permanent Secretaries of Health and Finance, and the Speaker of Parliament. We also used World AIDS Day and the Annual Health Assembly as opportunities to directly present the dossier, citizen petitions, and their advocacy asks to high-level leaders and government officials.Getting the accountability message home, locally and nationallyWithin a month, the Ugandan government had committed to securing a US$200 million loan, partly to be used to re-stock the country’s HIV/AIDS and TB drugs. The government also successfully negotiated with the Global Fund, which agreed to frontload its future budget to the country’s HIV/AIDS and TB programs to purchase lifesaving drugs. Officials at the Ministry of Health and the National Medical Stores also revealed pipeline plans to spend US$5 million to build additional drugstores to accommodate more antiretroviral drugs and other drug supplies. They agreed to hold quarterly dialogues with civil society advocates and provide direct access to the President of Uganda if future stock-outs persist. The dialogues continue today and have proven to be a very useful platform for addressing some of our country’s supply chain gaps.At a public forum toward the end of our campaign, Uganda’s Minister of Health acknowledged our efforts, saying: “The message has gotten home.” Accountability for health begins at home, and a stronger civil society can mean a stronger, more responsive government. But first, citizens must know how to pressure leaders to fulfill their health commitments. We look forward to continuing our work across Uganda to empower citizens to demand that leaders prioritize the health of every citizen.

At ABH, we focus on ensuring decision-makers fulfill their promises on a wide range of domestic health issues, including human resources for health, access to medicines and commodities, health financing, and delivery of high-quality services. Our slogan is: “Where everyone is accountable, everyone wins.”While “accountability” can mean different things to different people, at ABH it means turning up the volume of citizen voices. We achieve this by building the capacity of civil society organizations (CSOs) to advocate to decision-makers at both the local and national levels. As ABH’s community empowerment officer, I have the privilege of empowering citizens with knowledge of their health-related rights and responsibilities. This enables citizens to speak out and engage their leaders on issues affecting their health and social welfare. Our citizen empowerment and advocacy approach has brought a number of successes. Due to the vigilance of citizens, in many health facilities, health workers are no longer perpetually absent from duty. In other facilities, district officials have stationed more health workers, especially midwives, and decision-makers have committed to address gaps affecting the delivery of high-quality services. In some communities, new cadres of health care workers have begun work in facilities that were previously understaffed. All of this means better healthcare for the citizens in those communities — and a more accountable government. Averting a health crisis by holding government accountableIn late 2015, we faced one of our greatest accountability challenges when a stock out of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) drugs threatened health facilities across the country. Because of several factors – including a weak health supply chain system, rising drug prices due to fluctuating currency, and an unexpectedly high enrollment in the country’s treatment program – the health of millions of HIV/AIDS and TB patients was at risk.In response, our CSO partners sprang into action to develop a campaign: “Drug stock-out kills! Stop it.” The campaign urged our government to address this crisis, and our coalition prioritized three actions: gathering the best evidence available; communicating one “voice;” and engaging in solution-oriented outreach with key decision-makers. To do this, our CSO partner, the National Forum of People Living with HIV Networks in Uganda, worked with district and community partners to develop a regularly updated evidence dossier on stock-outs. We also executed a coordinated media blitz of radio spots, press conferences and journalist study tours to bring attention to the dwindling supply of drugs. During one of our engagement meetings, a Ministry of Health official conceded, saying: “The stock-out of HIV drugs is no longer looming; it is real.” To keep pressuring for a solution, the coalition collected citizen petitions and mobilized powerful community champions. This included a popular performing artist, Matovu Joy, who publicly disclosed his positive HIV/AIDS status during the campaign. As a result, our campaign gained the attention of many powerful decision-makers, and led to face-to-face meetings with the permanent Secretaries of Health and Finance, and the Speaker of Parliament. We also used World AIDS Day and the Annual Health Assembly as opportunities to directly present the dossier, citizen petitions, and their advocacy asks to high-level leaders and government officials.Getting the accountability message home, locally and nationallyWithin a month, the Ugandan government had committed to securing a US$200 million loan, partly to be used to re-stock the country’s HIV/AIDS and TB drugs. The government also successfully negotiated with the Global Fund, which agreed to frontload its future budget to the country’s HIV/AIDS and TB programs to purchase lifesaving drugs. Officials at the Ministry of Health and the National Medical Stores also revealed pipeline plans to spend US$5 million to build additional drugstores to accommodate more antiretroviral drugs and other drug supplies. They agreed to hold quarterly dialogues with civil society advocates and provide direct access to the President of Uganda if future stock-outs persist. The dialogues continue today and have proven to be a very useful platform for addressing some of our country’s supply chain gaps.At a public forum toward the end of our campaign, Uganda’s Minister of Health acknowledged our efforts, saying: “The message has gotten home.” Accountability for health begins at home, and a stronger civil society can mean a stronger, more responsive government. But first, citizens must know how to pressure leaders to fulfill their health commitments. We look forward to continuing our work across Uganda to empower citizens to demand that leaders prioritize the health of every citizen.

She is part of a group of traditional healers incorporated into a new cadre of community health workers (CHWs) blessed by the new government in South Sudan.She underwent a one-week training on identification of danger signs in children for three diseases with which she’s been familiar all her life. She was acquainted with the signs and symptoms mentioned during the training, and learned more about how to react when she encounters a child with a danger sign.This new level of frontline health workers will extend essential health services coverage to fulfill the new global agenda of universal health coverage. And on a personal level, the opportunity to serve her community has made Freedom feel proud and useful.To achieve universal health care, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an average of 4.1 essential health workers (e.g., doctors, nurses/midwives, pharmacists) per 1,000 people. However, in Africa, there are 1.6 health workers per 1,000 people on average, with South Sudan one of 36 countries that do not meet this WHO criterion.Moreover, only 20% of the health workforce in South Sudan is located at the sub-district level, meaning an average 80% of health staff do not render preventive or basic level services to people in their communities. To fill this gap, World Vision employs a community human resources task-shifting strategy in a program known as community case management.CHWs like Freedom are key to accelerating progress in achieving universal coverage, but these efforts are not cheap: millions of dollars have been invested in task-shifting activities and systems to ensure competencies and skills of CHWs are not neglected. Improving and maintaining their clinical skills is critical for strengthening health systems and providing adequate care to mothers, newborns, and children.Moreover, supervision is widely recognized as key to improving health worker performance. Among other goals, we hope that functioning supervision systems to support community case management activities will contribute to the appropriate use of antibiotics.In Warrap State, South Sudan, a 13-month study funded by USAID through World Vision’s Child Survival grant was undertaken to assess a supervision model for illiterate CHWs. They were trained, supervised and studied to assess their correct use of newborn and child health record forms, identification, classification, treatment and referral of disease.After the supervision period, 87 percent of CHWs were accredited as competent to deliver integrated community case management and essential newborn care services. A total of 2,552 children under age five were seen by CHWs, with a mean of 196 child visits per month.Results indicate that a supervision process to monitor, improve and maintain clinical skill performance by CHWs within a community case management strategy is an important element of program design and implementation to obtain health outcomes. This is especially true in fragile state contexts and among community-based approaches where treatment with drugs is included.Freedom was part of this group and even though she did not benefit financially from this activity, the sense of support and recognition of the value of her work was enough incentive to continue her efforts. She knows that her work is an investment in the development of her community and her country.

42,POLITICS,Badly Misinformed Lawmaker Thinks Our 'Warm Bodies' May Be Causing Climate Change,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-misinformation-scott-wagner_us_58dbeecce4b01ca7b4292dc5,Spoiler alert: Republican Scott Wagner is very wrong.,2017-03-29,State Sen. Scott Wagner may need a refresher science class.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dc00171d0000f42c7d1311.jpeg?ops=crop_6_39_946_553%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A Republican state senator running for governor of Pennsylvania shared some unusual views this week about what’s causing climate change. Scott Wagner told a Harrisburg audience on Tuesday that the body heat from the planet’s growing population might be responsible for rising temperatures. “We have more people. You know, humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off?” Wagner said, according to State Impact Pennsylvania, an NPR project. “Things are changing, but I think we are, as a society, doing the best we can.”The lawmaker was speaking to a receptive audience of rural county officials about loosening regulations on the natural gas industry.At another point, Wagner appeared to conflate global warming with ... well, it’s not quite clear what he meant.“I haven’t been in a science class in a long time, but the earth moves closer to the sun every year ― you know, the rotation of the earth,” Wagner said. “We’re moving closer to the sun.”The lawmaker is indeed a bit rusty on the basics of astronomy. Contrary to what Wagner said, the earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours, not every year. And it may come as a surprise to him that the United States and the rest of the Northern Hemisphere experience winter when the earth’s yearly orbit brings it closest to the sun. Scientists widely agree that the release of greenhouse gases from human activity is the primary force leading to climate change today. In a statement provided by a spokeswoman, Wagner said human activity is partly responsible for climate change ― although he implied that people shouldn’t take drastic action in response.“I believe that the climate is changing every day, and some of that change is certainly manmade. I think that we have a responsibility to future generations to be good stewards, and I support efforts to do that,” Wagner said. “However, the real question isn’t is the climate changing but what role should the government play in trying to alter it. I believe we have to prioritize action in a measured way so that we do not hurt our economy.”"

All proceeds from the day’s sales will go toward the ACLU and the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP). Curator Kirsten Flaherty began organizing the event following the announcement of Trump’s executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations in February.

46,POLITICS,Number Of Refugees Resettled In U.S. Has Skyrocketed Since Trump's Ban Struck Down,Willa Frej,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/refugees-resettled-us-skyrocketed_us_58dab856e4b01ca7b4277b2a,But this is actually making things way more confusing for resettlement agencies.,2017-03-29,"Faraj Ghazi al-Jamous, a Syrian refugee, loads his family's luggage into a taxi after departing from a hotel they had stayed in after they were prevented from travel to the United States in the Jordanian capital Amman on Feb. 1, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dbbe601d0000f42c7d11e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The number of refugees being resettled in the U.S. has shot up ever since a federal court struck down portions of President Donald Trump’s second executive order on immigration earlier this month.While this has allowed many to breathe a sigh of relief, it’s placing serious strain on the organizations responsible for bringing refugees to America and helping them resettle.“In accordance with the Court Order, and consistent with both our operational capacity and our capacity under available funding, we have increased the current pace of refugee arrivals to approximately 900 individuals per week,” a State Department spokesperson told The Huffington Post in a statement on Tuesday. “New refugee pre-screening interviews will continue to be scheduled and conducted at Resettlement Support Centers around the world.”Trump has signed two executive orders attempting to prevent refugees from finding safe haven in the United States since entering office. Both were legally challenged amid mass protests.His first order, signed on Jan. 27, halted the refugee resettlement program for 120 days, among other things, and slashed the number of people who could be resettled in the U.S. from 110,000 in the 2017 fiscal year to 50,000. As a result, the number of refugees entering the country weekly had been limited to 400 people, in an effort to avoid reaching the 50,000 quota too soon (the 2017 fiscal year ends on Sept. 30). Fewer refugees means less money allocated to the agencies that resettle refugees, since they receive federal funding contingent on the number of people they take care of.Parts of this order were struck down in federal court in February, but the quota remained unchanged. So the 400 per week figure was in effect until Trump’s revised ban was struck down in a Hawaii federal court on March 15, only hours before it was supposed to be implemented.These increased resettlement figures are welcome news to the nine U.S. refugee resettlement agencies, several of them said. But the multiple orders and their ever-changing legal statuses have placed the agencies in operational limbo, causing many to significantly downsize their staffs.Church World Service announced Tuesday that it let go of 547 employees worldwide, beginning the week of Feb. 27. That represents about 50 percent of its entire staff, a spokeswoman said. Its Africa operations were hit the hardest, with more than 400 layoffs in Kenya alone. “The decision to reduce our staff was a direct result of these executive orders, which sabotage our ability to offer vital services, support and counsel to families seeking to rebuild their lives in safety,” CWS president and CEO Reverend John L. McCullough said in a statement.“The reductions in international and Kenyan staff were the result of budgetary constraints,” a State Department spokesperson added.World Relief is laying off more than 140 people in the U.S. alone and closed five of its national offices.Resettlement agencies carried out these layoffs assuming, back in February, that the quota would remain at 50,000, which would warrant fewer staffers. But the portion of the second order containing the new quota was struck down ― meaning that the quota reverted back to 110,000. After laying off hundreds of people, organizations like CWS could now find themselves grossly understaffed for the rest of the year.“The situation continues to be highly volatile for resettlement – unfortunately the [executive order] itself hasn’t been fully and permanently rescinded yet,” the CWS spokeswoman said. “So it’s unclear how long this stay will last and whether that will be through the end of this fiscal year.”Elise Foley contributed reporting."

Frantic residents scrambled to pull relatives out of the collapsed homes, where they had sheltered from bombardments.“I ran to my next-door neighbor’s house and with others we managed to rescue three people, but at least 27 others in the same house were killed, including women and children of relatives who fled from other districts,” he said.“We pulled some out of rubble, using hammers and shovels to remove debris. We couldn’t do anything to help others as they were completely buried under the collapsed roof.”The risk of civilian casualties in western Mosul was always high as Iraqi government forces and their allies stage the assault. Tens of thousands of residents are trapped in homes around the Old City, where local people say jihadist fighters are using them human shields or herding them into buildings as cover.U.S.-led military commanders supporting the Iraqi forces acknowledged on Tuesday that a coalition strike probably played a role in the civilian deaths in the al-Jadida district, but said Islamic State could also be to blame.Exactly what happened on March 17 remains far from clear, but if confirmed those high casualties would mark the worst loss of Iraqi civilian life in a single incident since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, and risk damaging the Shi’ite-led government’s efforts to keep the war from alienating Mosul’s Sunni population.Coalition officials said there were air strikes in the vicinity of the al-Jadida blast that day. But Iraqi officials have been more cautious, suggesting there was no evidence a strike hit the collapsed building, which they say may have been rigged with explosives by Islamic State.Reuters spoke to several eyewitness at the scene of the al-Jadida blast, where rescue workers were still pulling bodies from the wreckage on Wednesday, hampered by a lack of heavy equipment and the threat from Islamic State drone bombs.The slow recovery may partly explain why casualty figures have varied considerably. Rescue efforts started only days after the explosion. One health official of Nineveh province, whose capital is Mosul, said 250 bodies had been recovered by Tuesday night. That differs from earlier Iraq military figures of 61.Local residents and eyewitnesses say Islamic State fighters were in and around the al-Jadida area the day of the explosion as they battled with Iraqi forces. Air strikes began to target Islamic State positions to clear the way for troops, they said. Several blasts hit the area behind the local hospital.“We were locked inside our houses as bombing intensified. The air strikes targeted four streets just behind Rahma hospital and Fathi mosque,” Abu Ayman said. “A few fighters were moving from house to house, using the holes they made before to avoid detection from the air.”Residents describe the explosion that flattened or damaged at least one large building and other homes around six tight alleyways.“It was a black Friday,” said Ahmed Obeida, another eyewitness. “It started with a huge blast that shook the walls of my house followed by series of blasts. We waited for three hours and after the bombing stopped, I went outside and saw that many houses were destroyed. We entered one house and saw body parts, legs and heads in the rubble.”ONLY LARGE BASEMENTInvestigators were still looking on Wednesday into whether the families were forced into the buildings that collapsed by Islamic State to cause civilian casualties deliberately or whether they had fled there, seeking shelter as they were caught up in the street-by-street fighting.One local official and an eyewitness said families and relatives from other districts appeared to have packed into one building because it had a large basement that would safely hold many people.“I saw fleeing families entering the large house, taking shelter in the basement. It was two-storey house and is the only one in the neighborhood with a large basement,” said a local resident. “We started to hear blasts getting closer and suddenly I felt my house was about to collapse. It was a very powerful blast. I couldn’t believe we were still alive.”Hassan Yassin, who fled from al-Jadida along with thousands of displaced residents, also said the blast happened in a crowded area near the Fathi mosque. “People were all sheltering in basements, looking for a place to hide. It was a random bombardment,” he said.But other accounts from local officials offer a different view of why the residents were packed into one building.Ghazwan al-Dawoodi, head of the Nineveh human rights council, said his team had made a field visit, finding that militants had forced residents into a bunker, and opened fire on helicopter gunships to provoke a coalition airstrike.Two eyewitnesses described how Islamic State, known in Arabic by its opponents as Daesh, had parked a truck packed with explosives next to the building. The vehicle may have gone up in an air strike, prompting the structure to collapse.“I can assure that Daesh brought a truck and parked it in the street next to mine. I saw it with my own eyes but never thought it was packed with explosives,” said Obeida. “It’s really heartbreaking to see neighbors killed in an instant. Why? What did they do to deserve such a tragic end?” Coalition officials say that although they may have played a role in the explosion, Islamic State was also likely have had a hand in the blast in an attempt to cause civilian casualties and slow the use of air strikes.One intelligence officer from the federal police told Reuters his force gives coordinates for air strikes but it cannot call in strikes if officers know civilians are there. He said they use surveillance drones to help in targeting.Iraq’s military command has also blamed the militants for rigging a building with explosives to cause civilian casualties, but some local residents and witnesses have little doubt it collapsed due to an air strike.“After the bombing stopped, I went outside to see what happened and I was stunned to see the house was flattened,” said eyewitness Sameer al-Taie. “Neighbors were hysterically shouting for help but we didn’t have anything to remove the large blocks of concrete to rescue people. We heard faint voice asking for help from nearby houses but then the voices disappeared.”(Writing by Patrick Markey; editing by David Stamp)"

Chris Christie (R) has been a strong supporter of President Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dbbed7140000880607224c.jpeg?cache=mZGL8JmsIT&ops=crop_0_50_2200_1224%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A judge sentenced two of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s (R) former aides Wednesday for their role in the Bridgegate scandal in 2013.In November, a federal jury found Bill Baroni, who served as Christie’s top official at the Port Authority of New York, and Bridget Anne Kelly, who was the governor’s deputy chief of staff, guilty on charges of conspiracy and fraud. Baroni received a two-year prison sentence Wednesday, and Kelly got 18 months.“I was wrong,” Baroni said. “I’ve waited three years to say that.”The trouble started on Sept. 9, 2013, when three of the access lanes were shut down on the George Washington Bridge connecting Manhattan to Fort Lee, New Jersey. It’s the busiest bridge in the country. The change created significant problems on the New Jersey side of the bridge and was ordered without notifying police, emergency officials or officials on the New York side of the Port Authority’s leadership.Christie officials originally tried to claim that the closures were part of a traffic study ― an excuse that was soon debunked. The real motive of messing with the city’s Democratic mayor, who refused to endorse Christie’s re-election bid, was revealed shortly afterward.The most damning piece of evidence for the political payback scheme was an Aug. 13 email sent by Kelly, when she wrote, “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.” David Wildstein, a Port Authority executive and close Christie ally, replied, “Got it.”Baroni was fully aware of what closing the lanes would do to Fort Lee. Mark Sokolich, Fort Lee’s mayor, had written to Baroni in November 2010 to complain of ongoing traffic problems. The sentencing happened as Christie was at the White House for a discussion on the opioid epidemic with President Donald Trump. Christie was a prominent Trump backer during the campaign and ran his transition effort for a time. He will now be leading Trump’s new commission to combat drug addiction.Wildstein told jurors that he and Baroni talked with Christie about shutting down the lanes during a Sept. 11 memorial service. Wildstein has been cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty to two counts of conspiracy."
50,ARTS & CULTURE,What's Really Going On Inside Your Favorite Songs?,Jillian Capewell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/song-exploder-podcast-deconstructs-music-with-solange-metallica-wilco-and-more_us_58daad24e4b07634059fc4e4,"Hrishikesh Hirway's podcast provides the musical equivalent of a director's commentary, featuring Solange, Metallica, Wilco and more.",2017-03-29,"Musicians like Angel Olsen, Solange and Joey Badass have all appeared on ""Song Exploder.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dbcdd71d0000f42c7d124e.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What makes up a song?There are the basic elements: notes, a rhythm, melody, perhaps vocals or instrumentation of some kind. Yet the heart of a song, the inscrutable way it reaches out to listeners, unites strangers, marks a personal or collective era, is a bit harder to get at. With his podcast “Song Exploder,” musician Hrishikesh Hirway — who also has a podcast devoted to “The West Wing” — helps to fill out the answer. Each episode since the show’s inception in 2014 takes one track from a musician or group’s catalog and allows an artist to break down the song in his or her own words. Who’s been on it? Some bigger names include Solange, Carly Rae Jepsen, U2, Metallica, DJ Shadow, Wilco and Iggy Pop, and the show’s indie-but-well-known roster could rival a Brooklyn resident’s most-played on Spotify: Grimes, Thao & the Get Down Stay Down, Phantogram and tUnE-yArDs.“I wanted the show to demonstrate this idea that there’s so much going on within any song,” Hirway told The Huffington Post last month. “Normally, we hear music and it’s just the finished product. It’s just a little bit opaque; you don’t really know what’s going on or how it got there. But there are so many decisions that come from so many different places, whether it’s inspiration, or accident, or experimentation, and trial and error.”Hirway starts each episode with a brief introduction before stepping back. You can detect the host’s hand in the well-crafted sound production — often, isolated musical elements from a given song will chime in as the artist is verbally deconstructing them. The effect is a bit like the director’s commentary on a DVD, in which you hear about the making of a project from the pros themselves. It’s accessible to both the casual listener and the ultrafan.The idea behind this, Hirway said, was inspired in part by Benjamin Britten’s orchestral pieces designed for children. (If his name doesn’t immediately ring a bell, perhaps the score for “Moonrise Kingdom” will.)“Benjamin Britten had those pieces for children where there were these records where they would explain what the orchestra did, what all the different sounds were, and what they were capable of,” he explained. “And there was something really nice about that. And it’s not condescending at all, it’s just like — OK, here’s what the trombone does.” By having a musician describe the decisions that led to the use of a certain instrument or lyrics, the finer points of a song take on more meaning.The experience Hirway had while listening to Marc Maron’s podcast was another influence: “Those [comedians] he has on his show, I felt like I was immediately stepping in to like, an AP level course on something ... It was intermediate or advanced stories. You were expected to kind of catch up a little bit.”“It felt more real, because they speak to each other like they have this shared vernacular,” he continued. Listening to an artist talk about their work expands our view of their song: it transforms from a whole into a puzzle of finely arranged parts. Instead of the finished product, you consider its influences, the choices made on the way to the finished product.Hirway’s examination of the music allows for a kind of granular, studied appreciation that feels absent in a world where, thanks to digitization, hordes of albums are always available on demand.“There’s something very disposable about music now, and maybe music always, but especially now, where you get five seconds of an mp3 of a track, and if it doesn’t catch your ear, you move onto the next one,” he said. “It’s the flipside of the blessing of having all the music on earth at your fingertips: How do you get through all of that?”The answer, or an answer, seems to be allowing artists to talk about the thing they love. Though Hirway said most interviews are recorded remotely, he was able to sit down in-person with Solange for her episode, where she breaks down “Cranes in the Sky,” off of 2016’s “A Seat at the Table.”“It was especially cool for me because she made my favorite record of last year,” he said. “But really, the best thing about that was how fantastic she was as an interviewee. She really had a really clear sense of her motivation and she had a very clear memory of how the song was made.”He recalled his favorite moment from Solange’s episode, where he asked about a certain part in the song when she sings, “I tried to cry it away,” and the backing vocals — also performed by her — respond, “Don’t you cry, baby.”“She told this story [explaining] how that’s her mom and her two aunties singing to her,” he said. “She had this story about how her mom always gave her and Beyoncé three days. Whatever it was that they were going through, they would get two days to be miserable, and then on the third day, they had to like, wipe the tears away and get back into it. So this little moment, this one line in the song, represented to her this sense of community and family and the idea of picking yourself back up.”“That was so beautiful, and perfectly encapsulated the kind of story and the kind of feeling that I always want from music and that I especially want from artists on the podcast.”Download “Song Exploder” from iTunes, Stitcher or your favorite podcasting platform.Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks, Tracy Morgan, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Moore, Padma Lakshmi and a whole host of other stars are teaming up for Stand for Rights: A Benefit for the ACLU.

A goal horn sounded when the grooms kissed.The wedding of Eric Pinder and Dwayne Smoot at the Amway Center in Orlando — courtesy of the Orlando Solar Bears of the ECHL — was memorable as perhaps the first same-sex wedding at a hockey arena.The couple were married in November, but the Solar Bears just sent them the wedding video this past weekend, which we were made aware of by our friends at Puck Buddys:When saying their vows to each other, Pinder and Smoot were asked by the priest, Gordon Barcalow, if they “promise to love and cherish [each other] through power plays and penalty kills, until the final horn of life sounds.” Pinder told Outsports how the wedding came off:“We met at a party and I was wearing a Red Wings Jersey. Dwayne knew the team and player so I was impressed. Plus, he is very cute. So hockey was really our first conversation.“When we were looking to get married, we thought that doing it before a game would be a great choice — we could get people to go see our local team, the Orlando Solar Bears. I called our ticket rep and asked if we could get married before a game. He said, ‘Hold on,’ then three minutes later got back on the phone and said, ‘Sure, we can do that for you.’“We had 30 people in a suite after and around 50 who bought tickets and sat in the section next to us. The Amway Arena was great. They let people rotate in and out of the suite so everyone could see our Zamboni cake. The priest is a friend of ours (also gay) who was thrilled to officiate.“We also had hockey themed gift bags — a puck with our wedding logo, unopened packs of trading cards from the 1990s and M&Ms with our team colors. We are both wearing Solar Bears jerseys, but Dwayne had a game-worn one from ‘Star Wars’ night.”Pinder, an actor/director/writer, and Smoot, who works in IT and data for Valencia College, met 16 years ago. Pinder was born a Red Wings fan, but both men have also adopted the Tampa Bay Lightning as their team. Pinder’s best man wore a Red Wing jersey, even though he’s a Penguins fan; Smoot’s best man wore a Steven Stamkos Lightning jersey.The couple want to give a special shout-out to Justin Derazza and Mark Nolte, the two men at the Solar Bears who made their special day memorable. By all accounts, it was a clean wedding, with no guests sent off to the penalty box.For more from OutSports, check out these stories:The first Tel Aviv Games are bringing LGBT athletes to Israel this weekCollege volleyball team in North Carolina is melting pot with three LGBT athletesThis gay high school wrestler found strength in his sport after facing harassment"

A goal horn sounded when the grooms kissed.The wedding of Eric Pinder and Dwayne Smoot at the Amway Center in Orlando — courtesy of the Orlando Solar Bears of the ECHL — was memorable as perhaps the first same-sex wedding at a hockey arena.The couple were married in November, but the Solar Bears just sent them the wedding video this past weekend, which we were made aware of by our friends at Puck Buddys:When saying their vows to each other, Pinder and Smoot were asked by the priest, Gordon Barcalow, if they “promise to love and cherish [each other] through power plays and penalty kills, until the final horn of life sounds.” Pinder told Outsports how the wedding came off:“We met at a party and I was wearing a Red Wings Jersey. Dwayne knew the team and player so I was impressed. Plus, he is very cute. So hockey was really our first conversation.“When we were looking to get married, we thought that doing it before a game would be a great choice — we could get people to go see our local team, the Orlando Solar Bears. I called our ticket rep and asked if we could get married before a game. He said, ‘Hold on,’ then three minutes later got back on the phone and said, ‘Sure, we can do that for you.’“We had 30 people in a suite after and around 50 who bought tickets and sat in the section next to us. The Amway Arena was great. They let people rotate in and out of the suite so everyone could see our Zamboni cake. The priest is a friend of ours (also gay) who was thrilled to officiate.“We also had hockey themed gift bags — a puck with our wedding logo, unopened packs of trading cards from the 1990s and M&Ms with our team colors. We are both wearing Solar Bears jerseys, but Dwayne had a game-worn one from ‘Star Wars’ night.”Pinder, an actor/director/writer, and Smoot, who works in IT and data for Valencia College, met 16 years ago. Pinder was born a Red Wings fan, but both men have also adopted the Tampa Bay Lightning as their team. Pinder’s best man wore a Red Wing jersey, even though he’s a Penguins fan; Smoot’s best man wore a Steven Stamkos Lightning jersey.The couple want to give a special shout-out to Justin Derazza and Mark Nolte, the two men at the Solar Bears who made their special day memorable. By all accounts, it was a clean wedding, with no guests sent off to the penalty box.For more from OutSports, check out these stories:The first Tel Aviv Games are bringing LGBT athletes to Israel this weekCollege volleyball team in North Carolina is melting pot with three LGBT athletesThis gay high school wrestler found strength in his sport after facing harassment"
55,POLITICS,Dreamer Targeted By Donald Trump's Deportation Force To Be Freed After Nearly 2 Months,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dreamer-daniel-martinez-medina-deportation-trump_us_58db889fe4b05463706381e0,"Daniel Ramirez Medina spent several weeks in detention, even though he has no criminal record.",2017-03-29,"Lawyers for Dreamer Daniel Ramirez Medina address reporters on March 8, after a hearing in federal court where they argued for his release.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dba3dc14000088060721f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the first young undocumented immigrants to be detained under President Donald Trump’s new deportation priorities is expected to be released on Wednesday, his attorneys announced.An immigration judge in Seattle agreed on Tuesday to allow Daniel Ramirez Medina, 24, to post a $15,000 bond in exchange for his release — all while a challenge to his deportation and a separate case in federal court proceed through separate tracks. He has no criminal record.Ramirez’s case is one of several that have drawn national attention because they implicate beneficiaries of former President Barack Obama’s policy to grant work authorization and exempt from deportation non-citizens who were brought to the United States as children.“Today the judge affirmed that Daniel does not pose any risk to public safety,” Luis Cortes, one of the attorneys in Ramirez’s all-star legal team, said in a statement late Tuesday. “We are thrilled he will soon be home with his family.”Ramirez has been in detention since Feb. 10 and spent his 24th birthday in detention, according to an op-ed he wrote in The Washington Post. In it, he said that his only aim is to work and provide for his 3-year-old son.“This country is my home,” Ramirez wrote.Since his detention, the federal government revoked his work permit and put him in deportation proceedings. In court, lawyers for the Trump administration have opposed legal requests for his release, arguing that Ramirez is a “self-admitted gang member” and that federal courts have no authority to entertain claims by recipients of Obama’s deferred-action program.Earlier this month, a federal magistrate judge partially agreed with the administration and declined to release Ramirez. But crucially, the judge noted that people like him may turn to the courts to challenge the constitutionality of their detentions and related actions taken by immigration authorities — which in turn may set a precedent for the more than 700,000 dreamers presently in the country.That decision is now being reviewed by U.S. Chief District Judge Ricardo Martinez of the Western District of Washington. Last week, the judge wrote in an order that Ramirez’s proper “avenue” for obtaining temporary release was in immigration court. The Department of Justice administers that system, which is governed by its own set of rules.“This Court acknowledges the unusual circumstances of this case and that many questions remain regarding the appropriateness of the government’s conduct,” Martinez wrote. “However, while the Court is sympathetic to the situation in which the Plaintiff finds himself, it can only conclude that he is not entitled to immediate release under the posture of this case.”Laurence Tribe, a prominent Harvard law professor who is contributing to Ramirez’s legal efforts, said on Twitter that the immigrant’s fight “isn’t over.”“Not by a long shot,” he tweeted. “Trump’s deporters are a vicious lot.”"
56,IMPACT,Puking Statue Will Make You Feel Sick -- But You Need To Look,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/puking-seagull-plasticide-sculpture_us_58dc101ee4b0e6ac7091e802,🤢 🤢 🤢,2017-03-29,"Jason deCaires Taylor's full ""Plasticide"" sculpture.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dc1fee2c00002000ff12fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ah, a day at the beach. Blue skies. A balmy breeze. Sand between your toes. And a seagull puking its brains out because it’s ingested far too many plastic bits.Famed marine sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor created this figure as part of a larger installation meant to convey a sense of urgency about the amount of plastic debris in the world’s oceans. Taylor partnered with the nonprofit Greenpeace to erect his disturbing installation in central London this week.The full work, called “Plasticide,” sits outside of the Royal National Theater. In addition to the vomiting seagull, the installation depicts a family of four enjoying a regular day at the beach. There are several other birds in the piece, and several other colorful piles of plastic ― presumably the other birds have already puked and moved on to find more garbage.Each year, 8 million tons of plastic wind up in the ocean. By 2050, we’ll have more plastic than fish in our waters. This will lead to a number of deleterious consequences, including birds mistaking plastic for edible food. Studies have found that 90 percent of seabirds have plastic in their stomachs.Among the pieces of debris one of the “Plasticide” seagulls has vomited is a cap from a Coke bottle. Beverage companies are a huge contributor to the current marine crisis, a Greenpeace UK report released earlier this month concluded.While the major soft drink companies have committed to producing bottles that are recyclable, that’s not actually a sustainable solution. Just because something’s recyclable, doesn’t mean the user is going to deposit it in the appropriate bin.One solution the environmental group has proposed is for beverage companies to manufacture bottles made entirely from recycled plastic. This will help reduce the amount of wasted materials entering the oceans, and cut down on the amount of entirely new bottles being produced.“The build-up of a man-made material like plastic in the vast expanse of our seemly untouched oceans is a visceral reminder of humankind’s devastating impact on our environment,” deCaires Taylor said in a statement.“I want to bring this message back to home: our oceans, and the marine life which inhabits them, literally can’t stomach any more plastic,” he added."
57,ENTERTAINMENT,Patrick Stewart Chimes In On Those Kellyanne Conway Comparisons,Mary Papenfuss and Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/patrick-stewart-kellyanne-conway_us_58da07cbe4b018c4606af1f3,"""TWINSIES.""",2017-03-29,"Actor Patrick Stewart playfully declared ""TWINSIES"" after seeing the side-by-side photo of him and Conway.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dc1c692c00002100ff12ef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A photo of actor Patrick Stewart dressed in drag in 2016 lit up social media after people began to draw comparisons between Stewart’s look and that of presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway. Now Stewart himself is weighing in.The “Star Trek” actor playfully declared “Twinsies” on Twitter on Tuesday while sharing a side-by-side photo of them both sporting hot pink with platinum blond hair and black eye makeup.Stewart had dressed up in drag a year ago in Los Angeles to promote his show “Blunt Talk” in April 2016. It took months before someone put his face next to Conway’s on the internet.Now the inevitable conclusion: a fan push for Stewart to play Conway on “SNL.”“SNL” (and “Star Trek”) fans are messaging pleas like “make it so,” or writing that Stewart should “go where no man has gone before.”Of course, Patrick wouldn’t be the first person to portray someone of the opposite gender on the popular NBC program.In addition to Melissa McCarthy’s recent portrayal of Press Secretary Sean Spicer and McKinnon’s Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Will Farrell famously portrayed Janet Reno, the nation’s first female Attorney General ― who in one “SNL” skit got in on the joke by appearing on stage with the actor. One thing: Despite these comparisons, they almost certainly wouldn’t get along. While Trump’s senior counselor is a stalwart supporter of the president, the “X-Men” star is a steadfast Trump detractor.The British actor even said early this month on “The View” that he’s working toward getting his U.S. citizenship so he can more effectively fight the administration. The “only good thing as the result of this election, I am now applying for citizenship — because I want to be an American, too,” said Stewart. “All of my friends in Washington said there’s only one thing you can do: fight, fight, oppose, oppose. But I can’t do it because I’m not a citizen.”Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks, Tracy Morgan, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Moore, Padma Lakshmi and a whole host of other stars are teaming up for Stand for Rights: A Benefit for the ACLU.

58,POLITICS,Republicans Trying To Ax Pro-Women Group In State Where 87 Percent Of Lawmakers Are Men,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-ax-womens-advocacy-group-in-state-where-87-percent-of-lawmakers-are-men_us_58c2e6dee4b054a0ea6a675b,"Happy Women's History Month, West Virginia! 😒",2017-03-29,Supporters of the West Virginia Women's Commission share photos on its Facebook page.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dad5a72c00002000ff0fa8.jpeg?cache=KlkyfEluJ3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Women make up just 13 percent of the West Virginia Legislature. That’s the third-lowest rate of women holding office nationwide, and if the state’s GOP lawmakers have it their way, there will be one less group fighting to change that statistic.Just two days into Women’s History Month, West Virginia’s House of Delegates voted 58-41 to pass House Bill 2646, which abolishes the state’s Women’s Commission, a small, nonpartisan group established in 1977 by the state Legislature to empower women, including providing guidance for running for office. If signed into law, the commission would be eliminated as of June 30, 2018.Out of 134 state legislators, just 18 are women ― that’s 13 percent, the state’s lowest percentage of female lawmakers since 1984 and nearly 10 percent lower than the national average. Advocates say the Women’s Commission has played a crucial role in recruiting women to run for office and shaping some of the state’s most progressive legislation on equal pay and domestic violence. But the bill’s supporters ― all eight of whom are Republican women ― claim the commission duplicates services offered by other groups and that its $150,000 annual budget is needed to help fill in the state’s nearly $500 million budget deficit.Belinda Biafore, chair of the state’s Democratic Party and former Women’s Commission member, said the Republicans’ move to terminate the commission for monetary reasons doesn’t make sense, noting that funding for the agency totals roughly .025 percent of the state’s anticipated budget gap.“I know every penny counts, but the bang you get for your buck with this program ― it’s just really unfortunate,” Biafore told The Huffington Post. “I don’t know what they gain by taking it away.… There is no explanation. There’s no rhyme. There’s no reason.”Margaret Chapman Pomponio has worked closely with the Women’s Commission in her role as the executive director of West Virginia Free, a reproductive rights advocacy group. She said legislators calling for the commission’s closure to save money were being “very disingenuous,” adding that the agency runs on a “shoestring budget.”“This is a sad way to mark Women’s History Month,” Pomponio said. “If you wanted to take a cynical look at the motives behind this bill, is it that the Legislature doesn’t want to deal with the reality that the status of women in West Virginia is relatively poor?”The irony of eight women introducing a bill to eliminate a group dedicated to empowering other women did not go unnoticed by the commission’s supporters.“For the Republican majority to pinpoint all the female Republican legislators to introduce this bill and talk on behalf of it, it’s just like it’s another slap in the face,” Biafore said. “And those women allowed it.”Despite women’s dismal participation in the state Legislature, the bill’s sponsors claim the commission isn’t needed to promote the status of West Virginia women. Republican Kayla Kessinger is the lead sponsor of the bill and argues that the commission’s initiatives are not only unnecessary but have a negative effect.“To assert that women need a commission to run for office or to be successful undermines women and does nothing to empower us as a demographic in our nation and in our state,” Kessinger said during a hearing on the bill.Kessinger ― who has not responded to multiple requests for comment ― and other supporters of the bill claim the commission’s services are duplicative of other agency’s services, citing a 2006 state audit of the agency that called for its closure. The auditor found that inadequate funding, not unnecessary services, prevented the commission from effectively executing its mission. The commission, which operates under the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services, is currently made up almost entirely of volunteers, save for one part-time employee: the executive director, who also leads another state commission.The Women’s Commission is the only state agency mandated to bring women’s concerns and issues to the attention of the executive and legislative branches of the state government, according to its website. The commission’s supporters point to the group’s initiatives to prepare women to run for office, like their Ready to Run training sessions and the Women’s and Girls’ Day at the Legislature, as necessary.Nancy Foster, one of the eight Republican women sponsoring the bill, claims some private-sector organizations and universities conduct similar research, though she struggled to specifically name any. She previously attended one of the commission’s candidate training workshops and argued she didn’t find the training particularly useful, though Stacy North, chairwoman of the Women’s Commission, said Foster gave the training “good marks.”“It’s nothing personal, nothing against that gender ― I am that gender,” Foster said.Pomponio argued the bill’s supporters are underestimating women’s interest in politics and the energy that came out of the historic Women’s March in January.“Women are going to find out about what they have done to the Women’s Commission and they hopefully will hold legislators accountable for not representing the interests of West Virginia women and families,” Pomponio said. “West Virginia women are worth more than $150,000 a year.”The state Senate is set to vote on the bill before the legislative session ends in early April. It’s unclear if Democratic Gov. Jim Justice would sign the bill if it reached his desk, though he called it “frivolous” during a town hall earlier this month.“It’s $150,000. I mean, that’s money ― I get it,” Justice said. “But at the same time, Jiminy Christmas ... all we’re going to do is stir the pot again and then be right back at the same thing next year.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Tran, the daughter of Vietnamese refugees and a workforce development specialist, assumed her preferred candidate, Democrat Hillary Clinton, would win.“It was fantastic,” she recalled. “How apropos that our baby would be due on Inauguration Day!”But after Donald Trump’s victory, the impending birth took on a different significance as the couple wondered whether a country of immigrants was turning its back on newcomers. They decided to name their daughter Elise Minh Khanh, a name heavy with symbolism. “Elise” was for “Ellis Island,” where Tran’s husband’s Jewish ancestors arrived in the United States. “Minh Khanh,” which means “bright bell” in Vietnamese, references the the Liberty Bell.“Her name means to us, ‘Ring the bells of liberty and champion opportunity for all,’” Tran explained.But giving her baby a poetic name was not enough.“I could not just give such an aspirational name to my baby and expect that she rise to the occasion and create that future for herself and her generation,” she said. “So I had to jump in myself.”Tran, 38, decided to run for a Virginia House of Delegates seat representing the swath of northern Virginia suburbs where she lives. She is hoping to unseat Dave Albo, the 42nd district’s Republican incumbent. Voters in the district opted for Clinton by a 20-point margin, and she hopes that turning out those voters will be enough to dislodge Albo after nearly 24 years in office.Tran is one of dozens of House of Delegates candidates who gathered over coffee and Jimmy John’s sandwiches for the Virginia Democratic House Caucus’ new candidate training seminar in downtown Richmond on March 18.Trump’s election has inspired an unusually large number of Democrats to run for Virginia’s House of Delegates: 74 candidates have lined up to run in 47 districts currently held by Republicans. In 2015, Democrats mounted general election challenges in just 21 of those districts. The state Democratic Party said this year’s candidate training seminar was likely the biggest it has ever had.Democrats hold all five of Virginia’s statewide elected offices ― governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and two U.S. senators. They also have a near-majority in the state Senate. But right now, they control just 34 of 100 seats in the House of Delegates. Democrats admit that the prospects of retaking the chamber are extremely unlikely in 2017, but they are optimistic about making significant gains.They are also looking ahead to 2018, when there could be several special elections if the federal courts order a redrawing of some of the state’s gerrymandered legislative districts.“If you can pick up a lot of seats this time, and then next time you’ve got some new districts which are more competitive, you can make a run at the majority in 2018 with the right set [of candidates],” said Delegate David Toscano, a Charlottesville lawyer and the Democratic leader in the Virginia House.More importantly, as one of just two states with legislative elections this November ― the other is New Jersey, where Democrats already control the legislature ― Virginia is a vital testing ground for Democrats hoping to ride the anti-Trump tide.Things look good for Virginia Democrats, at least on paper. Clinton won the state handily in November, and Republicans currently hold 17 state House districts where she won.A pair of special elections for open state House seats since the general election have not been particularly telling one way or another. In January, Republicans held on to the Virginia Beach-area 85th district, improving slightly on Trump’s 1-point margin there. Democrats kept control of a seat in Richmond’s solidly Democratic 71st district in February. “We’re the first out of the box in the post-Trump era, and we’ve got these two trends that are helping us: One is how chaotic D.C. is, and [the other is] how positive the state has been run under Democrats,” Toscano said.Many of these eager new Democratic candidates will first have to win primary races in June, including Tran. Her opponent in the primary is retired social worker and veteran civil rights activist Nelfred “Tilly” Blanding.Blanding, 66, broke into gospel-style song in introducing herself to the room of fellow candidates at the training seminar, and referred to the Republican incumbent as “Lucifer.”Her journey as an activist began when she was a teenager in Orangeburg, South Carolina, where she stood down threats of violence to protest racial segregation at local businesses.Like Tran, Blanding decided to run for office because of Trump’s election ― and particularly because the Affordable Care Act could be repealed. She protested in the U.S. Senate in late January and was arrested with fellow members of the Service Employees International Union.“I’m a faith-filled person. I feel like God directs my life. I’ve been on the battlefield all my life,” Blanding said. After the election, she said, “I thought, ‘Okay, the battle goes on.’”Despite an abundance of Democratic candidates ― and thus, lots of upcoming primaries ― party leaders said they are not concerned about internal divisions. Blanding and Tran, for example, have already said they will happily vote for the primary winner in the general election.Toscano said he has seen few signs that other contests will prove less amicable ― so far, they lack the bitterness or ideological divisions of the 2016 presidential primary.“I don’t see it as much as you would think,” he said.Toscano’s own race seems to be an exception, however. He faces a primary challenge from Ross Mittiga, a 28-year-old University of Virginia instructor and ardent Bernie Sanders supporter who derides Toscano as a “corporate-backed” Democrat.Mittiga complained last week that the Virginia Democratic Party was trying to obstruct his challenge by withholding access to the state’s voter files. (The party has since found a way to share those materials with primary candidates challenging incumbent Democrats without compromising the incumbent’s campaign data, the party said.)The Democrats gathered for the candidate training were more interested in taking on Republicans, however. Trump’s election also gave 34-year-old Schuyler VanValkenburg the push to run for office. The father of three and high-school government teacher had long considered challenging Jimmie Massie, the 72nd district’s five-term Republican incumbent. Massie’s time in office made him less accountable to his constituents, VanValkenburg said. (Hours after VanValkenburg spoke to The Huffington Post, Massie announced his retirement.)And while Trump may be a primary motivator for many of these candidates, they know they need to localize the issues to win state House seats. VanValkenburg, said he is eager to erode the legislature’s appetite for socially conservative initiatives ― like a so-called bathroom bill enabling anti-transgender discrimination that died in committee in January. He is campaigning on protecting voting rights, improving access to health care and making higher education more affordable, noting that Virginia’s public universities are among the most expensive state schools in the country.“Virginia doesn’t like President Trump,” said VanValkenburg. “There’s a lot of kind of passion in the area.

61,POLITICS,California AG Will Seek Death Penalty In Murder Case Tainted By Government Misconduct,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/orange-county-scott-dekraai_us_58dbed21e4b0cb23e65da681,"Legal experts have called the decision ""very disturbing"" and ""far-fetched.""",2017-03-29,"Scott Dekraai, pictured here in 2014, pleaded guilty to fatally shooting eight people in 2011. His case has been marked by misconduct from prosecutors and sheriff’s deputies, yet the California attorney general has said he will continue to seek the death penalty in the case.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dc11352c00002000ff12b8.jpeg?cache=VcEYHhpqmz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES ― California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Wednesday that he will continue to seek the death penalty against Scott Dekraai, a man who pleaded guilty to killing eight people in 2011, even though the case has been tainted by misconduct from prosecutors and sheriff’s deputies.“After weighing the evidence, considering the law and the responsibilities of my office, I have concluded that the appropriate course of action is to seek the death penalty in this case,” Becerra said in a statement.Orange County Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals ejected the entire Orange County District Attorney’s Office from the Dekraai case in 2015. He found the office’s use of jailhouse informants constituted egregious misconduct. After Goethals’ decision, which a California appeals court affirmed, the state attorney general’s office assumed responsibility for Dekraai’s case. The Justice Department announced in December that it was investigating allegations that the informant program used by the sheriff’s and district attorney’s offices had violated defendants’ rights. Many legal experts are unnerved by the decision to seek the harshest punishment available against Dekraai, considering the uncovered and alleged misconduct in the case. “Given the serious improprieties in the handling of this case ― including the disqualification of the District Attorney’s office for egregious misconduct, as found by the trial court and Court of Appeal ― it is very disturbing that they are seeking the death penalty,” Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of law at the University of California, Irvine, wrote in an email to The Huffington Post.Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University who has written at length about prosecutorial misconduct, said he was “deeply troubled” by Becerra’s decision to pursue the death penalty.“The fact that a different prosecution team ― state, and not the county ― is pursuing it does not remove the taint,” Medwed said. “Before pursuing the ultimate penalty, one hopes prosecutors are extremely confident in the integrity of the underlying evidence ― with respect to the crime itself and any aggravating factors. It seems far-fetched to have such confidence in a case infected by one of the most egregious informant scandals in the past quarter century.”Even relatives of the shooting’s victims have pleaded with prosecutors to abandon the death penalty, although OC Weekly reported in December that they are especially concerned with ending the case quickly. Goethals has also called for new evidentiary hearings in Dekraai’s case, partly because it appears some information had been manipulated and/or destroyed and partly because of allegations that the sheriff still has not turned over all documents related to the informant program.In his 2015 ruling, Goethals said a pair of sheriff’s deputies “either intentionally lied or willfully withheld information” about the existence of a jail database on informants when they testified in the Dekraai case. He also admonished the district attorney’s office for failing to turn over records pertaining to Fernando Perez, an especially prolific informant at the center of Dekraai’s case. Dekraai’s attorney, assistant public defender Scott Sanders, has argued that prosecutors and sheriff’s deputies intentionally planted Perez next to Dekraai in order to glean incriminating information from him ― a violation of his constitutional rights ― and then concealed that effort. Becerra’s office did not directly inform Dekraai’s defense team of its decision to continue to seek the death penalty, Sanders told The Huffington Post. He said his defense team was “very disappointed” to hear the news. “However, as will begin to show very soon, the misconduct that has poisoned this litigation is far more extensive than even known to the defense a few months ago,” he said. “We look forward fully adjudicating all of the issues relevant to this case.”Sanders has filed a series of blockbuster motions to unearth evidence that a secret, tainted snitch network has for decades existed in county jails. He alleges that county prosecutors and police have violated multiple defendants’ rights by illegally obtaining, and sometimes withholding, evidence received from jail informants. His discoveries have led to the unraveling of multiple murder cases in the county. Some accused murderers have had their sentences vacated. It’s not unusual or illegal for authorities use informants to help bolster cases. But Sanders alleges that in some Orange County cases, informants held recorded and unrecorded conversations with inmates who were already represented by lawyers, which violates an inmate’s right to counsel. Prosecutors then allegedly took damning evidence gathered by the informants and presented it in court, while withholding evidence that could have been beneficial to the defense — which is a violation of a defendant’s right to due process. It remains unclear exactly how many cases in the county may have been affected by tainted informant evidence. Sanders has argued that every case involving a jailhouse informant in Orange County over the last 30 years deserves to be re-examined.And the scandal continues to grow. Just last year, Goethals made public 242 pages of notes, known as the “special handling log.” The log reveals the inner workings of the county’s informant program and appears to contradict testimony given by multiple deputies. The district attorney’s office conceded that the log contradicts statements made by multiple witnesses, including several members of law enforcement who had testified during hearings in the Dekraai case. The pages represent just a fraction of the total 1,157-page database, still largely under seal, which was used between 2008 and 2013 and maintained by sheriff’s special handling deputies. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas has maintained that no one in his office intentionally behaved inappropriately in relation to the jailhouse informant program. OCSD argues similarly and that it has taken steps to create more robust ways of documenting and managing inmates."
62,PARENTS,Mom's Viral Post Offers Important Message About Car Seat Safety,Caroline Bologna,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/moms-viral-post-offers-important-message-about-car-seat-safety_us_58d9a3bae4b0f805b32314cf,"""I think this is a great visual and shows just how important proper car seat use is.""",2017-03-29,"“I wasn’t as educated about car seats when I had my daughters,” McNamara said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dc022a1d0000f42c7d1320.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On an ordinary day, Maine mom Rachel McNamara was adjusting the straps on her toddler son’s car seat when an idea struck. “I had him sit in his car seat and get all buckled up to make sure it looked good, and I thought, ‘Lets do a fun little test,’” she told The Huffington Post. “I flipped him up and had my husband take a quick picture.”McNamara shared two photos from the “test” and a caption about car seat safety on Facebook and was overwhelmed to see the post quickly go viral. The mom’s original caption stated, “After strapping your child into their car seat, ask yourself if you’d be comfortable flipping it upside down. Remember that the chest clip should be at armpit level and the straps should be tight enough to pass the pinch test. #carseatsafety.”The post attracted a lot of attention from fellow parents. To date, it’s been shared almost 50,000 times. Following the initial burst of viral fame, McNamara updated the caption with some additional clarifications and links to car seat safety resources.“First, I’d like to clarify that I’m not advocating that parents should be flipping their kids upside down before every car ride,” she explained. “Just that they should feel confident that their child would be safe IF the car seat was flipped over in an accident. I think this is a great visual and shows just how important proper car seat use is.”McNamara emphasized the importance of reading your car seat’s manual before installing and adjusting and clarified what the “pinch test” entails. She also advised parents to reach out to their local child passenger safety technician for assistance, keep their kids rear-facing for at least their first two years, and avoid “aftermarket products” and used car seats from untrustworthy sources.“Car accidents are the leading cause of injury and death in children,” she wrote. “People might also say, ‘Twenty years ago I didn’t even wear a seatbelt and I’m perfectly fine!’ Well, that person got lucky. There are many children who are not alive today to tell their story.”She added, “Times have changed. There are more drivers on the road today. We have more distracted drivers due to cell phones. We also know a lot more than we knew back then about children’s bones and development. Car seats are constantly evolving to become safer.”McNamara has two daughters, ages 7 and 8, in addition to her 2-year-old son. She told HuffPost she developed a passion for car seat safety during her most recent pregnancy. “I wasn’t as educated about car seats when I had my daughters,” she said. “Unfortunately I made some of the same mistakes that I talk about in my post. A favorite phrase I live by now is ‘Know better, do better.’”Ultimately, the mom hopes parents who read her post learn more about car seat safety. And in lieu of flipping their children upside down (”because accidents do happen”), McNamara said they can simply ensure that the chest clip is at armpit level and the straps pass the pinch test.“The biggest thing I want people to take from my post is that accidents can happen anywhere, at any time to anyone,” she said. “Proper car seat use could be the difference between life or death. It’s a little hard to hear that, but it’s true. And if someone is trying to give you advice about car seat safety, please don’t think they’re judging you or think you’re a bad parent. They care!”"

Lamar Smith instead promotes the work of right-wing website Breitbart news.,2017-03-29,"Rep.

Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, has challenged the credibility of Science magazine — one of the world’s most respected science publications.“That is not known as an objective writer or magazine,” Smith said during a hearing Wednesday on climate change, which Smith denies.Smith’s comment came after testimony by Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, who cited a news article published last week about Smith’s attendance at a conference of global warming skeptics hosted by the conservative Heartland Institute. The article’s author, Jeffrey Mervis, called out Smith for using his House committee as a “tool to advance his political agenda rather than a forum to examine important issues facing the U.S. research community.”To Smith’s assertion that Science magazine is not objective, Mann responded, “Well, it’s Science magazine.” Science is a publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.A spokeswoman for Science told HuffPost via email that the magazine’s news department “follows journalistic principles and strives to be neutral and objective in its reporting.” As for research papers published in the Science family of journals, “various editorial departments employ a rigorous, multi-step, peer-review process, one central to the integrity of the material published,” she said.Criticism of the magazine by the head of the House committee tasked with overseeing America’s scientific research programs would be shocking if that person wasn’t Smith, who has a long history of denying mainstream climate science, running to the defense of the fossil fuel industry and harassing federal climate scientists.While Smith apparently doesn’t trust Science, he has been a devoted follower and contributing writer of the hyper-conservative Breitbart news site.Late last year, as HuffPost reported, the House Science Committee appeared to mock “climate alarmists” in a post to Twitter. The tweet linked to a Breitbart story that argued — incorrectly ― that a short-term drop in global temperatures proved climate change isn’t happening. The tweet drew a response from The Weather Channel, which blasted both Breitbart and the House Science Committee. Smith and the committee drew similar criticism in February, when they promoted an article published in the British tabloid The Daily Mail with the headline, “Exposed: How World Leaders Were Duped Into Investing Billions Over Manipulated Global Warming Data.” In his ongoing attempt to make something out of a fake climate scandal, Smith accused the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ― yet again ― of playing “fast and loose” with data, and the Obama administration of pushing its “costly climate agenda.”The study in question, led by NOAA scientist Thomas Karl and published in 2015 in the journal Science (also a publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science), found that an apparent slowing trend, or hiatus, in the rate of global warming from 1998 to 2012 was the result of its own biased data. The agency corrected its analysis to account for differences between ships’ measurements and those of more accurate at-sea buoys, which increased the estimated rate of warming over the previous 15 years.At Wednesday’s hearing, Mann blasted Smith for his attacks on Karl and NOAA, which included issuing subpoenas to obtain communications related to the federal agency’s analysis. He said public attacks on climate climate scientists are “meant to send a chilling signal to the entire research community; that ‘If you too publish and speak out about the threat of human-caused climate change, we’re going to come after you, too.’”The hearing, titled “Climate Science: Assumptions, Policy Implications, and the Scientific Method,” was billed as a way to “examine the scientific method and process as it relates to climate change.” What played out instead was a back-and-forth debate about whether the vast majority of climate scientists — roughly 97 percent — are correct in their consensus that climate change is real and that humans are the primary cause. With the majority party choosing the bulk of the hearing’s witnesses, speakers leaned heavily in Smith’s favor, with three prominent climate skeptics joined by Mann, the minority’s choice, who advocates the urgent need to tackle human-caused climate change head-on.Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Oregon) described the hearing as “unproductive,” and said she wished the discussion had on focused finding ways to address the risks of climate change.“For a balanced panel we’d need 96 more Mr. Manns,” Bonamici said.Smith said in beginning the hearing that he believes “the climate is changing and that humans play a role.” But “significant questions remain as to the extent,” he said, and “our actions must be based on sound science.” Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), the ranking Democratic member of the committee, said the “long-established scientific understanding of the reality of climate change ends at the doorstep of the Republican National Committee.”“Even on this committee on science, Republican members have postulated sometimes unique theories about climate change, some of which have become punchlines on late night television,” Johnson said.

65,POLITICS,How Sweden's Feminist Foreign Minister Is Dealing With The Age Of Trump And Brexit,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/margot-wallstrom-sweden-donald-trump_us_58dac86ee4b01ca7b4279db5,"Margot Wallstrom pushes forward on international cooperation, equality and correcting the record on refugees.",2017-03-29,Migrants board a train to Sweden from Denmark on in September 2015.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dacae61400002000072082.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallström is used to her strong convictions making her job harder.After she announced that Sweden would become the first Western European power to recognize Palestine as a state, Wallström faced condemnations from Jerusalem and Washington. When she criticized Saudi Arabia’s draconian restrictions on women and flogging of an imprisoned blogger, she earned the ire of Swedish business leaders worried about their country’s lucrative trade with the kingdom. Israeli officials continue to snub her, and it took an intervention from Sweden’s prime minister and its king to defuse tensions with the Saudis. Still, the minister has remained firm in her views, proudly championing a foreign policy that puts a high value on principles ― particularly gender equality ― not just pragmatism. President Donald Trump poses the greatest challenge yet to this principled diplomacy. With the U.S. now run by a man who sees foreign affairs as a game of transactions, narrowly defined national interest and wall-building, figures like Wallström must decide how to protect their vision while maintaining good relations with Washington. As the U.S. and U.K. grow more isolationist, the future of international cooperation increasingly relies on small but determined countries such as Sweden.“We have seen so much of populism, polarization, protectionism and all of these isms ... that lead our world, as I see it, in a wrong direction and will not help us to create more jobs and more wealth and everything that we want,” Wallström said in an interview with HuffPost last week, during her first trip to Washington since Trump took office. “And more peace!” she added. Without direct condemnations of the president, Wallström offered a broad defense of the internationalist worldview Trump and his allies in Europe call obsolete. “We see countries turning inward, thinking they can just look after their own interests, but there are few problems or challenges that one country can solve on its own,” she said. “I don’t think that there is a way back to something that existed. We have to live in this world. And I think our children and grandchildren will not forgive us if we cannot come together.” Sweden wants to work with Trump on issues like fighting the so-called Islamic State, European security and humanitarian crises. Wallström was in town to attend a meeting of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS.But there’s no denying the disconnect between Stockholm and Washington. Wallström’s left-wing, avowedly feminist government is already subtly highlighting it: Its ambassador to the United Nations, Olof Skoog, criticized Trump’s depiction of the U.N. in January, as Sweden took up an influential position on the Security Council; the following month, Deputy Prime Minister Isabella Lövin posted a tweet apparently mocking Trump’s all-male photoshoots. Three weeks ago, Sweden pledged $22 million to the global health organizations Trump has targeted with his ban on U.S. support for groups that even discuss abortion. Powerful men in elected office “often start by taking decisions that restrict the movement of women or how women dress or violence against women, so that is also something they seem to have in common, and that worries me a lot,” Wallström said, in an indirect reference to Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who recently decriminalized some forms of domestic violence.As the face of Sweden abroad, Wallström bears the greatest responsibility for her country’s relationship with the new U.S. administration. And the biggest Trump-Sweden moment so far was a reminder that stability is far from assured. On Feb. 18, the president told a Florida rally that Sweden proved his point about the danger of accepting refugees: “You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,” Trump said. “Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.”It was quintessential Trump: It turned out there was no incident, and he was referring to a Fox News report in which an expert misled viewers about an increase in crime since Sweden began accepting refugees. After declining to comment in the immediate aftermath, Wallström now says she wants to use the news peg the president provided.“We are trying to use [it] to just give a more balanced picture of Sweden,” Wallström told HuffPost. “It’s maybe difficult [to integrate refugees] in some places, but it is not out of control. ... I don’t know where they got that from.”Sweden has introduced new border controls in the wake of the refugee crisis and participated in a controversial deal with Turkey to reduce the flow of people moving into Europe. But it continues to accept large numbers of asylum-seekers ― 29,000 in 2016 and up to 45,000 this year ― and offer them generous social support.“We just have to get the numbers down so that we can manage,” Wallström said, noting that Sweden had received an exceptionally high number of young refugees, who require greater state care. “But we are not changing our rules or laws on exactly what you can get. We want to continue to be able to take care of all the refugees and asylum-seekers in a decent and dignified way and to have them fully integrated.”  For some on the anti-immigrant right, like Breitbart and pro-Russian news outlets that frequently spread untruths about refugees to stir up tension in Europe, Sweden’s border control could be seen as a vindication. But Wallström doesn’t buy that. Whereas right-wing politicians say European centralization is one source of the crisis ― preventing countries from rejecting migrants wholesale ― Wallström says the trouble is too little European coordination.“This would not have been a problem at all if we had together in the European Union shared responsibility,” Wallström said. Ultra-nationalist governments in Hungary and Poland have been stridently anti-refugee, increasing the burden on others like Sweden and Germany. There’s now a government-wide challenge to false portrayals of the situation. In Washington, Sweden’s high-profile embassy is running events with the tagline “Safe And Sound” to argue that societies don’t have to sacrifice openness, diversity and liberalism for the sake of security. The campaign’s first event was the launch of a major exhibit on how refugee integration works in Sweden ― featuring a high-ranking U.S. Department of Homeland Security official. Asked at the opening about language in Trump’s Muslim bans that presents anti-refugee measures as important to protect women, Åsa Regnér, the minister for gender equality, noted that levels of violence against women in Sweden have remained relatively constant in recent years. To experts like her, this scapegoating of immigrants is a clear misrepresentation: Misogyny does take specific and troubling forms in migrant communities, but it’s deceptive to pretend that closing the borders will lead to equality. “We know that there is violence in the [ethnically Swedish] majority, and there is also violence among the first and second generation of immigrants, and we have to really understand those and take targeted measures,” Regnér said. “I feel we have to speak of both things.” The refugee policy is only one part of how Sweden’s approach veers from Trump’s policies.Wallström’s government proudly funds efforts to include more women at the U.N. peace talks on Syria, and she doesn’t buy Trump-style suggestions that the West embrace strongman Bashar Assad. “It ought to be for the people of Syria to decide who should be their leader ... but the confidence will be affected by the fact that so many war crimes have been committed,” she said. Sweden recently used its temporary U.N. Security Council seat to try to punish Assad for his use of chemical weapons.With Russia boosting its presence in the Baltic Sea and violating Swedish airspace, Wallström’s government has reaffirmed its commitment to Sweden’s traditional nonalignment. At the same time, it wants Putin to respect the international norm of territorial sovereignty ― in Ukraine and in Sweden’s neighborhood. Stockholm has boosted its defenses, including by reintroducing conscription. “We have to be very clear about our policy toward Russia: When you do things like the illegal annexation of Crimea or the aggression in eastern Ukraine, then we will adopt a policy that includes sanctions,” Wallström said. This kind of commitment to principles entails costs ― to prestige and to delicate, important relationships. Wallström acknowledged reports that the anti-ISIS coalition has killed hundreds of civilians since Trump took office, urging accountability for those who have potentially committed war crimes. And she slammed Turkey, the key to the E.U.’s refugee plans, for its crackdown on civil society and increasingly heated rhetoric about European governments.A Social Democrat, the minister thinks the global left can still recapture popular support despite the rise of groups ― like the Front National in France and the far right in the U.S. ― who successfully pitch a mix of ultra-nationalism and popular, traditionally left-wing state spending.“We lost our vision more than anything else. We have not been able to describe the tasks in front of us,” Wallström said. She wants greater focus on the state’s role in tackling wealth gaps, climate change and future sustainable development.Without that focus, voters see globalization as necessarily causing the growing inequality economists like Thomas Piketty have warned about, Wallström said. “It’s ironic, of course, that it’s the very wealthy people who seem to be elected.”As the interview concluded, the minister prepared to head to the big anti-ISIS summit. After all the talk of principle, Wallström made a little show of Trump-era pragmatism ― her press secretary offered a printout of information about Sweden’s success. First topic: the ease of doing business there."

We have to do something,’"" Jane Goodall finds.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58db0bbe1400008806072123.jpeg?cache=o32nHzVfLR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — In the face of enormous environmental challenges, including climate change and a biodiversity crisis, Jane Goodall, now 82, continues to spread a hopeful message about the future. But even the famed conservationist, a natural optimist, can recognize a dark day for the planet when she sees one.Asked about President Donald Trump’s signing of an executive order earlier in the day to reverse Obama-era policies aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, Goodall told The Huffington Post that she found it “immensely depressing.”“Many of us, not just my institute but many, we’ve been working really hard to create the Paris [climate] agreement and global efforts to cut emissions,” she said. “Thinking that the USA isn’t going to play its part, such an industrial country, is really very, very sad. And it means we’re going to have to work harder.” Hours after Trump signed his executive order, which essentially derails America’s climate action, Goodall, a United Nations “messenger of peace,” addressed students at American University in Washington, D.C. Before her speech, however, she sat down with several members of the media, fielding questions about Trump, climate change and more.In her extensive travels, Goodall says, she has come face-to-face with the effects of our changing climate. Not being an expert in that field, however, she relies on the scientists who are, including Nicholas Stern, chair of London’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.“I would not dream of refuting the science that shows climate change is happening,” she said. “It’s happening everywhere. It’s already having devastating effects in many parts of the world. The droughts are getting worse, flooding’s getting worse. Storms, hurricanes are getting more frequent and more violent. And the main thing is unpredictability. Everywhere I go, people say, ‘Well it’s not normally like that at this time of year.’”Trump, of course, has described climate change as “bullshit” and as a “hoax” created by the Chinese, and the president has vowed to withdraw the U.S. from global actions to combat it, namely the historic Paris climate agreement. Goodall said this trip marks her first to the U.S. since Trump took office and admitted it feels different.“There is definitely a feeling of gloom and doom among all the people I know,” she said, responding to a question from The Guardian’s David Smith. “If we allow this feeling of doom and gloom to continue, then it will be very, very bad. But my job is to give people hope.”And as she sees it, there is one bit of hope that has come out of the Trump administration: It has woken people up.“People who were apathetic before, who didn’t seem to care, now suddenly it’s like they’ve heard a trumpet call — ‘What can we do? We have to do something.’ And these are people thinking about future generations, not just themselves.”Goodall declined to share her personal feelings about the president, whose behavior she once compared to the chimpanzees she spent decades studying in the wild. “I’m not going to tell you because you’ll print it,” she said with a laugh.She did, however, offer some advice for the politicians in Washington: “Please, when you make a decision, get your heart involved in it and think about the future of your children and your grandchildren.” Today, she doesn’t see that happening.“I see it being unraveled. But hopefully we can change it,” she said. “The main thing when one’s confronted with political pushback is not to give up. We will prevail — somehow. Think of all the marches and demonstrations, people really have woken up. It is the hope I think.” "
68,POLITICS,What The Trump Administration Needs To Tell The Kremlin,"Andrea Prasow, ContributorDeputy Washington Director at Human Rights Watch",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-the-trump-administration-needs-to-tell-the-kremlin_us_58dc001fe4b07f61a2bb8ad6,That the White House spoke up at all about this week's events is a sign that public pressure is working.,2017-03-29,"Law enforcement officers detain an opposition supporter during a rally in Moscow, Russia, March 26, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dc2a551400008806072414.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With Alexandra Schmitt, Advocacy Coordinator at Human Rights Watch News of Russia has dominated the Washington press for weeks. Whether, when, and to what extent President Trump and his advisors had contacts with Russian officials prior to his electoral win has provided endless fodder for pundits and politicians alike, not least in light of revelations that it is the subject of an FBI investigation. At the same time, there was deafening silence from the Trump administration as a Syrian bombing campaign with Russian help killed civilians in the northern city of Aleppo.This weekend, the winds shifted. Anti-corruption protests broke out across Russia in the biggest sign of discontent since 2011. Thousands took to the streets in almost 100 cities in response to a corruption video that highlighted the alleged fortune of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader whose organization released the video, was arrested on Sunday and police raided his organization’s office. Some estimates said that over 1,000 people were detained, including 11 journalists reporting on the protests according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.Surprisingly, despite Trump’s reluctance to date to criticize Putin’s human rights record (Trump’s infamous “You think our country’s so innocent?” retort comes to mind), the administration spoke up. A State Department statement called on Russia “to immediately release all peaceful protesters” and affirmed that the Trump administration believes that “[d]etaining peaceful protesters, human rights observers, and journalists is an affront to core democratic values.” The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, read the statement aloud in the White House briefing on Monday. There was however no tweet on the issue from either Trump’s personal Twitter account or the official presidential account.But it is a sign that the growing pressure from Congress and the U.S. public is working. The widespread condemnation of Trump’s attempts to cozy up to Vladimir Putin is increasingly coming from Trump’s own party – from Senator Marco Rubio’s strong questioning of then-nominee for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to Senator Lindsey Graham’s hearing on Russian aggression towards it neighbors.Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, called on the administration to speak up about the protests, declaring, “Free speech is what we’re all about and Americans expect our leaders to call out thugs who trample the basic human rights of speech, press, assembly, and protest.” Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, a leading Democratic voice in the Senate on Russia’s human rights abuses, also urged the Trump administration in a statement on Sunday to make human rights and democratic principles a priority in its relations with Russia.Russian authorities deemed most of the 95 protests ‘illegal’ – unsurprising, given the increasingly repressive environment and closing space for discontent in Russia. Under a crackdown that began in 2012, Russian authorities have harshened penalties for unsanctioned protests, and allowed few protests that are critical of the government. Russian authorities have also clamped down on free and opposition media, restricted internet access, and imposed new laws that restrict nongovernmental groups and activists.This domestic crackdown has of course occurred as President Vladimir Putin has positioned himself as a strong man who can restore Russia’s reputation on the world stage as a great power. Yet he has done so by supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s weak grasp on power in Syria and seizing Crimea in Ukraine. Human Rights Watch has documented the horrifying effects of this foreign policy, from questions about its role in war crimes in Aleppo to the pervasive climate of fear and repression in Crimea. Russia’s promises to abide by international law by impartially investigating civilian casualties from Russian airstrikes in Syria appear to have been broken.With Russia’s economic crisis, the Kremlin needs to sell the public on his victories and portray Putin’s leadership as the only solution to the country’s problems. By clamping down on a free press, by controlling all media and internet access, the Kremlin has promoted a fanciful narrative that projects an image of Russian power and strength on the world stage.But the protests are an indication that this strategy has limited effectiveness and that young people at least are hearing other messages. The weekend protests, while small relative to 2011, highlighted growing public discontent with the economic situation. No one knows exactly how much Russia is spending on military campaigns abroad, but the operations in Syria cannot be cheap. Meanwhile, real household incomes in Russia declined by as much as 15 percent between 2014 and late 2016 according to some estimates, yet many powerful people have amassed colossal personal wealth, exacerbating the country’s staggering economic inequality. Transparency International ranked Russia 131 out of 174 countries on its corruption index in 2016.Now more than ever, U.S. officials should make clear to the Kremlin that the U.S. will not partner with Putin on his abusive campaign in Syria, and that the U.S. will speak out against Russia’s repressive policies at home. If Trump really wants to pursue a close relationship with Putin the least he can do is use that to pressure him to ease up on nongovernmental groups. Many of the weekend protesters were young. They made clear that they want a future free of corruption. Despite the Kremlin’s tight control of the media, messages do reach them. The message from the U.S. should be one of solidarity and support, as the young Russians press for basic human rights and freedoms. Let that be the story that dominates the Washington press this week."

71,POLITICS,GOP Congressman Turns Science Committee Into Platform For His Own Anti-Science Views,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-house-science-committee-us_us_58d94964e4b02a2eaab64c3b,Rep. Lamar Smith has invited three climate change skeptics to discuss the issue at a hearing this week.,2017-03-28,"Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, in 2013. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58da6f101d0000cf3b7d0e5e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) — one of Congress’ most outspoken climate change deniers — is using the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology to push his own agenda. In addition to harassing federal climate scientists and issuing subpoenas to seemingly everyone looking into oil giant Exxon Mobil’s suppression of climate change research, the committee chairman is loading hearings with witnesses who largely agree with his personal views. It’s normal for the majority party to pick the bulk of a hearing’s panelists. What many find shocking, however, is who Smith is choosing to invite. The congressman tackled the subject of “Making EPA Great Again” last month by turning to a coal lawyer, a chemical industry lobbyist and a libertarian scholar who recently accused the Environmental Protection Agency of “regulatory terrorism.” The committee’s Democratic minority chose the fourth witness: Rush Holt Jr., chief executive of the nonprofit American Association for the Advancement of Science. Wednesday is shaping up to be more of the same, with a panel of witnesses stacked 3-to-1 in Smith’s favor. This time around, the subject is climate change. The hearing, titled “Climate Science: Assumptions, Policy Implications, and the Scientific Method,” will “examine the scientific method and process as it relates to climate change” and “focus on the underlying science that helps inform policy decisions,” according to a hearing charter. To do that, Smith has invited a trio of prominent, like-minded climate change skeptics.The ultimate goal, as the committee noted on Twitter, will be “making scientific debate great again.”While speaking at a climate conference hosted by the conservative Heartland Institute last week, Smith blasted the Obama administration and the “liberal political agenda.” He also praised President Donald Trump’s efforts to undo Barack Obama’s climate legacy and promoted the upcoming committee hearing to discuss climate change and the scientific method ― something he said is “repeatedly ignored by the so-called, self-professed climate scientists.”The audience applauded each time the congressman read off the name of a chosen witness.The first person he named was Judith Curry, president of Climate Forecast Applications Network, who retired in January as a professor at Georgia Institute of Technology’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. Curry defended EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt when he told CNBC that he does not believe carbon dioxide is to blame for global warming.“If I am interpreting Pruitt’s statements correctly, I do not find anything to disagree with in what he said: we don’t know how much of recent warming can be attributed to humans,” Curry wrote in a blog post. Second on Smith’s list of witnesses is Roger Pielke Jr., an environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado often cited by climate change skeptics. “I believe climate change is real and that human emissions of greenhouse gases risk justifying action, including a carbon tax,” Peilke wrote last year in the Wall Street Journal. “But my research led me to a conclusion that many climate campaigners find unacceptable: There is scant evidence to indicate that hurricanes, floods, tornadoes or drought have become more frequent or intense in the U.S. or globally.”And finally, Smith named John Christy, a professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama. The “danger just isn’t there,” Christy has said in reference to global warming, arguing that there’s no smoking gun to prove human activity is the main culprit.Smith paused before reading off the final witness, who had been chosen by the committee’s Democratic minority.“Before you applaud, let me read the name,” he warned, as the audience laughed. “Last witness is Michael Mann.” The crowd booed loudly. “That’s why it’s going to be a good hearing,” Smith chuckled.Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, tweeted that he found it an “honored to be booed” at the Koch Brothers-funded, anti-science, “climate denier” event.Smith acknowledged at the Heartland conference that the House Science Committee is “now a tool to advance his political agenda rather than a forum to examine important issues facing the U.S. research community,” Science magazine’s Jeffrey Mervis reported.Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), the ranking Democratic member of the committee, echoed that sentiment in an email to The Huffington Post.“The Chairman unfortunately has ignored the overwhelming majority of scientists around the world who represent the scientific consensus on climate science, instead calling three witnesses friendly to his anti-science, pro-industry point of view — witnesses who have already collectively appeared in front of Congress at least 20 times over the past decade,” she said. “I am saddened that the Chairman has taken this great Committee that was once at the forefront of our [research and development] policy-making and turned it into a vehicle to advance his political agenda at the cost of diminishing its standing in the eyes of the scientific community,” she added. Mann told HuffPost via email that he’s attending Wednesday’s hearing to “attempt to inject some actual facts and some actual climate science in a Washington D.C. atmosphere where ‘alternative facts’ and industry-funded science denialism have run amok.”Given his audience and fellow panelists, however, that may prove easier said than done.During his speech last week, Smith argued the Obama administration spent years promoting its political agenda rather than relying on “good, sound science,” and that the “days of trust-me science are over.”“They often regularly claimed that extreme weather, hurricanes and severe storms were getting worse due to human-caused climate change,” he said of members of Obama’s administration. “They never let science get in the way of their assertions.”Ironically, a study Mann co-authored that links extreme weather events to climate change was published Monday in Nature Scientific Reports.As Curry noted in a post to her blog, the event will be “high theater for climate geeks.”“Get your popcorn ready,” she wrote.

72,POLITICS,Ana's Fate Rested With An Asylum Officer Who Had Just Been Told To Doubt Her Word,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-asylum-seekers-deportation_us_58d990b3e4b00f68a5ca030f,She showed up at the border bearing a scar from a gunshot wound to the head.

He ordered a tostada, then remained standing at the entrance even as another waitress invited him several times to take a seat. Instead, he took a few steps toward Ana, pulled out a gun and pointed it at her face.She froze, looking him in the eyes without speaking. His hand trembled. When a co-worker saw the gun and screamed, the boy pulled the trigger. The bullet grazed Ana’s head and she fell to the floor, hoping he’d think she was dead and leave her alone.She reported the attack to the police, but they didn’t arrest anyone. Authorities suspected he was a gang member and might have confused her with someone else or attempted to kill her as part of an initiation rite. To protect herself, she moved to a town nearby.But a few months ago, she ran into him again. Now a fully grown man, he was bulkier but still wore baggy pants. She could tell he recognized her from the way he stared. “All that fear I had became reality again,” she said.When she saw him a few weeks later, he raised his hand, extending his fingers toward her as if they were the barrel of a gun. Fearing that he wanted to kill her for reporting the shooting, she fled the country with her 3-year-old daughter, traveling overland through Mexico and into the United States.Ana, whom we are identifying with a pseudonym because she fears for her life if she’s deported, told all this to a U.S. asylum officer last month. The officer didn’t disbelieve her story, according to a record of the interview. But after they spoke, he checked the box on her application that read “credible fear NOT established.” Instead of sending her claim for asylum onto an immigration court, the interview fast-tracked her for deportation back to Guatemala.Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to deport Ana on Tuesday, returning her to a country where she thinks she’ll be killed.“I’m not lying,” Ana told The Huffington Post by phone from the Karnes County Residential Center in Texas, where the 24-year-old has been detained for the last month. “I thought I was safe. Why don’t they believe me?”Asylum is the best known of several ways that unauthorized immigrants can obtain legal permission to remain in the United States when they fear for their safety at home. The bar for establishing “credible fear” ― the first step in the asylum process ― had been low for most of the Obama administration, requiring officers to err on the side of leniency so that people don’t get deported to a place where they’ll be killed, tortured or abused. But last month, President Donald Trump’s administration ordered asylum officers to take a more skeptical approach in these interviews, making it more likely that the U.S. will deport people whose cases previously would have advanced to an immigration court. Ana had her interview on Feb. 27, the day the new rules went into effect.Claims for asylum (and other forms of relief from deportation) can often take years to settle, so most who pass the credible-fear interview are released from detention while their cases wind through the courts. But a negative ruling on credible fear prevents immigration judges from setting bond hearings for those detained and makes deportation quicker and easier.It’s impossible to say whether any specific person would have passed that first step in the asylum process under past presidents. Asylum officers have wide latitude to make their determinations. And even once a person clears that first step, judges’ rulings on who eventually is granted asylum status vary widely between jurisdictions and individual cases.But several experts consulted by HuffPost, as well as the attorneys who represent Ana, thought her case would have easily passed muster under the previous administration’s guidelines. Manoj Govindaiah, the director for family detention services at the legal group RAICES, said Ana’s case shows that Trump’s new rules are already pushing asylum seekers into deportation more swiftly.“The new guidance raises the bar as to what is considered a credible fear of return,” Govindaiah said. “We believe that if her interview had been only a few days earlier, she would not be facing deportation today.”Denise Gilman, a lawyer who is trying to help Ana avoid deportation, agreed that Trump’s new directives undermined her client’s claim.“It does appear that she was denied based on the new guidelines,” Gilman said. “It was a perfectly viable case.”Ana is part of a wave of tens of thousands of Central American mothers who have entered the United States with their children since 2014. The Obama administration hastily established two new family detention centers ― including the Karnes facility, where she has been detained ― in an effort to dissuade the women from coming. The mothers and their children generally apply for asylum or other humanitarian exemptions from deportation. The vast majority of those detained at the two family detention centers in Texas were making it over the first hurdle. The credible-fear approval rate hovered around 85 to 95 percent over the last two years, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Trump has accused immigrants of abusing this system to avoid deportation. Ana appealed the decision on her credible-fear claim after getting legal advice from lawyers with RAICES. When she went before a judge, she also raised the fact that she had been sexually abused by her father, who she says abused her mother as well. But the judge denied her appeal. Gilman said the judge held that the abuse claim wasn’t credible because Ana hadn’t raised it in her initial interview.The news sank Ana into desperation. Guards at the facility put her on medical observation for the day to keep her from taking her own life. She composed herself to avoid giving the impression that she is not competent to care for her child. “If it wasn’t for my daughter, I think it would have been better to die at that moment so I wouldn’t have to live with this anguish,” she said.It’s unclear whether others like Ana, who might have once passed their credible-fear interviews, are now being rejected. Citizenship and Immigration Services could not immediately provide updated statistics, which are compiled by quarter.Blaine Bookey, co-legal director of the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, said Ana likely had several avenues to apply for asylum. Failing to raise the sexual abuse claim during a credible-fear interview is common, she noted, because women often aren’t comfortable disclosing such abuse and many times don’t know that it could help their cases ― unless they have lawyers to tell them.“This case really demonstrates the complete lack of understanding ― whether it’s willful or through ignorance ― of the impact of trauma on the survivors at these interviews,” Bookey said. “A woman experiencing sexual abuse wouldn’t be immediately forthcoming about it in the context of a credible-fear interview.”While it’s too early to tell if cases like Ana’s will become more common, Stephen Legomsky, who served as head counsel for Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013, said the message of the Trump administration’s revised guidance is unmistakable: Reject more claims.“Asylum officers are going to read between the lines and distill that the guidance is ‘deny more cases,’” said Legomsky.As for Ana, he said, “It does seem to me that based on the assertion of domestic violence in combination with the gun threat, that she has at least a ‘significant possibility’ of succeeding in an asylum claim, which is what the statute says.”Ana has struggled to sleep since the judge rejected her first appeal. She said her daughter sometimes wakes up crying in the middle of the night.On Monday afternoon, Immigration and Customs Enforcement rejected her lawyer’s second request to reconsider the deportation. She could be on a plane back to Guatemala as early as midnight.“I don’t want to go back,” Ana said. “This man wants to kill me.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Blaine Bookey’s role with the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies."

When she went before a judge, she also raised the fact that she had been sexually abused by her father, who she says abused her mother as well. But the judge denied her appeal. Gilman said the judge held that the abuse claim wasn’t credible because Ana hadn’t raised it in her initial interview.The news sank Ana into desperation. Guards at the facility put her on medical observation for the day to keep her from taking her own life. She composed herself to avoid giving the impression that she is not competent to care for her child. “If it wasn’t for my daughter, I think it would have been better to die at that moment so I wouldn’t have to live with this anguish,” she said.It’s unclear whether others like Ana, who might have once passed their credible-fear interviews, are now being rejected. Citizenship and Immigration Services could not immediately provide updated statistics, which are compiled by quarter.Blaine Bookey, co-legal director of the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, said Ana likely had several avenues to apply for asylum. Failing to raise the sexual abuse claim during a credible-fear interview is common, she noted, because women often aren’t comfortable disclosing such abuse and many times don’t know that it could help their cases ― unless they have lawyers to tell them.“This case really demonstrates the complete lack of understanding ― whether it’s willful or through ignorance ― of the impact of trauma on the survivors at these interviews,” Bookey said. “A woman experiencing sexual abuse wouldn’t be immediately forthcoming about it in the context of a credible-fear interview.”While it’s too early to tell if cases like Ana’s will become more common, Stephen Legomsky, who served as head counsel for Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013, said the message of the Trump administration’s revised guidance is unmistakable: Reject more claims.“Asylum officers are going to read between the lines and distill that the guidance is ‘deny more cases,’” said Legomsky.As for Ana, he said, “It does seem to me that based on the assertion of domestic violence in combination with the gun threat, that she has at least a ‘significant possibility’ of succeeding in an asylum claim, which is what the statute says.”Ana has struggled to sleep since the judge rejected her first appeal. She said her daughter sometimes wakes up crying in the middle of the night.On Monday afternoon, Immigration and Customs Enforcement rejected her lawyer’s second request to reconsider the deportation. She could be on a plane back to Guatemala as early as midnight.“I don’t want to go back,” Ana said. “This man wants to kill me.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Blaine Bookey’s role with the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies."

She was initially opposed to Brexit, but is now tasked with spearheading the impending departure. Her administration faces extraordinary challenges over the next couple years as negotiations with the EU unfold, and the stakes are critically high.Westminster must now race to develop a new strategy of self-governance while recasting relationships and trade deals with the EU and other major partners before the two-year deadline arrives. It will also have to fight to defend the evolving rights of its citizens and decide the fates of EU nationals living in the U.K.Furthermore, May’s government will have to establish the parameters of the “hard Brexit” it has committed to ― meaning Brits will lose access to the European single market, which refers to the EU as one territory without internal borders. They will also have to bid farewell to “free movement” — one of the EU’s fundamental principles that allows its citizens to live and work in other member states without obtaining special permits.British negotiators are certainly hoping for smooth talks with the EU, but could face resistance and tough terms from Brussels leaders trying to discourage other members from leaving. The final Brexit deal will require approval from a “qualified majority” of EU member states, and can be vetoed by the European Parliament.Beyond bargaining with the remaining 27 members of the EU, Britain is also dealing with intensifying inner turmoil: Dismayed by Britain’s decision to leave the bloc, the Scottish government is now pushing for a new independence referendum of its own to leave the U.K.Scottish lawmakers have backed First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s bid for the proposed secession vote, but it cannot take place without Westminster’s permission. To the ire of Sturgeon and her Scottish National Party, May has refused to approve the referendum until after Brexit takes effect in 2019, asserting that “now is not the time” and Brits “should be working together, not pulling apart.”Learn more about Scotland’s new referendum bid here.May is working to wrap up Brexit negotiations within 18 months, leaving six months for ratification.“When I sit around the negotiating table in the months ahead, I will represent every person in the whole United Kingdom,” she said on Wednesday. “We are one great union of people and nations with a proud history and a bright future. And, now that the decision has been made to leave the EU, it is time to come together.”Jesselyn covers world news for The Huffington Post. Follow her on Facebook and Twitter."

There were at least 700 arrests linked to the protests, including that of leading Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, who was sentenced to 15 days in jail and fined. Although the demonstrations were unexpectedly large, they had been planned for weeks, sparked by a viral investigative video that Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation released on March 2. The report alleged that Russia’s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, had accumulated vast real estate holdings through bribery and graft.The nearly 50-minute video features Navalny seated in front of a bookshelf walking viewers through his report.

Many protesters on Sunday carried yellow rubber ducks as a reference to reports that one Medvedev-linked property has a house exclusively for ducks.Navalny states in the video that although none of these real estate holdings are in Medvedev’s name, he is the de facto owner. The prime minister has a network of intermediaries, made up of old university friends and charity foundations, that has allowed him to accumulate enormous wealth, the report says.In one case, Navalny shows a property he says is worth $85 million that a Russian billionaire donated to a charity foundation run by Medvedev’s college friend Ilya Yeliseev. The report alleges that this is a bribe to Medvedev from the oligarch, disguised and funneled through the foundation. “The former president, acting prime minister and Russia’s second in command has created a corrupt network of charity foundations that he uses to get bribes from the oligarchs and to maniacally build himself palaces and dachas all around the country,” Navalny states in the report.The video portrays Medvedev as a hypocrite and is interspersed with numerous clips of the prime minister making statements condemning corruption. It also features animated sequences set to a version of the Russian 1990s hit “American Boy” ― the same song Medvedev was filmed dancing awkwardly to during a university reunion in 2011. The Anti-Corruption Foundation video has now been viewed over 13 million times on YouTube and has outraged many Russians. Medvedev and the Kremlin were silent on the corruption allegations, but some lawmakers in the country’s lower house of Parliament have called for an investigation.

We will continue to work with the government in the hope that they will update their proposed regulations and enable Danes to enjoy the benefits of modern technologies like Uber,” Uber said.Despite the minority liberal government’s ambitions to deregulate the taxi business and accommodate new operations like Uber, the taxi law passed in February introduced measures such as mandatory fare meters and seat sensors.”It is a shame, that there was not a majority in favor of the government’s proposal for a significant liberalization of the taxi law, which would have made it easier for Uber and similar ride services to operate legally in Denmark,” Transport Minister Ole Birk Olesen said in a statement.At least three opposition politicians used Twitter on Tuesday to praise Uber’s exit.Two Danish Uber drivers were fined in November for violating taxi laws.In December, Uber’s European division was indicted by Danish public prosecutors for assisting the two drivers in violating taxi laws. The case will come to court by the end of April.“When they (Uber) started two and a half years ago it was illegal and was ruled illegal several times. The new law has not changed that,” Jan Villadsen, the president of the transport section in Denmark’s biggest union 3F, told Reuters.He said Uber’s departure would help 6,000 taxi drivers in Denmark continue making a living."

Current and future DNC staff will be integral to that effort,” Hinojosa said. “Over the last few months, the DNC staff has done incredible work under immense pressure to hold Trump accountable,” she added.Sources within the DNC said that the resignations are part of an institution-wide evaluation and that they expect many current staff members to be kept on. Will Hailer, who served as political director for Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison’s bid to chair the DNC, is helping with the staff re-organization. Former South Carolina Democratic Party chair Jaime Harrison, who endorsed Perez after dropping out of the chairmanship race, is assisting in the transition as well.The DNC already underwent a round of massive layoffs following the election in December.Perez begins his term as DNC chair with a broad mandate to overhaul the party’s central-most body. Over the course of three months campaigning for the chairmanship in the hardest-fought contest in decades, Perez routinely promised to get “back to basics” by rebuilding the party at the state and local levels. The perception of many grassroots progressives that the DNC favored Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has by now been well-documented. Many establishment Democrats have even acknowledged the validity of their grievances. While campaigning for chair, Perez conceded that the process had been “rigged,” before walking back the comment.But the DNC faces equal if not greater skepticism from state and local party officials who feel that the organization neglected them for the length of Barack Obama’s presidency. Critics of the DNC from diverse factions of the party lamented Obama’s establishment of Organizing for Action as a separate fundraising and organizing arm, arguing that it drained the party of much-needed energy and resources.Perez now faces pressure to deliver on promises to make the DNC a less centralized organization, allocate more resources to state and local branches of the Democratic Party and create a more transparent system for awarding consulting contracts.Since 2009, the Democratic Party has lost control of not only the White House and both chambers of Congress but nearly 1,000 state legislative seats as well.Some of the DNC’s strongest progressive critics praised the decision to reassess the party’s staff structure.“This is a good move,” said People for Bernie co-founder Winnie Wong. “It shows they are at least willing to take an inventory of the situation.”Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, praised the move in the context of other steps Perez has taken to show his concern for the Democratic grassroots. Kleeb noted Perez’s support for elections in Nebraska and his show of solidarity with the children of Flint, Michigan, which he visited last week as a part of multi-state tour.“I am pleased he is listening to everyone,” said Kleeb, who is also a board member for Our Revolution, the Sanders campaign successor organization. “And I’m really pleased that as Democrats we get to see Perez and Ellison standing together pushing back against Trump but also lifting up the issues that we care about.”UPDATE: This story has been updated to include the names of people working on transition efforts and comments from progressive critics."

The island, called Tetiaroa, is an atoll located in a group of French Polynesian islands. Its closest neighbor is Tahiti, which is roughly 30 miles away. Not only is it super private and exclusive, it’s also gorgeous: The island was once owned by actor Marlon Brando, who bought the property while scouting locations for his 1962 movie, “Mutiny on the Bounty.” A decade after Brando’s death in 2004, the property was acquired by hotel company Pacific Beachcomber and converted into an ultra-luxurious resort called The Brando.Obama is reportedly staying at the 35-villa resort for most of his month on the island, and its eco-friendly reputation keeps in line with his own high environmental standards. According to its website, the resort eventually hopes to be 100 percent energy independent ― fueled by solar panels, generators powered by coconut oil and a contraption that converts seawater to air conditioning. Rooms start $2,800 per night and some are as expensive as $13,300 per night, but the amenities are simply outrageous. And considering Barack and Michelle Obama recently inked a book deal worth a reported $60 million, they can afford to splurge a little. If Barack decides to bring the whole family along for part of his stay, The Brando is both super family friendly and all-inclusive.“This is an ideal resort for families as well as honeymooners and clients seeking seclusion,” Dan Ilves, senior vice president of Travel Store, told The Huffington Post for a previous story. “All activities are included and for those interested, there is an onsite marine research center.”Other activities include snorkeling in a coral garden, swimming in a magical place called Mermaid Bay and enjoying the resort’s incredible spa. Getting to the island isn’t exactly easy, but it’s safe to say the end result is worth it.Just copy Obamas’ mode of getting to the island. Fly into Tahiti, then hop on a short, 20-minute flight to Tetiaroa. We’re pretty sure this is what Obama looks like right now (though he probably added a backwards hat and flip flops).

The circumstances are different now, Sturgeon insists, and therefore Scotland needs the chance to reconsider its democratic options. She wants “IndyRef2” to be held at least 18 months from now ― once the terms of Brexit are clear, but before it takes effect.The countdown begins on Wednesday, when May will trigger Brexit proceedings by officially informing EU leaders of Britain’s intention to withdraw from the bloc. The U.K. will then have up to two years to negotiate an exit deal with the EU before it must leave.Sturgeon’s next step in her unwavering pursuit of a new secession referendum is to win approval from British Parliament, but May says she will not grant it until the U.K. leaves the EU ― she has maintained her assertion that “now is not the time,” and that Brits “should be working together, not pulling apart.” In a cautionary message to May, Sturgeon said that the mandate for IndyRef2 is clear, and “it would be democratically indefensible ― and utterly unsustainable ― to attempt to stand in the way of it.” She said she will seek Westminster’s approval “within the next few days.”Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson called the outcome of Tuesday’s vote “deeply regrettable,” and warned “it will only add to the uncertainty facing Scotland at this time.”Even if Scots do get the chance to vote on their sovereignty again, leaving the U.K. in hopes of rejoining the EU as an independent nation could be a risky venture. Scotland’s readmission to the bloc would not be automatic; it would have to reapply and win unanimous approval from EU members.Some member states, including France and Spain, have already tried to discourage Scotland from attempting to negotiate with the EU as a new state.But Sturgeon remains undeterred.“The people of Scotland are sovereign,” she said on Tuesday, “and they will be given a choice on their own future.”Learn more about the referendum bid here.This story has been updated with comment from Nicola Sturgeon and Ruth Davidson."

She wrote to the company to request “cool girls’ shirts” and received a personal response from the company’s CEO with exciting news.After Beth wrote about her daughter’s letter for The Washington Post, someone at the Gap found her information on LinkedIn and reached out to her to let her know the company couldn’t find it. With Beth’s help, the letter was located and shortly after she and Alice received an email from Jeff Kirwan, CEO and president of the Gap brand. In his email correspondence with Beth and Alice, which The Huffington Post obtained, Kirwan wrote that the 5-year-old sounds like a “really cool kid with a great sense of style.” He then told her that he spoke with his designers so the company could start working on more options:At GapKids, we try to always offer a wide range of styles and choices for girls and boys. This includes a selection of girls’ tees with dinosaurs, fire trucks, sharks, footballs and some of our superheroes. Our latest Disney Collection, Beauty and the Beast, is also all about the strength and bravery of girls and that’s something that’s really important to us.Kirwan ended the email telling Alice that he was sending her some of his favorite shirts from the Gap ― including a shirt with Rey from “Star Wars” on it ― and told her to let him know what she thought. Beth helped Alice respond to the email so she could thank Kirwan. “Thank you for those clothes and the letter,” she wrote. “It made me feel good. The Rey shirt is pretty cool. I’m going to wear it to school tomorrow.”Beth told HuffPost she was “taken aback” when she first read the email. “They know this could and likely would be made public,” she said. “And Kirwan doesn’t just acknowledge they have work to do, he says outright that he’s asked his design team to get started.”She also responded to Kirwan via email to thank him and discuss how they could work together to help other kids learn that their voices matter. “It[’s] not just about T-shirts, is it?” she wrote. “You and I, we’ve got a chance to show kids everywhere that all big changes start small.”The proud mom and the CEO continued expressing their appreciation in a short email exchange. Beth joked to HuffPost that they are now “pen pals.” She also said Alice is “delighted” to know her letter made a difference. “Last night I was talking to her at bedtime and I asked her what’s important about that. I said, ‘What did you learn about why writing that letter was important?’” Beth said. “And she threw her arms back and said, ‘Speak up!’”H/T Washington PostThe HuffPost Parents newsletter, So You Want To Raise A Feminist, offers the latest stories and news in progressive parenting.

85,BLACK VOICES,Uber Needs To Do Better When It Comes To Diversity,Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-diversity-report_us_58daa0b8e4b07634059f9aae,Just like the rest of the tech industry.,2017-03-28,Uber -- and the rest of Silicon Valley -- have a lot of work to do when it comes to diversity.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dab42d2c00002100ff0f35.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After years of keeping its diversity data hidden away, Uber released its first diversity report Tuesday, under the direction of its new Chief Human Resources Officer Liane Hornsey.The report revealed that Uber employees are mostly white and mostly male, especially at the more senior levels of the company. A full 78 percent of Uber’s workers at the director level or above are men, and 76.7 percent of the company leadership is white.Tuesday’s disclosure is part of a concerted PR effort to right the ship at the company after a series of scandals. Uber has faced allegations of rampant sexual harassment from former employees; a high-profile lawsuit that contends Uber stole trade secrets from a Google-founded competitor; numerous high-profile departures; and a video showing CEO Travis Kalanick telling off a driver.“​This report is a first step in showing that diversity and inclusion is a priority at Uber,” Kalanick said in a statement. “I know that we have been too slow in publishing our numbers — and that the best way to demonstrate our commitment to change is through transparency.”Still, as dismal as Uber’s numbers are, Business Insider notes they’re slightly better than several other top companies in Silicon Valley.Overall, 63.9 percent of Uber’s workers are male, and 36.1 percent are female. That’s not great, but it’s still slightly ahead of Facebook (33 percent women), Apple (32 percent), Google (31 percent) and Microsoft (25.8 percent).In tech positions, however ― where Silicon Valley struggles as a whole ― women make up just 15.4 percent of Uber’s workforce.Compared to the above companies, Uber also has a (slightly) more racially diverse employee base, with 49.8 percent of employees identifying as white, 30.9 percent identifying as Asian, 8.8 percent black, 5.6 percent Hispanic, 4.3 percent identifying as “two or more races,” and 0.6 percent identifying as “other.”Again, not great, but still ahead of the companies listed above and Silicon Valley overall.For comparison’s sake, as of June 2016, Apple’s U.S. workforce was 56 percent white (a 2 percent increase from 2015), 19 percent Asian, 12 percent Hispanic, and 9 percent black (up 1 percent).In a release accompanying Tuesday’s report, Uber also noted it’s making an effort to hire more women and people of color. That includes ramping up recruitment efforts at historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions, and pledging to spend $3 million over the next three years to help boost the ranks of women and minorities in tech overall. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Uber board member Arianna Huffington are also conducting an independent investigation into the various sexual harassment claims at the company. (Huffington, previously the editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post, stepped down from her role last year.) And last week, Uber made three female executives at the company available for a conversation with reporters.But there’s clearly much more work to be done.“Every strength, in excess, is a weakness,” Hornsey told The New York Times. “What has driven Uber to immense success — its aggression, the hard-charging attitude — has toppled over. And it needs to be shaved back.”"

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-coal-industry_us_58da777ae4b018c4606b99f9,"Despite White House executive orders and gains in overall coal production, jobs-starved Appalachia is forecast to see a 3.3 percent decrease in mining.",2017-03-28,This chart from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows how coal has declined as natural gas and renewables gained in the utility market. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58da796f1400008806071edc.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Robert Murray, owner of the world’s largest private coal company, said this week that he’s told President Donald Trump he can’t single-handedly revive the coal business.“Can the coal industry be brought back?” Murray ― a major Republican donor who asked to move a court date last year so he could attend Trump’s formal nomination at the Republican National Convention ― told The Columbus Dispatch in an interview published Sunday. “The answer is, I’ve suggested to President Trump that he temper his expectations.”Murray’s remarks were published just two days before the White House released its long-awaited executive order on energy and climate change, a move that Trump has promised will “save our coal industry.”“The miners are coming back,” the president told a rally in Louisville, Kentucky, last week.But the evidence suggests coal will continue to shrink, particularly in the regions most devastated by the industry’s decline. The executive order, which Trump signed on Tuesday, will sound the death knell for the Clean Power Plan, a sweeping Obama-era regulation meant to slash carbon emissions from the utility sector by putting limits on coal- and natural gas-fired power plants and encouraging use of renewables like wind and solar.“Perhaps no single regulation threatens our miners, energy workers, and companies more than this crushing attack on American industry,” Trump said Tuesday at a press conference, flanked by miners. “We’re ending the theft of American prosperity and rebuilding our beloved country.”The order will lift a temporary moratorium put in place last year on coal leases on federal lands. It also does away with federal guidelines directing agencies to factor climate change into policymaking, and disbands a team tasked with calculating the “social cost of carbon,” which the previous administration pegged at $36 per ton of carbon dioxide. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump rebuked his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton’s $30 billion plan to retrain miners in economically depressed Appalachia for new careers, vowing instead to bring back the high-paying jobs of decades past. Trump’s promises ignited in the coal industry what The Washington Post describes as “flickering signs of life.” Coal prices have doubled since last year. Rail car deliveries of coal soared 16 percent this year. Coal company stocks surged. Peabody Coal, the country’s biggest coal producer, announced plans to pull itself out of bankruptcy next month. Yet those gains seem merely cosmetic when you consider the long-term outlook for coal. The coal business and its political allies accused former President Barack Obama of waging a “war on coal” ― that is, pursuing a set of policies meant to punish an industry that once fueled transcontinental railroads and powered most homes in America. It’s easy to blame whatever administration is in office during a time of industrial decline. It’s easier still to point the finger at the first president to make a top priority of addressing man-made global warming. But while the Obama-led policy pivot toward clean energy may have helped dim investors’ view of coal, market forces are actually to blame for the uptick in layoffs and bankruptcies.Even Murray recognizes the severity of the situation. In 2014, the man known as the “last king of coal” told an industry conference: “If you think it’s coming back, you don’t understand the business. Or you’re smoking dope.”The decline in demand is twofold.On the domestic side, natural gas devoured the U.S. electricity market as utility companies converted to a cleaner-burning fuel made cheap by advances in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. In 2002, the U.S. added more than 3,571 miles of pipeline to carry natural gas, supporting a surge in use of the fuel to produce electricity. By 2016, natural gas overtook coal as the top source of electricity. The loss signaled a slow-moving catastrophe for coal, which saw its zenith in the mid-1970s, when Congress responded to an oil embargo crisis by giving the industry a decade-long monopoly on new power plants in an effort to wean the U.S. off energy imports. Faced with real competition from a cleaner-burning fuel, coal lost utilities’ favor. And coal had already been in decline. In 1985, the industry employed 177,000 people. By the end of 2008, when George W. Bush was still president, that number had fallen to 86,000. It was down to 56,000 last year. But coal’s steepest slump in recent memory came in 2012, when Chinese demand tapered off.It’s there, on the foreign side, that coal was dealt its most devastating blow. The industry bet big on China continuing to buy huge amounts of U.S. coal to fuel its rapid construction of power plants and its seemingly unlimited appetite for steel smelting. In 2012, though, the Chinese economy began to slow. By that point, the country had become so notorious for air pollution that companies started selling bottled air in its smog-choked cities. A year later, coal consumption in the country peaked. Chinese demand fell by 3 percent in 2014, and dipped another 4 or 5 percent the year after, according to the Sightline Institute, a think tank. In 2016, coal consumption in China fell by 4.7 percent year over year, and its share of the country’s energy mix fell by 2 percent to 62 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics of China reported.U.S. exports of coal mirrored that decline. Data released earlier this month by the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that in 2016, coal exports fell for a fourth consecutive year to 60.3 million short tons, less than half the record volume shipped overseas in 2012. Demand doesn’t seem likely to come roaring back in China, either. In January, China canceled 103 new coal-fired power stations as commits to spending $380 billion on renewables over the next four years. And China already has a surplus of its own coal miners. A subsidiary of China National Coal Group, the third-largest coal mining company in the world, recently announced plans to lay off 4,000 workers by the end of the year. To be sure, the coal industry has reason to be excited ― but those reasons have almost nothing to do with the new administration. Last year, the U.S. became a net exporter of natural gas, and prices are forecast to rise this year and next as supplies are shipped overseas. As a result, coal production is on track to inch up slightly in 2017 and 2018 as coal regains a sliver of the electricity sector.But the gains would go almost entirely to Western coal-producing states such as Montana and Wyoming, where it’s cheaper to mine. Production in the West is expected to rise from 407 million short tons last year to 443 million short tons in 2018, according to data from the EIA. In the interior coal region ― which consists of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and part of Western Kentucky ― coal mining is projected to climb from 150 million short tons to 152 million short tons over the same period. But in Appalachia, where exhausted mines drive extraction costs up, coal production is actually slated to decrease 3.3 percent, from 183 million short tons in 2016 to 177 million short tons in 2018.“We already have enough coal reserves to last us for two decades,” Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at the watchdog group Public Citizen, said in a statement. “Renewing leasing now under a system plagued by loopholes will do nothing but continue to line the bulging pockets of coal company CEOs, who, it bears mentioning, have continued to rake in millions in bonuses while running their companies into the ground and laying off workers.”These are market trends that were already happening before Trump’s win in November. Moreover, the White House’s proposed budget would actually hurt voters who abandoned the Democratic Party to hand Trump victories in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, in part because of his vow to bring back coal jobs.Trump has suggested slashing funding to the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Economic Development Administration, two programs that provide aid to communities devastated by the loss of coal jobs.“I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed in the President’s skinny budget are draconian, careless and counterproductive,” Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), a firm Trump ally from a coal-mining district, said in a statement. He added that the programs help “reduce poverty rates and extend basic necessities to communities across the Appalachian region.”This article has been updated with Slocum’s statement, and with details from the March 28 signing of the executive order."

88,POLITICS,Will Suburban Activism Pave The Democratic Path To The House?,"Justin Miller, The American Prospect",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grassroots-house-2018_us_58da7d41e4b0928a6b780ada,"If they’re to retake Congress in 2018, Democrats need their newfound activist hordes to focus on health coverage—and diverse, upscale swing districts.",2017-03-28,"Elizabeth Lewandowski holds a sign as U.S. Congressman Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) hosts a town hall event at a community college in Branchburg, New Jersey.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58da80c62c00002000ff0dda.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Justin MillerThis story originally appeared in The American Prospect. On an unseasonably warm Friday evening in late February, more than 100 residents of Virginia’s Tenth Congressional District filled the gymnasium of a community center in Sterling, one of the sprawling towns of Loudoun County in the exurbs of Washington. Constituents had for weeks been trying to get Republican Representative Barbara Comstock to go beyond the controlled environs of a tele-town hall and face her constituents in person. They mounted daily call-in campaigns and protests outside her district offices, asking her to attend. In the end, she was a no-show, saying she had a long-scheduled event at the same time.One by one, district residents went before the microphone, listed their hometown and ZIP code for the record (often with a pithy comment about not being a paid protester) before asking questions on a series of pressing issues—national security, President Trump’s conflicts of interest, immigration, education, environmental protections, and, most prominently, the future of the Affordable Care Act.In response to each question, one of several volunteers would parse Comstock’s voting record and public comments to piece together her position. Oftentimes the resulting answer was incomplete or evasive. When there was a clear position—whether for rolling back environmental regulations or boosting school vouchers—it drew jeers from the crowd. One older woman repeatedly held up a sign that read, simply, “Boo!”Toward the end of the evening, Janine Murphy-Neilson of Herndon stepped up to the microphone in a “Nevertheless, She Persisted” T-shirt and talked about her husband, who has chronic myeloid leukemia. “Prior to [the] ACA, I was frantically worried about his preexisting condition and the $8,000 a month that his prescription would cost without insurance,” she said. “I would like to know how much is it going to cost to repeal and replace, and how do you justify that expense when Republicans would do absolutely nothing to try to help make this a better-working [law] for the American people?”One of the health-care policy volunteers referenced comments Comstock made during two of her recent tele-town halls about how to pay for the ACA replacement, which amounted to vague platitudes about the need for “small-business pooling,” making health care “patient-centered,” decreasing Washington bureaucracy, and promoting tort reform and wellness incentive programs. The crowd was not satisfied.BARBARA COMSTOCK MAY BE PART of a newly endangered species. She was re-elected in an increasingly purple district that swung strongly for Hillary Clinton by 10 points in 2016 after going for Mitt Romney by just over one point in 2012. While she carefully casts herself as a moderate Republican, Comstock has voted with Trump 100 percent of the time thus far—which, according to a ranking by FiveThirtyEight, makes her the House member third-most out of line with the way their district voted.With the Trump administration and the Republican Congress both off to the rockiest of starts, and with progressive and Democratic activists mobilized as never before, Democratic strategists hope, and increasingly believe, that Comstock and her peers—the 22 other Republican House members from districts that Clinton carried in November—can be defeated in the 2018 midterm elections. Longtime activists and first-timers are eager to target those who aid and abet Trump’s agenda. They’ve become newly attuned to every quote and vote of rank-and-file House Republicans.But protest is one thing; strategic electoral activity is quite another. The question before Democrats is whether this surge of grassroots activism can evolve into a well-organized, effective political movement that can sustain itself till the midterms—and avoid devolving into cacophonous disarray of protest without politics.In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, there’s been no shortage of activism on the left. The opening salvo was the Women’s March on Washington the day after Trump’s inauguration, drawing more than 500,000 to the nation’s capital and millions more around the country and the world. Since then, participants have organized more than 5,000 “huddles”—small, neighborhood-based meetings to plot the next steps of resistance.Another cornerstone of the activist surge has been the Indivisible Guide, a document compiled by former congressional staffers offering suggestions on how best to engage and pressure your member of Congress. The team behind the guide sought to mirror the successful grassroots pressure of the Tea Party protests that in 2009 caught Democrats completely off-guard.In the age of Trump, with people hungry for ways to engage, the relatively basic civics primer published by Indivisible’s founders has resonated as the guiding document of the resistance. It has been downloaded more than one million times and spurred the creation of several thousand local Indivisible chapters, with at least two in each of the nation’s 435 congressional districts, according to the organization. In turn, these local groups have organized massive call-in campaigns, actions outside representatives’ district offices, and public town halls.In Lovettsville, Virginia, a small and affluent enclave in Comstock’s district, Kristen Swanson, who owns a pottery studio in town, reached out to five women in her life right after the election who, like her, were not very politically active, but were distraught by the results of the election. With no idea of what to do, they started brainstorming.Midway through December, Swanson stumbled upon the Indivisible Guide, printed it out, read it about 20 times, and thought to herself, “This is it; this is what we do.” In early January, she organized the first meeting for the Lovettsville Indivisible—12 people showed up and, by virtue of doing so, became the steering committee. Soon after, she initiated contact with Comstock’s office and set up a meeting. In four days, she—along with other nearby Indivisible groups—rallied 58 people to discuss concerns about the Republicans’ plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They arranged for constituents to tell their stories to Comstock’s staffers and put together a packet detailing personal experiences and concerns about repeal.Swanson’s story has its counterparts all across the nation—most importantly, in districts like hers that could swing Democratic in 2018. In the Republican Representative Ryan Costello’s suburban Philadelphia district—which, like Comstock’s, was carried by Clinton—Claire Witzleben, a stay-at-home parent with a master’s degree in health-care administration, has been organizing weekly protests since mid-January outside Costello’s district office in West Chester. One week the protest topic is Trump’s alleged connections to Russia, the next it’s the president’s deportation plans or the ACA repeal. Before the election, Witzleben admits, she didn’t know the name of her representative or even what district she lived in. Trump’s victory, she says, quickly woke her up. Now, Witzleben and Tammy Harkness, an engineer, are the lead organizers for one of the area’s local Indivisible affiliates, dubbed the Concerned Constituents Action Group, which organized a town hall meeting for Costello on the last Saturday of Congress’s President’s Day recess. For both women, this was their first time engaging in political organizing.Costello’s Sixth District, as Democrats describe it, “looms like a dragon descending on Philadelphia from the west,” carving jaggedly through the towns of suburban Chester, Berks, Montgomery, and Lebanon counties. It’s a mostly white district that mashes up very wealthy suburbs with more rural pockets—and one that Republicans have held, despite consistent targeting by Democrats, since redistricting in 2000. Costello, a second-term member, wiped the floor with his Democratic challenger in 2016, winning by 14 points. However, Romney-voting Republicans ditched Trump en masse, giving Clinton a narrow victory in the district of just over one-half of one percentage point. If that didn’t put Costello on notice, he’s now feeling the heat from organized constituents as well.Some 400 people filled the auditorium of the local high school in Phoenixville, a small borough of Chester County, on the weekend after President’s Day. Many of them lined up to direct questions to a photo of the absent Costello that had been taped to a podium on the stage. As in Sterling, a number voiced concerns about Trump’s alleged ties with Russia and spoke passionately about their personal experiences with Obamacare and fears about losing coverage for themselves or their families. About an hour into the town hall, after several dozen questions had been posed to Costello’s photo, a woman in a salmon-colored shirt and jeans walked up to the microphone and said, “I’ve been looking at your picture … and have been thinking to myself, you know, it’s really a possibility that this guy isn’t going to watch this tape; it’s a real possibility that he’s going to ignore all these people in this room and what they’re saying.”“What I want to say to you very, very sincerely from my heart, is that this is a movement, and it’s not going to go away,” she declared, instantly drawing a standing ovation. If Costello wanted to be re-elected, she added, it would be wise to listen to what his constituents were saying.Congress’s first recess of the year was also the first opportunity for anti-Trump activists to focus their indignation not just at Trump, but at representatives who will come before voters in 2018. With members of Congress headed back to their district, it was these groups’ first major chance to translate energy from Facebook pages into real life, and palpable electoral politics. Like Comstock and Costello, many Republican representatives avoided in-person interactions with angry constituents by holding tele-town halls or by announcing last-minute town halls in remote areas. Members who did show up often faced down crowds that were demanding answers. Videos of constituents dressing down their members of Congress quickly went viral; speculation over whether this was the first act in a Tea Party–style takeover quickly followed. “If it fizzled, if there was nothing to show for it during the recess, then it would have allowed Republicans in Congress and Trump to continue moving forward with their agenda,” Indivisible co-founder Angel Padilla says.WITH 23 DEMOCRATIC SENATORS, many from red states, up for re-election, hopes of taking back the upper chamber in 2018 are slim, if not nonexistent. The likeliest chance of breaking Republicans’ unified control of the federal government lies in the House, where Democrats will need to pick up 24 seats to wrest control from Speaker Paul Ryan and the GOP. History tilts in Democrats’ favor. Since 1982, the president’s party has lost an average of 28 seats in first-term midterm elections. If Trump’s approval ratings remain in the gutter, he could drag down even more House Republicans. But midterm turnout generally skews older, whiter, and more conservative, and the GOP benefits from the heavily gerrymandered districts they drew for themselves in 2010.“Looking at the House right now, it might seem like Republicans’ structural advantages are insurmountable,” says David Wasserman, House editor for The Cook Political Report. “If we look at what we saw in 2009, no one really thought Republicans had a chance—and they took back 23 more than they needed to.”Democrats are already trying to tap into the early grassroots energy flowing from the Women’s March, Indivisible, and all the assorted activism. Less than two weeks after Trump’s inauguration, the party’s House campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), recognizing the need to take advantage of the early grassroots energy, funneled money to state parties to hire full-time organizers in 20 of its top Republican district targets. Dubbed the “March into ’18” accountability project, organizers will recruit local volunteers and try to build a more formal coalition with groups already mobilizing in district. The DCCC also announced it added 635,000 supporters to its list in January alone—a 20 percent growth of its total base.The Democrats’ path to a majority begins with the 23 seats—mostly well-educated and higher-income suburban districts—that voted for Hillary Clinton but elected Republican House members, including Comstock’s and Costello’s. These types of seats are seen as must-wins.The 23 Clinton-Republican districts are marked by more diverse populations than the national average or a higher percentage of residents with college degrees than the national average—or both. Eighteen of the 23 have an above-average share of college-educated whites, and eight of those seats have a higher share of both minorities and white college grads. As The Atlantic has reported, such so-called “hi-hi” districts already form the core of the Democratic House caucus: Democrats hold 87 of the 103 districts that fit that profile.Costello’s district, for instance, is far whiter than the national average; about 86 percent compared with around 77 percent nationally. However, 42.5 percent of the district’s adults have a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared with about 33 percent nationwide. Its median household income is $80,000, almost $30,000 more than the national average. Comstock’s Northern Virginia district has become notably more diverse over the years. In 2000, Loudoun County, where the district is centered, was 82 percent white. Now it’s about 70 percent white. The district is also one of the wealthiest and most well-educated in the country. More than 54 percent hold a bachelor’s degree or higher, and its median household income is nearly $115,000.Half of the 23 Clinton-Republican districts are found in bluing Texas and California suburbs. If there’s one place that epitomizes the type of areas where Democrats need to start winning House races, it’s Orange County, California, long the epicenter of Republican politics in the Golden State. Four Orange County Republicans—including Darrell Issa, who might just be the most vulnerable member of the House, Ed Royce, Mimi Walters, and Dana Rohrabacher—are seen as beatable by Democrats. Their districts all voted for Clinton, as did Orange County as a whole—the first time the county had voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Franklin Roosevelt’s 1936 landslide victory.Absent a dramatic change in the Democrats’ political messaging, House analysts think the well-educated and diversifying suburban seats that are moving toward Democrats will be better bets for a 2018 shift than the blue-collar and more rural seats that have been slipping away from the party. It remains to been seen, though, whether Romney Republicans’ distaste for Trump will trickle down to the House. “I’m not convinced that the Orange County Republican who voted against Trump is ready to throw out Mimi Walters or Ed Royce,” says Nathan Gonzales, the editor of the political analysis newsletter Inside Elections.In total, the DCCC has cast an ambitiously wide net of 59 target districts to start from, including a second rung of ten flippable seats that Clinton narrowly lost by four points or less. “I don’t think it’s that realistic to be targeting districts that Trump won by more than 15 points,” says Wasserman. His rationale goes back to the 2010 Tea Party wave; Republicans picked up 66 seats, but not a single one that Obama had carried by more than 15. Wasserman says that the DCCC list of 59 includes about a dozen seats that Trump won by 15 points or more, which he says are not realistic targets. However, he points out, there are 92 Republican seats that Trump won by less than 15 points. Many of those are unwinnable, either because of local political dynamics or an incumbent’s high favorability. But there are also incumbents with unique weaknesses—whether it’s ethical or, perhaps, a particular proximity to the administration—whom Democrats hope to pick off from the herd.Recruiting viable Democratic candidates not only in the top targeted districts but in as many races as possible will be critical. The party has often struggled with recruits, investing big money in promising candidates through the DCCC’s Jumpstart program—which provides early campaign support—only to come up short on important turf like the Philadelphia suburbs. In 2014, the DCCC made an early call to back Kevin Strouse, a then-34-year-old Army and CIA veteran, as one of its eight Jumpstart candidates to run against a top target, Mike Fitzpatrick of suburban Pennsylvania’s Eighth District. Despite the support, Strouse only narrowly beat another promising Democratic primary opponent, and then lost to the incumbent by more than 20 points. Of the 23 challengers Jumpstart backed that year, only two won.In Comstock’s district, a long list of potential candidates are already lining up in the hope of challenging her. So far, Tenth Congressional District Democratic Chairwoman Patsy Brown has interviewed 11 interested people, while the DCCC and state progressives are reportedly courting Jennifer Wexton, a well-known Virginia state senator in the district, to run. “We have never, ever had this kind of outpouring of people,” Brown told a local newspaper. She’s been on the committee since 1992.That said, it isn’t obvious that early support for one of several primary candidates by a national party organization would be welcomed by many local activists. The revelations that the Democratic National Committee tilted toward Clinton instead of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries will likely serve as a brake on such pre-primary support in a number of 2018 contests.For Democrats to win in these districts, they need to dramatically expand turnout among non-voters and low-propensity voters who will choose Democrats if they actually get to the polls. They also need to attract some Republicans. Sam Wang, an elections statistician and neuroscientist at Princeton, estimates that Democratic congressional candidates would need to win the national vote by 7 to 12 percentage points to wrest control from Republicans. Democrats pulled off those margins in 2008, but that was in a presidential election year with a popular candidate at the top of the ticket. That was also before the Republican gerrymandering that followed the 2010 census.Analysts say it would require a massive political event for the Democrats to overcome such a stacked deck. One of those ground-shifting events could be health care. If the GOP succeeds in repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with Paul Ryan’s American Health Care Act, the Congressional Budget Office estimates it will cause about 24 million people to lose coverage over the next ten years—14 million in the first year alone. It doesn’t take a political genius to see how this would endanger Republican incumbents across the board. In the hours after the CBO released its ominous scoring of repeal-and-replace, the DCCC sent out a rash of press blasts condemning Republican members on their target list—including Comstock, Walters, Minnesota’s Erik Paulsen, Colorado’s Mike Coffman, and New Jersey’s Leonard Lance—who have voiced support for repeal.“When something is about to be taken away, it’s more salient. That’s an enormous opportunity,” says Theda Skocpol, a Harvard University professor who studied the rise of the Tea Party movement on the right. “If [Republicans] proceed with repeal, it’ll be important to dramatize what the costs are going to be for actual human beings in each district.”Analysts have already begun crunching those numbers—and they don’t look good for Republican prospects. According to a Daily Kos analysis, there are 51 congressional districts where the estimated number of people expected to lose coverage with the repeal of the ACA outnumber the Republican incumbent’s 2016 margin of victory, including a number of districts that Clinton carried. In Darrell Issa’s district, which he carried by fewer than 2,000 votes, there are more than 60,000 people who are projected to lose coverage.In Comstock’s district, which she won by about 22,000 votes, 30,000 constituents are projected to lose health insurance. In Costello’s district, where he had a landslide victory, there are nearly 40,000 people who are primed to lose coverage as well.The hardest-hit districts would be in cities and white working-class, pro-Trump areas, while many of the more upscale Clinton-GOP districts, where far fewer people benefited from Medicaid expansion and insurance subsidies, would be relatively less affected. In fact, the Ryan replacement plan would disproportionately benefit people in those districts, as it is designed to deliver tax credits to people at the high end of the middle class who are currently phased out of Obamacare subsidies, and would also deliver major tax cuts to earners in the top tax brackets who were subsidizing the costs of the ACA.The 2018 elections, then, could likely turn not just on how effectively the Democrats can turn out their base but also on whether the Republican crusade on Obamacare—combined with a mish-mash of other Trump-related issues—will be enough for Republican Trump defectors, or reluctant Trump voters who’ve become fed up, to vote Democratic.That will require a lot of effort from Democratic and progressive activists—and not just in swing districts.INDIVISIBLE IS NOT THE ONLY GROUP that materialized out of the post-election ether to facilitate strategic activism. A trio of friends with no formal background in politics or organizing launched Swing Left, a project that aims to match liberals concentrated in deep-blue districts with their nearest swing district and coordinate in-district volunteer campaigns. “We obviously hit some kind of a nerve,” Ethan Todras-Whitehill, a writer and tutor from Western Massachusetts who came up with the idea of Swing Left, told volunteers during a February call.So far, about 300,000 people have signed up to get involved in Swing Left, and 15,000 have volunteered for district leadership positions—including in each of the 52 districts Swing Left has targeted to keep or flip to the Democrats. “We want to get people invested in their local swing districts. We want you guys to know your local swing district representative better than you know your own representative,” Todras-Whitehill said. About 6,000 people volunteered to do research and compile in-depth dossiers on each swing district.Wearing jeans and a red and black half-zip, Dan Schramm stood up on a chair in the corner of his living room and introduced himself to the dozens of people who were milling about, sipping drinks, munching on snacks, and talking politics. It was the first Saturday of March, and Swing Left had asked volunteers to host house parties for people interested in the organization, talk about the swing district they have targeted, and get volunteers lined up for upcoming canvassing trips. Schramm and his wife, Amanda, had decided to host one in their neighborhood in Northeast Washington, D.C., a city that had given 91 percent of its vote to Clinton. The attendees were targeting Comstock’s Tenth District seat, the far outskirts of which just barely touch the District’s western boundaries several miles from Schramm’s house.That weekend, there dozens of Swing Left house parties in the District and throughout Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland. Across the country, there were more than 600 house parties scheduled, with more than 11,000 total RSVPs.Like many liberals, Schramm had thought Clinton had the presidential election in the bag. “I didn’t do much,” he told me, saying that, like many, he wondered, “Who could possibly vote for Trump?” He now hopes, though, that Trump’s election is propelling people who previously weren’t all that engaged in politics to get involved, and turn out to vote in the midterms.That’s Swing Left’s top priority. In Schramm’s living room, people signed up to volunteer to lead monthly voter registration and canvassing trips to Comstock’s district, in coordination with volunteers and progressive groups that reside there.The group will stay out of Democratic primary contests. “Conceptually, we see ourselves as the campaigns-in-waiting for the eventual nominees. Our goal is to have busloads of volunteers ready to work for them,” says Swing Left organizing director Matt Ewing.If the path to Democrats winning back the House starts anywhere, it just might be in those Swing Left living rooms and at those Indivisible town halls."

But they have since stopped in fear they could be next in the firing line.The town’s latest victim was Elizabeth Castillo, a transgender woman, who police say was kidnapped in February after attending the funeral of two transgender women. Her body, showing signs of torture, was then found dumped on the roadside.So far, no one has been arrested.“The gangs don’t accept lesbians, gay boys or transgender people. Diversity doesn’t fit into their rules,” said Teresa, who did not want to give her full name.GANG VIOLENCEEl Salvador is one of the world’s deadliest countries outside a war zone. Entire city neighborhoods are controlled by two powerful gangs - Barrio 18 and its rival Mara Salvatrucha.To maintain control, gang members extort money at gunpoint, rape women and girls and murder.Not only are LGBT people victims of general gang violence, like other Salvadorans, they are also persecuted because of their sexual orientation.Same-sex marriage is not recognized by law, and transgender people are not allowed to change to the gender they identify with on public documents.The country’s influential Roman Catholic Church and most evangelical churches publicly condemn gay marriage and sex.“They are criminalizing us,” said Karla Avelar, head of rights group, Communicating and Training Transwomen (COMCAVIS). “They use the word of God and the Bible to judge us. It’s destroying us.”Last year, 25 members of the LGBT community were killed across the small country of six million, and seven transgender people have been murdered so far this year, according to Vanda Pignato, the government secretary for social inclusion.“I’m very worried and not only because of the recent murders in San Luis Talpa,” Pignato said.“We have to understand that the LGBT community are citizens like all of us,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.But intolerance in the socially conservative nation is an obstacle to change. A 2013 survey by the U.S.-based Pew Research Centre found nearly two thirds of Salvadorans believed society should not accept homosexuality.A 2012 government survey also found that some Salvadorans view homosexuality as an illness that should be cured.Two in every five LGBTI people of the 400 surveyed said they had undergone some kind of therapy, of which half had been recommended by a psychologist.FLEEING FOR THEIR LIVESTens of thousands of Salvadorans are driven from their homes every year to escape gang violence and poverty, and LBGT people are also fleeing the country in fear of their lives.The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) calls the exodus from El Salvador and other Central American nations - Honduras and Guatemala - plagued by gang violence a “refugee crisis”.This year in San Juan Talpa, around 40 transgender people have fled their homes, according to COMCAVIS.“Many transgender people have been forced to migrate to other countries to safeguard their own lives,” said Avelar of COMCAVIS, who has survived two murder attempts.Across El Salvador, at least 136 LGBT people have fled the country since 2012, she said, seeking refuge in Europe, the United States and Mexico.“LGBT people who seek asylum have faced serious risks and are doubly discriminated against,” said Francesca Fontanini, UNHCR’s spokeswoman in Mexico.Across the region, violence against the LGBT community is widespread. Latin America is the world’s deadliest region for LGBTI people, according to research group, Transrespect versus Transphobia Worldwide (TvT).The Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR) said it received reports of at least 41 attacks and murders of LGBTI people across the region this year.“This situation is disturbing and unsustainable,” Francisco Eguiguren, IACHR rapporteur on the rights of LGBTI people, said in a statement last week. “There must be no impunity.”El Salvador has taken steps to better protect LGBT people.In 2015 lawmakers recognized hate crimes motivated by gender or sexual orientation and imposed tougher jail sentences. But so far no one has been convicted under the law, activists say.Meanwhile Teresa is mulling whether to leave her home and begin the overland journey to Mexico to seek refuge.“With a doubt, I’ve thought about being far away from this country because staying here the gangs find you,” Teresa said.(Writing by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by Ros Russell.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.

90,POLITICS,Local Officials Grapple With Trump's Fearmongering On 'Sanctuary City' Policies,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sanctuary-cities-messaging-trump_us_58daabb4e4b0d41721b9d600,They want to send the message that their policies make the country safer.,2017-03-28,"President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have railed against so-called ""sanctuary cities"" for years.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58daafa91400002000072030.jpeg?cache=uizRhrBRlA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― President Donald Trump’s campaign to take down so-called “sanctuary cities” isn’t just about denying them funding. He’s also trying to turn the public against local officials who refuse to fully cooperate with deportation efforts, accusing them of protecting dangerous criminal undocumented immigrants at the expensive of American lives. Local leaders who support sanctuary policies say that’s not true. They argue that separating police and immigration enforcement improves public safety, keeps families together and saves local jurisdictions money. Now they have to convince Americans and other elected officials that they’re right. “The hate mail I get really treats this as an issue of lawlessness versus lawfulness,” Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez (D) told The Huffington Post. “On the opposition side, that’s a really easy argument: ‘You violated the law. It’s unlawful. We’re all going to heck in a handcart.’ Our side is a little more nuanced, which is that our communities are very integrated [and] our economy really relies on people who are immigrants.”Chavez and officials from more than 30 cities gathered in New York City on Monday and Tuesday for a strategy session hosted by New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito (D) and the Local Progress network to discuss policies in sanctuary cities ― cities, counties and states that in some way limit their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They are preparing for a legal fight over their policies, particularly after Attorney General Jeff Sessions reiterated on Monday that he will withhold federal grants from sanctuary cities. But they also talked strategy for the other part of the battle: messaging. Trump’s efforts to take away sanctuary cities’ funds might fail in the courts, but only if communities stick by them ― and that requires keeping the public and fellow officials on board.  “Overwhelmingly, Philadelphians support sanctuary policies,” Philadelphia Councilmember Helen Gym (D) told HuffPost. “But it’s clear that the misinformation, the fear-mongering, the misleading characterizations of what sanctuary cities are has an impact. It plays to the worst of human nature, it plays to our suspicions and our divisions. And it can be, in some circumstances, extremely effective in sowing that kind of hate and division.”There are a few ways to counteract those messages, Gym said. One of the biggest is to frame the issue broadly ― it’s not just about immigrants, it’s about protecting everyone, including U.S. citizen children of undocumented parents and the community at large, she said.A number of local law enforcement officials don’t want to fully cooperate with ICE because they believe it makes it harder to do their job of fighting crime. They want the undocumented community to feel comfortable coming forward to report crimes and serve as witnesses, and argue that complying with all of ICE’s requests makes the community less safe, not more. At the summit, experts briefed officials on some of the numbers they could cite to make that claim and counteract anecdotes that suggest undocumented immigrants and sanctuary policies are dangerous. Tom Wong, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, presented his recent findings that crime is significantly lower in counties with sanctuary policies compared to those without them. The economies of sanctuary counties are stronger as well, he said. If people aren’t convinced by the arguments about families or law enforcement, there’s another message: money. Some jurisdictions adopted policies against holding individuals on ICE’s request because they weren’t compensated for doing so. Someone they might release on bond would instead stay in jail at a high cost to taxpayers, and not all of that money is reimbursed. In addition to that, local law enforcement can put itself at risk of a lawsuit if it holds people solely for immigration purposes. This isn’t speculative ― it’s happened before, and is the reason that certain cities and counties don’t fully cooperate with ICE. That’s worth reminding people who don’t otherwise agree with sanctuary policies, Lourdes Rosado, who leads the Civil Rights Bureau at the Office of the Attorney General of New York State, told other officials at the summit. But she also admitted that she found such arguments dispiriting.“Hitting people where the money is is one strategy, but a sad strategy,” she said. “I hate doing it, because it shouldn’t be this way to persuade people to do the right thing. But I think, unfortunately, for some it’s going to be about the money.” Officials at the summit also talked about ways to avoid counteracting their own message ― for example, by consciously avoiding “the language of the right when it comes to deportation and criminalization,” as Chicago alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (D) put it.“If I hear one more Democrat say, ‘It’s ok to deport criminals,’ we’re going to have problems, because to President Donald Trump, every single undocumented person is a criminal,” Ramirez-Rosa said during a panel.They also talked about some of the dangers in their own messaging, including whether “sanctuary city” is an apt term, given that none of the jurisdictions in question can actually keep people from being detained or deported. Multiple officials said they don’t want to give their communities a false sense of confidence that they’re protected, even as local leaders do everything they can to help them.“It’s horrible, but it’s true that I can’t tell folks, ‘You are safe,’” Austin City Council Member Gregorio Casar said at the summit. “But I can tell them that we have their backs.”"
