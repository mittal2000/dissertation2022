0,POLITICS,The GOP Tax Plan Tells Us Everything About Who Matters In American Democracy,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-tax-plan-who-matters_us_59fc8ed4e4b0b0c7fa39d222,"Your boss, not you.",2017-11-03,"President Donald Trump, flanked by Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep. Kevin Brady, pitches the GOP's tax plan on Nov. 2.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fc92cf1d00002a007f41a2.jpeg?cache=Tmn4fQUOTC&ops=crop_252_107_3750_2561%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The United States is the richest country in the history of the world. Last year, the genius and muscle of the American people generated more than $18.6 trillion in wealth. This year, our brains and brawn will combine to create well over $19 trillion. Despite all the debt theatrics of the Republican Party during the Obama presidency, we owe just $6.2 trillion to other countries ― less than four months of our collective labors at their present value.Under these circumstances, the question of what the American government can afford is functionally meaningless. If any nation has ever been able to afford quality housing, education, health care, parks, museums ― anything ― the United States can.And we don’t need to tax anyone, rich or poor, in order to afford these fine things. The wealth — the fruits of our labor — already exists. Taxes are a way of managing the bookkeeping system, of setting national priorities for the distribution of wealth created by good ideas and hard work.That’s key: Our country’s wealth is created by everybody. It’s not created by rich people. Rich people are what happen when the bookkeeping units we use to keep track of that wealth — the dollars ― get stuck on particular individuals. Sometimes these people fall into the world possessing such accounting anomalies in the form of inheritances. Sometimes they siphon them from other people through the daily operations of commerce. Sometimes Washington decides to hand them more.On Thursday, President Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and congressional Republicans proposed a multitrillion-dollar tax cut for a particular slice of very wealthy citizens. There is much more than math at stake: These are matters of justice, social prestige and political power. There is no economic law that governs how the $19 trillion we produce each year must be distributed. Figuring out who should get how much of that $19 trillion is a political choice — and the Republicans’ choice is to give much of that money to a few hundred financial dynasties.The GOP says its plan is an effort to “fix our broken tax code,” and there can be no doubt that the code is broken. Our fabulously wealthy nation is mysteriously plagued by poverty. More than 40 million Americans currently live in poverty, including 11.5 million children. Over 41 million people live in what the U.S. Department of Agriculture defines as “food insecure households.” Millions of Americans literally could not afford to eat at some point during 2016. Families living a little higher up the economic ladder generally have a tenuous hold on their middle-class status: 78 percent of U.S. households report living paycheck to paycheck.These economic troubles persist as Wall Street and Silicon Valley are increasingly dividing the spoils of the broader economy among themselves. The financial sector is supposed to function as a sort of utility for manufacturing, agriculture and other elements of what economists call the “real” economy. But today it accounts for nearly 30 percent of corporate profits — about triple its share from three decades ago. Since 2000, compensation in the financial sector has increased at nearly three times the overall rate in the economy. Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook now mimic financial giants by acquiring tech startup after tech startup and then using their merged muscle to consume the profitable activity of others. Google and Facebook together take in 60 percent of the digital advertising market and collected 99 percent of all online ad revenue growth in the past year.The GOP tax plan won’t resolve any of those problems. Republicans have assembled a host of tax changes that will ensure that more and more of the nation’s wealth goes to the people who already have most of it. It’s a strategy to inflate existing fortunes, increase profits on Wall Street and enhance the social dominance of people who make their living from investments over people who make their living earning wages and salaries.The heart of the Republican plan is a permanent cut to the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. The benefits of that will accrue to people who own corporations. If you hold stock in a corporation and the tax rate on that corporation’s profits falls, the value of your stock will rise. You become wealthier without doing anything. It doesn’t matter if the company you own pays its workers a living wage, develops state-of-the-art technology or names violent felons to its board of directors. However prudently or recklessly that company had been earning a profit, it will suddenly become more valuable to its owners.That’s just great if you own tons of stock. But according to Gallup polling, only about half of Americans own any stock at all — through a retirement account or otherwise. Most households that do own stock don’t own very much. Only 22 percent of households own at least $25,000 worth of stock, research from New York University economist Edward Wolff shows.At the top of the distribution, however, stock ownership accounts for a tremendous share of new wealth. On average, households in the top 1 percent receive about 36 percent of their income from financial assets, while the 400 wealthiest American households receive almost 75 percent of their income from capital gains and dividends. It’s not hard to figure out the target market here.Not so long ago, President George W. Bush took a lot of heat for slashing the tax on capital gains — the tax you pay when you sell stocks, bonds or real estate investments. It was, critics said, a shameless giveaway to the idle rich. The current GOP tax plan offers a similar benefit without the hassle of having to actually sell any investments: When stock prices go up due to a drop in corporate taxes, the people who own the stock get richer. And because the GOP bill will also ultimately eliminate the estate tax, owners of financial assets could pass their holdings to their heirs tax-free in perpetuity, allowing financial dynasties to grow and grow independently of the intelligence or enterprise of those stewarding any particular generation of family wealth.No trained economist seriously believes that shoveling unearned benefits to people who just happen to own or inherit financial assets is good for growth, productivity or anything else. And Republicans aren’t really trying to hide what they’re up to. In addition to the corporate rate cut, the GOP would allow companies to immediately write off the full value of new capital investments — when, say, a company purchases new equipment or technology. This tax perk would actually encourage some worthwhile activity: If businesses invest in improving their longer-term operations, they will realize an immediate economic benefit from the tax code. Cutting the corporate tax rate down to 20 percent doesn’t encourage anything except a one-time jolt to asset prices.When Republicans dole out big tax cuts, they typically offer something for low- and middle-income families to make the process a little less unseemly. It’s not clear if they’ll be able to include those perks this time around, and the slapdash, piecemeal approach to helping everyone outside the capital class makes their priorities perfectly clear. When the tax framework was released Thursday morning, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) talked up a slightly more generous child tax credit and some additional deductions for middle-class families. The bill itself shows many of the additional deductions are countered by the elimination of other popular deductions. The expanded child tax credit expires after five years, to be replaced by an increase in taxes on families with children, while the corporate rate drops to 20 percent forever. Republicans on Thursday couldn’t promise that their bill wouldn’t ultimately raise taxes on middle-class families. It’s even conceivable that bona fide rich people could end up worse off under the plan if they draw their incomes from a high garden-variety salary, rather than stock or interest.So never mind the budget deficits and growth projections. The GOP tax plan is a simple political statement about who matters more in American democracy: the heirs to hedge fund fortunes or everyone else in the country. Trump and the Republicans have chosen the dynasts. This is not a necessity; we could easily afford a different set of priorities. Social domination by the financial sector is a choice."
1,TRAVEL,TripAdvisor Apologizes For Removing Rape Claim From Mexican Resort's Reviews,Rebecca Shapiro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tripadvisor-rape-claim-mexico-resort_us_59fbea0de4b0415a420adc7f,The popular site has been accused of deleting posts that could keep travelers safe.,2017-11-03,Three women have come forward claiming they were sexually assaulted at this Mexican property.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fbf6791700002100795b65.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TripAdvisor apologized on Wednesday for deleting a 2010 post in which a woman claimed she was raped at a Mexican resort. The statement came in response to an investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which showed that TripAdvisor removed negative reviews of hotel properties in Mexico which detailed claims of rape, assault and injuries.“A Journal Sentinel investigation into the workings of the $1.5 billion company has found that it is what TripAdvisor does not publish that poses real problems for travelers,” journalists Raquel Rutledge and Andrew Mollica wrote.While the Journal Sentinel reported that more than a dozen travelers claimed the site removed their posts as well, TripAdvisor specifically apologized about a 2010 post written by Dallas native Kristie Love. The mother-of-two said she was raped by a security guard at Iberostar Paraiso Maya, a resort located between Cancun and Playa del Carmen.TripAdvisor removed her post detailing the alleged rape because it violated its commenting policies at the time, which the company described as using “G-rated language.” “We recognized that our previous guidelines went too far in preventing information like this from being shared,” the company said in a statement posted on Twitter.TripAdvisor added that it changed its policies “a few years ago,” and travelers have since been able to post reviews detailing warnings of alleged assault and injuries. According to the Washington Post, Love’s comment was reinstated in October and appears in its original chronological order from seven years ago.But Love was unable to warn TripAdvisor travelers for years. One woman said she was raped by a security guard at the same resort in 2011. Another woman, Jamie Valeri, said she was sexually assaulted there in 2015 when she and her husband blacked out after only a few drinks, the Journal Sentinel reported.Valeri also told the Milwaukee paper that she tried to post a review about the attack on TripAdvisor, but the site removed her comment, labeling it “hearsay.” In response to the Journal Sentinel investigation, TripAdvisor said the company planned to create a “badge” to apply to businesses where claims of health, safety or discrimination issues have been reported in the media or from other “credible sources.” At the time of this writing, Iberostar Paraiso Maya’s TripAdvisor page still features a high rating and an award badge: a 2017 Traveler’s Choice, TripAdvisor’s highest recognition. This award is presented annually to the top 1 percent of businesses across select categories. Need help?

2,ENTERTAINMENT,Sia's Christmas Album Title Contains An Awkward Grammatical Error,Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/its-every-day-not-everyday_us_59fca2cfe4b04cdbeb3300cf,We're very sorry to bring you the following post.,2017-11-03,"Frequent Sia collaborator Maddie Ziegler appears on the cover of Sia's holiday album, ""Everyday Is Christmas.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fcc08a1d00003b007f422a.jpeg?cache=2nlGWGgfTV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Nov. 17, Sia will release a Christmas album.Like everything Sia touches, it will likely be a very good Christmas album. Billboard reports that it contains 10 “soon-to-be” classics with seasonally appropriate titles that include “Snowman,” “Candy Cane Lane,” “Underneath the Mistletoe” and “Underneath the Christmas Lights.” Another perpetuates the false, yet still very nice, idea that “Puppies Are Forever” while the album’s lead single, “Santa’s Coming for Us,” conjures an oddly sinister vision of the traditional carmine figure.We are not here to discuss any of that, though.We are here to discuss the glaring and seemingly unintentional grammatical error in the album’s title, “Everyday Is Christmas.” Yes, “Everyday” should be “Every Day.”And now: a pause for eye-rolling.Though confusing the two terms is an everyday occurrence, it’s not every day that we see such a high-profile misuse. “Everyday” is an adjective used to describe things that are commonplace or literally happen daily, so it doesn’t make sense right before the verb “is.”Except for descriptive clauses, English syntax usually demands we know whom or what we’re talking about before we dive into the action bit (the verb). Regarding Sia’s album, we’re talking about days. Specifically, all of them. Every day. The phrase normally functions adverbially, as in, “I wish I could eat Christmas cookies every day.” In this case, though, its function aligns with that of “today” in the statement: “Today is Christmas! Huzzah!” That is, it’s more of a noun or noun phrase.Grammarist cites a simple test: “Every day” should be used if it could be easily substituted for “each day.” And each day is Christmas, or at least feels more like it, if you listen to Sia’s new songs 365 days per year. Or something.There is, however, one possibility we must acknowledge that would negate this entire argument, subjecting you to several paragraphs’ worth of discussion on grammar for only the sheer fun of it ― artistic license. Sia and Atlantic Records could have made some kind of creative linguistic choice, bucking the rules for effect’s sake.We do not know what that effect would be.HuffPost has chosen to bother two of the singer’s representatives with this question, and will update this post if one of them stops pointing both her eyeballs toward the ceiling long enough to tap out a response. (Sorry, representatives. So sorry.)In the meantime, this writer looks forward to cringing internally when “Everyday Is Christmas” ads crop up before the big day."

7,POLITICS,Republicans Sneak Anti-Abortion Language Into Tax Bill,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-abortion-tax-bill_us_59fca946e4b0baea2631965f,Democrats denounced the move as a back-door attack on Roe v. Wade.,2017-11-03,"""The tax code is no place to define what constitutes an ‘unborn child.’ What’s next, giving a Social Security number to a zygote?” says Rep.

The move is part of an effort by the Trump administration and House Republicans to define life as beginning at conception, with an eye to rolling back Roe v. Wade.Buried on page 93 of the 429-page tax proposal is a provision that would allow fetuses to be named as beneficiaries of college savings accounts known as 529 plans ― investment vehicles that come with a range of tax breaks.Abortion rights advocates were quick to call out the language. “This is a back-door attempt to establish personhood from the moment of conception,” Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus, said in a statement. “The tax code is no place to define what constitutes an ‘unborn child.’ What’s next, giving a Social Security number to a zygote?” Ostensibly, the idea is that parents can get a leg up on saving for their kid’s education before he or she is even born. However, it takes care to define the terms “unborn child” and “child in utero,” in what appears to be a naked attempt to establish so-called personhood for fetuses, a popular anti-abortion tactic.Abortion foes believe that if fetuses were legally considered people, then abortion would have to be outlawed. State and federal legislation attempting to classify fertilized eggs, human embryos and fetuses as people has failed repeatedly over the years. The tax reform provision appears to be a sideways attempt at something similar.“A child in the womb is just as human as you or I yet, until now, the U.S. tax code has failed to acknowledge the unborn child,” Jeanne Mancini, president of the anti-abortion group March for Life, told Politico.There’s nothing in current law stopping parents from opening a 529 savings account before a child is born, explained Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, a personal finance site. A parent opens the account in his or her own name, and once the baby is born, changes the account beneficiary, he explained. McBride said he did this for one of his sons.“I don’t know how this makes it different,” he said. McBride said at most, the tax reform provision would allow parents to skip the step of naming a new beneficiary. “Taking a nonstop flight instead of changing planes,” he said.It’s unclear how the anti-abortion language got into the tax bill. Another anti-abortion group, however, thanked Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) “for his leadership on this important effort.”The GOP tax reform plan is still in its early stages, and it’s unclear if the anti-abortion provision will survive. Two tax policy groups ― one conservative, one progressive ― declined to speak on the topic with HuffPost.Parents use the widely popular 529 accounts to sock away money for their kids’ education expenses. The accounts come with a few tax breaks: You pay no tax on interest earned. And, if you use the money for education expenses, you don’t pay taxes when you withdraw the money, either. In some states, you also get a tax deduction for contributing money to a 529 account. So-called personhood language also made an appearance in a draft strategic plan for the Department of Health and Human Services released last month. In a note about the department’s organizational structure, HHS said its mission was to protect “Americans at every stage of life, beginning at conception.”And earlier this week, the House held a hearing on a bill that would ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The ban doesn’t have a chance of passing, HuffPost’s Laura Bassett reported on Tuesday. “It’s time to emancipate every little unborn baby,” Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said at the hearing.The draft tax bill also offers a tax break to another of the GOP’s favorite kind of people: corporations. The proposal would reduce the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.Actual human children and adults fare less well. The proposal gets rid of an adoption tax credit and ends popular tax deductions on medical spending and student loan interest. Although, perhaps if fetuses can save for college, kids of the future will rack up less in school debt. "
8,RELIGION,I Say Allahu Akbar. I Am Not A Terrorist.,"Karim Shamsi-Basha, ContributorArab-American, American-Arab, Writer, Photographer, Lover of m...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/i-say-allahu-akbar-i-am-not-a-terrorist_us_59fc6d71e4b01ec0dede4144,Any religious book can be misunderstood and misrepresented.,2017-11-03,<p>My sister Mimi prays at her house in Damascus.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fc6e951400002900d7ebfc.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," I grew up saying “Allahu Akbar” numerous times every day.And no, I wasn’t, and am not, a terrorist.I wasn’t someone who blew buildings up, killed people or shot a missile from my rocket launcher. As far as the West is concerned, those are the events associated with the saying when something bad is about to happen. People of the West are terrified of the phrase.I was a Muslim boy trying to pray as many times as he could amidst a life of love and peace, in a home that did not condone any terrorism. My father was a poet who read me love poetry instead of nursery rhymes. He uttered the phrase when he prayed. If love existed in the form of a man, it was my father.“Love everyone,” was the phrase he uttered almost daily. To him, there was not a problem he couldn’t solve with love.Allahu AkbarThe saying literally means God is the greatest. It is required of all Muslims to say several times during prayer, which is demanded five times a day. On the average a Muslim ends up saying it hundreds of times. The words are also used as a celebration of life: When a baby is born, when a couple marry or when a veteran returns home safe.The word Islam means surrender. You’re supposed to surrender to God and worship him. Love, mercy and compassion are uttered several hundred times a day by any Muslim when they say Besm Allah Alrahman Alraheem, In The Name Of God The Merciful The Compassionate. That saying is uttered before you do anything.So when and why is the phrase Allahu Akbar used as a battle cry, when a terrorist is about to kill someone? The latest incident was the horrific act in New York when the terrorist shouted the phrase before the police shot him, and after he killed eight people and injured many more.For the majority of Muslims, to shout God’s name as you killed the innocent is an abomination. Muslims no more want innocent people killed than anyone else. So why is the phrase used by terrorists?For the same reason ISIS and Al-Qaida exist: The misinterpretation of Islam. When you use religion as the motive for you actions, you have the power to appeal to the masses. It’s a brain washing if you will. The terrorists who flew the planes into the World Trade Center on September 11th are no different than any suicide bomber in Israel/Palestine, are no different that the one who mowed down bicyclists in New York. They are people who misunderstood and misused the religion. They are sick and twisted and evil.The phrase is to remind Muslims that God is supreme. That’s it. It was never to be used as a battle cry during horrendous actions furthering political agendas with evil motives.My heart sank when I heard the terrorist shouted the saying after the attack. I will never understand the link between Islam and Terrorism. The Islam I grew up amidst condemns such actions. It preaches love and peace and tranquility and feeding the hungry and clothing the poor and sheltering the homeless. One of the five main requirements of Islam in addition to prayer and fasting is to give a percentage of your money to the poor.Is There A Difference?To me, there is no difference between the terrorists who shout Allahu Akbar when committing a crime and those white nationalists and racists who shouted “Jews will not replace us” in Charlottesville ― Virginia recently.Here’s where the double standard hurts: When that man killed 58 people in Las Vegas, the word terrorist was not uttered by anyone. Why is it only attached to people who claim Islamic affiliation?The Quran was brought down to Muhammad in the seventh century. The verses which preach war and fighting were contextual and apply to the time when he and his followers had no choice but to fight back, or die. It is no different than the Old Testament which contains many verses preaching war and killing.In Deuteronomy Chapter 2, Verses 32-37, Moses is told to kill men, women, and children:“And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Siphon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain. From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us.”How is this any different than what’s in the Quran? And why are Muslims judged by a different prism? Most of the Quran preaches love and harmony and helping those who have not. Take this for example:“And feed with food the needy wretch, the orphan and the prisoner, for love of Him (saying): We feed you, for the sake of Allah only. We wish for no reward nor thanks from you.” [76:8-9]Any ancient religious book can be misunderstood and misrepresented. The Ku Klux Klan said the Jesus was the first Klansman. They burned crosses to spread their ill will. How is that any different?My SisterMy sister Rowaida lives in New York. We chatted last night when I wanted to make sure her head covering was not causing any problems. In the past when terrorists committed atrocities in the name of Islam, women with head coverings were profiled. She said everything was fine, and prayed for those people affected by the terror.My sister prayed for them.She is a teacher and her husband is an architect. All they want is food, water, and a roof over their heads, and for their children to thrive. They have four: a computer scientist, a doctor, a physical therapist, and a pharmacist. They love like anyone else, and they have compassion and mercy and empathy like anyone else.The covering on her head says two things: Modesty and humility.A Wish Or TwoI have one wish, well maybe two.The first is for my children to thrive and go through life without any judgment based on their last name.The second is for this world to know that Muslims mean no one any harm. The people who mean harm are as far from Islam as the KKK is far from Christianity.My religion is love.For more, visit arabinalabama.com "

He allegedly has been in that position for three years, previously serving as an information systems specialist at the foundation from May 2013 to May 2014. But if you ask the foundation, he is not an employee there and hasn’t been one, at least for the past year. The Foundation for Moral Law is no doubt a family affair for the Moores. The president of the organization is Kayla, Roy’s wife. The Washington Post reported that the charity has employed at least two of the couple’s four children, although it’s not clear what their compensation was. The foundation has been lucrative for Roy Moore. He collected more than $1 million total ― for part-time work ― as president from 2007-2012, which was far more than what the nonprofit disclosed in its tax filings.Tax experts told The Washington Post that the foundation was suspicious because it may violate tax rules that prohibit the use of a charity for the private benefit of an individual. A board member acknowledged that it is basically run by the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and his family. Caleb may be benefiting more from the resume boost rather than a steady paycheck. His resume, found on his LinkedIn page, is dated Feb. 27, 2017. Assistant executive director is his most recent position, from May 2014-present. The resume is riddled with grammatical and typographical errors, such as the note that he has assisted in “managing a team of 5 attorneys’, and two office staff employees,” and has “7 years of management experience, including a two-high-level position’s.”Despite those seven years of management experience, the resume states that he is looking for “entry-level employment.”“Significant relational and interaction skills, both written, and oral,” Caleb writes on his resume. “Constantly aware of current Alabama Law; both Criminal and Civil Procedure. Also as a part-time contractor; I stay up-to-date with OSHA compliance. Business- professional competitive disposition with a prominence of gaining knowledge and experience in every aspect of the work place.”Caleb’s LinkedIn page, however, has a different title: legal administrative assistant, a position he says he’s had since May 2013. In its 2012 tax filing, the Foundation for Moral Law listed Caleb as the executive director and secretary for part of the year, although it said he received no compensation. In a 2015 interview, Caleb denied ever holding that job. “I work in the ministry,” Caleb said. “I’m part of the foundation. Matthew Kidd is the executive director. My mother (Kayla Moore) is the president. I do work there. I basically draft letters. I’m also going to school. I’m taking classes from Troy online. I’m two classes short of a bachelor’s degree.”Caleb’s resume says he graduated high school in 2009 and is currently in the process of getting his college degree. But Jessica Deem, the executive assistant at FML, told HuffPost that despite Caleb’s resume, he does not work at the organization. “Since I’ve been here [about a year], he’s had odd jobs here, but nothing permanent. He helps out from time to time, but that’s it,” she said. Deem also confirmed that Caleb has received compensation from FML: “He’s gotten paid from our foundation, yes, he has. He was on our payroll, but it wasn’t as an executive director.”She didn’t have the exact dates of when he was on the payroll, asking HuffPost to email her so she could forward the request and get more details. The foundation never provided any additional response on Caleb’s employment. Neither Caleb Moore nor Roy Moore’s Senate campaign returned a request for comment. Caleb has also attracted extra attention not for his work at the foundation, but for his multiple arrests. Most recently, on Oct. 10, he was charged with third-degree criminal trespassing. It was related to his November 2016 arrest for hunting without permission. Caleb has been arrested nine times, including for driving under the influence, drug-related charges and domestic violence. After one of his arrests in 2015, he wrote a Facebook post going after “crooked police officers and critics of my dad” who want to “not only destroy his career for what he stands for but will go as far as trying to destroy his family.”Caleb has also reportedly tweeted offensive and controversial comments, such as referring to his friends as “niggas” and saying he agrees with his dad on ”#nohomos” and ”#traditionalmarriage.” After the LGBTQ blog Joe.My.God published some of Caleb’s tweets, he made his Twitter account private. “I was getting tired of homosexuals messaging me and saying things,” he told AL.com in 2015, also seeming to suggest that someone had gotten hold of his account and sent some of the messages without his permission. Roy Moore has made a national name for himself with his conservative stance on social issues and has been an outspoken opponent of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. As chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, he instructed state probate judges to ignore a U.S. Supreme Court ruling declaring marriage equality the law of the land.

In her post, Kohler wrote that “Ratner was a rapist on at least one night in Hollywood about 12 years ago,” according to the defamation suit, which was filed in federal court. Kohler said Ratner had “preyed on me as a drunk girl.”Ratner’s attorney told TMZ that Kohler said the director “forced her to have sex” after they’d met at a club in Los Angeles in either 2004 or 2005. Ratner’s suit, which characterized the Facebook post as libel per se, alleged that her claims were “entirely false, fabricated and fictional.”The suit seeks general, special and punitive damages for Ratner’s alleged “emotional distress, worry, anger and anxiety,” and “injuries to his personal and professional reputations,” Variety reported. On Wednesday, the Times published its expose on Ratner’s alleged history of sexual predation. In the feature, six women, including actresses Olivia Munn and Jaime Ray Newman, discussed their alleged encounters with Ratner. Munn recalled an incident in 2004 when she said Ratner masturbated in front of her in his trailer. Actress Natasha Henstridge accused Ratner of forcing her to perform oral sex on him.Through his attorney, Ratner denied the allegations leveled against him in the Times article. Warner Bros. reportedly severed ties with Ratner on Wednesday. The Hollywood Reporter said the studio chose not to renew its production deal with Ratner and will be removing him as producer from the upcoming film “The Goldfinch.”"

By next year, the number will be down to 17.",2017-11-02,"<p>New Jersey construction workers rally in favor of a gas tax hike, which was enacted. The increase was packaged with the elimination of the state’s estate tax and a cut in sales taxes.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fb27e51400004a00a66653.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Elaine S. PovichFor years, the New Jersey Business & Industry Association advocated scrapping the estate tax, arguing it was driving wealthy New Jersey families to other states.The group got nowhere. Defenders of the tax argued that the cash-strapped state needed every penny it could get, and that it was fair to levy an extra tax on the estates of the rich.Then late last year estate tax opponents finally succeeded: They packaged the eventual abolition of that tax with a bunch of other tax hikes, including a huge increase in the gasoline tax that brought New Jersey from the second-lowest gas tax in the nation to the eighth-highest. Under legislation Republican Gov. Chris Christie signed in 2016, the estate tax exemption rose from $675,000 to $2 million this year and will be eliminated in 2018.New Jersey will retain its inheritance tax, which is assessed on individual bequests rather than on overall estates.That’s been the pattern in many states that have scrapped the estate tax or increased the amount of the estate that is exempt: By eliminating the estate tax as part of a package that raises revenue from other sources or puts money into other priorities, such proposals have won the support of both Republicans and Democrats.In 2001, every U.S. state imposed either an estate or inheritance tax. But that year, the federal government eliminated its income tax credit for such payments — and the repeals began. By 2018, only 17 states will have an estate tax, an inheritance tax or both.In recent years, Tennessee (2016), Georgia (2014), Indiana, North Carolina and Ohio (all in 2013) also have eliminated their estate or inheritance taxes.Earlier this year, Minnesota increased its estate tax exemption from $1.8 million to $2.1 million, retroactive to Jan.1. The exemption increases to $2.4 million in 2018, $2.7 million in 2019, and $3 million in 2020.Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton, who argued that the state couldn’t afford the loss in revenue, allowed the legislation to become law without his signature. He said that the compromise contained some things that he supported, including child care tax credits, property tax relief for farmers, and increased government aid to cities.Maryland next year will raise its exemption from $3 million to $4 million, under a 2014 law. Maryland’s Senate president, Mike Miller, a Democrat, supported the legislation, though he said he was reluctant to do so. As a tradeoff, he urged the Legislature to raise the minimum wage. It did, and the wage went to $9.25 in 2017.In D.C., the exemption level doubled to $2 million at the start of 2017, and is set to go up to $5.5 million in 2018. The item, which was part of the city’s budget, was made possible by a surplus in revenue. To stave off critics, the council also put more money into school funding and paid leave.Tradeoffs Make the DifferenceJared Walczak, senior policy analyst for the Tax Foundation, a conservative group that generally believes in lower taxes on a broader base, said that tradeoffs often do make the difference on tax policy. He noted New Jersey’s trade, eliminating the estate tax but raising the gas tax, means more people will pay a little, rather than just a few rich families paying a lot, spreading the pain.Walczak explained that the estate tax is a relatively small source of revenue — in fiscal 2016, state inheritance and estate taxes raised $5.1 billion, accounting for 1.4 percent of state tax collections in the states that have the taxes. It is also a volatile revenue source, since it depends on when someone dies.Delaware this year also enacted legislation to repeal the estate tax, despite facing a $400 million budget hole. Similar to New Jersey, the change in Delaware, which takes effect in 2018, was negotiated during larger budget talks. It was signed into law by Democratic Gov. John Carney just days after a budget that included tax increases on real estate transfers and corporations.Republicans had sought the estate tax repeal in exchange for their support of the corporate tax hike, which Democrats expected to bring in more revenue.Delaware state Rep. Paul Baumbach, a Democrat, said getting rid of the estate tax — which brought in an average of $3 million to $5 million a year — in return for a $100 million projected increase in other revenue, was “an easy decision to make.” He said he is attuned to the voices of liberals in his state who opposed it, but “when they realized it was a 20-to-1 tradeoff, they understood where it came from.”On the Republican side, state Rep. Michael Ramone had long argued that the estate tax was driving wealthy residents to declare one of their other homes as their “primary residence,” to dodge the Delaware estate tax. Financial advisers, he said, began to recommend that strategy, and he saw revenue drop, not just from the estate tax but from income taxes and other taxes that the rich residents would normally have paid.“The closer they got to dying,” he said, “the more money managers were recommending that they establish residency elsewhere.”With the help of the financial managers, Ramone compiled a list of names of ultra-rich people who were willing to talk to legislators about their strategy in private, but he said that was not needed once he showed lawmakers the math on how their leaving such a small state, where rich people have outsized influence on revenue, would hurt the bottom line. “There was no public campaign. We were just educating people.”But Baumbach pooh-poohed the notion that attorneys were advising their clients to move to Florida because of the Delaware estate tax. “I call shenanigans on that,” he said, “I think they want no winters.”Gift to the Wealthy?The New Jersey tax compromise included a 23-cents-per-gallon hike in the gas tax, bringing it to 37.5 cents a gallon. The legislation also cut $1.4 billion in other taxes, including income taxes on elderly residents who can now exempt the first $100,000 of retirement income (a couple) from state income tax.Supporters said the tax break for middle-income seniors was a way to counter arguments that eliminating the estate tax was a gift to the wealthy. New Jersey took in nearly $320 million in estate taxes in 2014. The increase in the gas tax is expected to raise more than $1 billion a year.Michele Siekerka, president and CEO of the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, said she had talked to lawmakers many times about its members’ concerns about the estate tax. A small-business owner, for example, told her if they got hit by a bus tomorrow, their children wouldn’t have the liquidity in the business to pay the estate taxes, she said.Her organization commissioned a study in 2016 that found New Jersey lost more than 2 million residents from 2005 to 2014, which resulted in $11.4 billion in lost economic activity, including spending, taxes and investments. The report said that of the 34 states that attracted New Jersey retirees, 20 have no estate and inheritance taxes, among them Florida and North Carolina.But William Frey, demographer at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank, scoffed at the notion that the estate tax played a major role in those moves, especially for rich people who would have been subject to it.“Broadly, people move for all kinds of reasons, and taxes are not the main reason,” he said. “Snowbelt-to-sunbelt migration is going to continue to happen. A lot of it has to do with the weather and the high cost of living, of which taxes are a piece of it, but not the whole thing.”CORRECTION: The map in this story was updated 11/2 to add Illinois to the states with an estate tax.Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"

He said he saw bars and restaurants filled with patrons, and he saw New Yorkers thanking police officers for their service.“People were shaking cops’ hands and saying, ‘Thank you so much.’ And cops were saying, ‘Thank you for being here ... for being part of our community,’” Smith said. Police identified 29-year-old Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov as the driver who barreled down the bike path Tuesday in lower Manhattan. He arrived in the U.S. in 2010 from Uzbekistan and is a self-described member of the Islamic State. He was charged Wednesday with one count of providing support to a terrorist organization and one count of violence and destruction of a motor vehicle.Smith praised New Yorkers for continuing to move about their lives in the wake of the attack. “This morning ... kids were walking to school on a brisk day ... buses were loading, people were getting onto subway stations,” Smith said. “Sixth Avenue was a mess, but New York City was strong and solid and impressive.

Under that deal, most sanctions on Iran were lifted in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear work.“America’s hostility is towards the Iranian nation ... America is the number one enemy of our nation ... We will never accept their bullying over the nuclear deal,” Khamenei said.Since the deal was reached in 2015, Khamenei has continued to denounce the United States publicly, suggesting that the antagonism between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Tehran would not abate because of the accord.Iran and the United States severed diplomatic ties shortly after the revolution when hardline students took 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.

18,WORLD NEWS,We Don't Need No Balfour Declarations... Or Celebrations,"Gil Troy, ContributorAmerican presidential historian, McGill professor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/we-dont-need-no-balfour-declarations-or-celebrations_us_59fb06d5e4b09887ad6f3dc7,"Thinking forward from past to present, I see how the Balfour declarations advanced Jewish nationalism, meaning Zionism. Nevertheless",2017-11-02,"<em>The Balfour declarations, Wilson’s Fourteen Points, and the League of Nations mandate legitimized the quest for nationhood of all nations with a self-conscious identity.</em>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fb070716000046002f1bf4.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Thinking forward from past to present, I see how the Balfour declarations advanced Jewish nationalism, meaning Zionism. Nevertheless, the proud Zionist activist in me shudders.As a historian, I appreciate the Balfour declarations – plural. As a proud Zionist, however, I resent the cheers and the jeers the centennial is provoking.Last Shabbat, I saw the master educator Mordy Hurwich-Kehat at synagogue. Having noticed that he was giving a lecture “celebrating the centennial of the Balfour Declaration,” I asked: “do you really think Balfour’s that important? All this celebrating feels pathetic.” Kehat – whose father was born on November 2, 1933, the Declaration’s 16th anniversary – noted that until 1948, Jews in Palestine celebrated “Balfour Day” as a national holiday, hailing this turning point in Zionist history. And he referred me to Martin Kramer’s impressive article in Mosaic, “The Forgotten Truth about the Balfour Declaration.”Reading the article, and reflecting on our conversation, inspired three conclusions. First, we should call them the Balfour declarations, plural. Lord Balfour’s declaration wasn’t just one idiosyncratic British improvisation, Kramer explains, nor was it a British colonial power grab. Rather, it was one of many simultaneous affirmations. France, Italy, Japan, Siam, China and, most important, the United States of America echoed Balfour’s Declaration recognizing the Jews’ right to a national home in Palestine.Second, the nineteenth century’s elaborate national matchmaking service, linking European national aspirations with geographic regions – as France became France, and Italy became Italy – went global after World War I.On February 11, 1918, addressing a joint session of Congress, America’s president Woodrow Wilson proclaimed: “National aspirations must be respected; peoples may now be dominated and governed only by their own consent.”The colonial empires were crumbling. Instead, peoples in Asia and Africa would achieve “self-determination,” expressing their collective nationalist identities through the political form of the nation state. The Balfour declarations, Wilson’s Fourteen Points, and the League of Nations mandate legitimized the quest for nationhood of all nations with a self-conscious identity. This process included the Jewish nation at the time and – trigger warning for right-wingers – the Palestinians, eventually.Thus, the historian in me responds to Hurwich-Kehat and Kramer. Thinking forward from past to present, I see how the Balfour declarations advanced Jewish nationalism, meaning Zionism.Nevertheless, the proud Zionist activist in me shudders.The Jews’ legitimacy as a nation doesn’t depend on one Balfour declaration from 1917 – or many of them. Jews didn’t need an international permission slip: not in 1917 nor even in 1947 from the United Nations, and certainly not today.Such affirmations are welcome. They should help legitimize Zionism. But these documents are window dressing.No such papers compare to the Bible. They don’t rank with 3,500 years of Jewish ties to the land, which make Jews, as the human rights activist Irwin Cotler teaches, the original aboriginal people, still reading the same Bible, speaking the same language, continuing the same culture, on the same land.They don’t compete with Jews’ rich history in that land of Israel, with Deborah the prophetess and David the king, Isaiah the preacher and, yes, Jesus the teacher. And these documents lack the emotional power of the case Jews made starting in the 1800s, that Jews had nowhere else to go, nowhere else that was home – and nowhere else to flourish individually and collectively, spiritually and politically, as we have in Israel.I am touchy on this point because our enemies are using the Balfour Centennial to reduce the Zionist claims to these 67 words of diplo-speak rather than 3,500 years of nationhood. Characteristically, Haaretz is running articles denouncing the Balfour Declaration as racist, imperialist, colonialist, evil. Such distortions make kneeling during the national anthem look patriotic; this vitriol from Israel’s truly loony Left is more like barfing on your founding documents.And speaking of founding documents, did Great Britain or the United States need some Balfour-type permit? Like most countries, in the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence these nations seized the moment, emerging proudly, unilaterally, without anyone’s permission – simply asserting their national identities and resulting rights.I am also touchy on this point because the fight against Israel remains so vicious that our enemies exploit any hesitation on our end, any sense that we are too pathetic to claim our basic rights – like all others. Jews shouldn’t be the Sally Field of Nations, waving the Balfour Declaration or the UN Partition Plan to say, as Fields said when she finally won an Oscar in 1985, “you like me... you really like me.”Jews don’t need a Balfour green-light when authorities in Abu Dhabi won’t play Israel’s anthem – the Israeli Judo champ Tal Flicker starts singing “Hatikva” anyway, without anyone’s permission.Jews don’t need a Balfour validator to confront the haters at McGill University – my academic home – who kicked the only three pro-Israeli, anti-boycott students off the student council: we fight antisemites loudly, proudly, unashamedly. Jews don’t need a Balfour thumbs-up to mock those who view Israel as a disappointment. We salute Israeli democracy’s everyday miracles without seeking anyone’s approval.And Jews don’t need a Balfour hug to prove what Israel has proved since 1948 – that the Jews are a people, fully justified in building a state in the Jewish homeland, and impressively capable of making that state a refuge for the persecuted and an oasis of idealism, a liberal democratic stronghold in the undemocratic illiberal Middle East and a source of old-new Jewish pride to a once depressed, now liberated, people.Read original article on The Jerusalem Post.The writer is the author of The Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s.

But I was in a mall food court scribbling down a joke about dog farts ’cause I’m a comic and a goddamned professional.Then it happened.Two yards away and one tired teriyaki chicken taste-tester away sat two young boys. Children. Six? Eight? They seemed old enough to know Santa Claus isn’t real, but young enough to still think their parents’ love is unconditional. One of them wrinkled his face when he spoke, like a squirmy, excitable human pug. The other looked like a tiny Tom Hanks and periodically stuck his stubby little finger up his nose when his mother wasn’t looking. They were playing that “Would you rather...?” game, asking each other little boy questions. The types of questions I imagine Trump asks foreign leaders.Tiny Tom Hanks: “Would you rather... eat forever... cupcakes or pie?”Pug Boy: “Pie!” (idiot)Tiny Tom Hanks: “Okay, um, would you rather... fly or be invisible?”Pug Boy: “Invisible ’cause then no one could see me!” (someone get this kid therapy)Tiny Tom Hanks: “Umm... would you rather... play... baseball or soccer?”Pug Boy: “Baseball, duh! Soccer’s a girl sport!”Then they laughed. Oh, how they laughed.I put my pen down. I summoned my most potent “I hate you” look. Then I aimed.They, of course, didn’t notice me staring daggers at them. Which is a shame — It’s never too early for a kid to learn that people around you despise your joy.His words struck me on a personal level. But also, on a professional level — the irony of hearing an unsolicited opinion about girls playing soccer felt so ironic it felt like divine intervention. But I’ll get to that later.I remembered when I was his age. My bedroom walls were adorned with posters of Derek Jeter. I remembered the string that dangled above my bed that stored the sock my mom made me cover my hand with at night so I wouldn’t suck my thumb that I later replaced with a New York Yankee replica helmet. I remember staring at that helmet every night as I drifted off to sleep; I allowed it to be the tour guide to my subconscious, steering my dreams to the day I could glide the real helmet onto my head before stepping up to the plate, before sticking my back leg out of the batters box and telling the umpire time out. Just like my hero, and — undoubtedly— my predecessor, Derek Jeter.But when I was nine years old, I got kicked off my tee ball team. A boy teammate started to “like” me so the coach deemed me a distraction. He explained it was an unspoken rule girls weren’t allowed on the team anyway, and basically fired me. I got fired! FROM TEE BALL! The fact that ESPN wasn’t alerted to this nine-year-old future Yankee’s incomprehensible termination was beyond me. I wasn’t juicing. I wasn’t betting on the game. But I committed the most reprehensible offense possible — I was, simply, a girl. Way to go, Coach... you made an unspoken rule pretty fucking spoken. Dick.I was shattered. I was afraid MLB scouts would stop tracking my progress. My dad — SUPER CASUALLY — told me the Yankees wouldn’t allow me on the team anyway. He told me Major League Baseball didn’t let girls in. “There, there,” he said. “There’s no future for you in baseball anyway.” I was numb.A couple grief-stricken months later, I discovered soccer. I entered the fray tentatively — like a young widow re-entering the dating scene: Broken. Hesitant. Horny.I watched Mia Hamm score. I watched Julie Foudy run. I watched people in the stands watch them score and run. I became interested in soccer because I was allowed to play it. Then, I fell head over heels in love for the sport itself.So as I watched these little boys (in a not-at-all-creepy way), I had questions. I wanted to reshape these boys’ undercooked little minds. I wanted to inform them that soccer is the most popular sport in the world — what makes it a girl sport? Is it a “girl sport” because it is only one of two team sports women are allowed to play professionally? Is it a “girl sport” because as children both boys and girls are encouraged to play it, but since girls are allowed, that somehow dilutes it compared to the sports girls aren’t allowed to play? So, to Pug Boy, the idea of playing soccer — compared to baseball — is laughable?What a hilarious notion, really. That this pink-dicked machismo of a man would ever associate himself with something girls can do?! How disgusting! How embarrassing! How. Fucking. Funny.I wanted to punt that kid into the open oven of the Sbarro’s like he was the extra point after a touchdown.Full disclosure: Yes, I am an LGBT-rights advocate Jew lady living in 2017. Which means, yes, if I were to sit on a stool and have a portrait painter render me as accurately as possible, the end result would be a bruised bowl of blood filled to the very brim.That being said —Why does a little girl have no shame idolizing a male athlete, yet a little boy is ashamed even considering a girl athlete. Or, even, an entire — how’d he say it? — “girl sport.”“He’s a child! Children don’t know anything!” I agree. I am eavesdropping on a kid whose brain is still mush. He literally knows nothing. Except for thinking he’s better than girls. HOW? How can a mini-person with such limited life experience already be prejudiced?“He’s a little boy. Boys don’t like girls.” Are they conditioned not to, or do they pop out of the womb that way? Is it because a woman’s womb was his first place of residence? Look, I’m ashamed of where I came from too. But I came from Florida. Totally different. So how can a child — a blank canvas of morality — a still-evolving pre-man, somehow, subliminally, be ashamed of something he associates with girls?You think I’m over-reacting.Possibly. I’m not devoid of self-awareness. After the results of the election and one more guy friend lashing out at me for choosing not to have sex with him (or as men call it, “friend-zoning”), I sulked into my first ever therapy session dressed in all grey like a slumped-over storm cloud. And so I’ve learned, yes, I can at times be a tad, well, dramatic. But buckle up!’Cause here’s where the divine intervention comes into play.For the last year, I’ve been developing a dark comedy TV show about a professional women’s soccer team. A professional women’s soccer team no one seems to give a shit about. Or realize exists.Because in case you don’t know, there is a professional women’s soccer league called the NWSL. They recently had their championship game — their World Series of soccer — and the next day, one of the largest sport website’s headline boasted some NFL player’s injury. I couldn’t find the headline proclaiming the Portland Thorns as victorious anywhere on the homepage. My cable provider doesn’t even list the NWSL alongside the MLS (Major League Soccer - the men’s league) in their “sports” category.They must also deem it a laughable “girl sport.”What’s funny to me is considering soccer a girl sport — doesn’t “girl sport” sound like the sport favors girls? Like of both the genders who play the sport, the girls reign supreme?I wonder if the women soccer players who make about 40 percent, if not less, of their male counterparts feel like they’re reigning supreme in a girl’s sport.I wonder if the women soccer players who have day jobs to make up for their $8K professional athlete salary feel like they’re reigning supreme in a girl’s sport.I wonder if the women soccer players who had their league shut down so the owner could buy an expensive player on his men’s team feel like they’re reigning supreme in a girl’s sport.I wonder if the women soccer players who were forced to play their World Cup on the cheaper, injury-prone artificial turf instead of real grass like their male counterparts feel like they’re reigning supreme in a girl’s sport.So those little boys’ words stung me. Because for the past year, I’ve dug as deep into the world of women’s soccer as a person who isn’t a player can possibly dig. I’ve done hundreds of hours of research about women soccer players fighting for televised games (thank you, Lifetime, for broadcasting NWSL games since all the sports stations ignore it), fighting for wage equality, fighting for equal employment opportunity, fighting for corporate sponsorship, fighting for our gender’s rights, fighting for our gender’s respect, just fucking fighting.And as my studio and I begin to prepare for network pitches, the premise of my show has been received with skepticism, despite having Abby Wambach attached as a consulting producer. “Women’s soccer, really?” or “Risky! Good luck!” Does a dark comedy about a team of women sanction a dubious warning? I might as well be pitching a multi-cam about six nazis who share an NYC apartment. Which, let’s be honest, is much more likely to happen first. Sidebar, Abby Wambach: Two time Olympic Gold medalist, World Cup Champion, FIFA Player of the Year, Time Magazine’s Top 100 Most Influential People in the World (& girl athlete, obvi.)So when I heard those little boys laugh at the prospect of playing soccer — of playing girl soccer — I realized their reaction is not all that different from some of these fully evolved non-mush adult brain reactions.Are we conditioned to believe these women athletes are less than, or did we come out of the womb that way?Let it be clear: I’m not bashing men. I’m saying from birth, every one of us is conditioned to somehow think less of a woman playing sports. To somehow assume watching women’s sports or reading about women’s sports is something the general public wouldn’t give two shits about. So we don’t broadcast women’s sports and we don’t write about women’s sports. I’ve read Harry Potter — pretty sure that’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.Case in point — I had a general meeting with a production company that has made it their mission to tell stories about women: Their struggles, their empowerment, their badassery. The woman I met with asked me to write an essay for their online feminist newsletter. I didn’t want to. I’ve never written an essay. But then I thought about that day at the mall. Those two little boys. I thought about my fight to get people to give women’s soccer a chance. I thought about the book I just read “Under the Lights and in the Dark: Untold Stories of Women’s Soccer” by Gwendolyn Oxenham that details several players’ struggles to make it in an industry that is constantly trying to push them out. Stories about grit, about passion, about the extraordinary perseverance of the human spirit. (It’s excellent, please read it.) So I wrote this essay. The woman I met with said she loved it and sent it to the feminist newsletter’s editor. Then the feminist newsletter editor emailed me, said she wouldn’t publish this essay. She said, “Your voice is great and you’re really funny, we just weren’t that excited by the subject matter. Would love to have other ideas from you though!”“The subject matter.” Girls playing sports. Even a feminist newsletter whose main objective is “to give a platform to young female voices to discuss feminist issues” like unequal treatment and unequal pay refuses to publish, FOR FREE, an essay trying to raise awareness of those very things. First, I was amused by the irony and the hypocrisy. Then, I was disgusted by the irony and the hypocrisy. “Would love to have other ideas from you though!” Fuck off.It’s hard enough being allowed to write about women’s soccer. I can’t even imagine how difficult it must be to try to earn your life’s sustenance from playing it. To every woman who has risked everything to be a professional soccer player — you’ve been slighted by society, you’ve been slighted by your employers, you’ve been slighted by unequal playing surfaces, you’ve been slighted by working harder and earning less, you’ve even been slighted by a feminist newsletter — and yet, you continue to teach young girls (and frumpy older ones) to just keep your head down and keep fighting. You deserve to have people fighting for you, too.So I guess my call to action is this: If you like sports, next season, watch a National Women’s Soccer League game.Watch Marta dance a soccer ball between her opponents legs with such spectacular deftness it’s almost spiritual. Watch Meghan Klingenberg zoom around the field and miraculously appear wherever the ball is in a way that somehow reminds me of Tinkerbell. (sorry, Megan). Watch Becky Sauerbrunn clobber the offense with the intensity of an army.Because if you like sports, you like competition. You like stakes. You like excitement. In women’s soccer, if your team wins or loses, it matters. It matters to the league, to the team, to the player. It effects the existence of the sport. Let’s be honest, if the Yankees win or lose, nothing changes. I might be happier for a night and tell my cousins in Boston to go suck it, but ultimately, nothing changes. There’s no stakes. With women’s soccer, everything is on the line.So watch it, it’s fun. Support it, it matters.Also if you have spawn, have them watch it too. It’s not a coincidence we celebrate the religion our parents celebrate, we eat the cheese our mom ate, we grill our steak the way our dad grilled it (well-done and I’m not apologizing for it). And we root for the teams our parents rooted for. Or at the very least, the teams they exposed us to. We support what we grew up with.If you’re wondering…No. I did not punt that kid into the open oven of the Sbarro’s like he was the extra point after a touch down. Because, to put it in the most annoying way possible, that’s football - another sport I’m not allowed to play. See?

20,POLITICS,Trump Picks Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell To Lead The Central Bank,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-chair_us_59f9eb33e4b00c6145e334a8,"With this choice, the president opted against a radical break with the status quo.",2017-11-02,Progressives think they've dodged a bullet with the president's pick of Jerome Powell to chair the Federal Reserve.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f9ebfb1800003400d5a899.jpeg?cache=Idz15W2lZu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump nominated Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell to chair the Fed on Thursday, defying conservative calls for a dramatic shift in the direction of the central bank.“If we are to sustain all of this tremendous economic growth, our economy requires sound monetary policy and prudent oversight of our banking system. That is why we need strong, sound and steady leadership at the United States Federal Reserve,” Trump said at a Thursday afternoon event announcing Powell’s nomination. “I have nominated Jay to be our next federal chairman ― and so important, because he will provide exactly that type of leadership: He’s strong, he’s committed, he’s smart,” Trump continued, referring to Powell by his nickname.Powell, a Republican who made a fortune in the private equity business, has served on the Fed’s board of governors since 2012 when President Barack Obama nominated him.Widely viewed as only modestly more conservative than current Chair Janet Yellen, Powell is expected to broadly maintain the monetary and regulatory policies the Fed has pursued since the financial crisis of 2008. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets key interest rates, he never voted against Yellen’s low-interest rate policies. In a public change of heart, Trump, who had lambasted Yellen during his presidential campaign, praised her on Thursday as “a wonderful woman, who’s done a terrific job.” As recently as last week, the president had even said that he hadn’t ruled out nominating her to a second term as chair.In picking Powell, Trump sided with his pro-business advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, over the recommendations of Vice President Mike Pence and other ideological conservatives. Pence had reportedly urged Trump to pick Stanford University economist John Taylor, who favors narrowing the Fed’s mandate to focus on addressing inflation. The prospect of such a dramatic rewrite of the Fed’s mission pleased inflation hawks, but spooked Wall Street analysts who predicted negative effects on the economy.“It’s relieving that Trump chose someone that represents continuity from the current Fed,” said Jordan Haedtler, manager of the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of groups that advocates for progressive Fed policies. “But it’s also unclear why if he wants continuity with the Fed’s policies of accommodating monetary policy and reasonable financial protections, he would not have reappointed Janet Yellen, who is by many metrics the most successful chair in Fed history.”“It seems like he’s gone with the safer pick and found some kind of middle ground between Yellen and the movement monetary right,” Haedtler added. Powell must be confirmed by the Senate, where he is likely to encounter more resistance from conservative Republicans than Democrats. Twenty-one Republican senators voted against confirming him as a Fed governor in May 2012. If approved, Powell will begin a four-year term as chairman in February 2018.Fed Up, which had run an ad campaign aimed at persuading Trump to re-appoint Yellen, has now shifted its focus to pushing Democratic senators to question Powell carefully about his commitment to pro-growth interest rate policy and to strong banking regulation.“It’s worth clarifying, given the dangerous moment we’re in and how precarious the economy is, where he stands on both of those questions,” Haedtler said.In June testimony before the Senate banking committee, Powell affirmed his overall commitment to the tougher post-crisis banking regulations overseen by the Fed, including higher capital requirements.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law of 2010 increased the Fed’s authority to regulate large financial institutions. It has the power to set and enforce the amount of capital that banks must hold and to conduct “stress tests” evaluating the health of banks and other financial institutions whose collapse would pose a systemic risk to the economy.“In the longer term, stronger prudential requirements for large banking firms will produce more sustainable credit availability and economic growth,” Powell said.At the same time, he expressed an openness to easing some regulations, stating that “it is important for us to look for ways to reduce unnecessary burden.” “If he reiterates those views, the Senate should be inclined to confirm him,” Haedtler said.The Federal Reserve, long an agency of interest to the business community and the ideological right wing, has received growing attention from liberal activists who have come to appreciate the institution’s impact on the lives of ordinary Americans. The Fed, which serves as a banker to both the federal government and private banks, consists of the board of governors, a seven-seat public entity based in Washington, and 12 privately owned regional banks, which service financial institutions under their purview.By law, the Fed has a dual mandate: to maximize employment and keep price inflation in check.The primary tool the Fed uses to pursue these goals is the adjustment of the federal funds rate, an interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight lending, which serves as a benchmark for lending throughout the economy, including home, auto and student loans. Under the leadership of the chair, the Federal Open Market Committee typically lowers this rate to help the economy grow during a downturn and gradually raises it during boom times to head off inflation.The slow recovery from the Great Recession prompted the Fed to keep the target range of the federal funds rate between 0 and 0.25 percent from December 2008 to December 2015. Several increases later, the target range is now between 1 and 1.25 percent.This long period of low rates, along with the Fed’s extraordinary private asset purchasing program known as quantitative easing ― both of which work to increase the money supply ― prompted howls from conservatives in Congress. They argued that Yellen, an Obama pick, and her predecessor Ben Bernanke, who was first nominated by George W. Bush, were risking runaway inflation and effectively debasing the dollar.But progressives responded that consumer price inflation has remained low, failing even to reach the Fed’s 2-percent target nearly a decade after the 2008 financial crisis. In fact, they unsuccessfully appealed to Yellen to hold off on the modest rate increases she approved until the recovery generated more wage growth.Trump disappointed financial reform advocates in July by appointing Randall Quarles, a Wall Street veteran and outspoken proponent of deregulation, to serve as the Fed’s vice chair for enforcement. The Senate confirmed Quarles in October.Powell, 64, was a scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a centrist think tank, from 2005 to 2012. Prior to that, he was a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, and served as undersecretary of the Treasury in the George H.W. Bush administration.He would be the first Fed chair in some four decades to lack an advanced degree in economics. That dearth of academic expertise raises fears for Haedtler that Powell might be swayed by other, more conservative governors on monetary policy and bank regulation ― including Quarles, who worked at the Carlyle Group for a period after Powell’s departure from the firm.Trump also has the opportunity to name inflation hawks to three open seats on the Fed board of governors, Haedtler noted.“We’re not out of the woods yet,” he said."

That’s less than white, Asian, black or Native American women. Longoria starts her newsletter by breaking down the severity of the situation.“That’s like ripping a dollar bill in half — or like working an entire week, but only getting paid through Wednesday afternoon,” she wrote. “At this rate, to earn what white men earn by age 60, Latina women would have to work until they’re 90.”She continued: “I come from a long, proud line of smart, hard-working Mexican-American women, and this injustice strikes deep.”Many women on Twitter echoed Longoria’s sentiments, using the hashtag #LatinaEqualPay.Prominent Latinas, including Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and “Orange is the New Black” star Jackie Cruz, are being vocal about how they and others can help to solve the problem.“Think of the ways that you hold power and then challenge yourself to determine what you can do to level the playing field for Latinas,” Cruz wrote for the website Lenny. “If you are a teacher, if you own a business, if you help make hiring decisions, you have the power to do good.”Longoria offers some researched solutions in her newsletter as well.

24,POLITICS,Trump's Likely Pick For Global Women's Ambassador Trashed Him In The Primaries,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/penny-nance-trump-global-womens-ambassador_us_59fb34dce4b0b0c7fa389012,"Penny Nance said the choice between him and Hillary Clinton would be ""horrible"" for conservative women.",2017-11-02,Penny Nance celebrates a Supreme Court ruling against abortion clinics in June 2014.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fb5bc816000035002f1d20.jpeg?cache=0igWVXTH5s&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Penny Nance, the woman Donald Trump is reportedly tapping to be his ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues, trashed him during the GOP primary to HuffPost, saying that the choice between him and Hillary Clinton would be a “horrible” one for women.Nance, president and CEO of the conservative Christian advocacy group Concerned Women for America, endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) in the Republican primary and actively campaigned against Trump. In an April 2016 interview with HuffPost, she balked at Trump’s remark on the campaign trail that women liked him because as president, he would protect them from terrorists.“My question is, who’s gonna protect us from him?” Nance said.At the time, Nance was particularly angry with Trump because he had just said at a town hall event that if abortion became illegal, women should ”face some sort of punishment″ for undergoing the procedure. She said that comment was “in no way helpful” to the anti-abortion movement, which had been fighting the left’s argument that abortion restrictions are designed to punish women.“Appalled. I’m appalled by what he said last week,” she told HuffPost. “No one in the pro-life perspective thinks it’s a good idea to imprison women.”If the GOP were to nominate Trump for president, Nance said conservative women would face a “horrible choice” on Election Day.“I don’t know that we would endorse anyone,” she said. “That would be a horrible choice for our members. As questionable as Donald Trump’s judgment is, sadly, we know Hillary’s positions, and they are the opposite of what we believe to be good policy.”“I do worry about women staying home because they don’t like their choices,” Nance added. “I understand that. It’s difficult.”Weeks earlier, Concerned Women for America had co-hosted campaign events with the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion political action committee, that urged primary voters in the key states of South Carolina and Iowa to “support anyone but Donald Trump.”“America will only be a great nation when we have leaders of strong character who will defend both unborn children and the dignity of women,” Nance and other anti-abortion activists wrote in an open letter to Iowa voters. “We cannot trust Donald Trump to do either.”Nance declined to comment for this story, but a Concerned Women for America spokeswoman noted that she has since changed her tune on Trump. In May, Nance told Bret Baier of Fox News, “I am thrilled to have been wrong about this. Donald Trump has turned out to be a real champion for life and for families and we are very thankful.”Politico reported last week that Trump is expected to nominate Nance as his global envoy for women’s issues, in which role she would oversee State Department programs to curb gender-based violence and promote equality for women and girls around the world.Her prior criticism of Trump aside, Nance is an odd pick for the position. Her group called the creation of the State Department’s Office of Global Women’s Issues a “wasteful and unnecessary idea” and opposed the proposed International Violence Against Women Act, because some of its funding could supposedly have been used to “undermine marriage and disrespect women’s noble roles as mothers and wives.” She criticized the Disney movie “Frozen” because it features strong female characters and she claimed it undermines women’s ability to raise their little boys to be “heroes.”Nance also opposes emergency contraception and abortion rights, even in cases of rape. She is against LGBTQ rights because she believes “our femininity is a gift from God.” She wrote in a 2016 Fox News op-ed that former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, whom Trump infamously called “Miss Piggy,” deserved to be harassed by him over her weight because she “was being paid to look perfect.”“Let’s be honest, a woman who voluntarily puts on a bikini and literally asks people to judge her based almost solely on her body can’t be mad when they do,” Nance wrote.Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, said Trump’s choice of Nance for global women’s ambassador “shows a fundamental disdain for women’s health and their lives.”“This would be putting an arsonist in charge of the fire department,” Laguens said.Still, Nance appears to be gearing up for the announcement and has already begun defending Trump against his vocal Republican critics in the Senate. Last week, she tweeted that GOP Sens. Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Bob Corker (Tenn.) should “resign immediately” for questioning Trump’s fitness for office. Later she said on Twitter that Flake ”sounded like a middle school girl.”Both men sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which could kill her chances of being confirmed."

Never in the recent past has this been more evident than in our current race for governor. The Democratic candidate Lt. Governor Ralph Northam understands that it is in our best interests to confront our state’s past. Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate for governor, has repeatedly stood on the wrong side of history, fomenting racial hate and division for votes. Just last month, he declared that Confederate monuments – symbols of Virginia’s violent, racist past – should remain on our streets.This issue is deeply personal for me. For six months, I have been fighting to change the name of J.E.B. Stuart High School in Fairfax County. I am a product of Fairfax County Public Schools and while I did not attend this school, I often went there for extracurricular activities. It always bothered me that this school bears the name of a Confederate general known for raiding northern towns and kidnapping black people to send into slavery in the South during the Civil War. It is truly sinister that our local leaders force thousands of Virginia children – many of whom are descended from slaves – to graduate under the banner of a Confederate general. It tells the students that it is O.K. to cheer on the school’s teams, the ‘Raiders.’ It is O.K. to lionize a leader whose historical accomplishments are deeply embedded in hatred, racism and bigotry. And it is O.K. for the school district to systemically dehumanize black people by funding and supporting the school.Virginia’s dark past and present are jumbled, existing uneasily in a state where so many families can trace their roots back to slaves and slave-owners. Children of color in Virginia grow up surrounded by public spaces like the Jefferson Davis Highway, the Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson Memorial Highway and JEB Stuart High School. That is why I have been working to change the name of the high school – to send a signal to all its students, regardless of the color of their skin, that their lives and their voices matter. Meanwhile, opponents to the change have made disjointed and incoherent arguments to maintain the status quo – out of shame, ignorance, guilt, or perhaps all three.Our voices were finally heard when seven out of twelve school board members voted to rename JEB Stuart High as Justice High ― a name that embodies our vision for a more just and fair Commonwealth. This victory shows why we need leaders who stand on the right side of history. And no elected leader in our state is more critical to us than the governor, who sets the tone for how we should treat other Virginians in the way we’d want to be treated.I believe that leader is Dr. Ralph Northam.A native of the Commonwealth, Northam has made it his life’s work to make Virginia work better for everyone – immigrants, people of color, students and people who are struggling to get ahead. Compare Northam’s positive and forward-thinking campaign to that of his opponent. Ed Gillespie, a New Jersey transplant, has led a campaign built on stoking racial fears and resentment in political ads and interviews. At the same time, he favors policies that take away health care and other resources for people of color, immigrants and those struggling to get by. It is unconscionable – and it proves that Gillespie is the wrong choice for Virginians.The Commonwealth needs a governor who is willing to confront our complicated past. A governor who is willing to stand up to white supremacists and fight for all of Virginia’s families, many of whom continue to be impacted by the lingering consequences of slavery, segregation and other racist policies. A proven leader who is going to bring people together, not tear them apart. Ralph Northam is that leader – someone we can trust to finally start to heal the wounds of the past and create a better future for every Virginian, no matter their race, religion, gender, or immigration status.I believe Virginia can do better. That’s why Northam has my vote. I hope he has yours, too.Helen Li is a Fairfax County resident, community activist and writing fellow for the Center for Community Change Action."

In recent years, the ability for LGBTQ individuals to get married and start a family has not only become a reality for so many, but has brought along with it societal pressures that previous generations have not had to wrestle. This summer, on an r Family Vacations (www.rfamilyvacations.com) in Ixtapa, RaiseAChild CEO Rich Valenza met Scott Saladino and his husband Scott Kricho. who have been together for 27 years, and married for two. They currently do not have children, but have weighed the decision to become parents and have struggled with making the right decision for themselves and the children they could potentially help by starting a family of their own. The couple met in 1990 in Breckenridge, Colorado while both were on a ski trip, and within three months Kricho had moved to New York city to be with Saladino and the two have been together ever since. Admittedly, they never really thought about adding to their family until they moved to Arizona in the early 2000’s and met their friends, Bob and Will, who began contemplating having a child. “We never really thought about having our own kids because we never thought it was possible”, noted Kricho. Bob and Will had looked into many options, but settled on surrogacy and became the proud fathers of a daughter, now 13 years old. Throughout their parental journey, Saladino and Kricho observed the joy experienced by their friends and began to wonder if becoming parents was something they should do.“Everyone would ask us why we don’t have kids and always told us that we would make perfect parents” notes Kricho as Saladino quickly adds, “And my response was always, ‘don’t you know me, I’m so set in my ways.’” The two Scotts watched as Bob and Will raised their daughter, and later adopted two more children through the foster-adopt system. They saw the joy that Bob and Will brought to the children, and also the joy that the children brought to Bob and Will. Through it all they wondered if they were making the right decision to hold off on starting a family of their own. A number of years back, they reluctantly accompanied Bob and Will on an r Family Vacations cruise. Their fears of a miserable week were quickly dissolved as they got to spend time with hundreds of LGBTQ families. “We now go every year, that’s our vacation time, meeting up with these families with kids on these vacations.” Saladino continues, “These kids have become such a part of our lives, and we have become part of theirs. The parents, who have become our dear friends, tell us all the time that their kids only want to go on trips that Scott and Scott will be on!” Not only have the two Scotts become surrogate gay uncles - guncles - to the numerous families they have known through r Family, but they also began volunteering at a local group home for homeless gay teens.Even though the timing had not felt right for them to create a family of their own, Saladino and Kricho still had a yearning to give of their time and a desire to help, in any way they could, children that were suffering.“I was having lunch with a friend,” Saladino tells the story, “and he had begun volunteering at this group home called Mulligan’s Manor in Tempe, and thought that we should also volunteer.”The two met with the owner, Jenny, and were blown away by the work she was doing and the eight boys that were under her roof. As they spent more time with the boys, listening to their stories and learning of the experiences that left them hopeless and homeless, they both realized that there were other ways they could help without being parents.It was a comfort to them both to know they could make a difference without the commitment of parenthood. Soon they rested in the knowledge that just because they would make great parents, it did not mean they needed to be fathers. They could shine their light the best way possible for them.Kricho acknowledges, “even with the time we spend at Mulligan’s Manor, it never feels enough, and we both have jobs that limit the hours we have for volunteering. We wrestle with putting in enough time and not making these kids feel like they are being abandoned again.”On their most recent vacation, they listened as Rich Valenza told personal stories of LGBTQ families created and changed by the foster-adopt system. “It brought me to tears,” says Saladino. “We both want to be that couple that could really help these kids.”In their hearts, they grapple with idea of becoming fathers, but deep down they know the clock is ticking and that it may be enough for them to know that they have touched lives through their volunteering; their caring for their biological nieces and nephews; and the countless r Family Vacations families from around the world that look up to their guncles, Scott and Scott.They both express an incredible fear that they may regret the decision not to have a family. They feel they may miss out on the joy of parenthood, and the time to make a decision is winding down. Saladino rests in his belief that, “if there is a greater plan for a kid to be in our lives, it will happen. And for all I know, it has already happened and we’ve changed the life of someone for the better through the work we do at Mulligan’s Manor or on the cruises.”Are you curious about the benefits of building a family through fostering or adoption?

28,POLITICS,"A Tax Cut That Republicans Could Pass, Flaws And All",Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-tax-cut-bill-reaction_us_59fb8f4ee4b0b0c7fa39191d,"They haven't really read it, but most of them still love it.",2017-11-02,"House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) is seen with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Nov. 2, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fb90c21d00003b007f4032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Republicans released their long-awaited tax cut bill on Thursday, with some interest groups coming out immediately against the legislation and most Republicans enthusiastically supporting the bill anyway.Home builders, realtors and small business groups were among those opposing the legislation, citing changes to mortgage interest deductions and concerns about restrictions on who gets a 25 percent pass-through tax rate. But GOP lawmakers on Thursday didn’t seem to be taking arguments against the bill very seriously.“I’m for it. Been for it. Didn’t see any reason to be against it,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) told HuffPost. Massie, one of the most conservative Republicans in the House, said the general mood on Thursday when GOP leaders rolled out the bill in a special closed-door meeting was positive, and he didn’t think the bill would have any problems in the House.Conservatives seem overwhelmingly supportive of the tax bill, which would increase debt by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years in the name of lowering individual and corporate tax rates. House leaders have learned from recent fights, like health care, that once they get the conservatives on board, they can pressure the other members to vote yes. And in this case, they may not have to pressure too much. Republicans, longing for some kind of policy accomplishment, are eager to get behind the measure, signaling that they’ll make whatever changes are needed to get the bill over the finish line. As Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) told HuffPost on Thursday: “Whatever it takes to get it done at this point.”Still, there are dozens of ways the tax bill could fall apart. Lawmakers are just getting their hands on the text of the bill, and they’re sure to find provisions they want changed. Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity, two conservative groups partially funded by the Koch brothers, are taking issue with certain foreign territorial taxes. They’re presenting it as the much-maligned border adjustment tax “by another name.” Republicans could also run into trouble with some provisions surrounding mortgage interest. The GOP tax bill would cut the deductibility of payments on mortgage interest from $1 million to $500,000 ― news that caused a home builders index fund to fall by more than 2 percent on Thursday. Realtors and home builders are concerned the GOP tax bill could cause a housing downturn, something that House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) dismissed Thursday morning.“Nothing sells more homes and raises property values better than a strong economy,” Brady said.Other, quirkier issues could also give some Republicans pause ― a 1.4 percent tax on investment income from large universities, eliminating the 80 percent charitable deduction of college sporting tickets, getting rid of tax-exempt bonds for professional stadiums ― but the biggest issue is still the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction.Republican leaders say they’re still working to find a solution for states like New Jersey, New York and California that heavily benefit from the SALT deduction. Some members from those states, however, don’t seem to be holding their breath. A handful of Republicans who voted against the budget setting up the tax cut bill last week were quick to announce their opposition to the tax bill Thursday. Reps. Dan Donovan (N.Y.), Peter King (N.Y.), Leonard Lance (N.J.), Frank LoBiondo (N.J.), Tom MacArthur (N.J.) and Lee Zeldin (N.Y.), all Republicans, have indicated they’re leaning against the proposal in its current form. The draft released Thursday would let filers deduct up to $10,000 of their property taxes. That wouldn’t do much for the districts benefiting the most from the SALT deduction, but it could split the New York and New Jersey delegations and be enough to win over California Republicans. (Not a single California Republican has voted no on two budget resolutions setting up the tax bill for reconciliation, despite GOP leaders indicating they wanted to get rid of the SALT write-off entirely.)For a handful of districts that benefit from the SALT deduction, the $10,000 capped write-off could be enough to make taxpayers whole, particularly when taken with the overall lowering of rates and the doubling of the standard deduction. But these states, which already pay more into the federal government than they receive back, would largely be financing a significant portion of the tax cuts for the rest of the country. “The people of New York deserve the same tax break as the people of the rest of the country,” Donovan told HuffPost.The question for each member is how much their district is affected. MacArthur seems like he would vote yes if the deduction went up to $12,500, while LoBiondo said it would take more money for him to get to yes.MacArthur is “speaking not for me,” LoBiondo said.MacArthur knows that if Republicans ask for too much, they run the risk of perhaps just soaking the SALT districts and trying to get 217 votes in the House by appealing to other constituencies.“They know how to count,” MacArthur said of leadership, “and if they don’t need our votes, they might take that approach.”Assuming no Democrat votes for the tax bill, GOP leaders can afford to lose 22 Republicans and still pass the bill in the House. In the Senate, Republicans could only lose two votes and still pass the bill, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie. The Senate looks like it will be the tougher chamber for tax reform, with fewer votes to spare and harsher rules about increasing the deficit in a reconciliation bill. While the House bill comes in right around $1.5 trillion in increased debt over the next decade, Republicans are already clamoring for changes that would make more people eligible for the pass-through rate of 25 percent, and there’s been some chatter about reinstituting a tax break for research on rare diseases as well as the mortgage interest deduction on second homes (which the bill would end). Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has also made it clear he won’t settle for the smaller child tax credit that the House offered. The House bill would increase the child tax credit to $1,600 per minor, up from $1,000. Rubio and some other Senators want it to be at least $2,000.Opening up the bill for changes could be difficult for Republicans. They have some ways to raise money by increasing rates here or there. But the most significant revenue-raiser is still the elimination of the SALT deduction, so getting more generous with how much they allow taxpayers to write off could be a challenge.In the House, if past budget votes are any indication, there are only about a dozen Republicans who are serious about voting against the tax bill over SALT objections. Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), whose average constituent benefits about $14,000 a year from the deduction, told HuffPost that his district is interested in tax relief, “not particularly concerned by the equation by which they get it, and under this plan, they get it.”If Republicans from districts like Roskam’s don’t have a problem with the SALT fix, it’s a good bet that this tax bill will pass the House. It’s difficult to predict how much the bill would affect taxes in every individual district for every individual situation, but there are clear winners and losers. Someone with an expensive home, with high medical expenses (that deduction is also eliminated in the GOP bill), from a high-tax area ― that person could see their tax bill go up. People who don’t own homes and don’t have many deductions already, on the other hand, could see a substantial cut.Republicans are counting on moving this bill at such a quick pace that inertia takes over and gets them across the finish line. The Ways and Means Committee plans to begin marking up the measure next week, and leaders seem to have their sights set on passing the bill out of the House the week after that.Unless there’s a sudden mutiny, it’s a good bet that gambit will work."
29,POLITICS,Trump's USDA Pick With Ties To Russia Investigation Withdraws Nomination,Alexander C.

As I am focused on your success and the success of this Administration, I do not want to be a distraction or negative influence, particularly with so much important work left to do for the American people.” Yet he said he would continue to serve as an adviser to the White House and to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. “We respect Mr. Clovis’s decision to withdraw his nomination,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement to reporters. The move came days after news that Clovis, a former Iowa talk radio host and political science professor, was named in court documents as one of the Trump campaign officials in contact with George Papadopoulos, the campaign foreign policy adviser who admitted to making false statements to the FBI about his ties to Russian officials. Papadopoulos included Clovis on a March 24, 2016, email thread to discuss a meeting he had in London with a professor who had introduced him to the Russian ambassador and a Russian woman he described as “Putin’s niece,” according to The Washington Post. Clovis became “a fully cooperative witness” in the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Politico reported earlier this week. “This is Dr. Clovis’ decision,” a USDA spokesperson told HuffPost in an email. “He has laid out his reasons in the attached letter.”His exit may come as a relief to science advocates.In an Oct. 17 letter obtained by The Washington Post, Clovis admitted to having no hard background in the subject. Clovis, who possesses a bachelor’s degree in political science, an MBA degree and a doctorate in public administration, repeatedly acknowledged his lack of background in the hard sciences when responding to Stabenow.Clovis, an early Trump supporter, is a birther conspiracy theorist who described former President Barack Obama and his black and Latino Cabinet members as “racists.” He once accused progressives in a since-deleted blog post of “enslaving” minorities, called black leaders “race traders” and said Obama was a “Maoist” with “communist” roots. The blog can still be seen on the Internet archive, the Wayback Machine. Like many others in the Trump administration, he also rejects the science behind climate change.“Clovis’ only apparent qualifications to head this critical science post [are] that he lives in agriculture-heavy Iowa and is a shameless Trump supporter,” Josh Nelson, deputy political director of the progressive group CREDO, wrote on a petition urging the Senate to reject his nomination. “Clovis is instead deeply anti-science, claiming the overwhelming evidence behind climate change is ‘not proven’ and ‘junk science’ and has stated that he will not prioritize climate change in the agency’s policy.”"

32,POLITICS,Lawmakers Are Again Fighting Over Drilling In The Fragile Arctic Wildlife Refuge,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arctic-wildlife-refuge-drilling_us_59fa377be4b0415a42095c8a,"""To suggest that we would despoil our environment for short-term gain is offensive,"" Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a supporter of the drilling, said during a hearing Thursday.",2017-11-02,A grizzly bear walks across tundra in the 1002 area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fb70922500004400c4b667.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — A little more than two years after recommending that the coastal plain of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be designated as wilderness, a move that would have permanently protected the area from commercial development, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) on Thursday voiced support for oil and gas drilling in this remote and fragile ecosystem.Although a significant change in course, the move comes as little surprise. The Trump administration’s 2018 fiscal year budget calls for allowing oil and gas production in the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain, also known as the 1002 area.The administration says that development there would generate an estimated $1.8 billion over a decade — a figure that’s both highly disputed and only slightly more than the $1.6 billion President Donald Trump is looking to slash from the Interior Department’s annual budget.Greg Sheehan, principal deputy director of the FWS, was among a dozen panelists to testify during an hours-long, and at times tense, hearing Thursday of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. As expected, he went to bat for a Republican-led effort to open the refuge to energy exploration and extraction. “We support responsible development, in whatever form or fashion that best occurs in,” he said. Sheehan added that if Congress passes legislation, the agency would “use the best science, the best technologies and other strategies” to ensure activities have the “least amount of impact on the native wildlife species.” The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), described by some as “America’s Serengeti,” covers more than 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska. It is home to polar bears, caribou, moose and hundreds of species of migratory birds. In 1980, with the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, Congress expanded the refuge, but opted not to give wilderness status to the 1002 area, setting it aside for potential future oil and gas development. Granting leases for that purpose, however, requires an act of Congress. The issue of drilling in the arctic refuge has long been the subject of controversy and debate. Over the last several decades, many attempts to open the area to drilling — as well as others aimed at banning it — have failed. The battle over this pristine slice of arctic land has been given new life under the Trump administration, which is pushing for increased fossil fuel development in its quest for “energy dominance.” In May, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke signed an order to “jump-start Alaskan energy production.” He said at the time that the move was an “important first step in a smart and measured approach to energy development in ANWR.”Republicans, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and other state lawmakers, have for years been advocating for opening ANWR’s coastal plain. The Senate budget plan includes a provision that tasks the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, of which Murkowski is chair, with finding $1 billion in additional revenue over the next decade to help pay for tax reform. Murkowski stressed Thursday that opening up “a small portion” of the 1002 area to oil and gas would not only get the job done, but benefit both the state and the nation for decades.“We are asking [for] 2,000 acres, or about one ten-thousandth of the refuge,” she said. “And we’ve waited nearly 40 years for the right technologies to come along so that the footprint of development is small enough to ensure that the environment continues to be respected and will not be harmed. This is not a choice between energy and the environment. We are past that.”But the economic benefits that supporters of the proposal often speak about are not clear cut. An analysis by the left-leaning Center for American Progress found that by drilling in the refuge, the U.S. government would likely only collect $37.5 million over 10 years. David Murphy, an assistant professor at St. Lawrence University, concluded in a report published Wednesday that “drilling there would have little appreciable effect on increasing U.S. energy security,” and that “current presidential and congressional budget projections are unrealistic, and thus that it would be fiscally irresponsible to pursue this path on a budget justification.”Bloomberg reported Wednesday that previous lease sales in the Arctic “suggest the U.S. is likely to collect less than a fifth of that billion-dollar goal over the next decade — about $145.5 million — from auctioning off territory in the sprawling northeast Alaska refuge.”Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), the minority’s ranking member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said she is both “disturbed” by the process — budget bills require only a simple majority vote and cannot be filibustered — and finds it “hard to believe that there will be the economic incentive to drill” in ANWR. “We are here today because someone has come up with a ludicrous idea that we can pass a tax reform bill that raises the deficit and increases our taxes, and that will take a sliver out of a wildlife refuge to do it,” she said. “I almost want to call this ‘caribou for millionaires’ because it is the most ridiculous idea I have ever heard as it relates to meeting the tax reform agenda.” Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), who joined the hearing as a panelist, called drilling in the refuge an issue of national security and dismissed the idea that opening the coastal plain would have severe negative environmental impacts. To make his point, he reached for a pen. “I represent Alaska,” he said, drawing a small dot on the tip of his nose. “You see anything different with my nose right now?” (The mark was clearly visible)“This little dot on my nose — I weigh 225 pounds — this little dot is what we’re talking about,” he said. “I don’t think it changed my appearance very much, because the coastal plain is not that pristine area you see in the propaganda that’s portrayed by all the environmental groups. It is a flat terrain that in fact was set aside by this Congress” for development and not preservation, he added. Perhaps the most powerful testimony Thursday came from Samuel Alexander, a representative of the Gwich’in tribe. He said it is the duty of Gwich’in people to protect the land and animals on it. And the tribe, he said, views drilling in the 1002 area as an attack on their freedom and the caribou on which they depend.“Money can’t buy our wealth, but the reckless pursuit of money can take it away,” he said. “And for that, we will never stop fighting to protect the porcupine caribou herd and our way of life.”Asked by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) about claims that developing oil in ANWR and elsewhere in the U.S. under strict environmental regulations helps mitigate the effects of climate change, Alexander said it reminded him of a phrase he and others used during his time in the Army: a “self-licking ice cream cone.”“That’s really what this has become,” he said. “We are trying to drill more oil, pump out more pollutants to address climate change and the impact that it has. That is just insanity to me.”Alaska Lt. Gov. Byron Mallot said Thursday that developing the coastal plain “will allow us to have fiscal resources to meet rapidly changing climate circumstances. Otherwise, we have no real ability to respond.” Earlier this month, Senate Republicans blocked an attempt by Cantwell and other Democrats to bar drilling in ANWR. On Thursday, Democrats accused Republicans of putting short-term economic gains over environmental protection.“It ought to be clear,” Cantwell said. “If you want to open up the arctic refuge, you should just admit you’re going to destroy the wildlife refuge.”Murkowski swung back. “We clearly disagree that this is an either-or proposition,” she said. “It clearly is not. For those of us who call Alaska home, to suggest that we would despoil our environment for short-term gain is offensive.”"

35,POLITICS,Trump Court Pick Rated 'Not Qualified' Sits Through Humiliating Senate Hearing,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-judicial-nominee-grasz-unqualified_us_59fa1df9e4b0b0c7fa37aa85,"You're the first Circuit Court nominee since 2006 to get this awful ABA rating? Yep, says Leonard Steven Grasz.",2017-11-01,"Here's Leonard Steven Grasz in his confirmation hearing, listening to Democratic senators read aloud all the reasons why he was deemed ""not qualified"" to be a judge.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fa489f1400002100a66524.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Two days after the American Bar Association rated Leonard Steven Grasz “not qualified” to be a judge, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing Wednesday for Grasz’s nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. It was brutal.With Grasz sitting in front of the committee, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) read aloud passages from the ABA’s eight-page statement outlining why Grasz earned such a terrible and rarely designated rating by the nation’s premier legal society.“I assume you’re keenly aware that you are the first Circuit Court nominee since 2006 to receive a unanimous ‘not qualified’ rating from the ABA?” Whitehouse asked Grasz. “And that the last nominee who had such a rating was withdrawn?”“That is my understanding, senator,” replied Grasz.Awkward! It only got worse.“Do you think that this is a matter as to which the committee should have no concern?” asked Whitehouse.“I have great respect for the amount of time and effort the American Bar Association put into the process,” said Grasz. “I respectfully disagree with the result.”The Rhode Island senator noted that the ABA rated Grasz “not qualified’ in a unanimous 14-0 vote. He asked Grasz if he knew that was the tally.“I’m not keenly aware of that,” said Grasz. “I believe there was one abstention.”“That’s why it’s 14,” Whitehouse replied. “There are 15 of them.... It’s the full panel of 14 non-abstaining lawyers.”The ABA interviewed several colleagues of Grasz, who was Nebraska’s chief deputy attorney general for 11 years, as part of its evaluation of his fitness to be a judge. Some described him as “gratuitously rude.” Others expressed an “unusual fear” of consequences if they said anything bad about him because of his “deep connection and allegiance” to powerful politicians in Nebraska.ABA members also raised concerns that Grasz would be “unable to separate his role as an advocate from that of a judge,” given his record on such issues as abortion. Among other things, he defended Nebraska’s ban on partial-birth abortion, and, in a 1999 article, he argued that lower courts should be able to overrule Supreme Court decisions on abortion rights because “abortion jurisprudence is, to a significant extent, a word game.”“In sum, the evaluators and the Committee found that temperament issues, particularly bias and lack of open-mindedness, were problematic,” reads the statement submitted by Pam Bresnahan, the chair of the ABA’s standing committee that reviews nominees. “The evaluators found that the people interviewed believed that the nominee’s bias and the lens through which he viewed his role as a judge colored his ability to judge fairly.”White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley defended Grasz’s nomination.“Steve Grasz is an outstanding lawyer, who has the full-throated support of the President, both U.S. Senators from Nebraska, and lawyers on each side of the political spectrum,” Gidley told HuffPost in a Wednesday statement. “The ABA claims to be non-partisan, but the facts show it cannot be trusted to fairly evaluate exceptional nominees.”Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), who recommended Grasz to Trump, told the Senate committee she was “shocked” by the ABA rating. She said she didn’t come across “one single temperament issue” when she talked to Nebraskans about Grasz.“I am sad to say that, after thoroughly examining the substance of the ABA’s report, it is evident to me the ABA evaluation of Mr. Grasz was a baseless political character assassination,” Fischer said.But Whitehouse pointed out that 40 of the 42 judicial nominees Trump has put forward so far have gotten “qualified” or well qualified” ratings by the ABA. (Charles Goodwin, Trump’s pick for a district court in Oklahoma, was the other nominee rated “not qualified.”)“It would be hard for the committee to ascribe the outcome in this case to a general partisanship of the ABA process,” said the Democratic senator. “It would not be consistent with the facts.”It’s up to the White House to decide if it wants to plow ahead with Grasz. If the president doesn’t withdraw his nomination, the Judiciary Committee could vote to advance him to the full Senate in a matter of weeks."

He was openly flirtatious, he grabbed my ass, he talked about sex to me and in front of me,” Hunter recounted. “One morning I went to his dressing room to take his breakfast order; he looked at me and grinned, taking his time. Then he said, “I’ll have a hard-boiled egg … and a soft-boiled clitoris.”“I loved the attention from Dustin Hoffman. Until I didn’t,” she added. Hunter regularly corresponded with her sister, sending detailed messages about Hoffman repeatedly groping her and making sexually inappropriate comments, which the outlet has printed in full.“Today, when I was walking Dustin to his limo, he felt my ass four times. I hit him each time, hard, and told him he was a dirty old man,” she wrote to her sister. “He took off his hat and pointed to his head (shaved for the part) and said, “No, I’m a dirty young man, I have a full head of hair.”At the time, Hoffman was at the peak of his career, coming off critically acclaimed films like “Tootsie” and “Kramer vs. Kramer,” a film that has also been embroiled in controversy due to Hoffman’s behavior behind the scenes. She claims that actor’s misconduct was widely known and condoned on the set of “Death of a Salesman,” despite her efforts to alert superiors who told her to “sacrifice some of our values” to keep the production running smoothly. Hoffman issued a response apologizing in broad terms for any harm he caused. “I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am.”To read Hunter’s full account, head over to The Hollywood Reporter. "

If they have religious beliefs and you can’t tell what they are, say ’Happy holidays.”The sentiment won’t likely sit well with President Donald Trump, who started in on his war-on-Christmas rhetoric in July. “I remind you that we’re going to start saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again,” Trump said at a “Celebrate Freedom” event at the Kennedy Center this summer. He again spoke about his issue with people not using the word Christmas when he spoke at the Value Voter Summit, an anti-LGBTQ event, on Oct. 13. “This idea that we can only say one thing is ridiculous. It’s ridiculous,” Goldberg said. “And clearly, this is some political ploy to make people feel better in some way.” She added, “But the truth of the matter is this is America where we celebrate all of our holidays ― whenever they are ― and we don’t necessarily say ‘happy this’ or ‘happy that,’ we say ‘happy holidays.’ That’s what you say.” Politics aside, Goldberg just wants people to wear her holiday sweaters and have fun. “We’ve got some fun and silly things that I think are great and I think people will have a good time with,” she said. “I hope that if people buy them they’re buying them with the knowledge that they’re meant to bring some laughs and some cheer.” Goldberg said her favorite sweater is the one with a black baby Santa with a beard, diaper and a big tummy, though she admitted she “took the theme of baby Santas a little far.” Baby Santas aside, Goldberg’s sweaters could get even more wild if she ever gets to work with her dream collaborator ― and one of her favorite fashion designers ― Rihanna. If the two ever teamed up, Goldberg said they’d make a fur sweater together. “A great fur sweater so that if you were to rub the fur up it would be me and Rihanna around a Christmas tree and if you rubbed the fur down it’s me and Rihanna on an ice skating rink,” she said. “You write it and we’ll see if she’s up for it.” Goldberg’s holidays sweaters are currently for sale on Zappos.com and retail for $89.

She was then transported to the Bergen-Belsen camp, where she died aged 15 in 1945.“The combination of Anne Frank and a train evokes associations with the persecution of the Jews and the deportations during the Second World War,” the Anne Frank House said in a statement shared on its website Monday.It is “painful for the people who experienced these deportations, and causes fresh pain to those who still bear the consequences of those times within them,” added the nonprofit organization, which preserves the Frank family home in Amsterdam as a museum.Dozens of people echoed the concerns on social media:Deutsche Bahn said it did not intend to disrespect Frank’s memory “in any way whatsoever.” “On the contrary -– aware of the historical responsibility we bear, we made a deliberate decision to help keep Anne Frank’s memory alive,” it said via a statement on its website.“We are very sorry if any feelings were hurt as a result of this decision,” it added.Its proposal to honor Frank came following a public poll in which more than 19,000 people suggested figures of historical importance as the names for 25 new high-speed trains which are set to go into service by 2019.Scientist Albert Einstein and actress-singer Marlene Dietrich were among the other most popular iconic names put forward.The Anne Frank House acknowledged that such initiatives were “usually taken with good intentions” and that Frank had “great symbolic power” which would likely “become stronger and more varied in the coming years.”"

He billed himself as a “leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda.”Since taking over the agency he sued more than a dozen times, he has defended the Trump administration’s deregulatory campaign in complex legalese, arguing that the issue is not how best to protect the environment and public health, but how to adhere to his narrow interpretation of the EPA’s mandate under the law. He even thanked a Time Magazine reporter for calling him “lawyerly” in an interview last month.For that, Rex J. Zedalis, who taught Pruitt at the University of Tulsa’s law school in the early 1990s, said he has “tossed and turned” for “countless nights.”“I confess regret for whatever small role I played in unleashing Administrator Pruitt on the unsuspecting public,” Zedalis wrote in an Op-Ed published Monday in The Santa Fe New Mexican. “Surely I’m at least partially to blame for failing to nurture in him a deep regard for seeing law as an instrument for addressing real facts on the ground, not simply implementing a political ideology, regardless the facts.”He pointed to Pruitt’s proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, the sweeping set of Obama-era regulations meant to curb planet-warming emissions from the utility sector. While still at his Oklahoma post, Pruitt persuaded the Supreme Court to issue a stay on the plan last year, so it never went into effect. Since becoming EPA’s chief under President Donald Trump, Pruitt submitted a policy to eliminate the Clean Power Plan without replacing it, a move critics said demonstrated his intention to cripple efforts to curb climate change rather than refine the legal framework through which that action is taken.“I understand why Obama’s environmental measures seem objectionable to Administrator Pruitt,” Zedalis wrote. “What I fail to comprehend, though, is his utter disregard for tailoring EPA regulatory actions so they address the environment as facts demonstrate we find it, not as we imagine it.”He said Pruitt’s attempts to unravel climate regulations are rooted in a refusal to acknowledge the overwhelming evidence that climate change is dangerous, human-caused and addressable. Ninety-seven percent of peer-reviewed research agrees with the conclusion that factors including the burning fossil fuels are warming the planet with greenhouse gases. And a research review published last November found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who found otherwise.“What affords all of us, including Administrator Pruitt, the chance to blithely live regret-free is the fact we never live long enough to witness the full effect of many of our decisions,” Zedalis wrote. “As discomforting as it might be to accept consensus decisions of the scientific community on particular matters, the alternative raises the specter of regression to the Dark Ages’ reliance on the shaman and the soothsayer.”The EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Pruitt."

The new holiday cups look a bit different from years past, as they’re missing the trademark red color ― for a reason. “This year’s cup is intentionally designed to encourage our customers to add their own color and illustrations,” Leanne Fremar, executive creative director for Starbucks, said in statement.The white cups feature images of holiday cheer and bit of green and red, but most of the cup is left blank to encourage personalization (which could be tricky when you’re trying to decorate a cup full of hot liquid).Fremar added, “We love the idea of everyone making this year’s cup their own.”A Starbucks spokesperson told HuffPost that “most of our U.S. Starbucks locations will have colored pencils available for customers to borrow.” Details around the new design leaked a few weeks ago, when someone on Reddit released a photo of the cup. People on Twitter are divided over the new design and the coloring-in concept of the cups: If you’re missing the traditional red design, McDonald’s is offering all-red holiday cups with stars (which look more like snowflakes) for its McCafé drinks for the first time this year, starting Nov. 6: Coincidence that they’re red? We think not. "

Its beautiful land has seen triumphs of freedom and,2017-11-01,<p>People prepare to canvas in Virginia for Ralph Northam for governor.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f8a89c180000310ddfd0a3.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Tom Steyer and Dorian WarrenVirginia’s story is America’s story. Its beautiful land has seen triumphs of freedom and aspiration, and yet it is also stained with the blood of indigenous people, slaves and soldiers, Confederate and Union alike.Some of the best and the worst moments in our country’s history have taken place in Virginia. Black and white indentured servants rose up against elite rule in Jamestown in the 1676 Bacon’s Rebellion, hastening the creation of racial categories and the emergence of a system of slavery based on race. Yorktown is where America won its freedom from Britain in 1781. Less than a century later, Richmond became the capital of the Confederacy, and more than half of the Civil War’s battles were fought on Virginia soil. In 1989, Virginia became the first state in the nation to elect a black governor, Douglas Wilder. And on August 11, 2017, thousands of white supremacists marched through the streets of Charlottesville, where the day ended in violence and tragedy. A few weeks ago, they came back to double down on their white nationalism.On Nov. 7, the entire nation will again be watching Virginia when it holds the first important election since Donald Trump became President.The top of the ticket sets the tone for the state, and the contrast between the candidates and their campaigns for Virginia Governor could not be starker. Democrat Ralph Northam understands that the Commonwealth is strong because of the diverse voices, backgrounds, heritages and cultures of the people who choose to call Virginia home. Republican opponent Ed Gillespie has used an overtly race-baiting playbook. From the start, he has lied about Northam’s record and embraced the politics of cynicism.Gillespie has released four offensive, racist, and anti-immigrant TV ads to score political points with Trump’s right-wing supporters. One of his ads opens with the words “Kill. Rape. Control” smears the entire Virginia immigrant community by associating them with the MS-13 gang. Gillespie’s ads intentionally inflame racial fears, and they directly appeal to the white supremacists that marched through Charlottesville this summer. This blatant fearmongering was designed to win over President Trump and his supporters ― and it worked. Last week, President Trump tweeted his endorsement of Gillespie.Immigrants are our neighbors, our co-workers, our friends, and family. We are talking about people who have been in this country for decades. Families that want to stay united. Children who have only ever known one country to call home. DREAMers and refugees and workers—all of them central to our economy, society, and culture.And unless you belong to the less than two percent of citizens who are Native Americans, your path to this country also began elsewhere — whether willingly or unwillingly.Being American and being a patriot has nothing to do with where you started or how you arrived. It comes down to what you contribute to this country once you are here. The Virginian immigrant community is an essential thread in the fabric of our society, culture, and economy, as students, soldiers, workers, journalists, entrepreneurs. One in nine Virginians is foreign-born. This election will play a crucial role in determining the direction of not only Virginia, but of the nation. The results of this referendum on the right’s bigotry will set the tone for races around the country in 2018 and beyond. That is a big reason why leaders from every corner of the progressive coalition are finding common cause to back Ralph Northam. As Presidents of progressive organizations, we have worked in this race to register tens of thousands of young voters and mobilize immigrants, and those who support them, to elect a leader who will serve, not scapegoat, their community. Progressives are uniting in Virginia because this race is about restoring the soul of this country. It is about recognizing something basic, but supremely important: that we are all Americans and human beings, deserving of dignity and respect. The vast majority of Virginians, like most Americans, want to pull together. They want a more prosperous, healthier, cleaner life for their families and communities. They want to rally around a positive, inclusive vision for a new American century. They need leaders who will protect the rights of every person in America—citizens alongside DREAMers, refugees, and other immigrants hoping that one day this country will grant them the path to citizenship they have earned. Leaders who will advance an inclusive vision of the American democratic project where all of our fates are interdependent and bound together. Leaders who know the importance of investing in the American people and will put public needs ahead of corporate greed. Leaders who will not run from our most pressing challenges, but instead pursue bold ideas to address them.That is the kind of leader Ralph Northam will be for Virginia. And that’s what this election is about. Virginians rejected the dark divisions of the past in 2016. Next month, they can move forward on a path towards a brighter future.Tom Steyer is founder and president of NextGen America and Dorian Warren is president of the Center for Community Change Action."

Bennett, was a physicist, inventor and co-developer of the gas laser while working at Bell Laboratories in the 1960s. The laser he developed – and received a patent on ― is used in surgeries and every retail checkout for the past few decades. And the gift he gave his daughter was a microscope.“He was a total inspiration in terms of my interest in science and love of biology because I also worked in various labs in elementary school,” says Bennett, professor of ophthalmology of the Center for Advanced Retinal and Ocular Therapeutics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, and a featured researcher in the documentary, “The Gene Doctors,” airing through Nov. 7 on PBS.org. It will then stream on Amazon Prime beginning Nov. 8.Her father was a professor at Yale University, and growing up in New Haven, Connecticut presented many opportunities for her to have part time jobs in research labs. “I knew I wanted to go into basic research,” she says.After graduating from Yale undergraduate in 1976, and earning a masters in biology in graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley in 1980, Bennett then went on to University of California-San Francisco because she did not like the competitiveness of pre-med programs, and wanted to concentrate on research.Years before the genome project was even launched, she was working in the UCSF lab on studying the genes of mammals. She asked her mentor how this work could transfer to humans. He told her to study the roots of diseases by going to medical school. So she did.Bennett enrolled at Harvard Medical School and began work on gene therapy. With funding from a $50,000 grant, her career was launched and she arrived at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992, as one of only two female professors on the medical school faculty.“To them summer vacation was leaving at 5 p.m.,” Bennett says. “Things have changed a lot in 25 years” for women in science and medicine, Bennet says, “But it’s not ideal. It’s not 50/50.” Of the 669 full professors at Penn Med today, 24 percent, or 163 are women.As one of the doctors featured in the documentary from HHMI Tangled Bank Studios on genetic illnesses, Bennett says he hopes to bring more awareness to the “orphan diseases” that each affect fewer than 10,000 people, but collectively affect more than a million babies born each year with these rare diseases. The exposure from the one-hour documentary has been enormous.“I’m a shy kind of person,” Bennett says. “But I love sharing the stories and my enthusiasm for the work.”While funding is difficult in this climate, and Bennett says for large grants for instance, male co-investigators tend to take the dominant portion of the grant, “ignore the gender differences and try to explain the work and show the outcomes.”The outcomes are nearly miraculous.Boys and girls should be encouraged at an early age to study STEM, Bennett says. “I am cognizant of the challenges for women and I have a lot of trainees in my lab,” Bennett says. “I want them to see what is possible.”Yet, teachers may not feel prepared. A new study from SAM Labs shows that 78 percent of U.S. teachers feel they have not received enough training to be able to teach technology in the classroom.According to SAMS, “Eighty-two percent of U.S. teachers believe that students who use technology in the classroom are more prepared for their future careers. And while 42 percent of teachers do feel that technology in the classroom further supports students’ interests in math and science, the benefits extend beyond tech-oriented subjects.”Joachim Horn, CEO of SAM Labs, adds, “Because they are on the front lines with students every day, teachers are in the best position to identify the opportunities – and the challenges – that the government will face in supporting students’ education. By first focusing on how we can support and train our educators, we will quickly see U.S. students excel in STEM.”Support in education may begin early, but needs to extend throughout a science career.Recognizing the need for funding of women in science for what is possible, L’Oréal USA recently announced five recipients of the 2017 For Women in Science Fellowship, honoring female scientists at a critical stage in their careers with $60,000 grants to advance their postdoctoral research. Celebrating its 14th year in the U.S., L’Oréal USA’s For Women in Science fellowship program has awarded 70 postdoctoral women scientists over $3.5 million in grants.“Women make up nearly half of the workforce but hold only a quarter of STEM jobs in the U.S.,” says Lauren Paige, vice president of public affairs & strategic initiatives at L’Oreal USA.This program assists “women postdoctoral scientists at a pivotal moment in their careers where additional support can help ensure they reach the highest levels of science. We believe that by recognizing and rewarding leading women scientists for their innovative research and dedication to inspiring the next generation of women in STEM we can help increase the representation of women in STEM fields,” Paige says.From genetics to quantum physics, the five 2017 fellows are Kellie Ann Jurado, a postdoctoral scientist in Immunobiology at Yale University; Felicity Muth, a postdoctoral fellow in Biology at University of Nevada, Reno; Ritu Raman, a postdoctoral fellow in Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Sydney Schreppler, a postdoctoral fellow in Physics at University of California, Berkeley; and Molly Schumer, a postdoctoral fellow in Genetics and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard Medical School.“Today, more than ever, we are proud to support our country’s most accomplished women scientists at a key moment in their careers, and to empower them to continue their groundbreaking work,” says Frédéric Rozé, President and CEO of L’Oréal USA.These private sector initiatives are critically important to advances in science.“It’s so hard to carry out basic research now,” Bennett says. “Almost impossible.” She adds,”You cannot be a tenured professor without two large grants,” she says. “This will cause major problems in women doing science down the road. “Other top women leaders in science agree there are challenges for women in STEM.Dr. Christyl Johnson, deputy director for technology and research investments at National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Goddard Space Flight Center, at the recent the Advancing Women in STEM session at the 2017 United Nations Women Global Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship Industry Forum in New York, told Elana Lyn Gross writes at Forbes, “Women bring to the table an amazing, unique perspective that should absolutely be celebrated. I learned that when I was a manager for a team. “Dr. Johnson tells Gross the story of a senior chief engineer on a problem solving task. “He would walk into the laboratory and tell the engineers that were under me, ‘You need to try this. Tweak this over here. Make this adjustment.’ I said, ‘You can’t just walk in and do that.’ “Dr. Johnson tells Gross, “When you have a problem and you don’t know what’s causing that problem, you need to be methodical about what you change so that you can pinpoint exactly what caused the problem and exactly what needs to be done to fix it.”A summit of female scientists and leaders November 8 in Washington D.C., In Pursuit: An Atlantic Summit on Women & Science, is underwritten by L’Oréal USA and “will bring together leading scientific experts to highlight recent achievements by women in STEM as well as strategies for ensuring that more female innovators flourish in the field,” according to the site.“Despite the tremendous impact of just a handful of women scientists, only 24 percent of today’s STEM workers are female. How does this substantial gender gap impact the economy, human development and the environment? And what can be done to pave the way for today’s women scientists ― and future women scientists ― to unleash the discoveries of tomorrow?” according to the site.Bennett, whose daughter is a post-doctoral scientist, says she emphasizes the importance of the research and discoveries of women in STEM, with an eye toward more future advancement for women scientists.“I get to do exciting work and be gratified,” Bennett says.Since the airing on PBS of the documentary that features her gene therapy successes in restoring sight and moving toward disease cures, she says, “We had an FDA meeting to review the data from our study and they unanimously approved it.” She adds, “I am a leader.”This post originally ran in Take The Lead.

Be sure to take care of yourself first.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fa3c061800004900af547e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Stuffed turkeys and yuletide carols might be the stuff of holiday cheer, but when you’re grieving, twinkling lights and festive dishes could simply be salt on your open wounds. The holidays – with their ubiquitous scents, sounds, sights and feelings – likely reminds you of a happier time, or simply a time spent with someone you loved who is gone. Your “ghosts” of Christmases, Thanksgivings, New Years’ or Hanukahs past might still be haunting you this holiday season. Here’s what you can do to get through it.Plan aheadYou’ve heard the old adage that a failure to plan is a plan to fail. If you’re dreading the holiday season, the last thing you want to do is make plans for it. But guess what? Avoiding the holidays – like avoiding your grief – will only make it worse. Plan where you’ll be and who you’ll be with for any major holidays you celebrate. Make sure to choose company that understands what you’re going through and can act as a support system for you. If other family members are grieving, talk about how each family member feels comfortable celebrating. What is comforting for one might be painful for another, so be candid with your feelings.Take care of yourself firstRegardless of what you’re going through, the holiday season can be draining. But when you’re grieving, the stress of family plans, work obligations, gift lists and party planning can seem insurmountable. During this time, give yourself the greatest gift you can: self-care. Practice healthy nutrition, good sleep habits and engage in some quiet relaxation or meditation on a daily basis. Don’t feel guilty for skipping out on your office holiday party in order to relax and recharge. Only you know how to best care for yourself, so if that involves surrounding yourself with family and friends, do it. If it means quiet time alone, that’s okay too.Ask for helpIf you’re like most people, “help” is a four-letter word you try to avoid. But when you’re grieving, you need support. Sadly, after a death, even though your friends and family want to help, they simply don’t know how. That’s where you come in. Don’t be afraid to ask for help – and to do so specifically. If you need someone to simply give you a call every day to lift your spirits, ASK! Believe me, people want to help; they just need you to tell them how to do so effectively.Do some goodGrieving has a way of turning our feelings inward. That’s only natural, as you are forced to confront your new reality of a life without a person or relationship you valued. But one of the best ways for you to get the focus off your grief is to simply lend a helping hand. Fortunately, charitable opportunities abound this time of the year, so find a good cause and get involved. Whether you’re simply dropping change in a collection jar or organizing a food drive from scratch, serving others is both comforting and healing throughout the grieving process.Remember that you’re uniqueUnless you live in a Hallmark original movie, holidays are rarely perfect – for anyone, let alone someone suffering through a loss. Be careful not to compare your holiday celebrations with those of a friend, family member or acquaintance (which likely looks more picture-perfect on social media than it was in reality). Likewise, don’t feel pressure to grieve in a certain way, either. There’s no guilt in enjoying a holiday gathering or event, even if your loss is recent.Get some helpGrief knows no season, but it can certainly be accentuated by memories of a certain time of year. If you need a little extra help through the holiday season, a professional grief counselor might be your best resource. I know how hard this time of year can be for my clients, and I have specific exercises and habits to help make it more manageable (or even enjoyable).

Club noted over the weekend.The problem: It made no mention of Best’s Jar Jar Binks, the Gungan from 1999′s “Star Wars: Episode I ― The Phantom Menace,” who is often considered one of the worst “Star Wars” characters. Jar Jar also had smaller roles in subsequent installments, “Attack of the Clones” and “Revenge of the Sith.”Best, who linked to a tweet of the perceived slight by another user, wrote in a series of posts last week that he felt “forgotten,” although with “no disrespect” intended toward Serkis.According to the actor, Jar Jar Binks helped pioneer the process of bringing a computer-generated character to life:“To deny Jar Jar’s place in film history is to deny the hundreds of VFX technicians, animators, code writers and producers their respect,” he wrote.In case you’ve erased Jar Jar Binks from your memory, here’s a reminder:"

Law enforcement officials said the gunman, Stephen Paddock, used weapons modified with bump stocks to kill 58 people and injure over 500 others at a country music concert outside the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.Texas-based Slide Fire temporarily suspended sales of bump stocks in the wake of the Oct. 1 attack, and demand quickly spiked for the devices across the country amid fears they would soon be outlawed.The push in Congress for a legislative ban on bump stocks, however, has stalled. Lawmakers have introduced several bills that would do so, but the effort was kneecapped after the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobby, said the matter ought to be handled via existing regulations rather than new laws.Under such a scenario, the Trump administration would direct the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to outlaw bump stocks and similar devices. The ATF is reviewing whether it has the authority to do so. Democrats, however, note the agency has previously said it cannot regulate bump stocks under existing laws.Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation that would regulate the purchases of bump stocks ― but not ban them outright. The bill, authored by Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) and Dina Titus (D-Nev.), would require people who wish to purchase a bump stock to register with ATF, pass a background check, and pay a $200 tax. “Anyone who wants a device that modifies a firearm to shoot hundreds of rounds per minute should undergo thorough background checks and oversight,” Titus, who represents the city of Las Vegas, said in a statement.Clarification: A previous version of this story called the $200 payment made in order to purchase a bump stock a fee.

The dubious claims and accusations start to fly and voters just wind up frustrated and unsure of what to believe.But here’s one thing we know is true — Mark Herring is a champion for Virginia women.Having served side by side with Mark, we know we can always count on him to be a forceful ally for economic justice, reproductive rights and healthcare, and more.As a State Senator, he introduced legislation to rollback the outlandish regulations that were designed to close women’s health clinics, supported equal pay for equal work, and fought the infamous “transvaginal ultrasound bill” every step of the way.As our Attorney General, he has been a breath of fresh air after the relentlessly anti-women administration of Ken Cuccinelli.Mark corrected some of Cuccinelli’s bad legal advice and protected our women’s health clinics.He helped defeat the Republicans’ 20-week abortion ban with an official opinion that said it would be an unconstitutional attack on women’s rights.He has elevated women to senior leadership roles, built an inclusive staff, and promoted pay equity in the Office of Attorney General.And while his Republican opponent John Adams wants to ban abortion, put employers in charge of women’s contraception coverage, and went to the Supreme Court twice to try to limit women’s access to birth control, Mark is leading the fight against President Trump’s rollback of contraception coverage and fought at the Supreme Court for our right to access reproductive healthcare.So as we get down to the final days of this campaign, don’t be fooled by the lies and half-truths you’re going to hear from the other side.The fact is, Mark Herring is the right choice for Virginia women.Sincerely,Delegate Lashrecse Aird (District 63-Petersburg)Delegate Jennifer Boysko (Herndon)Delegate Betsy Carr (Richmond City)Delegate Eileen Filler-Corn (Fairfax)Delegate Charniele Herring (Alexandria)Delegate Daun Hester (Norfolk)Delegate Kathleen Murphy (McLean)Delegate Marcia Price (Newport News)Delegate Delores McQuinn (Richmond City)Delegate Jeoin Ward (Hampton)Delegate Vivian Watts (Annandale)Senator Rosalyn Dance (District 16-Petersburg)Senator Barbara Favola (Arlington)Senator Janet Howell (Reston)Senator Mamie Locke (Hampton)Senator Jennifer McClellan (Richmond City)Senator Jennifer Wexton (Loudoun)"

Martin had expressed a desire on social media days before to organize a prayer session on Liberty’s campus. On Monday, he said he was told by police that if he ever returned to the university’s campus, he would face arrest. “What does it mean for a college administration to be this afraid of free speech? What precisely do they fear?” Martin wrote on Instagram. ”[Jerry Falwell] openly encourages his students to carry guns, but fears public prayer from Christians who openly embrace nonviolence.”“This confirms everything I’ve heard about the authoritarianism of Falwell, who, like the president for whom he serves as a full-time apologist, does not easily tolerate robust dissent,” Martin wrote. Martin did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for an interview.In a statement sent to HuffPost, Liberty University said that Martin was given a “trespass warning” Monday night for “public safety reasons.”The university argued that Martin, who is not a student, faculty member or employee, had not followed proper protocols for scheduling events on campus.“Members of the Liberty University community are always welcome to engage in peaceful debate, intellectual inquiry and protest, but for public safety reasons, organized events by outside groups require advance notice and participating in the appropriate application process,” the statement read.Falwell Jr. is the son of Liberty’s founder, the late Dr. Jerry Falwell Sr., who helped organize the conservative Moral Majority movement in the 1970s and 1980s. Fallwell Jr. has been a prominent and vocal supporter of Donald Trump, defending the president after a video of the then-candidate making lewd comments about women surfaced during the election. Falwell’s support for Trump didn’t waver after the president claimed that there were “some very fine people” on both sides during a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one person dead.More recently, Falwell claimed he was “so proud” of Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, for taking on the Republican establishment at the White House. Bannon, executive chairman of the conservative Breitbart News, has claimed in the past that his website is a “platform for the alt-right.”Trump gave his first commencement speech as president at Liberty University in May.Falwell’s steady support of the president reflects the views of many white evangelicals, who as a group have been overwhelmingly supportive of the presidency. But there have been divisions within American evangelicalism over the president’s goals and tactics, a reality that has played out at Liberty University, where both current students and alumni have expressed displeasure over Falwell’s overt political ties. On Oct. 27, Martin wrote on Twitter that he felt led to organize a “time of praise & peaceful protest at one of the most hostile environments for the gospel in the US: @LibertyU.”“I think it’s an important site strategically: ground zero for the counterfeit faith that is sweeping many evangelical churches right now,” he wrote.On Oct. 30, Martin encouraged students to gather on Liberty’s campus at 7 a.m. the next morning to “pray, listen & discern together.” “That’s all, for now-praying for God’s grace to guide us to know what faithful witness looks like in this unique season,” he wrote.Dustin Wahl, a Liberty University senior who organized a petition protesting the university’s association with Trump last year, told HuffPost he reached out to Martin after reading the tweets. Wahl said that Martin was receptive to students’ requests to keep the event focused around prayer.“We spoke, and he was very receptive to student input,” Wahl wrote in an email. “It seems that he did not intend to lead any kind of a protest when he was here ― he wanted merely to pray with however many students wanted to join him in prayer for the school. The prayer was something that a number of students discussed with him. So it was in part his plan, and in part the plan of students.”Due to the “late hour of notice” about the 7 a.m. prayer, Liberty University said that the only effective way to prevent the unauthorized event from happening was to give Martin a trespass warning.“The judgment was made that it was safer to stop the event before it started than to attempt to turn away an unknown number of people who traveled to Liberty’s campus. Either option likely gives Mr. Martin’s cause the publicity he apparently seeks,” the statement read. “The University cannot be concerned with whether its actions provide additional oxygen to either side of a debate but rather must be concerned about safety and security of its campus.”Martin claimed the response from the university was linked to his criticism of Falwell.“This was evidently in response to my strong criticism of @JerryFallwellJr’s alignment not only with the darkest contours of Trumpism, but expressly with Steve Bannon & the alt-right he represents,” Martin wrote on Twitter. “I was openly considering some sort of future action oriented around prayer & repentance, but came this time only for the show & for...a time of prayer tomorrow morning to seek divine guidance as to what faithful, humble-but-clear Christian resistance might look like.”The prayer gathering proposed by Martin took place without him at 7 a.m. on Tuesday, Wahl told HuffPost. A few students also accepted Martin’s invitation to pray with him off campus. Wahl said that he believes Falwell’s views don’t reflect the values of most students at his university. “Many have the perception that Liberty students are a bunch of mini Steve Bannons which could not be further from the truth. Maybe 1% of campus is like that,” Wahl wrote. “Christianity is centered on man’s sinfulness and need for forgiveness.

Wubbels said at a Tuesday news conference that she will donate part of the settlement to a local nurses union and apportion some of it to fund legal help for others trying to obtain body camera footage from police.“We all deserve to know the truth and the truth comes when you see the actual raw footage and that’s what happened in my case,” Wubbels told reporters, per The Salt Lake Tribune. “No matter how truthful I was in telling my story, it was nothing compared to what people saw and the visceral reaction people experienced when watching the footage of the experience that I went through.”Wubbels was arrested on July 26 at University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City. Body cam footage showed Detective Jeff Payne manhandling the nurse after she refused to allow him to draw blood from an unconscious patient who had been involved in a car crash.“I’m just trying to do what I’m supposed to do, that’s all,” Wubbels, the head nurse of the hospital’s burn unit, told the officer in the footage as she explained to him that a warrant or the patient’s consent would be required before blood could be drawn.Refusing to take no for an answer, Payne kept insisting that she comply with his demand, eventually chasing the nurse down and handcuffing her as she sobbed and screamed for help. Payne was fired from the Salt Lake City Police Department last month. His supervisor, James Tracy, was demoted for the role he played in the nurse’s arrest.No charges were ever filed against Wubbels.On Tuesday, the nurse’s attorney, Karra Porter, said Wubbels would not be filing a lawsuit following the settlement with the city and the University of Utah.Other than using part of the settlement to help others access police body camera clips, Wubbels said she planned to donate some of the $500,000 to the Utah Nurses Association and to support the national #EndNurseAbuse campaign.Porter added that her law firm, Christensen & Jensen, is committed to providing free legal services to those needing to obtain body cam footage. Though Wubbels’ case was settled, Porter said, “we’re hoping the discussion about body cameras continues.” "

My daughter was in that building. And that’s where I was going to be.I hopped on a Citibike and sped like a racer.

I held her in my arms and cried again with her. I was so happy and relieved, then sad, and then angry. Angry that these poor kids had to experience this horror. That my kid would have the image burned into her head of the crash, the screams, and this monster pointing weapons in her direction. Angry that she once again had her innocence kicked in the gut.And then she started telling me what happened. And I became proud. Proud of how she reacted when faced with unimaginable horror. She stayed calm. She helped others. And despite me feeling like she ignores the shit out of me when I try to instill in her a few survival tactics, it was clear she had listened to me.

The series of proposals have approximately zero chance of becoming law anytime soon, with Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress and President Donald Trump in the White House. But the aggressiveness of the plan ― introduced as an official plank of the party’s “Better Deal” agenda ― underscores the leftward tilt in Democratic policy following the 2016 election, with party leaders taking up causes that were previously relegated to more progressive members. “We all worry about the decline of the middle class, and the number one reason for the decline of the middle class is the assault on unions and on labor that’s occurred over the last 30 years,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said at a press conference on Capitol Hill, alongside House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “The union movement is under vicious, relentless attack by big corporate interests.”Schumer said the Democratic plan would begin to “unwind a rigged system that undermines every worker’s ability to negotiate with the employer.” Indeed, the reforms would revamp decades-old labor laws that unions believe are too friendly to employers and make it difficult to retain members or add new ones.One proposal would ban states from enacting “right to work” laws, which give workers the option to stop supporting unions while still enjoying the benefits of representation. Other proposals include creating new penalties for companies that engage in union-busting and forbidding the use of permanent replacement workers during labor strikes. Another proposal extends collective bargaining rights to more public employees, including in states that have recently restricted them, such as Wisconsin and Iowa.If that sounds like a wish list for unions, it pretty much is. As a pillar of the Democratic Party, unions have wanted for years to see mainstream Democrats push for major reforms to the law that would rejuvenate the ranks of organized labor. At the press conference Wednesday, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka applauded the proposals, but also emphasized that many Democrats have taken their union support for granted.“To be perfectly honest, Democrats in the past have lost some of their connection with working people in our communities who made up their base for generations,” Trumka said. “But this ― these proposals ― will strengthen that bond.”Union membership in the United States has been hovering near a historic low in recent years, with less than 11 percent of workers now belonging to a union. That’s down from a high of around 35 percent in the 1950s. Five states have passed right-to-work laws since 2012. Such laws forbid contracts between unions and employers that require all the workers in a unit to pay fees to cover the costs of bargaining. Many workers choose to opt out once they have the chance, even though the union must continue bargaining on their behalf. A majority of states are now right-to-work, making it hard for unions to maintain their membership levels.The Supreme Court case known as Janus could make it even harder. The conservative majority of justices may issue a ruling next year that would make the entire U.S. public sector right-to-work, giving hundreds of thousands of workers the option to stop paying union fees. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers union, said Wednesday that the Democratic proposals would help counteract those threats. She also said they stood in stark contrast to the Republican plan being hashed out this week to slash corporate taxes. “This is a which-side-are-you-on moment,” Weingarten said. “The better deal starts with collective bargaining. It starts with having the freedom to negotiate, and it starts with unrigging the laws to ensure that.”The Democratic proposal:"

Now he's President Donald Trump's nominee to run the Export-Import Bank.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f9e9e71800003400d5a884.jpeg?cache=9ZiduxIUwD&ops=crop_14_238_3408_2283%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As a Republican congressman from New Jersey, Scott Garrett took to the floor of the House in 2015 and lambasted the Export-Import Bank as an institution that “embodies the corruption of the free enterprise system.” He consistently opposed the reauthorization of the bank and wanted to shutter it.Now, he wants to run it. Garrett lost his re-election bid in 2016 ― in large part because he lost the backing of financial institutions after he made anti-gay remarks. In April, President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate him to lead the institution that helps finance U.S. exports. Trump’s pick has split many traditional GOP allies, with groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposing Garrett’s confirmation. Now that he needs a new job and wants to run the bank, Garrett is trying to reassure everyone that he supports it. “Let me be crystal clear on this point: If I am confirmed, the Export-Import Bank will continue to fully operate, point-blank,” Garrett told the Senate banking committee Wednesday morning. But what Garrett was less clear about was why he changed his mind. Democratic senators repeatedly pressed Garrett on why they should believe he’s now sincere. “It seems to me what’s changed is you’ve been offered this good-paying job to run the Export-Import Bank, not the change of the Export-Import Bank, but perhaps the change of your situation,” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said. “I believe in this bank, and I’m not sure you do,” added Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who was frustrated that Garrett refused to say he was wrong in his previous denunciations of the agency. “Will you admit now that your crusade to kill the bank was a mistake?” asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Garrett, again, refused to do so. While Democratic senators were the ones who mainly pressed Garrett on this point, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) did so as well.“The reason for the change is perhaps more important than the change,” he said.Garrett never really gave a policy explanation for why he shifted on the bank. His reversal came down to two main reasons: Trump is president, and he now wants to run the bank.“Senator, if the question is, what has changed since 2015, what we have seen changed is a new administration,” Garrett told Brown. “What we have seen change is a new agenda by this administration to see to it that the economy actually grows, and that businesses are given a fair chance to grow their businesses both nationally and internationally as well. That is a significant change since 2015.”Later, Garrett also told Scott, “My role has changed. I am not in a legislative function.”“I commit ... to carry out the letter of the law as established by Congress,” he added.In 2015, Garrett told fellow Republicans in a closed-door meeting that he wouldn’t pay his dues to the National Republican Congressional Committee because the organization supported some gay candidates.Garrett later clarified that he didn’t oppose gay people running for office, but he believed the GOP should not support candidates who back same-sex marriage. His comments cost him support from Wall Street donors, who had been a major source of funding for his previous campaigns."
62,POLITICS,Bill Would Block Utilities Responsible For Wildfires From Passing The Cost To Customers,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pge-california-wildfire-cost_us_59f9e548e4b046017fb05fda,"""It's time to stop allowing utilities to push the burden of their negligence onto the backs of customers.""",2017-11-01,"Cal Fire firefighter Brandon Tolp uses a drip torch during a firing operation while battling the Tubbs Fire on Oct. 12, 2017, near Calistoga, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f9e6fe180000051bdfd39d.jpeg?cache=hedWLCaYQw&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A bill set to be introduced in the California state legislature next year would block public utilities from passing the cost of wildfire claims and damages on to consumers. As state regulators investigate the deadly blazes that broke out last month in Northern California, four lawmakers are hoping to prevent the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and other utility companies in the state from billing their customers for any costs they may incur if they’re found to be responsible for the fires. PG&E has acknowledged that some of its electrical lines and poles went down as a result of wind or falling trees around the same time the fires began. At issue is the question of whether those incidents in fact started the fires ― and whether, if that was the case, it happened due to negligence on PG&E’s behalf. The fires ultimately burned more than 100,000 acres and left 43 people dead. If found responsible for the blazes, the utility could be on the hook to pay billions of dollars in damages. San Diego Gas & Electric, another major California utility, found itself in a similar situation after Cal Fire, the state’s forestry department, determined that the company’s power lines had started a series of 2007 wildfires that killed two people and destroyed 1,300 homes. The utility has since asked state regulators to let it bill its customers for the $379 million in damages that weren’t covered by the company’s insurance.PG&E officials have supported that case, lobbying regulators last month to allow utilities to pass on wildfire liability costs to ratepayers by charging a higher monthly rate for electricity. Officials argued that worsening fire conditions and the current state of the insurance market have made it “untenable” for utilities to shoulder the entire cost of wildfire damages themselves. The four Democratic lawmakers, however, don’t think consumers should be forced to pay for utilities’ mistakes.“This practice is an outrage,” state Sen. Jerry Hill, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said in a statement. “Victims of devastating fires and other customers should not be forced to pay for the mistakes made by utilities. It’s time to stop allowing utilities to push the burden of their negligence onto the backs of customers.”The bill, which is also backed by state Sens. Mike McGuire and Scott Wiener and Assemblyman Marc Levine, is expected to be introduced once the state legislature reconvenes in January.PG&E spokesperson Ari Vanrenen said in a statement that “while we all want answers, we must address these climate-driven natural disasters and come together to find solutions that protect our infrastructure and keep our communities and customers safe.”“Catastrophic wildfires pose real risks to our entire state’s economy and infrastructure. They don’t recognize or respect the boundaries of one energy company versus another. Given these devastating effects of climate change, this is a vital state-wide safety issue that impacts every person and community in the state,” Vanrenen said. The wildfires, which are now 100 percent contained, blazed through California’s famed wine country in mid-October, destroying more than 8,000 homes, prompting 100,000 people to evacuate and causing an estimated $3.3 billion in damage. Full recovery is expected to take years. This story has been updated to include PG&E’s response."

The ACLU gave notice on Monday that it would file a lawsuit if the Office of Refugee Resettlement failed to release 10-year-old Rosa Maria Hernandez by 3 p.m. on Tuesday. Rosa Maria remained in custody after the deadline. “There’s no reason to hold this child,” ACLU attorney Michael Tan told HuffPost. “This is probably the most outrageous case I’ve ever worked on. It’s mind-boggling.” Rosa Maria’s case drew nationwide attention last week, when Border Patrol agents apprehended her after she underwent emergency gallbladder surgery. Rosa Maria has cerebral palsy and developmental delays, and has lived in the U.S with her family since she was 3 months old ― not exactly the type of hardened criminal undocumented immigrant the Trump administration has claimed is its primary focus. Border Patrol agents encountered Rosa Maria Oct. 24 while she was being transported in an ambulance from a hospital in Laredo, Texas, where she lives with her family, to another hospital in Corpus Christi. Border Patrol operates as much as 100 miles from the border, so checkpoints are often unavoidable for people in border regions. Border Patrol agents delayed the ambulance for 30 minutes, according to the ACLU. They eventually allowed Rosa Maria continue to the Corpus Christi hospital, but followed her and waited as she underwent emergency surgery. Agents apprehended Rosa Maria on Wednesday, when she was discharged from the hospital.The Trump administration then took the girl to an Office of Refugee Resettlement shelter in San Antonio, treating her as an unaccompanied minor immigrant ― even though she has lived with her parents for her entire life, most of it in the U.S. (Rosa Maria’s adult cousin, who is a U.S. citizen, had accompanied her to the Corpus Christi hospital rather than her parents.) Unaccompanied minors apprehended at the border go into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement until it can find sponsors to take them in, but officials would allow neither Rosa Maria’s cousin nor her grandfather, a legal permanent resident, to take her home, according to a family attorney. The ACLU argued in a letter Tan wrote on Monday that Rosa Maria’s detention is illegal and has no basis, in part because she should not be considered an unaccompanied minor. Her arrest and detention violates a 1997 legal settlement that requires the government to place immigrant children in “least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor’s age and special needs” and to “release a minor from [their] custody without unnecessary delay,” Tan wrote. The government has not alleged that Rosa Maria’s family is unfit, Tan said. In the letter, he wrote that Rosa Maria, who has the cognitive development of a 6-year-old, “is completely dependent on her mother” due to her medical condition, and “needs this care, stability, routine, and support.” “It’s a nightmare for the family,” Tan told HuffPost. “It’s horrible.”Customs and Border Protection, which includes the U.S. Border Patrol, said in a statement that agents had to take the child into custody after encountering her because she was in the U.S. without legal status and was not with her parents. “The law specifically defines who is a parent or legal guardian and there is no discretion with regard to the law whether or not the agents should enforce the law,” CBP said in a statement. CBP also defended the agents against allegations that they violated its “sensitive locations” policy, which instructs immigration and border enforcement officers to avoid medical facilities, along with schools, places of worship and protests.“CBP has a policy regarding sensitive locations such as hospitals, but it should be stressed that the encounter took place at a checkpoint and the actions taken were in accordance with the law and carried out as humanely as possible,” the agency said in its statement. The Office of Refugee Resettlement declined to comment on a specific case as a matter of policy, but said in a statement that the agency has procedures to ensure safety of minors in its custody, including their health care. Its policy requires the release of minors to sponsors in a “safe and timely” manner “that promotes public safety and ensures that sponsors are able to provide for the physical and mental well-being of” the unaccompanied minor, according to the agency. Members of Congress, religious leaders and human rights advocates have decried Rosa Maria’s detention, in part because she was stopped on her way to emergency surgery and taken into custody during her recovery. Border Patrol officers followed Rosa Maria and entered the hospital in spite of the agency’s “sensitive locations” policy. “Any plans for Rosa Maria’s removal from the United States should be cancelled and any proceedings against her should be administratively closed based on humanitarian grounds,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said in a statement on Tuesday. ”The Trump administration needs to focus its resources on targeting dangerous criminals, not ill children. The president’s callous immigration policies continue to reach new, inhumane lows.”This article has been updated with comment from CBP. "

Authorities didn’t identify the drug.Media reports of the warrant circulated on Monday. “The warrant obtained February 1, 2017, was and has been a matter of public record since issuance and our police have made attempts to contact Ms. McGowan regarding the matter,” Trull said.Airport police want to arrange for McGowan to appear in court in Loudoun County, Virginia, to answer the charge, according to Trull. In a tweet on Monday, McGowan, star of TV’s “Charmed” and the movie “Grindhouse,” dismissed the warrant as “horseshit,” asking, “Are they trying to silence me?”McGowan was presumably referring to the Weinstein controversy. She had spoken out against sexual harassment and assault in show business before a growing number of women exposed the movie mogul’s predatory ways. McGowan later confirmed that the “studio head” she said had raped her was Weinstein.Reps for McGowan didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment."

My passion for politics and public policy was my toehold in reality. However, my illness’ physical, psychological, and spiritual symptoms overwhelmed me. Without help, I was powerless to fight it.To say that I led a double life would be an understatement. My career put me in the public eye: I worked closely with President Bill Clinton and his advisors, in the highest office of our government. My addiction, however, took me to the absolute depths of misery and isolation. From Pennsylvania Avenue, I ended up homeless, sleeping on a drug dealer’s couch, and begging for change at the gas station. I had felt so fortunate to work with President Clinton, and be one among a staff of bright, inspired people. Where did my luck go? I didn’t know that I was one of more than 20 million Americans affected by addiction. The stigma of my illness was powerful, and kept me suffering in silence and in hiding for a decade. When I was actively using, my greatest fear was that I would be discovered. I was afraid that my addiction would define me: that being an “addict” would steal everything from me. I knew that Americans with substance use problems face terrible discrimination in the workplace. A 2004 study by Faces & Voices of Recovery showed that 27% of people would not hire an otherwise qualified applicant who was openly in long-term recovery. That’s discrimination, and it’s perfectly legal: people like me don’t enjoy the same protections that other minorities do in the workplace. Although everyone agrees that the stigma of addiction is harmful, it still influences how people like me are viewed. It affects our ability to find meaningful work, quality medical care, housing, and other basic human needs. When I left the White House in 2001, I had no idea I would be homeless, scared, and alone in only a few years. As I got sicker, I was sure I’d never work in policy again, much less meet the President. My illness separated me from the career I loved. By 2003, I was in full-blown addiction. A couple of years after that, I was injecting heroin, and so ashamed of myself that I thought I’d rather die than ask for help. So much has changed since then. After years of struggling with my illness, I was able to get treatment. I have been in recovery since February 2, 2015. Since then, I have not had to use any mind-altering substances, such as heroin or other opioids. And, instead of destroying my life, my substance use disorder has given me a second chance to work in the field I’m so passionate about. The next time I shook hands with President Clinton, it was not as a sick, frightened heroin user. It was as a sober person in recovery. I told the President my story, and he shook my hand. He didn’t turn away, or recoil. He reached out to me, as a person, and said, “I’m proud of you, Ryan. What you’re doing is immensely brave.”His words, and his leadership in recovery efforts nationwide, are deeply meaningful to me, on many levels. To see a President put his hand out, and reach past the stigma of addiction, is world-changing. And it wasn’t just a handshake. The Clinton Health Matters Initiative’s investment in addressing the complex social and political issues that relate to recovery will save many lives. President Clinton, I was happy to be a member of your team in 1999. Today, I’m so grateful to be on the same team again, along with your policy & advocacy working group and the many public health and recovery advocates who have joined you.

China is North Korea’s major ally and trading partner.“Rather than dialogue it is necessary to cause North Korea to change policies by raising the pressure to the maximum,” Abe said in a joint announcement with Stoltenberg.Trump has warned North Korea it would be totally destroyed if it threatened the United States with ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. North Korea stoked tensions last week when it reiterated a threat to conduct an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean in a demonstration of its nuclear capability."

Other Japanese companies have been enforcing smoking bans during work hours, even when their work takes them outside the office.According to the World Health Organization, roughly 18 percent of adults in Japan smoke tobacco daily.Piala CEO Takao Asuka said his company’s nonsmoking incentive is meant to be more positive than negative.“I hope to encourage employees to quit smoking through incentives rather than penalties or coercion,” he told the Times.The vacation offer could be healthy for the employees for more reasons than one.Overwork has been known to be a chronic problem among Japanese workers. Death, either by suicide or cardiovascular illness, linked to overwork is known as karoshi in Japan.A survey by Expedia Japan last year found that 53 percent of Japanese workers don’t know how much annual leave they are entitled to and 18 percent feel guilty taking paid time off.

Other Japanese companies have been enforcing smoking bans during work hours, even when their work takes them outside the office.According to the World Health Organization, roughly 18 percent of adults in Japan smoke tobacco daily.Piala CEO Takao Asuka said his company’s nonsmoking incentive is meant to be more positive than negative.“I hope to encourage employees to quit smoking through incentives rather than penalties or coercion,” he told the Times.The vacation offer could be healthy for the employees for more reasons than one.Overwork has been known to be a chronic problem among Japanese workers. Death, either by suicide or cardiovascular illness, linked to overwork is known as karoshi in Japan.A survey by Expedia Japan last year found that 53 percent of Japanese workers don’t know how much annual leave they are entitled to and 18 percent feel guilty taking paid time off.

The Senate bill was introduced by Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Mark Warner (D-Va.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). A companion bill was introduced by Representatives Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.) and Mike Coffman (D-Colo.) in the House.The bills were filed two weeks after Facebook reported about 470 accounts likely operating from Russia had spent about $100,000 on roughly 3,000 ads from June 2015 to May 2017.According to CRP data, all but three members of the three committees have received contributions from Alphabet Inc. (Google’s parent company), Facebook and Twitter since 2015. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) received the most from the three companies, with over $124,000 in donations.Since 2015, Alphabet alone has contributed around $100,000 to Wyden, the most to any committee member. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is Facebook’s greatest recipient with over $50,000, while Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has received $3,000 from Twitter, the most to any committee member. Harris also has received the most from the internet industry overall with over $200,000 in contributions since 2015.Judiciary chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) received about $60,000 from the three companies, while Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) received about $35,000 and House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. David Nunes (R-Calif.) received roughly $22,000.Last week, current and former representatives of print, online and broadcast media, as well as two nonprofits, testified on the House bill before the House Subcommittee on Information Technology.Allen Dickerson, the legal director for the Institute for Free Speech, said he opposed adding online political ads to existing regulations on electioneering communications on the pretext of preventing foreign intervention, which Congress can regulate separately.The Institute for Free Speech (IFS) ― known as the Center for Competitive Politics until last week ― generally opposes campaign finance transparency on First Amendment grounds. The organization represented the plaintiffs in SpeechNow.org v. FEC, which helped give rise to super PACs. In February, the group unsuccessfully represented a think tank that wanted to shield the identities of its ad donors.IFS has also advocated for anonymous spending beyond the context of ads. In 2010, the organization (then the Center for Competitive Politics) spent $40,500 lobbying on “general campaign finance issues” including in opposition to the DISCLOSE Act, which would have expanded reporting and disclosure requirements around political ad spending.All five Democrats and three of the seven Republicans on the subcommittee attended last week’s hearing. The Republicans present were Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.), Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) and chairman Rep. William Hurd (R-Texas).Reps. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Steve Russell (R-Okla.) and Greg Gianforte (R-Mo.) did not attend the meeting. Mitchell left the two-hour meeting immediately after directing rapid-fire questions at David Chavern, the representative for the News Media Alliance, a news industry organization.According to CRP data, Issa has received more than $95,000 from the internet industry since 2015. Farenthold has received over $39,000 from the industry, which has also donated more than $65,000 to Hurd and over $10,500 to AmashConnolly has received the most from the internet industry among subcommittee Democrats since 2015, with over $42,000 in donations. Raskin has received over $13,500 while Krishnamoorthi has received over $10,000. Robin Kelly (D-IL.) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) have combined to receive more than $10,000.On the day of the hearing, Twitter announced a new ad transparency policy that will include public access to the identity of buyers, costs and targeted demographics of electioneering ads. Three days later, Facebook announced its own transparency plans, with similar visibility into current and historical political ad spending.The internet became a key election battleground with Barack Obama’s unprecedented use of digital advertising in his 2008 presidential campaign, but online political ads are not yet subject to the same disclosure requirements as broadcast ads."

Cam Newton, NFL star with the Carolina Panthers, had just recently disrespected",2017-10-31,"<p> Lisa Pearson, CEO of Umbel (center) says deliberate action will change bias. (L, Kerry Rump; R, Ann Marie Schneider.) </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f8cd4c14000034068ca977.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We don’t need another example to know what’s up. Cam Newton, NFL star with the Carolina Panthers, had just recently disrespected a female journalist by mocking her in a press conference.Lisa Pearson, CEO of Umbel Corp., a data management platform for sports organizations, was not completely surprised at the expression of gender disparity and the tone of dismissiveness.“Certainly there are enough examples to pull from,” says Pearson, “as the pace of change is so staggeringly poor, it takes my breath away.”But it does not take away her mission and certainly not the impetus to move forward for women in tech and in sports management. Her eye is on the future, one that has gender parity. One of the reasons Pearson is so hopeful is her 13-year-old daughter, Eloise.Her daughter explained to her mother recently that on the school playground, some boys in her class made a rude comment.“And these girls turned around and roared,” Pearson says. And then they went to their teacher to propose a student-led conference with the theme, “Objectifying Women and Believing in Feminism.”The future is bright in part because of this next generation, she says. Because the bias, discrimination and invisibility of women in the workplace have gone on long enough.“All the industries I have been in have been male-led: agency side, global consumer brands, B2B software, without a lot of commonalties, except they are very male-oriented,” says Pearson, who also heads Umbelita’s, the company’s women’s leadership group.At Umbel since August 2015, as chief marketing officer, Pearson moved up to president in 2016, and became its CEO in April 2017.Pearson’s extensive experience in marketing spans representation of a variety of brands and corporations including Johnson & Johnson, TLC (The Learning Channel), Yahoo! HotJobs and American Eagle.The Texas-based CEO has also led her own strategic consultancy firm and served as principal in leading marketing agencies including DeVries Global and Euro RSCG where she helped drive strategy and performance for companies including Dell, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, American Express, Procter & Gamble, Starbucks, Stolinchnaya, ABSOLUT Spirits Company, Heineken Fetzer Winery, Champagne Krug, Champagne Perrier Jouet and Champagne G.H. Mumm.She has witnessed and experienced gender bias for decades. Working through her first pregnancy earlier in her career, Pearson says, “I never acknowledged I was having a baby. And when I came back from having a baby, I did not put up photos.” She adds, “I cannot believe such a beautiful milestone was something I felt no one even noticed.”The main lesson Pearson learned and wants to pass on is, “Stop hiding being a woman.”Pearson says the culture of the workplaces she was in early in her career promoted “the idea that you should be less womanly and blend in with the men to be successful.” She adds what is needed instead is “pushing for cultural shifts against sameness.”Others in sports leadership and management agree that sameness needs to be disrupted.At the recent espnW.com Summit, Laura Gentile, senior vice president, ESPNW and Women’s Initiatives, said, “The reality is that cultural and societal issues collide with sports all the time so I think we’ve really tried to handle it with great professionalism and maturity. To focus on how it affects the sports world and how it is affecting women in sports, specifically,” Gentile said, according to The Wrap.Pearson’s company mission for Umbel is to engage fans and improve the data management of sports brands and clients. That mission is connected to understanding female fans—a demographic that many do not understand accurately.Stacey Pope,  Associate Professor in School of Applied Social Sciences at Durham University, researches the nature of female fans. She writes in The Conversation, “When it comes to sports, die-hard fans are often thought of as the men in the crowd. But my new research shows, that despite popular stereotypes of women lacking sporting knowledge or only being interested in the sexual attractiveness of (male) star players – female fans are just as passionate and committed to their clubs as the men.”The gender bias is pervasive in sports management as well.“The sports world is often a difficult one for women to thrive in, as women often have to battle against people minimizing their work and expertise,” writes Bee Quammie in HuffPost.The sports and tech universes need to move to parity, as it will help the bottom line in both spheres.Stacey Leasca writes in Mic, “Women control 70-80 percent of all consumer purchasing through what Forbes described as a combination of ‘buying power and influence.’ This means even if a woman doesn’t directly purchase an item she influences the person who does.”The power and influence of women customers is only one part of prioritizing a shift to gender equity. Changing workplace culture is essential.[bctt tweet=“Changing workplace culture is essential to prioritizing a shift to #genderequity” username=“takeleadwomen”]Those cultural shifts can be accomplished with direct strategies to reduce unconscious bias, Pearson says, and she has specific recommendations on how to make that happen.Act as a mentor. As a woman, “what are you doing to make the company more hospitable to women?” Pearson asks.Enlist male support. Ask male leaders to be mentors to women and ask men to speak out in order to change the work climate.Change job descriptions. “Communicating high risk aptitude using language like ninja, rockstar, aggressive was resonant for male employees so female candidates would feel this job wasn’t them,” Pearson saysAvoid referral bias. Having mostly male employees would result in mostly young male candidates. So reward referrals outside of a network.Make sure the leadership team is 50 percent female. “From a candidate’s perspective, if I go on the , leadership page and do not see women there, I feel I don’t want to work there,” Pearson says.Be aware this is not a lady problem. The lack of gender parity in leadership in sports, tech and beyond is “a systemic, cultural problem and men should take this seriously,” Pearson says.Conduct a salary audit. “I wanted to make sure women are paid the same,” Perason says. “It’s not perfect, but I made corrections.”Be honest and authentic in service of the collective good. “Believing in something philosophically and prioritizing it are very different things,” Pearson says. “You can say it and say and say it about companies doing ridiculously better with more women CEOS and women on boards. But people are not relating to it, because if they were, it would look different.”Be more visible. “Get other women leaders out there to show what is possible. We need to show there are women executives who are happy and thriving,” Pearson says. “You can’t be what you can’t see.”Pearson is willing to be persistent in her goal to push for gender equity not just in tech and sports, but everywhere.“I am willing to be tedious and annoying in talking about” gender parity, Pearson says. “Women need to be willing to talk more freely, push the issues, be an example to other women and hold men who care on principle to accountability.”She adds, “It will take a combination of stick and carrot. We have to bring consequences. If a client doesn’t see diversity on the board and a tech company loses a big contract. Then it will change.”This post originally ran in Take The Lead."

Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), seen here in 2016, announced Tuesday that he will not seek re-election next year.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f8cfe41800003400d5a5f3.jpeg?cache=jrrIeiSoZ4&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), the current chair of the House Financial Services Committee, announced Tuesday that he will not seek re-election in 2018.As first reported by The Dallas Morning News, the eight-term congressman wrote to supporters that he never intended to make service in Congress a “lifetime commitment.”“I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned,” Hensarling, 60, wrote.Hensarling mentioned that he is term-limited as chairman of the Financial Services Committee, and because he must give up his gavel, “the time seems right for my departure.”He noted that there are still 14 months left in his term, and said he would continue to fight for the causes he’s passionate about: “individual liberty, free enterprise, and limited constitutional government.”Hensarling has long toyed with the idea of running for a GOP leadership position, repeatedly declining to challenge anyone. He served as the GOP conference chairman ― technically the No. 4 spot in leadership ― for two years before giving up the position to become the Financial Services chairman in 2013.He was often combative in that role, refusing to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank in 2015 and repeatedly taking on flood insurance to the delight of conservatives. But he also frequently aligned with Republican leaders and was a reliable vote for most of leadership’s priorities for his 14-plus years in Congress.Hensarling’s southeast Dallas district is safely Republican, and there’s apt to be a fierce GOP primary to replace him. The filing deadline is less than two weeks away, and the primary is in March.Hensarling interviewed with President Donald Trump last year to become Treasury secretary.

79,POLITICS,The Tax Scam We Know And The Tax Scam We Don’t Know,"Dean Baker, Guest WriterGuest Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-tax-scam-we-know-and-the-tax-scam-we-dont-know_us_59f7d02de4b0e4c2eab1c348,"We can apply any tax rate we want to the rich, but it doesn't matter if no one is enforcing it.",2017-10-31,"David Kautter testifies during his confirmation hearing in the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, July 18, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f8855f180000051bdfd005.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There has been much attention to the plan put forward by Republicans in Congress to cut individual and corporate income taxes. According to analysis done by independent sources, close to 80 percent of these cuts will go to the richest one percent of the population.While this may seem unfair and unwarranted in an economy where the rich have seen the overwhelming majority of the gains from growth in the last four decades, we have been told not to worry because the boost to growth will make everyone winners. The average family has been promised an income gain of $4,000 a year and possibly as much as $9,000.It is possible to construct economic theories where corporate tax cuts do produce large gains, but these theories clearly do not describe the world we live in. For example back in the mid-1980s, the U.S. lowered the corporate tax rate from 46 percent to 35 percent. Rather than producing an investment boom, the late 1980s were the weakest non-recession period for investment in the post-World War II era.The idea that investment is highly responsive to the after-tax rate of profit stands history on its head. The strongest period of investment in the last seven decades was the late 1970s when the profit rate was at its post-war low. By contrast, the near-record profit rates seen in this recovery have coincided with mediocre levels of investment. It’s difficult to believe that if we raised the rate of profit even further by cutting taxes, investment would somehow boom.But this is the scam everyone knows. There is another potentially far more pernicious scam currently in process. Any tax cut will have to go through Congress with representatives and senators having to cast a vote that in principle they can be held accountable for. The other scam requires no vote; it is about Donald Trump appointing a crony tax avoider as temporary head of the Internal Revenue Service.Last week, the Trump administration announced that it intends to make David Kautter the acting commissioner of the IRS on November 12, when the current director’s term ends. The IRS’s job is enforcing the tax code. Traditionally, IRS directors picked by presidents of both parties have had experience at the IRS, which would give them the necessary expertise to lead the agency.Kautter has zero experience at the IRS and in tax enforcement. Instead, his experience is as the director of “National Tax” at E&Y, the huge accounting firm formerly known as Ernest & Young. Kautter’s work there was in developing tax avoidance schemes, minimizing clients’ tax liability. This division of EY was so vigilant at its efforts in avoiding taxes that it eventually had to pay $123 million to the government in order to avoid criminal prosecution.This selection should concern people for a number of reasons. First, President Trump has claimed that his tax returns are being audited. If this is true, he is in effect being allowed to pick his own auditor, with no congressional oversight. Trump has virtually made a sport of flaunting the conflict of interest laws and norms that have governed the behavior of past presidents, but this is getting sufficiently extreme that it should even bother some Republicans.Apart from Trump personally there is also the question of how prominent Republican donors will be treated by the acting IRS commissioner. One donor in particular stands out in this respect. The ultra-conservative billionaire, Robert Mercer, is in a dispute with the IRS potentially involving more than $7 billion in back taxes and penalties, stemming from the tax treatment of his hedge fund Renaissance Technologies LLC. Favorable treatment from Kautter can mean a huge windfall for Mr. Mercer, much of which is likely to come back to the Republican party in future contributions.Mercer’s case might be an extreme one, but there is a real risk that many other politically connected rich people will be allowed to avoid much or all of their tax liability. For the rich, paying taxes could become a voluntary contribution to the government rather than something they are required to do under threat of punishment.That is a really huge deal. We can apply any tax rate we want to the rich, but it doesn’t matter if no one is enforcing it. And that it is a real risk we face with allowing the Kautter appointment to go through.There is no reason that Trump can’t do what other presidents have done, nominate a commissioner and have them go through the Senate approval process. The alternative is to make a joke of the tax code at the expense of the people who can’t afford expensive tax lawyers. This is a case of really swamping the drain, big-time."
80,STYLE,Don't Freak Out If You're Shedding More Hair Than Usual Right Now,Jamie Feldman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hair-loss-seasonal_us_59f8c230e4b0d1cf6e90f4d8,You're not alone.,2017-10-31,"If you find yourself doing this more often right now, don't panic. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f8cb2c180000051bdfd15d.jpeg?cache=17M8VTSOHZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The struggle with shedding hair is real, whether it’s clogging our drains, sitting in our hairbrushes or strewn around our homes. Shedding between 50 and 100 strands of hair per day is normal, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association. But there’s no reason to panic if you’ve recently noticed a lot more than that going down your drain. A new study published in the British Journal of Dermatology examined the correlation between seasons and hair loss. According to the study, which examined patterns in Google Trends searches for the term “hair loss” across eight English-speaking countries over 12 years, searches for the term were greater in summer and fall than they are in spring. Winter fell between the two. There are a few explanations given by dermatologists as to why hair loss increases during summer and fall. In the study, it concludes that the trend “suggests that hair loss in the population is significantly correlated with seasonality, and that hair loss occurs most frequently in the summer and fall.” This finding, the report reads, is “consistent with prior studies that used trichograms and other hair samples to find that telogen hair loss occurs maximally in the summer.” Telogen hair is hair in the resting phase, ""when the hair is released from the follicle and a new hair begins to grow in its place,"" according to a piece written for a Texas-based dermatology clinic by dermatologist Lisa Rhodes.Emily Wise Shanahan told Allure in September that “we hang on to more hair to provide increased protection from the sun” during the summer months. “A few months after, when we begin shifting into late fall and early winter, those hairs that we held onto during summer will make a transition into the shed phase,” she said. “This may result in a temporary increase in shedding compared to your baseline.” One of the authors of the study, Shawn Kwatra, a dermatologist and assistant professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins, told Health that it could have to do, in part, with evolution.“This is speculative, but from an evolutionary perspective one of the roles of hair loss is to provide warmth,” he said. “This would be less necessary during the summer months.” The more evolved we become, the less we need hair to shield us from the cold. But, just because it’s common to shed more hair during this time doesn’t mean you should assume that is the only reason for hair loss. Dr. Angela Lamb, director of the Westside Mount Sinai Dermatology Faculty Practice, director of dermatology at the Institute of Family Health and an assistant dermatology professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Angela Lamb, told HuffPost that yes, “The hair cycles more rapidly at different times of the year or due to hormonal differences,” but hair loss could also be the result of a larger issue. “One of the largest things I see in my office is hair loss due to vitamin deficiencies, thyroid disorders, birth control changes or pregnancy,” she said. “I would not just say if you are losing hair that it must be from the seasonal patterns.” Still, unless you are noticing a significant shift in amounts of shedding, we hereby permit you to use your extra shedding as a sign that you are a more evolved member of the human race.You’re welcome.

81,ENTERTAINMENT,"Melissa Leo, Forever A Fighter",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melissa-leo-novitiate_us_59f76781e4b0c0c8e67b95ee,"In her new movie, ""Novitiate,"" the Oscar winner plays a strict nun. We talked to her about religion, those infamous ""Consider"" ads and being a gay icon.",2017-10-31,"Melissa Leo accepts her Oscar for ""The Fighter"" on Feb. 27, 2011.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f7805f1800003400d5a26c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Melissa Leo became a movie star at 48, well past the age of most actresses’ first Hollywood curtsy.In 2009, after more than two decades of television work (“All My Children,” “Homicide: Life on the Street”) and small film roles (“21 Grams,” “Hide and Seek”), Leo collected her first Oscar nomination for “Frozen River,” in which she portrayed a mother supplementing her unstable income by trafficking illegal immigrants from Canada. Suddenly, Leo’s name was mentioned in the same breath as Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet and Angelina Jolie.Regardless, it took another two years and an actual Oscar win ― for playing the brash matriarch of a boxing clan in “The Fighter” ― for Leo to develop a reputation to precede her. When she couldn’t land the magazine covers and other promotional perks that are standard for Oscar hopefuls, Leo purchased her own glamorous ads, stamped the word “Consider” on them, and cemented her renown as an iconoclast. Ever since, her career has blossomed, from HBO’s “Treme” and Showtime’s “I’m Dying Up Here” to “Flight,” “Oblivion,” “Prisoners,” “The Big Short” and now “Novitiate,” which opened in limited release last weekend. In the 1960s-set drama about a teenager (Margaret Qualley) choosing to devote her life to God, Leo plays the top-ranking nun at a strict convent. When a modernizing decree handed down from the Vatican greatly diminishes nuns’ stature within the Catholic Church, the very foundation upon which Leo’s reverend mother has built her devotion crumbles. The movie could net Leo’s third Oscar nomination. Leo’s résumé offers a museum of stern characters, and this latest addition fits in well. In person, I expected her to mirror her typical screen persona: tough, brittle, direct. Leo didn’t disappoint, but I’d shortchanged how tender she could be. We talked about her frustrations with the infamous “Consider” ads, her lifelong desire to play a nun and the one role she regrets turning down. You’ve lived with this movie for a while. It was one of the buzzy titles at Sundance earlier this year.It was almost two years ago that we shot it. As a matter of fact, underneath the reverend mother’s habit, Melissa’s hair is about an inch and a half long. And now it’s down below my shoulders. I had it short because I had done so much dyeing. I play a woman on Showtime, and she’s bleached. I played Laura Poitras [in last year’s “Snowden”], and she [has black hair]. It was that black dye for Laura Poitras. I had to cut some of that hair off.Were there photos of this? I want to see your short crop.No, no, no. Nope. You’ll never see it. I made a suggestion to [“Novitiate” director Maggie Betts] that we see it at some point. She didn’t feel it was necessary. But it’s there in the film because I know it to be so. I’ve always talked about ― from my shoes, socks, underpants ― undressing the character. So to put the habit on each day and have it be closer to her is a help.So you imagined the reverend mother having short hair, too? I assume so if you were willing to reveal it. It’s what was true, so there’s what I think of, after 30 years of doing this, as real, true movie magic. Another example is when it snows. In Tennessee? In the springtime? We got a dump of snow, and I said to the company, “Get your camera out, get your camera out. I’m putting the costume on. Get your camera out.” Because the film takes place over years, not just a few days. [...] So they got the little bit of footage you see in the film of the girls playing in the snow.That’s a nice moment of levity. It’s a break from the girls’ rigid piety. It’s a nice thing, too, that you see that these are young girls and they have that in them. They’re human beings, too. But sometimes I will lose weight or gain weight — I don’t really mean to — and then I’ll see the movie I was working on and realize why. All I’m saying is things sometimes happen for a reason, if you’ll just let them happen. Did you grow up religious at all?[Leo shakes her head vehemently.]Everyone who wasn’t raised Catholic seems to have a different interpretation of nuns. Before “Novitiate,” what was yours?Part of my draw to it was, as you’re talking about, the great mystery of it. First of all, it’s a costume. Even before I started working, I’ve always been an actor, and I just love a costume. I don’t even know how to get dressed up to be a regular person, but I can put a costume on. I went to a Montessori school on the Upper East Side that was housed in a Catholic school. So as we had our teachers, who were not nuns, in Montessori school. We would pass in the halls these women in these costumes. I was fascinated by them. We were told there was a certain kind of respect you had to pay to these women. You could address them by calling them “sister,” and there was one of them you had to call “mother.” I remember being scared to death I might not know which one that was. I don’t think I ever got in trouble on it, though. It just laid in this thing. As I get asked about it, I think back and I think, well, yeah, I’ve just always wanted to play a nun. I find it fascinating. A commitment to something so full and complete? The costuming? To believe something you cannot see? That’s what actors do. And to believe it so intensely that you would effectively remove yourself from the world as an act of devotion. You think that would sound so terrible. Is it really so terrible? Have you seen the world today? [Laughs]Maybe at this point we all need to become nuns.Cloister a little bit.At least until 2020.Exactly. Back in our closets again for a little while.Did you see nuns as autocratic figures? Yours is certainly commanding and inflexible. No, I’ve talked to people who have this idea of the harsh nun. They’re never talking about cloistered nuns. They’re talking about nuns who went into education. You either go into education or you go into a convent. For the cloistered nuns, I would hazard a guess that it’s a little more complicated. When the reverend mother is saying things that the outside world finds harsh — because now we’re doing the interviews and I’m hearing the feedback — I did not perceive them as harsh. What she’s doing is — excuse the expression — goddamn serious. Right? And teenage girls? Well, you get more than one of them in a room and you’re bound to get some trouble. Reverend Mother knows that better than anyone. Reverend Mother was one of those girls, and, as she says in the film, rescued by the convent for her way of thinking. What I hope the film can also do is that you begin to recognize that someone can live a life you might not understand but that doesn’t make it something threatening. And you meet Reverend Mother not in her 40 years of quiet contemplation, but once the Vatican has come plopping on her desk telling her that she don’t matter anymore.Your résumé skews on the serious side. That one “Broad City” episode you did is very much an anomaly. Well, she’s a mother.And a dictator of sorts. She likes to run that co-op! What pushed you into such a serious realm? Did you never gravitate toward comedy?I did get that Emmy for the Louis C.K. show, and that’s pretty funny stuff. I am not ― you’re quite right ― known for being a particularly funny actor. But my friends tell me I’m funny. Some people tell me I’m really funny. I don’t know quite how to take that. And now I do that show on Showtime [“I’m Dying Up Here”], where I’m up to my eyeballs in funny people. But this is all a roundabout way to answer your question. I do not choose. It chooses me. It’s not on purpose. Does somebody else out there have a purpose for me? I know that when I’ve worked with producers or directors in trying to think of people for roles, you do kind of go through this thing of what you’ve seen them do already. The really clever ones, though, can think, oh, let’s see if we can offer it to that one because they’ve never done that yet. For me, as an actor, that’s interesting. And even though they’re all fairly serious and I am absolutely far too serious of an actor for my own good, I am what I am. Is there a moment you realized you’re such a serious actress?No, I think the thing that we most are is hardest to see. It would have been other people’s responses to me. I see other people having more fun doing it, but I’m having fun.Wielding that gun at the end of “Prisoners” isn’t a bad gig. It’s hard work. I like hard work. Nothing wrong with hard work. Are you aware that the “Consider” ads make you something of a gay icon?Aw, I did not know. And I’m glad you’re saying, with your fingers in the air, “Consider.” Because somebody referred to it as a for-your-consideration ad, and it wasn’t.How do you define it?OK, so when an actor is taken by a film company, you’re getting publicity. My talking with you is good for the movie I’ve already shot, and quite frankly it’s kind of good for getting work in the future. So then, in working with publicists, I would see many an actor ― male and female ― on the shiny covers of fancy magazines. And I thought, well, maybe if they’re thinking I might get an Oscar [for “The Fighter”], maybe I could be on the cover of a shiny magazine. It’s sort of a little girl’s dream. And then they told me no. And they told me no. And they told me no. And then I said, “OK, I hear your no. Can you tell me why not?” And then they said, “Too old. Not big enough box office.” And then I said, “OK. How much does a page cost in this magazine and that magazine? I can take a pretty picture.” I don’t think the prettiest pictures I ever took are in those magazines. I have a little bit of a problem with the photographs chosen, particularly the one in the back dress. It’s just in-your-face. It adds to this not understanding what I’m doing. I was saying, “Consider Melissa Leo. I could be funny. I could be gracious and pretty. I could play a queen.” But if I got you guys, that makes me happy.Actresses are supposed to want Oscars and magazine covers, but they’re not supposed to say they want Oscars and magazine covers. They’re supposed to act like it was thrust upon them. But to have someone seek out that narrative for herself speaks to something certain people, especially gay men, want to rally behind.Thank you. That is so sweet. Thank you so much for that.You were fired from “Homicide: Life on the Street” after five seasons, in your estimation because the network didn’t find you conventionally sexy. Did that experience change the way you negotiate your roles?Well, I’m really happy to report I don’t have to negotiate my own negotiations. I have some very talented people who do that for me, and you’d have to ask them, but my guess is it’s made their bargaining a little stronger. It’s definitely a chip to put in there. For me personally, I think the biggest mistake I’ve probably ever made in my professional life is going, “Oh, Academy Award? Well, what’s next?” It took me — I’m embarrassed to say — almost two years to realize that this is what we call expectations. That’s going to get your ass in trouble. So I backed away from thinking I had a better idea than the universe has for me. Because for 25 years I just opened myself up to what the universe held for me, and that works best for me. Was there a period where you fought against the fate handed to you by the industry?I had gone for literally 25 years, and I think I had twice said “no, thank you” to something that was offered to me. Once I thought it was a great mistake, but whatever; it’s in the past. And the other time I think it had to do more with scheduling.What was the mistake?Tony Perkins wanted me to play the first murder victim when he did “Psycho II.” That would be a funny thing to have on the mantle, right? He wanted her to be redheaded. And to have gotten the chance to work with Tony would have been iconic. So it was silly. That’s why the regret remains there, but it’s no big thing, either.Really, it’s people I shouldn’t have been listening to [after the Oscar win]. What are you going to say when people say, “Well, has Spielberg called?” No, should he have? So then I started thinking those kind of people should be calling me. But, in fact, in the long run, the people who needed to be calling me were calling me, and it’s working out. I’m working for the third time with Antoine Fuqua, who’s one of the finest directors the United States has ever had. It’s all going along OK. And I like to be asked about it because I like to encourage everyone. You can try and strive to make it different, or think you deserve something. Just get in the boat. Make sure you’re in the right boat for who you are, and take the ride. Given the ongoing conversation surrounding harassment and intimidation in the industry, it must be trying when it seems like there are so many bullies out there.Bullies and bullshiters and all the rest of it. To thine own self be true. And you can look back at the end of the day and feel good about it, right?But the Weinsteins of the world are still out there.I think it’s very important that big names have been mentioned, and it’s big names that are mentioning those names. It’s terribly important in the world, because big seems to matter. It’s not the only thing, and it’s not the only way in which people are injured. There’s all kinds of abuses. It’s not only sexual abuse. The industry is rampant with it in all kinds of ways. If we are living as shining, shiny examples that people want to look at and read about and write about, then let’s tell the truth about things and help the world. I think it’s very important. You can be butting into somebody else’s business, you can be nosy, but you can also be a human being on the planet with others and say, “You know, you really can’t talk to people like that.” This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

Copies of the 95 Theses were distributed throughout Germany. Luther was later excommunicated from the Catholic Church. Nevertheless, the movement he helped spark soon resulted in the splintering of the church, and the birth of Protestantism. Luther’s life story is marred by the virulently anti-Semitic writings he completed near the end of his life ― views that were later used by the Nazis to justify their persecution of Jewish people. On Tuesday, German politicians and leaders gathered in Wittenberg to attend church services and a ceremony at city hall. Wittenberg’s city center has been transformed into a medieval-era town, complete with performers and visitors dressed in period attire."
