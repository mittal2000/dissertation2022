0,POLITICS,"House Passes Spending Bill, But Shutdown Threat Remains",Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-spending-bill-shutdown_us_5a614042e4b074ce7a06ee7f,Basic governance may yet elude Republicans.,2018-01-19,"Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, says there are ""subplots"" to the agreement on the short-term funding bill.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6140a51e00003d005adbfb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A day before a government shutdown, House Republican leaders cut a last-minute deal with conservatives to get a one-month spending bill out of their chamber and on to the Senate floor. But that legislation to extend government funding still faces challenges, particularly after conservatives won concessions that could set up a shutdown in the coming weeks and the Senate delayed a vote late Thursday night.The House voted 230-197 for the four-week continuing resolution, with 11 Republicans voting no and six Democrats voting for it. A couple of hours later, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) set up a vote to end debate on the spending bill, and then promptly delayed it.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged Republicans to hold the vote now, so Democrats could demonstrate that Republicans didn’t have the votes and lawmakers from both sides could work toward a different solution. But McConnell wasn’t having it. Now the Senate appears likely to vote Friday on ending debate, and unless something changes overnight, that vote still looks like it will fail.President Donald Trump weighed in Friday, acknowledging the impasse and calling for more Republican victories in 2018:All day Thursday, the stopgap spending bill has looked to be in doubt, both because of Senate Democrats and House conservatives. In the House, the conservative House Freedom Caucus confidently told any reporter who’d listen that they had enough votes in their caucus to stop the bill, assuming every Democrat opposed the measure.The promises from Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) that he could ― and would ― sink the stopgap spending bill eventually forced House GOP leadership to cut a deal. In exchange for about 20 votes that Meadows said he had in his back pocket, Republican leaders agreed to hold a vote on a defense-only appropriations bill in the next 10 legislative days. That bill would break spending caps that lawmakers set in 2011, but it would not simultaneously raise those limits for non-defense spending. (The bill Republicans passed Thursday night would once again delay “sequestration,” the automatic spending cuts that would be triggered without an agreement.)Conservatives also got commitments on the House voting on a conservative immigration bill that, in return for extending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, would approve money for a border wall, curtail family reunification immigration and end the diversity visa lottery program ― among other right-wing immigration priorities.President Donald Trump personally approved of the agreement Thursday afternoon when he called Meadows during a Freedom Caucus meeting. With the president’s blessing, Meadows and former HFC Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) went to House Speaker Paul Ryan’s office and cut the deal.The agreement got the bill out of the House, but it hasn’t guaranteed anything in the Senate. If anything, it may make Senate passage of the four-week continuing resolution (CR) even more difficult.Senate Democrats have been lining up against this four-week CR for days now, even though it funds the Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years. Democrats oppose the bill because it doesn’t deliver any legislative fix for Dreamers, the undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Without a DACA deal, Senate Democrats look poised to vote against ending debate on the four-week CR. And if Republicans can’t close debate, government funding will lapse at midnight Friday.Democrats always could supply enough support for the Senate to get to the magic number of 60 votes to push through the CR, but Democrats instead look more apt to reject the bill and maybe agree to a shorter term for the spending measure ― or insist on assurances of their own.When HuffPost asked Meadows Thursday night what, in effect, conservatives really got ― because the deal conservatives struck was really to just hold two votes, not necessarily enact any real legislative changes, and defense hawks appeared to already have a deal to bring up a separate spending bill for the Pentagon ― Meadows said there were “subplots” to the agreement that he wouldn’t go into now. Those subplots look like a pact that Republicans will pass the two bills conservatives angled for ― the defense-only spending legislation and the immigration measure ― and then not cave when Congress hits the next government funding deadline.Trump and conservatives have seemed open to a shutdown fight, and, ultimately, this deal might move Congress closer to a shutdown either this week or in the near future.Senate Democrats don’t, at the moment, appear to be bluffing that they’ll oppose ending debate on this short-term funding bill. And without an agreement, lawmakers can’t send a bill to the president’s desk.Senators could strike a new deal on a CR, either for that shorter-term bill that some Democrats have indicated they’d support, or they could come up with a larger deal that would address DACA and win the support of Democrats in both chambers.But short of those possibilities, or some other last-minute option, Congress still appears to be veering toward a shutdown that no lawmaker really wanted."
1,POLITICS,Pentagon Drops Climate From National Defense Strategy In Retreat From Bush-Era Policy,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pentagon-climate-trump_us_5a611feae4b01d91b254278d,The National Defense Strategy has included climate change as a threat since 2008.,2018-01-19,"President Trump delivers a speech aboard the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford in Newport News, Virginia. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a621da61e000028005add34.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Pentagon scrubbed its latest National Defense Strategy of all references to climate change, an Orwellian rhetorical shift away from a scientific reality at an agency that has long avoided the issue’s politics.A summary document released Friday morning makes no mention of “climate,” “warming,” “planet,” “sea levels” or even “temperature.” All 22 uses of the word “environment” refer to the strategic or security landscape. The 11-page memo, signed by Defense Secretary James Mattis, is the first update to the policy in a decade.It’s unlikely the Department of Defense will release a full National Defense Strategy report; instead, the document is expected to remain classified. The Pentagon did not immediately return a call requesting comment. The move comes a month after the White House dropped climate change from the list of threats in its National Security Strategy. But it was not unexpected. Days after the president released his security memo, the Pentagon’s No. 2 civilian official said the National Defense Strategy would not “specifically address climate change.” “It really reflects the high priorities of the department,” Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters at the time. The George W. Bush administration first added climate change to its 32-page National Defense Strategy report in 2008, clearly stating: “[C]hanges with existing and future resource, environmental, and climate pressures may generate new security challenges ... These risks will require managing the divergent needs of massively increasing energy demand to maintain economic development and the need to tackle climate change.”The new strategy contradicts Mattis, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford and four other former top military commanders who were quoted in the defense bill President Donald Trump signed last month saying things such as, “Climate change is a national security issue.” The National Defense Authorization Act devoted roughly 870 words to the “vulnerabilities to military installations” linked to global warming and sea level rise over the next two decades, and warned that climate-linked droughts and famines could lead to more failed states and propagate terrorist organizations.The military began studying climate change as far back as May 1990, when the U.S. Naval War College issued a 73-page report titled “Global Climate Change Implications for the United States.” The report found that Naval operations in the coming half century may be drastically affected by the impact of global climate change.Despite the Bush administration’s official opposition to greenhouse gas regulations, the National Defense University published a report in October 2003 warning that “global warming could have a chilling effect on the military.” That same month, the Defense Department’s Office of Net Assessment drafted a report urging immediate action to prepare for the “not the most likely” but “plausible” scenario in which climate change became a problem.Yet the military remains woefully unprepared. The Naval Station Norfolk, the world’s largest naval base, suffers from routine flooding, even when the sun is shining, and there is no plan in place to fix it, InsideClimate News reported. In one chapter of journalist Jeff Goodell’s new book, “The Water Will Come,” officials at the base admit that they bill efforts to raise docks as maintenance projects without referencing sea level rise. Yet the issue has become impossible to ignore. Phyllis Bayer, Trump’s nominee to oversee Navy facilities, said climate change and sea level rise “is one of my top priorities if confirmed in the job” at a Senate confirmation hearing Thursday. “We can talk about climate change in a variety of ways, but one is sea level rise. And it’s happening, it’s visible and it seems to be accelerating,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said. “I think we need to know where our problems are.”Bayer replied, “Exactly, senator. It’s a real problem.”"

We are here and we are not going anywhere.”Raisman joined more than 100 women who have shared victim impact statements during Nassar’s sentencing hearing in Lansing, Michigan, this week, two months after publicly identifying herself as one of the athletes he abused.Nassar, who faces a sentence of at least 25 years for sexual abuse, delivered a six-page letter to the court on Thursday, saying it had become too difficult for him “mentally” to continue to listen to his victims. “This isn’t worth the paper it’s written on,” county Judge Rosemarie Aquilina responded. “There’s no truth in here. It’s delusional.” Raisman referenced the letter in her statement. “You are pathetic to think any woman would have any sympathy for you,” she said. “You think this is hard for you? Imagine how any of us feels.”The star gymnast, who competed in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, described how she felt “hearing a knock on the door” as “an innocent teenager in a foreign country” and finding Nassar.“You made me uncomfortable and I thought you were weird, but I felt guilty because you were a doctor,” Raisman said. She added: “I wouldn’t allow myself to believe the problem was you.”She said Nassar assured her that his touching, which she described as “inappropriate,” would be helpful, and that he “told on” young women who refused his treatment. Nassar served as a team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University until his firing in 2016. More than 140 women have accused him of sexual abuse. He pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in November. Raisman was joined on Friday by Jordyn Wieber, her teammate on the “Fierce Five” ― the name given to USA gymnasts at the 2012 Olympics. Other members of the Five, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney, also have accused Nassar of abuse. Olympic gymnast Simone Biles has spoken out, too.Wieber’s statement was the first time she spoke publicly about Nassar.“I’m angry with myself for not recognizing the abuse and that’s something I’m struggling with today,” Wieber said. She explained how the doctor used “grooming techniques,” BuzzFeed noted, to make the young female athletes believe he was their friend. “I thought that training for the Olympics would be hardest thing I would ever have to do. But the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do is process that I am a victim of Larry Nassar,” Wieber said.Raisman has spoken out repeatedly about Nassar. In her statement, she again slammed the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics ― which she declared to be “rotting from the inside.” Both groups, she said, were “very quick to capitalize on my success,” while failing to take action against Nassar and issuing “empty” statements.“Talk is cheap,” Raisman said, calling for an independent investigation into how Nassar was allowed to continue working with young athletes over multiple decades. Raisman asked the judge to sentence Nassar to the maximum to that he might have time “replaying the words delivered by this powerful army of survivors.”The hearing is expected to continue into next week to allow more women a chance to speak.

So the correspondents from “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee” ― Ashley Nicole Black, Allana Harkin, Amy Hoggart and Mike Rubens ― have been scrambling to make up for him. Last Wednesday, they kicked off a two-week “Apology Race” tour in an attempt to apologize to the people or communities Trump has offended. In theory, the concept is simple. In practice, however, it’s been a bit more challenging.“Initially, we thought this is going to be really fun, just jumping on trains, planes and automobiles and running around the country,” Harkin told HuffPost. “What we weren’t expecting was how emotional it was going to be.”“It’s one thing when you read something in the newspaper or see an annoying tweet, and another when you come face to face with somebody who is actually directly impacted by the choices or tweets the president makes and writes,” she said.“You feel terrible that they’re going through this and you actually can’t do much more,” Harkin said, adding that it’s “kind of upsetting” to apologize “on behalf of somebody that we personally of course do not agree with.”And not everyone has been willing to accept their apology, she said. Some people want to hear Trump himself say he’s sorry. Fellow correspondent Black said the tour has been an exercise in “stretching my empathy muscles.” “The president of the United States, I promise you, has not lost a minute of sleep thinking about that mother who is trying to figure out how to keep her family together,” she told HuffPost. “Comedians are doing this. It’s stupid.”Black also lightheartedly lamented that Trump had failed to properly offend Oprah Winfrey, whose powerful speech at the Golden Globes led people to speculate that she might be considering a presidential bid. “He’s offended everyone on Earth, but he managed not to insult Oprah, who is the one person I wanted to meet during this process,” she joked.“Apology Race” has gone global ― the only two tour stops the team would confirm were Haiti and Puerto Rico ― but Harkin said the correspondents would have been plenty busy saying “sorry” even if they hadn’t strayed far from home. “There’s so many things we could apologize for, that really in a two-week period we could have stayed in Manhattan,” she said. “Trump actually insults his own country more than he does anybody else. He’s more insulting to the people who live here.”Field producer Tyler Hall also addressed the breakneck speed with which the president has been offering his commentary and insults. “On any given day you open [Trump’s] Twitter [page] and scroll past three outrages, four embarrassing mistakes and a solid blatant lie or two,” he said. “What makes it all the worse is that most of America hates this. Most of America didn’t vote for this, yet it keeps being done in our name.

He faces up to five years in prison.His brother, Marc Sorrentino, also pleaded guilty to aiding the preparation of a false and fraudulent tax return. He faces up to three years in prison.“What the defendants admitted to today, quite simply, is tantamount to stealing money from their fellow taxpayers,” said U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito in a statement.“All of us are required by law to pay our fair share of taxes. Celebrity status does not provide a free pass from this obligation.”In 2011, Mike Sorrentino concealed some of his income to avoid paying more in taxes, making smaller cash deposits into bank accounts so they wouldn’t alert the IRS. His brother, on the other hand, gave his accountants false information and underreported his total income and taxable income in 2010, 2011 and 2012.Despite pleading guilty to his crimes on Friday, the “Jersey Shore” star still took the time to post on Instagram about his upcoming appearance in Miami for the “Jersey Shore Family Vacation” reunion show:The court approved Sorrentino’s request to travel for the show while on probation. His and his brother’s sentencing is set for April 25, when they each face an additional $250,000 fine.The star’s attorneys, Henry E. Klingeman and Kristen M. Santillo, also gave a statement to ET to say that the TV personality is “sober” and ready to live a “productive, law-abiding life.”“Today, Michael Sorrentino has come to terms with mistakes he made at a very different and tumultuous time in his life. He deeply regrets his failure to pay his taxes, and has spent the past several years turning his life into something positive. He has been sober for two years, counseled other young people facing life’s stresses, and has built a stable, loving relationship with his girlfriend Lauren Pesce, who stands by his side,” the statement reads.“The plea terms call for a balance between punishing the wrong committed and conditions that facilitate Mike living a productive, law-abiding life moving forward. Following through on this plea agreement, Michael intends to pay restitution before sentencing. We hope that the Court will consider the totality of the circumstances, including Michael’s minor role in the offense, and impose a fair sentence. In the meantime, he will continue to entertain millions on ‘Jersey Shore’ and thanks everyone who has expressed support.”Onward and upward, Mike. "

He spoke up on Thursday, the same day that Farrow gave her first television interview accusing Allen of sexually assaulting her in 1992, when she was 7 years old.“As a 7-year-old, I would say he touched my private parts,” she told CBS’ Gayle King. “As a 32-year-old, he touched my labia and my vulva with his finger.”The allegations originally came out in the early 1990s during an acrimonious child custody battle between Allen and then-partner actress Mia Farrow. In 2014, Dylan Farrow wrote about the incident in The New York Times, after Allen received a Golden Globe lifetime achievement award.Her allegations have received renewed attention amid the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, with several actors responding that they now regret working with Allen and would not have done so had they fully known about Farrow’s story.But women have disproportionately borne the weight of conversations about sexual misconduct. Firth, for example, is one of the only leading men to speak out about Allen.In October, actor Griffin Newman, who briefly appears in Allen’s forthcoming movie “A Rainy Day in New York,” said that he regretted his decision to work with the director and that he would donate his salary to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN).A number of actresses ― including Mira Sorvino, Greta Gerwig, Ellen Page, Rebecca Hall and Rachel Brosnahan ― have expressed similar sentiments in recent weeks, as has actor David Krumholtz, who had a small role in Allen’s “Wonder Wheel.”“Call Me By Your Name” star Timothée Chalamet, who plays the lead in “A Rainy Day in New York,” said earlier this week that he would donate his salary to the Time’s Up initiative, RAINN and the LGBT Center of New York. Allen has repeatedly denied Farrow’s allegations. Back in the ’90s, he and his defenders said that Farrow had been “coached” by her mother to “smear” Allen. This week, he responded to Farrow’s TV interview by reiterating that claim and suggesting that she is “cynically using the opportunity afforded by the Time’s Up movement to repeat this discredited allegation.”"

But last week, the 37-year-old learned that as far as the U.S. government is concerned, her services will no longer be needed.Guzman has been working legally under what’s known as temporary protected status, a program that has allowed nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to remain in the U.S. since 2001, when their native country was rocked by devastating earthquakes. The Trump administration, which has vowed to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration, announced Jan. 8 that it will end the TPS program for Salvadorans next year, meaning people like Guzman will lose their work permits and face deportation.The U.S. government expects Guzman and her husband to return to a country they haven’t seen in nearly two decades. And if they go, they will have to decide whether to bring their children or leave them behind.“I have never asked anything of the government,” said Guzman, who came to the U.S. in 2000. Seated at a Senate cafeteria table after a recent shift, she spoke in Spanish through an interpreter and at times wiped tears from her face. “We have just worked the whole time. We’re not doing any harm to anybody.”The Washington area is home to an estimated 32,000 TPS holders from El Salvador ― the largest such concentration in the nation. Low-wage Salvadorans with TPS protections serve members of Congress and White House officials every day, whether the latter realize it or not. These workers bus the tables at fancy K Street restaurants. They park the cars in expensive garages. They vacuum the downtown office buildings long after dark. And they pick up the mess left behind at the Senate salad bar.So while the imminent end of TPS has left Salvadorans around the country with wrenching decisions to make, the federal government’s about-face comes with a dose of painful irony for Washington-area workers like Guzman: They’re being given the boot by the political elite for whom they’ve labored many years.“The whole time I have worked ― day and night,” said Maria Fuentes, another TPS recipient from El Salvador who cleans the tables and floors in the Dirksen cafeteria. Like Guzman, Fuentes has spent a decade picking up after Senate power brokers. She has two grown children who also have been shielded by TPS and will face deportation, she said.Although there are no official statistics on how many Salvadoran workers with TPS status are employed on federal properties in and around Washington, the number is “significant,” according to Paco Fabian, a spokesman for Good Jobs Nation, a labor group that’s been organizing low-wage workers employed under federal contracts. That makes the U.S. government as much a beneficiary of TPS labor as many a private janitorial company, construction firm or restaurant.Guzman and Fuentes, who are both members of Good Jobs Nation, said they know other TPS workers inside the Senate buildings as well as at the Supreme Court, just across the street. All of them work for contractors rather than directly for the government, they said.“If they’re good enough to work in federal buildings, and they’re good enough to serve senators and members of Congress, then they should be good enough to stay in this country,” said Fabian.Nationwide, Salvadorans make up more than half of the roughly 300,000 immigrants living in the U.S. under TPS. The White House has already said it is also dropping protections for those from Haiti, Sudan and Nicaragua. Within the next year, it will have to decide the fate of immigrants from Honduras. Aside from TPS, the administration has also ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shielded from deportation young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.The Trump administration notes that TPS protections were never meant to be permanent, and that the earthquakes that plunged El Salvador into chaos happened 17 years ago. But the beneficiaries of the program have put down deep roots in the U.S. after years of working legally ― many of them, like Guzman, raising children who are U.S. citizens and have never set foot in El Salvador.That country’s leaders say it is not prepared for the return of thousands of TPS holders. El Salvador, which has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, is still a dangerous place for many of those who fled. Fuentes said her husband was murdered in El Salvador in 1993. Guzman said she and several family members left after it became clear that her nephew’s life was in danger.Guzman and her husband have had agonizing discussions about breaking up their family. If either or both of them are to be deported, should their three children who are U.S. citizens remain in Washington?Her 6-year-old daughter is worried, she said. “She doesn’t know El Salvador. She doesn’t want to go.”The Trump administration said it expects Salvadorans with TPS to either secure legal residency or leave the country when their protections expire. Neither Guzman nor Fuentes has one of the most promising routes to parole: a child at least 21 years old who is a citizen and can petition for the parent to stay. Immigration advocates are pressuring Congress to provide TPS recipients like them with new protections, such as eligibility for green cards. So far, there are no signs of a bipartisan fix.Both women suspect they will stay in the U.S. until they are forced out. Their predicament hints at a likely scenario for many who can’t secure legal status in the coming months: to remain and work undocumented under the fear of deportation, rather than split up families and return to a country where their connections have frayed.Some of those immigrants will inevitably lose their jobs if the companies they work for won’t employ people without work permits. But that doesn’t mean they’ll leave the labor pool, especially when the economy is humming at full employment, said Abel Nunez, director of D.C.’s Central American Resource Center, a legal aid group for immigrants.“They will lose the ability to be in the formal workforce and go underground,” Nunez said. “They are not leaving. They will have to figure out how to re-engage with the informal work world. They will be more susceptible to abuse and earn lower wages.”“It’s going to be an incredible disruption of family life and economic activity,” he added.Salvadorans constitute a significant chunk of Washington’s construction and hospitality workforces. That means with the end of TPS, many employers will have to train new workers to fill the roles of the experienced ones they lay off. Even jobs commonly thought of as “unskilled” still require skills, and someone who has prepped and cleaned the salad bar in the Senate basement for years is probably pretty good at it.“They need us here to do this work,” Guzman said."

This is particularly important when creating change, Dawson added, since people who feel discounted in one aspect of their lives are often less likely to speak up when they’re discounted in other areas.“I was raped and molested as a child, so for me the world was like that since I was a child,” she told hosts Cindy Rodriguez and Nathalie Farfan in the podcast episode, which was published Wednesday. “So when I saw it at the workplace, it wasn’t foreign to me. It was like, well, that even happens within family. It happens with people that are supposed to take care of you when you’re a child.”Dawson said that although she’s spoken out against sexual harassment in the past, the issue is “insidious” and harassment is not a “binary, man/woman thing,” but about people abusing power. The actress has been a vocal participant in the #MeToo online movement since it began last year and has supported Hollywood’s Time’s Up movement, launched to combat workplace harassment and inequality. The 38-year-old actress also spoke to Morado Lens about her spiritual journey, including what changed after finding her 26-year-old cousin Vaneza Ines Vasquez unresponsive in her Los Angeles home in May. Vasquez was pronounced dead at the hospital. “[When] my grandma died at 75, it put this really gloomy future ahead of us, like wow, we only have but so many years left if you live as long as Mima did,” she explained. “But when Vaneza died, it was like, oh my god, regardless of how well I’ve spent these years, I’ve already got 12 more years of life than Vaneza will ever have. And I think what it really did was give me back my gratitude.”She continued: “Whenever my moment comes, I wanna know that it’s been a good life. I don’t wanna be marinated in the upset ― because I have a lot trauma and sadness to dwell on if I want to ― but there’s so much beauty and so many things to be grateful for. And I don’t want to waste my time not being dedicated to that.”Dawson first broke her silence about her cousin’s death during an interview with the BUILD series in May. “I’ve been dealing with a lot of loss lately and reconnecting with my family and my friends in a different way,” she said at the time. “I’m realizing how much I’ve pulled myself back, and I’ve been just really humbled by this opportunity tonight.”Hear Morado Lens’ full interview with Rosario Dawson below or on iTunes.

Fernando Karadima. Instead, Francis accused the victims of slandering a bishop they claimed had protected the priest, The Associated Press reported.At least one of Karadima’s victims said Bishop Juan Barros watched while he was abused.A number of parishioners have accused Karadima of sexually assaulting them when they were teens, beginning in the 1980s. In 2011, the church “sentenced” the cleric to a lifetime of penance and prayer for his sins. A judge also found charges against Karadima credible. But too much time had elapsed since the crimes, and the authorities were unable to file criminal charges against him.Although victims and victims rights advocates have attacked Barros for allegedly covering up for Karadima, the Vatican has continued to embrace the controversial bishop. In 2015, Pope Francis appointed Barros to head the diocese of Osorno in south-central Chile.“The day someone brings me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk,” Francis told ADN radio before celebrating mass near the Chilean city of Iquique. “But there is not one single piece of evidence. It is all slander. Is that clear?”On Tuesday, the pope publicly apologized for sexual abuse involving the clergy. He said he felt “pained and ashamed” over the “irreparable damage” caused by the abuse, but he did not meet with Karadima’s victims.The church is losing its influence in the nation, Reuters reported. A new poll by Santiago-based think tank Latinobarometro showed that the number of Chileans calling themselves Catholics fell from 74 percent in 1995 to 45 percent last year.At least eight Catholic churches have been attacked in Chile over the past week."

Zeta-Jones argued that she herself doesn’t look Welsh, and noted that she’s played Hispanic characters before.“This is just the way I see it, and people can take what they want from it: I am a Welsh actress, who doesn’t happen to look like what you think someone from Wales would look like,” she told EW. “I have my own language; I speak Welsh. And so, for me to wait for a role that is fit for the way I look physically, that is not a Welsh role, where I don’t use my accent ― I never use my accent. Have you ever heard me use my accent that I’m speaking with right now?”Criticism over whitewashing, it should be noted, has less to do with nationality and appearance, and more to do with Hollywood’s pervasive habit of passing over actors of color and casting white actors in non-white roles. The issue is further complicated by the lack of multi-dimensional Latino lead roles in the industry. At any rate, true on-screen representation is not achieved by casting a white actress who can pass as what the industry believes Latinas look like (particularly when depictions of Latinos in film and TV often ignore the community’s incredible diversity).Still, the 48-year-old star pointed to previous roles in which she portrayed Hispanic women while defending her portrayal of Blanco.“This happens to be the third Hispanic I’ve played,” Zeta-Jones said. “I played the lead in ‘Zorro,’ and I screen-tested with six Hispanic women, and I got the role. I don’t know what to say. And I was a complete unknown at this point; it wasn’t because I had a name or box-office value. Four of the actresses are my contemporaries to this day.”“I played a woman of Spanish descent in ‘Traffic’ as well,” she added. “I have to take [the roles] I believe I can embody. I can’t be the person to fight against a very big issue, and I won’t take on that role. There have been so many actors who have played ‘against type.’ That’s sort of what we do.”However, the star did add that she is “all for diversity” and wants to see more people of color behind the camera. Zeta-Jones has faced backlash for portraying Blanco, one of the most notable figures of the Medellin Cartel and a pioneer in the Miami-based cocaine trade. “Cocaine Godmother,” directed by Guillermo Navarro, depicts the rise and fall of the drug lord, who was killed in 2012 at age 69.In the film’s trailer, Zeta-Jones portrays the ruthless Blanco with a thick accent. People have expressed their anger online about the casting choice."

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said a short-term spending bill is on shaky ground. “At this point, if the vote were to happen today, there’s not the votes to fund it with Republican-only votes.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5fedb01f00009a00db947b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Lawmakers appeared a little closer Wednesday to passing yet another short-term spending bill to keep the government open, but as Senate Democrats looked increasingly likely to cave, conservatives in the House looked increasingly likely to fight ― or at least get some concessions. And depending on what demands GOP leaders give in to, those changes could still throw the Senate into chaos and the government into a shutdown.House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) emerged from a meeting with Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) on Wednesday night saying House Republicans don’t yet have the votes to pass another short-term spending fix, called a continuing resolution (CR).“At this point, if the vote were to happen today, there’s not the votes to fund it with Republican-only votes,” Meadows told reporters Wednesday night.Still, Meadows said they were making “good progress,” and he expected leadership to have some accommodation for conservatives. The Freedom Caucus is pushing for leadership to take the monthlong CR and add military funding for the rest of the year ― or, at least, to fund some parts of the military for a longer period of time. And if leadership can’t get that, conservatives sound open to supplying some votes if leadership puts on the floor a hard-line immigration bill sponsored by Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and pushes to get it passed.“I haven’t made that formal request,” Meadows said earlier in the day of giving the immigration bill a vote, “but certainly if they were to come and say they were going to pass the Goodlatte bill and put that on the floor tomorrow, I think a whole lot of my members would be willing to vote for that. Sure.”Meadows said later Wednesday, after his meeting with McHenry, that conservatives wanted more than just a vote on that Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration bill, which would include approval of a border wall, a change in family reunification immigration and then end of the diversity visa lottery. But he was clear earlier that a commitment from GOP leaders to pass that bill would be a “strong influencing factor” in winning over Freedom Caucus votes for the CR.House leadership is in a bind right now because, about two days before a government shutdown, they still don’t have the votes to pass this government funding bill. (When a reporter asked Meadows how many Republicans were against the current legislation, Meadows said he didn’t know leadership’s whip count, “I just know mine.”)With current vacancies and GOP absences, Republicans look like they can lose only 21 votes and still pass the CR if every Democrat withholds their vote until Republicans put up a passing number.“There’s certainly more noes and undecideds than 21 right now,” Meadows told HuffPost.McHenry spent much of Wednesday trying to find the votes by meeting with members on and off the House floor. With Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) out for surgery, McHenry has been tasked with finding the votes for a fourth continuing resolution in a fiscal year that began in October.That perpetual game of kick-the-can has already angered many defense hawks, with Reps. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) and Rob Wittman (R-Va.) voting against the CR at the end of December. Now McHenry is trying to keep the defense hawks in line yet again while also brokering a deal with conservatives that could imperil the legislation in the Senate.Senate Democrats are already shaky about this current CR, but some have signaled they would support the measure to avoid a government shutdown. “I just don’t think there’s any way in the world that anyone should be talking about shutting down the government,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) told reporters Wednesday.That support might waver, however, if House Republicans begin attaching longer-term military funding to the bill in an effort to break the tie between defense and non-defense caps. Former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) suggested that, if House Republicans could send a bill with additional military funding to the Senate, it would be tough on the most vulnerable Democrats to oppose that bill, which in turn could force more Democrats to support it.“I mean, really, does Joe Donnelly want the government to shut down because he wants amnesty for people who came to this country illegally?” Jordan said Wednesday, referring to the moderate Democratic senator from Indiana who supports deportation protections for immigrants who were brought here as children. “I don’t think so.”There may be some truth to vulnerable Democrats feeling the pinch with a revised bill, but if House Republicans push too far, Senate Democrats won’t have too much trouble voting no and blaming it on Republicans, who control the House, Senate and White House.At the same time, if Republicans were unable to advance any bill out of the House ― where only a simple majority is required to pass a bill ― it’d be fair to say a government shutdown is entirely the fault of Republicans.That’s the balancing act facing GOP leaders. They want to pass the most Republican bill that Senate Democrats would approve while avoiding a showdown in which Democrats reject the legislation. Democrats also have their own considerations. They don’t want to be blamed for a government shutdown over what wasn’t included in the bill.Still, Democrats have repeatedly held off on a real battle with Republicans over DACA, and most Democrats apparently believe it’s unacceptable to continue pushing this immigration fight down the road.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Wednesday that no one at the Democrats’ weekly lunch meeting wanted to support the current short-term spending bill. If that’s the case, we’re headed for a government shutdown anyway. It’s just difficult to see that sort of statement, for now, as anything but posturing. Yes, Democrats want a DACA deal. No, they don’t want another CR. But a shutdown over a bill that is a government funding extension is a precedent Democrats would probably also like to avoid. And Republicans have their own interest in making sure a lapse in government funding doesn’t occur, particularly when they control all the levers of government.The closer lawmakers actually get to midnight Friday, the more willingness there may be on either side to negotiate. With so little time and the universe of compromises narrowing, though, Congress could easily find itself in a government shutdown that no one really wanted and hardly anyone really expected.Elise Foley contributed to this report."

His comments were confirmed by Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.), who was at the meeting.“I can confirm that Chief of Staff Kelly said today that the President’s campaign was not fully informed about the wall he was promising to voters,” Gutiérrez said in a statement. “Kelly went on to say that many campaigns are not fully informed about every policy and that campaigning and governing are two different things and that governing is harder.”Gutiérrez also went on to confirm reporting by The New York Times that Kelly took credit as the “one who tempered” Trump’s more extreme opinions on the wall and the viability of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals initiative, also known as DACA.“Kelly took credit for educating the President on the wall and that a concrete barrier from sea to shining sea was no longer the conception of border security barriers supported today by the White House,” Gutiérrez said.But Trump on Thursday dismissed reports he’d softened his stance, tweeting that the wall “has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it” and that it “will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico.”During the meeting, Kelly said he was optimistic about the prospect of a DACA deal and that the president was “committed to a permanent solution,” according to the Post. Kelly later told reporters that he believed an agreement would “be worked out” by Congress. The comments put one of Trump’s most senior aides at odds with the president’s recent statements continuing to stump his wall. Trump insisted that Mexico would still pay for the construction in an interview last week with The Wall Street Journal, although he clarified that it would pay “indirectly” through the North American Free Trade Agreement.“[Mexico] can pay for it indirectly through NAFTA,” Trump told the Journal. “We make a good deal on NAFTA, and, say, I’m going to take a small percentage of that money and it’s going toward the wall. Guess what? Mexico’s paying.”"

The first offense is a misdemeanor, carrying a sentence of up to six months in jail. Getting caught again can lead to felony “illegal re-entry” charges, with sentences of up to 20 years, depending on the person’s criminal record. In practice, most people serve much shorter terms and are then deported. Those prosecutions aren’t supposed to apply to asylum-seekers. When someone declares a fear of returning to their home country, those words are supposed to trigger a referral to an asylum officer to establish whether the claim is legitimate ― even if the person crosses illegally into the United States. Those claims are heard by the civil immigration system, not the criminal courts.Those rules haven’t changed since Donald Trump was elected president, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection told HuffPost in an email.“Every individual encountered who is a candidate for removal is asked if they have a fear of returning to their country,” the spokesman said. “CBP officers do not determine or evaluate the validity of the fear expressed.”Last year, agents referred nearly 55,000 immigrants who said they feared returning to their home countries to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, according to CBP. That figure includes people arrested by Border Patrol as well as people who tried to cross through legal ports of entry. But Human Rights First says the agency routinely violates that policy in practice. In a survey of 39 defense lawyers who handle such cases carried out by the group, 48 percent said asylum-seekers made up about half of their clients. All of the respondents said they had represented at least one asylum-seeker prosecuted for illegal entry or re-entry. Some lawyers said they had received Border Patrol arrest reports with the words “Credible Fear Claim” stamped on them. A “credible fear” interview is one of the first steps toward applying for asylum.“This administration has been painting asylum-seekers and really all immigrants as criminals,” Olga Byrne, one of the report’s authors, told HuffPost. “And by referring people for prosecution ― including people who previously had no contact with the criminal justice system ― the administration is essentially creating the kinds of statistics they want to put out to the public, that immigrants are criminals.”The HRF report ― which was based on observation of more than 700 prosecutions across eight federal courts from April 2017 to this month ― cites dozens of cases of people crossing into the U.S. to ask for humanitarian protection, only to find themselves in a group hearing facing expedited criminal charges instead. One woman from Honduras said she fled death threats and asked for asylum, according to the report. A Mexican man said he feared returning to his home country because his sexual orientation exposed him to violence. A Venezuelan couple who said they faced threats from the government in their home country were charged with illegal entry and separated from their 15-year-old daughter in the process. Since the advent of a 2005 program called “Operation Streamline,” immigration prosecutions have grown to swallow up a massive share of the federal criminal docket. Immigration prosecutions consistently accounted for about half of the federal criminal docket during the Obama administration. The number of people prosecuted on illegal entry and re-entry charges has declined steadily since 2013, however. Last fiscal year, which began in October and included Trump’s first eight months in office, federal immigration prosecutions fell 14 percent compared to the year before, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.Those numbers are dropping because illegal crossings themselves have plummeted to the lowest levels seen since the 1970s. A greater share of those who do cross into the United States are people who say they are fleeing the violence-plagued Central American countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Before Trump took office, it was not unknown for people to face prosecution for immigration violations. HuffPost observed at least three cases in October 2016 for a report about such prosecutions.But the authors of the HRF report contend that the phenomenon is becoming more common under the Trump administration, which has criticized the asylum system and urged prosecutors to prioritize immigration prosecutions, even as illegal crossings drop. In April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued guidance to all 94 U.S. attorneys asking them to prosecute illegal re-entry charges more aggressively. (Anyone with a deportation on his or her record can be charged with illegal re-entry, even if the arrest occurs outside the U.S.-Mexico border region.)Within three months, prosecutors in Tucson, Arizona, had already begun charging dozens of first-time crossers per day with illegal entry misdemeanors ― a practice the court had not seen in years. Prior to Sessions’ directive, prosecutors in the Tucson area had usually only filed criminal charges against people who had been caught crossing illegally in the past. Sessions has also criticized U.S. asylum laws, claiming that Central American migrants game the system.The Trump administration is facing a lawsuit in federal court over allegations that CBP agents have systematically barred asylum-seeking migrants from crossing into the U.S. at legal ports of entry, in violation of both U.S. law and international treaty obligations.

20,POLITICS,Trump Administration Highlights Violence Against Women -- To Blame Immigrants For It,Melissa Jeltsen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-violence-women-immigrants_us_5a5fc644e4b046f0811cc509,A new report uses misleading data to link immigrants with gender-based crimes.,2018-01-18,"There's no evidence that so-called honor killings are a problem in the U.S., but domestic violence is.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a60a183220000251ab4f0d6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than 1,000 U.S. women are killed by their husbands, boyfriends or former partners each year. But that’s not the number we should pay attention to, according to the Trump administration. Americans, the administration suggests, should instead focus on a small subset of those crimes: the ones committed by immigrants.That’s the argument behind a report ordered by President Donald Trump in March and released Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department. The report, which highlights crimes committed by immigrants, shines a new light “on acts of gender-based violence,” the White House said. Trump, as part of his executive order blocking citizens from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., tasked the government with collecting data on gender-based crimes committed by foreign nationals and releasing it to the public. But the report he commissioned doesn’t accurately describe the gender-based violence it focuses on. Instead, it offers misleading statistics that provide zero evidence that immigrants are any more likely than anyone else to commit crimes against U.S. women.“The report does two things. First, it sensationalizes a very small percentage of gender-based violence cases to feed into the centuries-old fallacy of violence against women, the fallacy being that this happens only to white women by ‘the other,’” explained Ruth Glenn, executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. “Secondly, it is also a severe marginalization of women of all backgrounds, classes, colors, and cultures who have endured (and continue to endure) suffering for being women by men of all backgrounds, classes, colors and cultures.”Take the example of so-called honor killings, crimes in which women are murdered by relatives who claim the victims shamed the family name, which the report highlights. Globally, an estimated 5,000 “honor killings” occur each year, mainly concentrated in countries in the Middle East, North Africa and Asia.As evidence of the prevalence of “honor killings” in the U.S., the report cites a study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which “estimated that an average of 23-27 honor killings occur every year.” But those figures, according to the bureau’s study, are drawn from unpublished research that applied U.S. demographic characteristics to another country’s honor killing statistics ― a method the researcher himself called “not terribly scientific.”Many “honor killings” look indistinguishable from what are usually called domestic violence homicides in the U.S. For instance, in 2015, nearly 1,100 women were killed in “honor killings” in Pakistan. One of the main causes of honor killings was domestic disputes, according to a report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. In the majority of the cases, the perpetrators were current or former spouses of the victims, just like in domestic killings in the U.S., and most women were killed with a gun, same as here.It is unclear how Trump’s administration plans to track gender-based crimes committed by immigrants. Neither the Justice Department nor Homeland Security responded to HuffPost’s repeated requests for information over the course of six months. On its face, tracking the crimes is daunting, as domestic violence, a form of gender-based violence, is extremely common in the U.S. The report acknowledges this difficulty, noting that there are an average of 1.3 million non-fatal domestic violence victimizations in the U.S. annually, and no way of knowing how many are perpetrated by foreign nationals, as most jurisdictions don’t note the immigration status of the offender in records of crimes.The Justice Department is “committed to working with our law enforcement partners to determine the best way to report these statistics,” an official told HuffPost on Wednesday.The Trump administration report also features a section on forced marriages that has come under fire from the organization that performed the research it cites. The report states that approximately “1,500 forced marriages occur every year” in the U.S. But Tahirih Justice Center, which collected the data, says the statistic is being presented incorrectly. The nonprofit in 2011 surveyed legal and social services providers about their clients in the previous two years, and counted 3,000 cases of forced marriages. A 2014 Bureau of Justice Statistics study cut this figure in half to come up with an estimate of 1,500 cases of forced marriages per year. That’s inaccurate, Tahirih Justice Center says, because its research only tallied people who had experienced forced marriages ― but not when or where those marriages occurred. They could have taken place outside the two-year period of its study, or in places outside the U.S.“It’s hypocritical for this administration to try to justify its restrictionist immigration policies by pointing to gender-based violence,” said Archi Pyati, chief of policy at Tahirih Justice Center. “In fact, the immigration policies of this administration are leaving immigrant victims more vulnerable.”It’s important to gather data on the prevalence and motivations for violence against women and girls to ensure that adequate resources go to victim services and prevention, Pyatti added. “But it has to be inclusive, expansive, and approach the issue with one goal: to end violence against all women, not to vilify particular groups.” "
21,IMPACT,The Clean Energy Transition Will Transform Our Economy Beyond Recognition,"L. Hunter Lovins, ContributorPresident Natural Capitalism Solutions, Professor of Sustainab...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/renewables-storage-electric-vehicles-global-economy_us_5a5f8997e4b054e35176a473,Are we ready?,2018-01-18,"Workers from Wuhan Guangsheng Photovoltaic Company install solar panels on the roof of a building in Wuhan, China. In August, China announced it had already eclipsed its 2020 goal in solar installations.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5f91f01e00003d00c97cae.jpeg?cache=rezqAtZ9OS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In November 2013, more than 15,000 scientists reissued a warning to humanity of “widespread misery and catastrophic biodiversity loss” unless business-as-usual changed. “By failing to adequately limit population growth, reassess the role of an economy rooted in growth, reduce greenhouse gases, incentivize renewable energy, protect habitat, restore ecosystems, curb pollution, halt defaunation, and constrain invasive alien species, humanity is not taking the urgent steps needed to safeguard our imperilled biosphere,” they wrote.Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres and physicist Stefan Rahmstorf last year warned that the world has approximately three years before the worst effects of climate change become inevitable. In an open letter they urged companies, communities, countries and citizens to cut carbon emissions now, arguing that failure means fires, floods, droughts, rising sea levels, extreme weather, agricultural losses and massive insurance costs. Between 2008 and 2016, climate related disasters displaced 21.5 million people.Humanity is in a horse race with catastrophe. The good news is that we are in the race. But even if we win, it will change our economy beyond recognition. We have the technologies to solve the worst of the crises facing us, and buy the time to deal with the rest. Back in 2009, Stanford scientist Dr. Mark Jacobson said that renewable energy could power the entire world by 2030. His Solutions Project calculated how to do this for every state in the U.S. and many countries. More recently, scholars like Christian Breyer have shown how to do this with photovoltaics alone.Stanford Professor Tony Seba argues that not only is the transition to renewables possible, it is inevitable.In his book Clean Disruption Seba describes how the convergence of disruptive technologies and business models makes a renewable world inevitable. He focuses on four factors: the fall in the cost of solar energy, the fall in the cost of storage (batteries), the rise of the electric vehicle, and the advent of the driverless car. These innovations, he argues, by delivering renewably powered, electric vehicle transit as a service will be ten times cheaper than current private ownership of internal combustion cars. In the process, the shift to EVs will move us to a completely renewable energy system.He reminds doubters that experts totally underestimated sales of mobile phones. In the 1990s, McKinsey told ATT to expect 900,000 mobile subscribers by the year 2000. They were off by 108 million. By 2014 there were more mobile phones on earth than the seven billion people, increasing five times faster than humans.A new solar array goes up in the U.S. every 150 seconds, but can the whole world be renewable by 2030?In August, China announced it had already eclipsed its 2020 goal in solar installations. It now adds 45 gigaWatts of solar every year (more than the entire installed solar capacity of Germany). California predicted it will hit its declared 2030 target of getting 50 percent of its power from renewable energy by 2020. The state is now debating resetting the goal to 100 percent renewable power. More than 100 companies have set such a goal. A thousand cities, too.Why? Because the cost of solar is falling rapidly. In October Saudi Arabia announced the new world record low price in an auction bid: 1.7¢/kWh. When the Kentucky Coal Museum puts solar on its roof rather than plug into the coal fired electric grid at its doorstep, you know that the fossil era is over.So we can run our society on solar energy, but what if the sun isn’t shining or the wind blowing?Storage technology to make renewable energy available 24/7 is only in its infancy as an industry, but its prices are falling, too.When the Aliso Canyon natural gas well blew out, spewing 100,000 metric tons of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, the local utility feared it would be unable to keep lights on in Southern California. In record time, Tesla and others brought online more than 70 megawatts of energy storage at a price cheaper than building a new gas peaking plant, and vastly faster.In late 2016 the Financial Times reported that Fitch Ratings warned: “Widespread adoption of battery-powered vehicles is a serious threat to the oil industry,” noting that transport accounted for 55 percent of total oil use in 2014. In the U.S. it accounted for 71 percent of oil use, according to 2016 figures.It endangers the banks, as well: a quarter of all corporate debt, perhaps as much as $3.4 trillion, is related to utility and car company bonds that are tied to fossil fuel use.Anyone doubting this risk must have been sobered when, in September 2017, China announced it was going to phase out internal combustion vehicles. Given that China represents a quarter of the global automobile market, this – coupled with India, France, the UK, and Norway making similar announcements – is an existential crisis for both the oil and car industries.About a week after China’s announcement, Jerry Brown, the Governor of California, the world’s fifth largest economy, asked Mary Nichols, head of the state’s Air Resources Board, whether California could do the same. Two days later she said yes. Two days later Jerry said then we will. That was a Friday.On the Monday, General Motors, which had reclaimed its coveted status of the world’s leading automobile manufacturer on the strength of its Bolt electric car, announced that its future is electric. Meanwhile, Daimler, Volkswagen and Volvo have committed to electrifying their entire product portfolios.In November, Elon released an all-electric long haul truck, and China announced the launch of the world’s first all-electric cargo ship.We’re three for three on Seba’s predictions. But in Seba’s scenario it’s the autonomous electric vehicle (AEV) that drives the real reduction in cost he claims will make the disruption inevitable. Are AEVs more than just science fiction?To get the straight story, I talked to Tom Chi, the head of Product Experience at Google X and one of the designers of the self-driving Google car.“Within ten years?” asked Tom. “Easy.” Tesla, he said, released its driverless vehicle when it was as safe as a human driven car. Remember, hundreds of thousands of people die every year in car crashes. Teslas have driven more than 5 billion miles in autonomous mode, en route to the company’s 10 billion mile safety proof point. In fact, all Teslas are now capable of full autonomous mode. The Google car has driven four million real miles, and 2.5 billion simulated miles. GM just announced that it is pivoting its business model to offer autonomous electric vehicle Transit as a Service by 2019.Does that make it four for four? Is Tony right?You decide. But realize that if the evidence laid out here is true, it has profound implications for everything. It will mean the dissolution in value, likely complete loss of the oil, gas, coal, uranium, nuclear, utility, auto industries, the banks that hold the loan paper for all of these companies and the pension funds and insurance companies that are invested in them.It will mean an economic collapse on a scale never seen coming at us within about 10 years.Consider oil. In 2011, Carbon Tracker calculated that at least 80 percent of the fossil deposits still in the ground would have to stay in the ground if the world is to avoid warming beyond 2C more that pre-industrial levels.Given that those fossil assets are on the balance sheets of some of the world’s wealthiest companies and form the basis of the sovereign wealth funds of many nations around the world, John Fullerton of the Capital Institute predicted that this implied a write-off of at least $20 trillion dollars. In contrast, Fullerton warned, the 2008 financial collapse was triggered by the stranding of only $2.7 trillion in mortgage assets.What can be done?It appears unwise to have any of your assets in the industries that will be disrupted. Bevis Longstreth, former Securities and Exchange Commissioner, observed: “It is entirely plausible, even predictable, that continuing to hold equities in fossil fuel companies will be ruled negligence.”Where does your energy come from? Are you dependent on an industry that is at risk? Millions of people, communities and cities are going 100 percent renewable.Is your job at risk? Companies will either become part of the solution, or they won’t be a problem because they won’t be around. The emerging industries are creating millions of jobs, but millions are at risk. Will we substitute a Universal Basic Income? Will we descend into unimaginable darkness? Or will we create a Finer Future?Either way, we will totally transform the global economy. The crises we face and the inevitabilities of change described here will drive this change.For more content and to be part of HuffPost’s new economy community join our Facebook Group. "

During her work with the commission, which the 41-year-old set up shortly before her death, Cox had called for the appointment of such a minister, Reuters reported.“Jo would be over the moon,” her husband, Brendan Cox, tweeted.According to statistics published in a report by the foundation in 2017, more than 9 million adults in the U.K. report feeling often or always lonely. For 3.6 million people aged 65 or older, it found, television is considered the main form of company.But the harmful impact of loneliness is more than psychological. Having weak social connections is considered to be as damaging to one’s health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, according to Brigham Young University Psychology Professor Julianne Holt Lunstad.“There is robust evidence that social isolation and loneliness significantly increase risk for premature mortality and the magnitude of the risks exceeds that of many leading health indicators,” Lunstad is quoted as saying in the Jo Cox Commission’s report. “The challenge we now face is what can be done about it.”Former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has also expressed concern about the effects of loneliness on health. In an article in the Harvard Business Review last year, he wrote that it can be associated “with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, depression and anxiety.”Like in the U.K., Murthy considers loneliness to be a growing health epidemic in the United States, with more than 40 percent of adults there reporting that they feel lonely — though he noted that that number could be even higher.Among those who are disabled or take care of the disabled, loneliness is particularly stark, research suggests.More than half of all disabled people in the U.K. experience loneliness, with it being more prominent among younger individuals. Eight out of 10 caregivers have also felt lonely or isolated as a result of looking after a loved one, according to the Jo Cox Commission’s report.“Many of the barriers to disabled people making friends and meeting people are practical, such as the need for accessible transport and buildings, financial support and appropriate social care,” Richard Kramer, CEO of the U.K. disability charity Sense, told HuffPost UK.“A lack of understanding and awareness of disability is also a significant obstacle to making connections and forming friendships,” he said.Read more here about other suggested measures that governments can take to tackle loneliness, according to five organizations that fight it in the U.K."
23,WORLD NEWS,"The United Nations Has Its Own Sexual Harassment Problem, New Report Says",Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/united-nations-sexual-harassment-assault_us_5a60f836e4b05085db6099ea,A new story sheds light on the systematic issues it says allow sexual harassment and abuse to go largely unchecked.,2018-01-18,"A new report from The Guardian details the stories of 15 people who worked for the U.N. and said it maintained a ""culture of silence"" surrounding sexual harassment and abuse. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a60f9a51f00003c00db9685.jpeg?cache=HJ14kdbl25&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sexual harassment and assault have run rampant at United Nations offices around the world, with victims afraid to come forward and perpetrators rarely punished, according to a new report.In a story published Thursday by The Guardian, 15 current and former female U.N. staffers, who remained anonymous, said they had experienced harassment or assault in the past five years. Seven of the women said they had reported the offenses, which ranged from verbal harassment to rape.Dozens of other current and former employees told The Guardian they had witnessed “a culture of silence” at the organization, where victims fear they will risk retaliation at worst or inaction at best if they come forward about alleged assaults.One woman, who alleged she was harassed by a supervisor while working for the World Food Programme, said it’s an “unsaid” rule that coming forward will mean ending your career.Another woman, an aid worker who said she was harassed by a senior U.N. employee, said she received threats after trying to formally report the offense. “I had threats, sent through friends, that ‘She will never set foot in this office again,’” she said.The U.N. press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement to The Guardian, a representative said the organization’s secretary general, António Guterres, has “prioritized addressing sexual harassment and upholding the zero tolerance policy.” The organization further pledged to “look at strengthening our capacities to investigate reports and to support victims.” The international humanitarian organization has long faced scrutiny for abuses committed both internally and against civilians in countries where peacekeepers are installed. The international nature of the organization of some 44,000 employees makes it difficult to establish a centralized system for tackling abuse, The Guardian noted. Many senior staff enjoy diplomatic immunity and those who don’t may be working in countries with dysfunctional judicial systems.A 2015 report from the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the U.N.’s internal watchdog, noted: “Very few victims have been assisted due to lack of dedicated funding and the slow enforcement process.”The U.N. tracks allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse against U.N. staff, and even features a real-time table of the reported offenses on its website. It also lays out prevention, enforcement and remedial measures aimed at addressing the problem.The organization acknowledges on its site: “When United Nations personnel commit acts of sexual exploitation and abuse against the very people who look to the Organization for protection and assistance, the trust between the UN and its beneficiaries is undermined.”"
24,QUEER VOICES,'RuPaul's Drag Race' Stars Open Up About Mental Health And The Toll Of Superstardom,James Michael Nichols,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rupauls-drag-race-mental-health_us_5a60d92ee4b01b82649d8594,Fan favorite Katya sparked a much-needed dialogue after announcing a yearlong career break.,2018-01-18,"The cast of the third season of ""RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a60f0e71f00009a00db966f.jpeg?cache=YF03TaIQ3a&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When “RuPaul’s Drag Race” megastar Katya went live on Instagram Monday and announced, in French, that she would be taking a hiatus from drag, fans were caught off guard.Katya, who has been transparent about issues surrounding mental health and addiction since first appearing on Season 7 of “Drag Race” in 2015, rocketed to fame as one of the leading stars of the drag universe in recent months. As one of the stars on Viceland’s “The Trixie & Katya Show” and the headliner for a (now postponed) European tour, Katya was in high demand.“Health is the most important thing for me ... I’m OK,” she told fans on Monday, speaking about the hiatus. “I’m not dying because I want to live. But I need to take vacations, like a normal person. The people who are listening will understand, can understand.”For several of the contestants on the upcoming season of “RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,” Katya’s moment of vulnerability is an entry point into a difficult, but necessary, conversation about mental health in the LGBTQ community.After successfully building a brand and fan following while appearing on “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” artists often face unique challenges.Between being a role model for marginalized youth and juggling intense touring schedules, fan meet-and-greets, social media and the pressures of working in environments where drugs and alcohol are readily available, this career path is one that requires extreme balance and self-care.“I personally have dealt with major depression and anxiety my entire life. But I’m very vocal about it,” drag star Thorgy Thor, who appeared on Season 8 of “Drag Race,” told HuffPost. “I’ve come to a point in my life where when things become a little too much, it’s time to take a step back.”“Look at what we do for a living! Every day, all day — we never sleep, we perform, people expect us in the subway to ‘turn on the fun’ when we don’t feel like it or we’re just shopping at the grocery store,” Thor added. “You have to be on all of the time! Especially within a gay spectrum as an entertainer, you go fucking crazy. But you have to know when it’s enough. I don’t — but Katya does.”As The Guardian’s Alexander Leon put it in May 2017, “mental illness and being queer [often] go hand in hand.” LGBTQ youth are three times more likely to commit suicide than their heterosexual counterparts, and nearly half of transgender people struggle with anxiety and depression. This is due to several factors, including “societal stigma, discrimination, and denial of their civil and human rights,” according to nonprofit Mental Health America.When the realities of queerness and mental health are combined with the pressures of fame, the full picture of “Drag Race” success becomes a bit more complicated.“This industry is about being alone and pushing your physical limits and pushing your creative limits,” Season 7 contestant Trixie Mattel told HuffPost. “And the pressures of people saying ‘I love you.‘ Every time someone says ‘I love you,’ it’s like you’re putting another dime in the piggy bank and the piggy bank gets heavier.”Mattel said the pressure is increased for contestants grappling with mental health issues. For those contestants, she said, ”‘Drag Race’ is sort of like trying to lift weights — like, 50 pounds, when you should’ve been lifting 20.”“But for Katya, I think she’s still finding balance,” Mattel added. “She’s taking basically the year off. I think she’ll come back to drag, but she’ll come back in sort of a substitute teacher sense, where she shows up when she wants and then she goes back to sleep when she wants. She’s going to be our new Halley’s comet of drag.”For competitors Chi Chi Devayne and BenDeLaCreme, the emerging conversation about mental health and queer performers hits close to home ― one they both see as an issue that needs to be humanized and talked about more.“I can totally relate, because this is something that I’ve been talking about for the past few weeks,” Chi Chi, who first appeared on Season 8, told HuffPost. “Sometimes you do feel like this is all going to drive you crazy — especially when you come from a small town like me, just a normal person everyday, and then you’re shoved into this limelight where everybody knows you.”Season 6′s BenDeLaCreme told HuffPost she hopes that, thanks to Katya starting this conversation for her many young fans, other influential queer people will begin to be open about their own experiences surrounding mental health and LGBTQ identity ― and that the dialogue will help break down societal stigma. “In general, I think mental health is an issue that we don’t talk openly or honestly enough about,” she said. “I think although more and more people are really speaking up on these issues and making it less taboo, so many people are afraid to talk about it in the first person or are afraid to bring it into our own lives.”“The reality is [that] this touches, I would dare to say, most of us in some way or another,” she added.“RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars” premieres on Thursday, Jan. 25, at 8 p.m. ET on VH1."
25,IMPACT,Here's What Happened When A Nigerian State Appointed A ‘Minister Of Happiness’,"Emmanuel Akinwotu, On Assignment For HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/minister-of-happiness-nigeria_us_5a5f1c34e4b00a7f171bd8b9,"""Ministries of happiness can work in societies where people don't have to worry about fuel shortages or erratic electricity supply.""",2018-01-18,"Rochas Okorocha, governor of Imo state, shakes hands with King Godwin Gininwa during the launch of an oil pollution cleanup. Okorocha has appointed a minister for happiness.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5f4d771e00003d00c97bb5.jpeg?cache=YpWwTDv2qB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A tiny but densely populated state in southeast Nigeria has created a Department for Happiness and Purpose Fulfillment, the first of its kind in the country. The new department in Imo state, which will sit alongside conventional departments such as health and education, has a remit to improve the well-being of the state’s 4 million people. Yet far from being seen as a novel policy direction, it has been widely derided in Nigeria.Gov. Rochas Okorocha announced that the department would soon serve as a model to be replicated by other state governments who needed to focus policy on well-being. “The ministry is to be able to assist Imo people to realize happiness, which is the very primary essence of government,” Okorocha explained in December. “Imo people must be happy. Imo people must be made to fulfill their purpose in life.”However, the appointment of the governor’s sister, Ogechi Ololo, as the first commissioner for happiness is one of several criticisms that have been widespread among citizens. “It’s my capacity to do good things, not my relation to the governor that counts. I’m a practical woman who comes into an environment and seeks to change it for the better,” Ololo said in response to nepotism claims. Defending her new role, she says she has big plans. “People have the right to say what they want to say but within six months Imolites will be able to see huge changes in the way we operate in the state.”Plans for a large-scale mentorship program initially targeted at 15- to 17-year-olds will begin in February, as part of the commissioner’s “purpose fulfillment” aim. The program is set to give students career advice that encourages them to pursue professions that will make them feel fulfilled.“I believe passionately that our young people can get jobs and should be in roles that give them a purpose and utilize their strengths and passion,” she said.According to Nigeria’s National Bureau of Statistics, 18.8 percent of the country was unemployed as of September. In Imo state the rate is far higher at 29.5 percent with almost half of the working population either unemployed or underemployed. Yet according to Ololo, a focus on fulfillment is important in tandem with working to increase the number of jobs.The department will open a “jobs bank,” where the state will register unemployed youth, identify their skills, provide them training and then offer them to private sector employers, guaranteeing their effectiveness as employees.“We want to reduce the costs in skilling employees and also improve the employability of young people,” Ololo explained. “We want people to be employed but also in the areas they’ll feel fulfilled in.”For all its ambition, the scheme has not been well received, said Eno-Abasi Sunday, a journalist at The Guardian in Nigeria.“Most people in Imo and in Nigeria see the development as bizarre and a classic case of misplaced priorities,” Sunday said. “Imo state people are battling to get their salaries and pensions owed from the state government. People will be happy when the government pays them their entitlements.”Imo’s financial difficulties are extensive. The state consistently struggles to pay salaries and pensions, owing more than 22 months in pension arrears as of last year. The governor only committed to reimbursing the pensioners fully following a court ruling. The state’s debt has also more than quadrupled since 2012 with monthly expenditures dwarfing its revenue, casting doubt on its ability to fund a new department.According to Ololo, states in Nigeria function in a way that is too far removed from individual citizens, due to poor governance and bureaucracy. The commission sees a large part of its role as making government more accessible and accountable.“What I want to do is to look at many existing policies in other departments and make them more people-oriented and more accountable to ordinary Imolites,” she said. “I think people are dissatisfied with government because there are policies or agencies that sometimes don’t work as they should. Then when they don’t, people don’t have anyone to complain to.” The government has ambitious plans for a new hotline for people to make complaints about the effectiveness of state agencies. A health policy called “health at your doorstep,” where mobile medical officials respond to residents’ health needs at their homes, is, according to Ololo, an example of a good policy that could work better. If a medical professional fails to arrive when called, people can call the hotline and an operator will follow up on their query.“We will roll out details of the hotline from next week,” she said. “It is one way we want to empower Imolites to feel like their state is here to serve their well-being effectively.”Despite the labor needed for the hotlines, mentoring schemes and other policies, Ololo said no extra funds would be needed as staff would be moved from other departments.“People who say this is an expensive project don’t understand that this is not costing Imo state money,” she said. “I am already employed as the governor’s deputy chief of staff, so my salary isn’t changing. However we are reorganizing the state to improve well-being in different areas.”Further fueling the cynicism has been the governor’s reputation for grand vanity projects. In November, the governor unveiled a 25-meter (82-foot) statue of South Africa’s president, Jacob Zuma ― whose administration was dogged by corruption allegations ― and named a road after him.According to Budgit, a civil society organization promoting government transparency, Imo state’s budget is one of many in Nigeria that isn’t transparent, preventing citizens from seeing how much of their taxes are spent on services versus on Okorocha’s controversial projects. The governor refused to disclose how much the statue cost, yet it has added to widespread concerns that money isn’t being spent efficiently.“Imo State is a perfect example of the escalating cost of governance in Nigeria,” said Oluseun Onigbinde, Budgit’s founder. “This governor’s projects and frivolous actions are an extravagant use of public funds. Meanwhile, the state struggles to meet its own financial obligations and help people in Imo.”According to Onigbinde, well-being is an outcome achieved in a functioning society. “Well-being is a noble aim and you can define it in different ways, but the government haven’t even thoroughly articulated what their version is and how they’ll achieve it.”Addressing the immediate needs of citizens in Imo state is a faster route to happiness, said Sola Tayo, an expert on Nigeria at Chatham House think tank in London. “Ministries for happiness can work in wealthy societies where people don’t have to worry about fuel shortages or erratic electricity supply. You could argue that Nigeria would be infinitely happier if these issues were addressed.”For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.

Rezeian is rejoining the Post as a staff writer for WorldViews, a newsletter and blog launched last year that targets an international audience. “For reasons that require little explanation, this is a moment for celebration,” read an announcement from the newspaper’s editors. “Jason joined The Post in 2012 as a correspondent in Iran, but his life was upended when he was detained and then unjustly imprisoned by an Iranian government that held him for 18 months in Iran’s most notorious prison.”The announcement falls on the second anniversary of Rezaian’s release from Evin prison, where he was detained after Iranian officials arrested him in July 2014.The following year, a closed-door Iranian court charged him with espionage and three other serious crimes, including “collaborating with hostile governments” and “propaganda against the establishment,” the Post reported. He was sentenced to prison for an undisclosed amount of time.Rezaian was one of four Americans set free in 2016 as part of a prisoner release deal between the U.S. and Iran ― a result of 14 months of nuclear armament negotiations between the two countries.After his release, Rezaian participated in the Nieman fellowship at Harvard University and the Terker fellowship at George Washington University’s School of Media & Public Affairs, and worked on a forthcoming book about his imprisonment.

Damien Harris, a running back on the football team, said on social media that Barber’s video dispelled any notion that “racism is dead.”Barber told the Post she was on the way back to New Jersey.“I’m an idiot,” she said. “There’s just no excuse.”"

The exhibit, titled “Rainbow in Reverse: Queer Kansas History,” was scheduled to open on Friday at Newman University’s Steckline Gallery in Wichita. Artist Genevieve Waller, a former Wichitan, hoped to use sculpture, photography and installation art to honor the achievements of queer Kansans in the fields of dance, film, literature, theater and politics, The Wichita Eagle reported.But Waller was forced to search for another place to hold the exhibition after Newman University decided it would no longer be taking place on school grounds.In a statement, Kimberly McDowall Long, Newman’s vice president for academic affairs, said that the university “understands that diverse perspectives, in an atmosphere in which the human dignity of each person is respected, are key to learning.” But after local community members expressed concerns about the exhibit, the school thought it was best to cancel, she said.“Over the years, Steckline shows have featured art and artists that focused on topics such as feminism, racism and other potentially challenging academic areas,” Long said. “Although we believe there might be some confusion regarding the purpose and content of this particular exhibit, we thought it was best to make this decision.”Days earlier, Jean Heimann, a local Catholic writer and blogger, reportedly warned the local religious community about the exhibit in an email, the Eagle reported. In that message, Heimann compared queer sexuality to “a sickness in our society” and expressed outrage over the school’s decision to “expose students to evil.” “Why don’t they have someone who has overcome the temptations of this lifestyle discuss their redemption? Perhaps someone who has been active in Courage?” Heimann reportedly wrote in the email. The writer then asked those concerned about the exhibition to contact the university and the local Catholic diocese. Heimann did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Clark Schafer, Newman’s director of university relations, told HuffPost that the school had in fact been contacted by a number of individuals who voiced their concerns about the exhibit.Schafer told HuffPost it’s possible some community members had “the wrong idea” about the show. He said the exhibit’s intent was to honor Kansans who may have been over-looked in the past and educate students about these individuals.Schafer said the university wasn’t sure it could correct this misunderstanding before the exhibit opened. As a result, they decided to cancel the event altogether. “In promotion of the event, some in the community thought it was inappropriate for the university to be hosting an exhibit they thought advocated for a way of life counter to the teachings of the Catholic faith,” Schafer wrote in an email. “Knowing we were so close to the event, and that it would be difficult to effectively communicate what gallery organizers believed to be the focus of the exhibit, a decision was made to cancel the event.”Kevin Clack, a junior at Newman, told HuffPost he was disappointed, but not surprised, by the school’s decision to cancel the exhibit.Clack is the president of Kaleidoscope, a group for LGBTQ students that was formed at the university in 2017 after years of effort.

It’s delusional.” Aquilina read Nassar’s handwritten, single-spaced letter in court and addressed each issue Nassar brought up. “I’m very concerned about my ability to face witnesses these next four days, mentally,” the letter said, noting that more than the seven women in Nassar’s plea deal were being given time in court to speak. Nassar also claimed Aquilina turned the proceedings into a “media circus.”“Aquilina is allowing them all to talk,” Nassar wrote. “She wants me to sit in the witness box next to her for all four days so the media cameras will be directed at her.”Aquilina responded that she “didn’t ask any media to be here” and that she doesn’t “need any cameras.”“I don’t have a dog in this fight, sir. I didn’t orchestrate this ― you did, by your actions and your plea of guilty,” she said.She added: “Spending four or five days listening to them is significantly minor considering the hours of pleasure you had at their expense and ruining their lives.” Nassar’s plea agreement allows for victim impact statements, which Aquilina is allowing all of the accusers to present. More than 100 accusers have agreed to appear or have statements read aloud.Nassar said the letter was meant to be “cathartic” and a cry for mental help. The judge noted that nowhere does the letter say “I’m having a breakdown,” but acknowledged Nassar’s accessibility to Community Mental Health staff.Nassar, 54, has already sat through dozens of victim impact statements since Tuesday, openly weeping during many.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported Tuesday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were planning a major sweep in San Francisco and other cities around the Bay Area. The article, which cited an unnamed source familiar with the operation, said the raids could occur in the coming weeks and would aim to arrest more than 1,500 undocumented immigrants.When asked to confirm the report, ICE told HuffPost that the agency doesn’t “speculate about potential future enforcement actions.”The goal of those allegedly upcoming raids, according to the Chronicle, would be in part to send a message that federal immigration enforcement will continue in California despite its statewide sanctuary status. The new statute, which went into effect this month, limits local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal immigration agents.California’s Democratic politicians have forcefully condemned the reportedly planned raids.“This Administration has continually put a target on the back of California,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) told HuffPost in a statement Wednesday, adding, “These broad brush raids will instill fear in immigrants who are terrified they will receive a midnight knock on the door and be deported or separated from their families.”“The Trump Administration’s deeply shameful plans to conduct immigration raids in California are an act of pure malice,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement.“Immigrant families in California must not be targeted in raids solely because they are Californians,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in her statement. “The administration is carrying out its enforcement actions to make a political point and not based on the security of the country.” “We will not turn our backs on the people of this City because of threats from the Trump Administration,” acting San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a statement to HuffPost. “San Francisco is and will always be a Sanctuary City and we will continue to defend and support our immigrant communities.”Later on Wednesday, Feinstein and Harris released a joint letter to acting ICE Director Thomas Holman asking to be “immediately briefed on the troubling reports.”“Diverting resources in an effort to punish California and score political points is an abhorrent abuse of power, not to mention a terrible misuse of scarce resources,” the senators wrote. Since President Donald Trump took office, ICE has sent repeated hard-line messages, declaring that undocumented immigrants should “look over [their] shoulder” and that politicians in sanctuary states should be prosecuted.Trump has also attacked sanctuary laws, claiming they make cities more dangerous. Supporters argue that sanctuary laws make communities safer by encouraging undocumented residents to trust and cooperate with the police. Earlier this month, Homan told Fox News that his agency would dramatically increase its enforcement efforts in California in response to the new sanctuary law.“California better hold on tight,” he said.Back in October, Homan responded to the governor’s signing of the sanctuary law by threatening “at-large arrests in local neighborhoods and at worksites, which will inevitably result in additional collateral arrests.”The Chronicle’s source said that the upcoming sweeps would target undocumented individuals who have been identified for deportation, including those served with final deportation orders and those with criminal histories ― and that other undocumented immigrants could be swept up in “collateral arrests.”Last week, federal immigration agents raided nearly a hundred 7-Eleven stores across the country, arresting 21 workers, in a crackdown that ICE said was meant to warn employers against hiring people without work authorizations.“What it does when you have these raids ― where agents can go to any place in the country, with no regard to criminal offense ― no one will feel safe,” Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute’s offices at New York University School of Law, told HuffPost last week. Under the Trump administration’s policies, all undocumented people ― not just those with criminal histories ― have become targets for deportation. ICE arrests increased by 40 percent during Trump’s first eight months in office, compared to the same period the previous year."
34,POLITICS,Senate Democrats Failed Dreamers In December. They Might Do It Again.,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-democrats-daca-shutdown_us_5a5fc823e4b0ccf9f1213cb9,Many Democrats want protections for undocumented immigrants to be part of a must-pass government funding bill. But will enough of them hold firm?,2018-01-18,Activists outside the New York office of Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday ask that protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program be spared.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5fe4a51e000028005ad98d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Democrats disappointed young undocumented immigrants in December when many of them voted for a government spending bill that left out deportation protections. Whether Democrats do the same again this week will depend on two things: their level of commitment to helping so-called Dreamers and their disgust over Congress’ continued inability to approve longer-term government spending.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday that there’s plenty of both commitment and disgust in the Democratic caucus, and he predicted strong opposition to House Republicans’ plan for another short-term spending bill that does nothing for the 700,000 young immigrants. “The revulsion towards that bill was broad and strong,” Schumer told reporters after a meeting with fellow Democrats. “The overwhelming number in our caucus have said they don’t like this deal and they believe if we kick the can down the road this time we’ll be back where we started from next time,” he added later. “There’s very, very strong support not to go along with their deal.” Their resolve will be tested this week if the House approves a short-term government funding bill to avert a shutdown on Friday, as leadership in the lower chamber aims to do in spite of Democratic opposition there. It’s possible that Democratic senators will, as they did in December, vote for it to avoid being blamed for its failure ― only a small fraction of them would need to ― without a fix for the Dreamers, who could begin to lose protections in larger numbers after March 5 under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Donald Trump had rescinded.Dreamers are hoping for the alternate possibility: that Senate Democrats will say they can’t support a bill that doesn’t address DACA, even if it means a government shutdown until Congress comes to an immigration deal. Some new dynamics emerged Wednesday when some senators suggested they wouldn’t support another short-term spending fix, known as a continuing resolution, even though they did in the past. “It’s another patch,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) told reporters, adding that it wasn’t about a potential lack of Dreamer protections but the fact that it was yet another short-term bill. When reporters said it sounded like that meant he would vote no, he said, “It does, doesn’t it?” Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), who also voted for the December short-term funding bill, said that he was leaning no if another comes up this week. He said he changed his mind because of the White House’s “unwillingness to negotiate in good faith” on immigration and after his conversations with members of the business community who urged a fast solution for Dreamers. “I want a comprehensive deal,” Carper told reporters. “This is not half a loaf, this is not a quarter of a loaf, this is a couple of slices of the loaf.” Inside the Democrats’ meeting, a handful of senators stood to say they would vote against a continuing resolution and another one or two said they were unsure, but none said they would vote for it, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters afterward. Durbin voted against the bill in December and said he would again without Dreamer protections.Durbin said he wants a vote on a bipartisan plan he and two other Democrats created with three Republicans to give Dreamers legal status and meet Trump’s demands on border security and legal immigration changes. Anything less than a vote wouldn’t be enough, Durbin said. “I’ve seen a lot of commitments that are not worth going to the bank on, so I want a vote,” Durbin told reporters. On the continuing resolution, Democrats have a newfound ally on the Republican side. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of the backers of the bipartisan deal to help Dreamers, along with Durbin, said Wednesday that he wouldn’t support a continuing resolution because “eventually, you’ve got to say no” to short-term spending bills. He said that Republicans need to accept that they won’t be able to get deals on things they want, like more defense funding, if they don’t give on Dreamer protections. “Democrats are not going to give us what we want on defense and leave the DACA kids hanging until March 4,” Graham said. “Nobody really believes that’s viable.”Trump has dismissed the Durbin-Graham deal, but it has a growing number of Republican backers. In addition to its original three GOP co-authors ― Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Graham ― four others signaled support on Wednesday: Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). Of course, it would take more than a few senators switching to opposition against a short-term funding bill to sink it. A bill would need 60 votes and, currently, there are 51 Republicans and 49 members of the Democratic caucus, which includes two independents. The continuing resolution in December passed easily in a 66 to 32 vote (two senators were absent), with two Republicans voting against it and 17 Democratic caucus members voting for it. Dreamers and their allies are lobbying hard on Capitol Hill, including through sit-ins at Democrats’ offices pleading with them to hold strong for a DACA fix as part of a funding bill. But some Democrats were shaky as to whether they would vote for another short-term bill, if they answered the question at all. Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said Tuesday that he thinks Congress can and should deal with Dreamers this week but did not definitively say he would vote against a bill that did not include protections for them. The most definitive ― although not explicit that he would vote for a funding bill without Dreamer relief ― was Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.). “I just don’t think there’s any way in the world that anyone should be talking about shutting down the government,” he told reporters on Wednesday. “We should be talking about working and keeping the government open.” "

The move came after a jury last month found all six defendants in the first felony trial not guilty on all counts. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, which handles both federal and local cases in the nation’s capital and is part of the Justice Department, said it would focus on a “core group” of 59 defendants it thinks were most responsible for destruction.“The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia has filed notice with the Court that it is exercising its discretion and moving forward with the prosecution of 59 defendants indicted on felony charges related to the rioting that took place on January 20, 2017, in Washington D.C.,” spokesman Bill Miller said in a statement. “The government will be filing motions to dismiss without prejudice the indictment against the other remaining 129 defendants so that it can focus its efforts on this smaller, core group that we believe is most responsible for the destruction and violence that took place on Inauguration Day.”When the first six individuals went on trial, the government conceded upfront that it had no evidence that any of them directly engaged in property destruction. But it said they should be held responsible for the damage that took place because they were part of a broader conspiracy to riot. During the trial, prosecutors used videotapes filmed by James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas and relied heavily on the testimony of a District of Columbia police detective who regularly tweeted about his distaste for activists. Defense attorneys argued that convicting their clients would amount to criminalizing First Amendment rights. The jury evidently agreed.An official from the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union said that the “U.S. Attorney has essentially admitted it never had the evidence to charge these innocent people in the first place, and we’re gratified to see they’ve come to their senses.”“For a full year, the government’s abusive prosecution has upended the lives of these defendants, who’ve endured the anxiety of multiple court hearings and suffered disruptions to their educations or careers while facing the prospect of more than 60 years in prison,” said Scott Michelman, a senior staff attorney for the ACLU office in D.C. “We hope the government continues to carefully examine the evidence it has against the remaining 59 defendants, at least some of whom we continue to believe are innocent.”The group of 59 people still facing charges includes several who have received prominent attention, including journalist Aaron Cantú.

All three gymnasts, and several others, say former team doctor Larry Nassar sexually abused them at the training center. More than 140 women have accused Nassar of sexually abusing them under the guise of medical treatment over two decades.“It has been my intent to terminate this agreement since I began as president and CEO in December,” Perry said. “Our most important priority is our athletes, and their training environment must reflect this. We are committed to a culture that empowers and supports our athletes.”She added that USA Gymnastics has canceled next week’s training camp for the women’s national team. “We are exploring alternative sites to host training activities and camps until a permanent location is determined,” Perry said. “We thank all those in the gymnastics community assisting in these efforts.”A spokesperson for Karolyi Ranch could not be reached by HuffPost for comment.A statement posted to the training center’s website reads: “After nearly four decades of spiriting young gymnasts towards greatness in sport, our yearly tradition of the Karolyi’s Gymnastics Camp has come to an end. Bela, Martha, and the rest of the camp staff wish to sincerely thank all participants, USA Gymnastics, and everyone who has been a part of our extended family for 35 years of unforgettable memories. ” Earlier this week, Biles revealed that she was sexually abused by Nassar while she was training at the Karolyi Ranch. “It is impossibly difficult to relive these experiences and it breaks my heart even more to think that as I work towards my dream of competing in Tokyo 2020, I will have to continually return to the same training facility where I was abused,” 20-year-old Biles wrote on Twitter. Olympic team member Aly Raisman has continued to call out USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee for failing to properly address the Nassar abuse. “To see [Simone] write that about having to go back to the ranch ... I hope USA Gymnastics listens, because they haven’t listened to us so far,” Raisman told ESPN in an interview on Tuesday. “I hope they listen and I hope they don’t make any of the girls go back to the ranch. No one should have to go back there after so many of us were abused there.” A sentencing hearing for Nassar began this week after he pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct in November 2017."

Michigan state Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis read the gymnast’s victim impact statement as a photo of Maroney at the 2012 Summer Olympics hung behind her. Maroney, 21, wrote about starting gymnastics when she was 18 months old and entering her first competition when she was 7. She said making the U.S. National Team at 14 was “remarkable and amazing,” but that it came with a price. “I was told to trust [Nassar], that he would treat my injuries and make it possible for me to achieve my Olympic dreams,” the statement said. “Dr. Nassar told me that I was receiving ‘medically necessary treatment that he had been performing on patients for over 30 years.’ As it turns out, much to my demise, Dr. Nassar was not a doctor, he in fact is, was, and forever shall be, a child molester, a monster of a human being. End of story.”More than 140 women ― including Maroney’s former teammates Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles ― have accused Nassar of molesting them. Nassar pleaded guilty in November to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct.“He abused my trust. He abused my body and he left scars on my psyche that may never go away,” Povilaitis read from Maroney’s statement. “For me, the scariest night of my life happened when I was 15 years old,” she continued. “I had flown all day and night with the team to get to Tokyo. He’d given me a sleeping pill for the flight, and the next thing I know, I was all alone with him in his hotel room getting a ‘treatment.’ I thought I was going to die that night.” She wrote that Nassar also abused her twice while she was competing in the 2012 Olympics.Maroney called for several organizations to be held accountable for allowing the abuse to go on for so long. “A simple fact is this: If Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee had paid attention to any of the red flags in Larry Nassar’s behavior, I never would have met him, I never would have been ‘treated’ by him, I never would have been abused by him,” she said. The statement ended on a strong note: “Our silence has given the wrong people power for too long, and it’s time to take our power back.”Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said she hoped Maroney and her mother were watching a livestream of the court proceedings. “Thank you, McKayla. I think you have just taken your power back along with your sister survivors,” she said. “Your voice for change and accountability is being heard.” The sentencing hearing for Nassar began Tuesday and is set to run through Monday. Povilaitis said 105 victims and their family members are scheduled to read impact statements throughout the hearing. Nassar is already serving a 60-year sentence on child pornography charges. "

His energetic routine to Lady Gaga’s “Poker Face” at the 2010 U.S. Nationals prompted further speculation. Though Weir has become an LGBTQ rights advocate in recent years, many fans are surprised to learn that he didn’t confirm he was gay until the release of his 2011 memoir, Welcome to My World. On Thursday, Weir explained on Twitter why he did not publicly come out “in the traditional sense” until a year after participating in the Winter Olympics for the second time. He continued: Weir’s remarks come nearly two weeks after figure skater Adam Rippon was named the first openly gay U.S. man to qualify for the Winter Olympics. The 28-year-old, who hails from Pennsylvania, soon may not be the only American athlete heading to the 2018 Winter Games who identifies as queer. Freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy, who came out as gay in a 2015 ESPN interview, is expected to find out later this month whether he qualifies for the U.S. ski team. As for Weir, he’s bound for Pyeongchang, South Korea, next month alongside fellow Olympian Tara Lipinski, where the pair will provide commentary for NBC’s primetime figure skating coverage. "

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, on May 4.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5ec542220000251ab4ecb6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Just a few days before a shutdown, lawmakers are still sorting out how they plan to fund the government past Friday.House Republican leaders put forward a plan Tuesday night that would extend government operations for another month, fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years as a lure for Democrats and try to win GOP support by delaying some taxes on health insurance plans.That bill would have a decent chance of passing the House and Senate, with Democrats still calling for a legislative fix for the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program but not necessarily willing to shut down the government in order to get a deal.In the House, this so-called continuing resolution (CR) could probably pass with just Republican votes ― or with only a few Democrats joining Republicans ― and then pass the Senate with bipartisan support. That’s essentially how Congress passed the last CR to keep the government funded at the end of December. House Democrats waited for Republicans to put up all the required votes to pass a CR before 14 Democrats joined most Republicans in supporting the bill just before Christmas. And then, in the Senate, 17 Democrats and one independent (Sen. Angus King of Maine) voted for the measure even though it didn’t include protections for DACA’s “Dreamers.” And while some Democratic senators who supported the CR in December are in question ― Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.) said Tuesday it would be “baloney” to vote for another stopgap bill ― a number of Democrats still look gettable.But that’s assuming Republicans actually move forward with this CR plan. Or that conservatives and defense hawks let them.Some House Republicans pushed GOP leaders Tuesday night to put forward a so-called cromnibus ― a portmanteau of “CR” and “omnibus” ― that would fund non-defense government operations for a month while supplying the Pentagon with money for the rest of the fiscal year.“I would love to see a cromnibus,” Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) told reporters Tuesday night. “That’s what we wanted back in December.”Byrne, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said he didn’t know if he would support the CR this time, citing challenges to defense procurement when Congress funds the military with short-term bill after short-term bill. But he and other defense hawks have had concerns for months about funding the Pentagon with another CR.On the conservative side, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) emerged from a meeting with his conservative caucus late Tuesday night to announce that there currently are not the votes in the GOP conference to pass the CR that leadership laid out.“Based on the number of noes and undecideds in the Freedom Caucus, there’s not enough support to pass it with just GOP support in the House,” Meadows said, adding that there were other members in the conference who may oppose the CR as well.Meadows said he planned to go to GOP leadership and ask for this defense cromnibus, but, he said, if it was clear Senate Democrats would have no problem voting against that measure, Plan B would be to add some funding for defense ― so-called anomalies for priorities like military pay raises and some procurement ― to the CR.Meadows also said there may be a Plan C, though he wouldn’t get into that possibility out of concern he’d end up negotiating against himself.The cromnibus plan could gain steam Wednesday if conservatives get behind it, but it’s difficult to see Senate Democrats going along. Senate Democrats are already showing signs of reluctant opposition to a CR that does nothing for Dreamers, so House Republicans could make the task of Democrats opposing this bill much easier, perhaps sending the government into a shutdown.But conservatives are thus far sticking together against the CR. Assuming leadership doesn’t go along with any of these demands from the Freedom Caucus, a big question in the House could become how many Democrats would be willing to vote for the short-term bill.Last time, in December, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) made sure Republicans put up the requisite number of votes for the CR before any Democrat voted for it as well.On Tuesday, Hoyer was cagey about whether Democrats could support a CR like the one GOP leaders laid out later in the day. While he was clear he and other Democrats want a DACA fix, he was less than firm about Democrats holding strong ― particularly when there are a number of Senate Democrats who are showing some discomfort with the prospect of a shutdown over what is, in effect right now, a clean extension of funding with six years of CHIP.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) could always go to Pelosi and cut a deal for a few votes with Democrats, which is the potential risk for conservatives. They may end up driving Ryan into the arms of Democrats, possibly securing a better spending deal or DACA agreement in the future.But they’re betting that Republicans won’t trust Democrats on such a deal and that, if there’s a chance a CR could go down in the House because of insufficient Republican support, Pelosi will wait to see how many votes Ryan can put up.The specter of a government shutdown has been raised by all the gamesmanship, to say nothing of President Donald Trump’s erratic behavior. The president could have another “shithole” moment and throw any deal into chaos. For now, conservatives want to see if leadership will agree to any of their demands ― about 72 hours away from a shutdown.Asked what would happen if leadership flatly rejected all of his proposals, Meadows raised the possibility of problems. “I’m sure we’ll be writing another story,” he said.Elise Foley contributed to this report."

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes on Tuesday night that Bannon was effectively being gagged by the White House, even after the panel issued a subpoena to compel his testimony.“He quickly informed through his counsel to the committee that he was not going to answer questions that pertained to meetings, conversations, events, etc., that took place either during the transition or while he was part of the administration,” Schiff told Hayes. “They went back to the White House and got the same instruction again, basically … effectively putting in place a gag rule.“There is no privilege that broad, obviously,” he continued.Executive privilege is a principle that allows the president, his aides and Cabinet officials to flout some subpoenas in order to protect confidentiality in the executive branch, according to The New York Times, although the definition has relatively narrow interpretations.Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) told CNN on Tuesday that Bannon’s refusal to answer the committee’s questions could place him in contempt of Congress.“While we were able to ask and answer a lot of different kinds of questions, there were an awful lot of questions we weren’t able to answer based on this very novel theory of executive privilege,” Himes told CNN.Despite Bannon’s invocation of privilege in front of the House committee, some say he will be more forthcoming with special counsel Robert Mueller. Bannon was issued a subpoena to appear in front of a grand jury as part of Mueller’s investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia last week, the Times reported.The Daily Beast’s Besty Woodruff, citing an unnamed source familiar with Bannon’s thinking, said the former aide won’t abide by the terms of Trump’s executive privilege as part of that inquiry.The Times noted that Mueller’s subpoena, the first issued to one of Trump’s close advisers, could be used as a means to negotiate and compel Bannon to answer questions in a direct interview with investigators."

The decision comes more than a month after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced in an off-the-cuff remark that he planned to hire Toyota to evaluate the agency’s internal practices and recommend some of the Japanese auto giant’s strategies to speed up reviews. “We were always just in talks anyway, so it was not a done deal,” Karen Nielsen, a Toyota spokeswoman, told HuffPost by phone. “We were just looking into working with them, but that was never a promised thing.” That isn’t how Pruitt made it sound when, at a Dec. 7 hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, he told lawmakers: “We are actually partnering with Toyota to begin a lean process at the agency to evaluate management practices.” The statement came in response to a question from Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) about how the agency assessed its workload and determined how many people were necessary to meet its goals. The announcement drew swift criticism from former EPA officials and environmentalists who told HuffPost at the time that the partnership represented “a clear conflict of interest.” The EPA directly regulates Toyota, and the automaker has lobbied aggressively to weaken Obama-era fuel economy standards.On Dec. 13, the Environmental Working Group sent a letter to Toyota North America CEO James Lentz, recommending he abandon talks with the EPA or risk damaging the company’s reputation. “We urge you to immediately and unambiguously announce Toyota’s rejection of any management partnership with EPA and Administrator Scott Pruitt,” EWG President Ken Cook wrote in the letter. “To do otherwise risks irreparable harm to Toyota’s brand and reputation in the American marketplace.”Five days later, EPA operations chief Henry Darwin dismissed ethical concerns about the partnership.“It’s not about policy. It’s not about specific decisions,” Darwin said in an interview with Bloomberg. It’s “about the process that we use in order to basically eliminate waste and maximize customer value.”During his 20 years working in Arizona, Darwin said he implemented parts of “The Toyota Way” ― a set of “lean manufacturing” strategies to avoid defects and shorten supply-line delays ― at the state’s Department of Environmental Quality and for Gov. Doug Ducey (R). Toyota proselytizes the Toyota Way by consulting for hospitals and nonprofits through a nonprofit affiliate called the Toyota Production System Support Center.But Pruitt’s aggressive rollback of pollution rules at the behest of companies the EPA regulates has raised concerns even among Republican former administrators. The timing of his Toyota announcement in particular fueled the backlash.In October, the EPA began working to repeal rules limiting emissions from truck components ― the same year vehicle emissions became the top source of greenhouse gas pollution in the country. Pruitt’s announcement in December came one day after a former Volkswagen executive was sentenced to seven years in prison for his role in the emissions cheating scandal the EPA investigated in 2015.Nielsen declined to comment on whether pressure from EWG factored into Toyota’s decision on working with the EPA. In a statement to HuffPost, the EPA said: “We continue to have collaborations with Toyota to better improve Agency outcomes.”On Jan. 9, Christopher Reynolds, Toyota’s executive vice president for corporate resources, sent EWG a letter defending the EPA talks, but informing the group that the company had “no definitive plans to move forward with a project.” EWG shared the letter with HuffPost. “Even the appearance of helping Mr. Pruitt dismantle public health and environmental protections at EPA would be a public relations nightmare for Toyota, and it seems the company agrees,” Cook said in a Wednesday morning statement to HuffPost. “It would be wise for any corporation that cares about its brand and marketshare among environmentally-conscious consumers to steer clear of the Trump administration. They’re bad for business.”This article was updated with a statement from the EPA. "

Top Wisconsin Republicans ― including House Speaker Paul Ryan ― acknowledged it was a blow to their party, and it could mean bad news for the GOP in the 2018 midterm elections. “I know this district fairly well. It’s not my district. It’s over in western Wisconsin. But typically, we’ve held this seat. And we lost this seat last night,” Ryan told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. “So yeah, I think we should pay attention to it.”GOP Gov. Scott Walker, who is up for re-election in Wisconsin this year, called it a “wake-up call.”Democrat Patty Schachtner, a county medical examiner, defeated her Republican opponent in state Senate District 10. Walker called a special election for the seat after the incumbent, Republican Sheila Harsdorf, gave it up to become his agriculture secretary.Harsdorf first won the seat in 2000, and the district has been solidly Republican. In 2016, Harsdorf won re-election by 26 percentage points, and Trump beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 17 points. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney carried the district in 2012. Tuesday’s win was the latest in a series of victories for Democrats since Trump’s inauguration. The party has flipped 34 state legislative seats nationwide, compared with just four pick-ups for the GOP. Democrats last year also recaptured the governor’s mansion in New Jersey and ― in 2017′s highest-profile race ― gained a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama.In Wisconsin, Republicans had sensed that the District 10 seat was vulnerable and threw in a fair amount of money to boost the Republican candidate, Adam Jarchow. The conservative Americans for Prosperity spent at least $50,000 on ads, and the groups Wisconsin Alliance for Reform and Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce combined to spend $80,000. On the Democratic side, Greater Wisconsin spent $30,000, and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee contributed $10,000. "
45,POLITICS,19 Attorneys General Call On Congress To Legalize Banking For Weed Industry,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/attorneys-general-banking-weed-industry_us_5a5fb08ae4b0ccf9f1210835,Federal regulations currently make it risky for banks to provide services to cannabis businesses.,2018-01-17,"Cannabis dispensaries are typically cash-only, with ATMs on site.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5fc11f1f00009a00db93f0.jpeg?cache=p2hbdY6wU1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Attorneys general from over a dozen states where some form of marijuana use has been legalized are urging Congress to pass legislation that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis businesses without risking federal prosecution.In a letter sent to congressional leaders on Tuesday, attorneys general from 17 states, Washington D.C. and the U.S. territory of Guam said they shared “a strong interest in protecting public safety and bringing grey market activities into the regulated banking sector.”“To address these goals, we urge Congress to advance legislation that would allow states that have legalized medical or recreational use of marijuana to bring that commerce into the banking system,” the letter stated.Such a law “would bring billions of dollars into the banking sector, and give law enforcement the ability to monitor these transactions,” the letter said. It added that “compliance with tax requirements would be simpler and easier to enforce with a better-defined tracking of funds. This would, in turn, result in higher tax revenue.”Medical marijuana is legal in 29 states and several U.S. territories, including Guam. Eight of those states and the District of Columbia have also passed laws legalizing recreational cannabis use by people who are at least 21 years old. The new year ushered in a newly legal recreational weed market in California.But the federal government still classifies cannabis as an illegal substance, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this month rescinded four Obama-era memos that discouraged enforcement of the federal ban. The abrupt announcement sparked confusion among banks on how to work with cannabis businesses without running afoul of federal money laundering laws.Under current federal regulations, banks that provide services to state-licensed weed businesses ― such as establishing deposit accounts or providing loans ― are liable for criminal and civil prosecution under the Controlled Substances Act.“This risk has significantly inhibited the willingness of financial institutions to provide services to these businesses,” the attorneys general’s letter said.That has left some cannabis businesses scrambling to find ways to secure their money, while the roughly $7 billion global weed industry rapidly continues to grow. Some have used apps like CanPay, which offers digital debiting services. And about 400 banks and credit unions, most of them small institutions operating in states where cannabis has been legalized, currently do business with the U.S. marijuana industry.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who was among those signing the letter to Congress, said in a statement that “the future of small and local licensed [cannabis] businesses has been clouded by the Trump administration’s relentless attacks on progress, in conflict with the will of voters.”He added that “Congress has the power to protect a growing $6.7 billion industry and the public safety of our communities.”"

Dr. Ronny Jackson following his annual physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, Jan. 12, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5e81381e00003d00c97a33.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A Navy rear admiral who serves as President Donald Trump’s personal physician vouched on Tuesday for his mental fitness, explaining that he gave Trump a dementia screening exam at the president’s request, and that Trump aced it.“Anything above 26 is normal, and certainly if you get a 30 out of 30, I think you can confidently assume that you’re done on the cognitive workup for now,” said Rear Adm. Dr. Ronny Jackson, who on Friday spent three hours examining Trump with a team of doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in suburban Maryland.Trump’s mental state, which had been an occasional topic of debate since the start of his presidential campaign, became a focus of national conversation in recent weeks with the publication of Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury. The book depicted a president quick to anger, deeply ignorant of policy matters and unable to focus for any length of time.Critics wondered aloud about Trump’s ability to perform his duties, as some psychiatrists around the country ignored their profession’s stricture against making assessments in the absence of a personal exam to suggest that Trump had dementia.Jackson works in the White House and sees Trump every day. Based on those interactions, Jackson said he personally saw no need to administer a dementia screening. However, he said, Trump was aware of the public discussion of his mental state and asked Jackson to give him one anyway.“I think he saw the physical as an opportunity to put some of that to rest,” Jackson said. “He wasn’t the least bit concerned that he had anything to hide. He actively asked me to include that in it, and so we did.”The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is actually more detailed and lengthier than the 10-minute quiz recommended by the National Institute of Aging for people 65 and over. Jackson said Trump scored 30, the highest possible result.“The president did exceedingly well on it,” he said.The results were something the White House ― which had refused to say beforehand whether Trump would take a cognitive assessment ― was pleased to discuss, and Jackson spent nearly a full hour taking questions about Trump’s physical exam at Tuesday’s daily briefing.Jackson also declared Trump, who is 71, to be in “excellent” health for a man his age, and said his cardiovascular system in particular is in good shape. He did say that Trump would benefit from losing 10 to 15 pounds from a combination of improving his diet and starting an exercise regimen.Jackson gave Trump’s height as 6 feet 3 inches, and his weight as 239 pounds. Those figures put him just barely under the obesity threshold in the body mass index calculation.Trump has claimed that exercise is bad because people are born with a finite amount of energy and that exercise needlessly wastes it.But Jackson said he will be figuring out a low-impact aerobic exercise machine in the White House gym for Trump, as well as bringing in a nutritionist to work with the kitchen staff to lower his intake of carbohydrates and fats. He said that as far as he knows, Trump is not currently engaging in any specific exercise at all.“The good part is that we can build on that pretty easily,” Jackson said."
47,POLITICS,Pennsylvania Supreme Court Appears Open To Striking Down Gerrymandered Map,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-gerrymandering_us_5a5f8856e4b046f0811c5bbe,"The justices struggled during oral arguments to determine what a fix could look like, especially with the midterm elections coming up this year.",2018-01-17,The Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg in 2011. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5f89d21e0000d900c97c92.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"HARRISBURG, Pa. ― A plurality of state Supreme Court justices on Wednesday appeared open to the possibility that the Pennsylvania congressional map may violate the state’s constitution, but during oral argument seemed unclear as to how to remedy the situation. The state’s map, which has been in place since 2012, gives Republicans a considerable advantage. The GOP consistently has been able to win 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats despite winning just 50 percent of the vote. The Brennan Center for Justice describes the congressional map as one of the worst gerrymanders in the country, and analyses have found it to be responsible for at least three additional GOP seats in Congress.During an oral argument that lasted about two and a half hours in a packed courtroom, the justices seemed resistant to the plaintiffs’ suggestion that any level of partisanship would be unacceptable in drawing district lines. Reaching such a conclusion would mean the court would be wading into redistricting more than any court had before, said Justice Debra McCloskey Todd. But a plurality of the justices seemed more open to a map that took into consideration some partisan concerns as long as they were not given more importance than traditional, neutral redistricting requirements, such as those mandating districts be compact and contiguous. David Gersch, the lawyer for those challenging the congressional map, said such an approach would be acceptable as a fallback position.Gersch argued that the case was a “straightforward” example of viewpoint discrimination. Republican lawmakers tasked with redrawing the state’s congressional districts sorted voters based on how they had voted in previous elections. Doing so, he said, “threatens to undermine the essence” of representative democracy.Lawyers for the Republican defendants did not dispute that voters had been sorted into districts based on their past votes, but said that did not amount to impermissible viewpoint discrimination. They argued that social science could not necessarily predict how voters would cast their ballot, and that political parties were not a protected group the way racial groups are.The case was filed by the League of Women Voters on behalf of 18 Pennsylvania Democratic voters, one in each of the state’s congressional districts.E. Mark Braden, a lawyer for House Speaker Michael Turzai (R), said it was inconceivable that the constitution would give the power to redraw districts to a legislature without anticipating it would take political considerations into effect. Brady warned the justices against wading into the “political thicket,” arguing the body would weaken its integrity as an independent judicial body by taking on the political process of redistricting.Gersch and Daniel Jacobson, another lawyer for the plaintiffs, said they were surprised at Brady’s admission that Republicans used Pennsylvanians’ past votes to sort them into districts. Brady argued it was unsurprising politicians would take politics into account when shaping drawing the new maps.“They offered no substantive argument that this wasn’t intentional discrimination,” Jacobson told HuffPost.Democrats have a 5-2 majority on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, onto which justices are elected. The court has the final say in this case because it involves a challenge under the free expression and equal protection clauses of the state constitution.A ruling would be deeply significant, both because it could force lawmakers to draw new, more competitive congressional districts ahead of the 2018 elections, and because it could encourage people in other states to bring similar claims.The lawyers for the Republicans faced sharp questioning from Justice David Wecht, who seemed strongly leaning toward throwing out the map. He suggested the Republican defense in the case hinted that they believed there was no permissible limit on how far a partisan gerrymander could go. Wecht at one point comparing the defense of the map to the defense in Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court that said school segregation was unconstitutional.Justice Max Baer also seemed leaning toward striking down the map, but appeared to wrestle with what a fix would look like. He repeatedly asked lawyers for both sides to give the court some kind of test to evaluate partisan gerrymanders. He wondered aloud if it would be constitutional to draw a district that was only Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, cities on opposite sides of the state, that were joined only by a single highway. A lawyer for the plaintiffs responded that courts had upheld a similarly drawn districts in Illinois.Constitutional issues aside, the justices also wrestled with the practical impact of throwing out the state’s congressional map weeks before the start of the election process for the 2018 midterm elections. Noting that technology had made it possible for computers to draw hundreds of maps in one day, Gersch said it would be possible to draw the maps in two weeks. Mark Aronchick, a lawyer representing Gov. Thomas Wolf (D) and state election officials, argued in favor of throwing out the map and said it would be possible to run the 2018 congressional election smoothly if the court decided to do so.With a few adjustments, he said, the state could hold its scheduled primary congressional elections on May 15 if a new map was in place by Feb. 20. If a map came later, he said the state could either postpone all of the primary elections scheduled for May 15 or delay just the congressional primary date. Aronchick suggested the court give the legislature two or three weeks to redraw the map, but also appoint an expert special master who could work on maps at the same time in case the legislature did not move quickly enough.Todd expressed concern about the cost of an additional primary. Lawrence Tabas, a lawyer for Republican voters supporting the map, said it would amount to substantial changes on the eve on an election and would infringe on the constitutional rights of voters in the state. He suggested leaving in place the current map for the 2018 election, even if the court struck it down, and ordering a new one for 2020.Wecht interjected to ask him if the convenience of Republican voters trumped constitutional rights.The case is being closely watched as courts across the country grapple with whether they can set a standard to determine when lawmakers go too far to draw electoral boundaries for their party’s benefit. The U.S. Supreme Court is considering two cases out of Maryland and Wisconsin this term that could help clarify that question. Observers are closely watching Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is seen as the deciding swing vote in the case and wrote in 2004 that such a standard may exist.But regardless of what the Supreme Court does, experts say a ruling striking down the map could encourage groups to pursue lawsuits in state courts to challenge partisan gerrymandering. Conversely, a ruling upholding the map would increase the importance of the Supreme Court’s decision.The lower commonwealth court initially put the Pennsylvania lawsuit on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court’s decisions were pending. The plaintiffs appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case on an emergency expedited basis. At the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s direction, Commonwealth Court Judge P. Kevin Brobson presided over a trial in December. In his recommendation to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which is nonbinding, Brobson noted partisan considerations were evident in the 2011 map and said it was possible to draw a fairer map using only neutral criteria. However, he also said the challengers had failed to offer a standard to evaluate partisan gerrymandering and failed to prove it violated the state’s constitution.Drew Crompton, a lawyer for Senate President Pro Tempore Joseph Scarnati (R), hinted that Republicans were considering how to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court should the Pennsylvania high court rule against them. He added that the League of Women Voters was using the lawsuit as a means to get more Democrats in Congress.“If they create new law and new policy, then we’re just going to see what they do and what the remedy is and then decide whether or not we go to the U.S. Supreme Court,” Crompton told reporters. “Regardless of the plaintiffs trying to say that this is all state Supreme Court law and state constitutional, in the world that we live in, the federal law and the state law are intertwined. There’s no getting around that. And we should highlight the fact that these are congressional issues, so federal issues. I think we have a right to an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, I hope it doesn’t come to that.”R. Stanton Jones, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said such an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was “absolutely not available,” because the congressional map was only being challenged under the state constitution.The gallery was mostly quiet during the hearing, but there were some moments of levity. How can it be so bad, Tabas wanted to know, if five Democrats are running for Congress in a district where Democrats allege a particularly egregious gerrymander for Republicans? “Hope springs eternal,” Todd responded, prompting the courtroom to break out into laughter.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly described the reason the plaintiffs lawyers believe the case is not subject to U.S. Supreme Court review and misspelled the last name of David Gersch.

Zainab Salbi, a humanitarian and founder of Women for Women International, will host the series, which will feature 30-minute episodes that debut on Feb. 2, according to a press release. “In order for this conversation to create true cultural change, we must talk with the man on the street, in our lives, our colleagues and friends,” Salbi said in the release. “Equally, we need to have the conversation with the women in our lives to examine why, when we’ve seen sexual misconduct, we’ve often looked the other way when it didn’t impact us directly.”The series will spotlight sexual harassment by featuring women and men of all ages. ”#MeToo, Now What?” seeks to answer the important question: “How did we get here and how can we use this moment to effect positive and lasting change?” according to the press release. “Topics to be explored include the impact of popular culture on women in the workplace, how race and class factor into the discussion, the social costs of pay inequity and gender discrimination, how men can be engaged in this discussion, and, ultimately, how we begin to chart a path forward,” the release said.The #MeToo movement was originally created by youth organizer Tarana Burke in 2007. It picked up steam in October, when actress Alyssa Milano asked Twitter followers to share stories of sexual harassment and assault using the hashtag #MeToo. Since then, dozens of men in power, including Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Matt Lauer, have been toppled by allegations of sexual harassment and assault. "

The government has no official figure.A few countries, including Nepal, India, New Zealand, Australia and Canada, have already offered third gender options.Their citizens can choose between male or female, or they may select an indeterminate gender, which is usually marked by an ‘x’ or ‘o’ in the passport."

Told to contact Zinke’s spokeswoman, Frosh tried to make things easy. He took out a pen, wrote a waiver on a piece of blank paper and asked a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management official to make sure it reaches Zinke’s desk. Frosh said he was concerned that the secretary wouldn’t take the time to speak or meet with him.“Apart from Mar-a-Lago, I think we got everything Florida’s got,” Frosh told BOEM’s chief environmental officer, William Brown. “We got beautiful beaches. We got the Chesapeake Bay. We’ve got an economy that’s based on the bay’s health.”Frosh was of course referring to Zinke’s sudden decision last week to remove Florida’s coastal waters from consideration for future offshore oil drilling.A few days into the new year, the Trump administration released a sweeping plan to boost America’s fossil fuel production that would make available for drilling leases roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, including huge swaths of the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans. The move drew instant outrage from both Democrats and Republicans. Less a week later, just two days into a 60-day public comment period, Zinke announced that at the recommendation of Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) — whom he called a “straightforward leader that can be trusted” — he would remove that state’s coastal waters from the areas that could be leased for drilling. Zinke broke the news from Tallahassee after a brief face-to-face meeting with Scott, an otherwise staunch Trump ally who had pushed back against the offshore proposal even before an official announcement. In a Twitter post that same day, Zinke referenced Scott in declaring that “local voices matter.” In a statement announcing the Florida decision, he said, “President Trump has directed me to rebuild our offshore oil and gas program in a manner that supports our national energy policy and also takes into consideration the local and state voice. I support the governor’s position that Florida is unique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver.” Tuesday’s event in Annapolis was the first of more than 20 public meetings that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is hosting over the next several weeks. At a press conference ahead of the event, several Maryland officials and environmentalists blasted the Trump administration for what they view as a shortsighted action that threatens the economy, environment and climate. “Any potential offshore oil and gas development to the mid-Atlantic could harm our economic and environmental interests and adversely affect our state’s robust marine-related communities and industries, especially travel and tourism and boating and fishing, which support hundreds of thousands of jobs and generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue,” said Mark Belton, secretary of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.Tony Friederick, a local recreational fisherman, said “a lot of magical things happen in the Chesapeake Bay” — a critical habitat for numerous species — and that “the risk vs. reward [of offshore drilling] makes no sense.” He offered this message to the oil companies eyeing waters off the Maryland coast: “Your best bet is to probably pick up sticks.”Among those who submitted written comments to BOEM were Paula Deschamp, who worked at the Environmental Protection Agency for 20 years, and her husband, Jeff Evans. The Maryland couple lives in Bethesda, frequents the Delaware shore and enjoys windsurfing. They told HuffPost they felt it was important not only to voice their opposition but to hear from the public servants who are handling the process.“I see so much of the politics driving attitudes about the environment in a certain direction, and I just wanted to come out and really do something more than just complaining about how it is,” Deschamp said. “And show my support for responsible exploration for additional fossil fuels, if that’s possible. My feeling is that for energy dominance, this is kind of the wrong direction to go. ... I think our country should be investing its time and resources into alternative fuel.”“We spend our lives along the coast and it just seems like to have these resources put in jeopardy for what appears to be minimal gain, in terms of petroleum products, just seems harmful and shameful,” Evans said."
51,POLITICS,Republicans Didn't Promise Tax Reform Would Deliver A Smattering Of Bonuses,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-tax-reform-bonuses_us_5a5fb152e4b046f0811c9412,"Bonuses are well and good, but the goal was wage gains over the long term.",2018-01-17,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell discusses the Republican tax plan on Dec. 19, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5fc4ed1e00003d00c97d71.jpeg?cache=TajQAMmR4Z&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans have said bonus and raise announcements by companies like Walmart and Humana show that the GOP tax agenda is already boosting worker pay as advertised. But Republicans had not promised there would be a scattered series of bonus announcements less than a month after President Donald Trump signed the tax bill into law. They said the bill’s corporate tax benefits would trickle down to workers over the long term. Kevin Hassett, the top economic adviser to the president, provided the intellectual underpinning for the idea that corporate tax cuts would benefit workers in an October paper. Hassett argued that workers would earn at least $4,000 more per year as a result of corporations investing in new equipment that makes workers more productive, which would in turn make them more valuable. “Effectively, reductions in the corporate tax rate incentivize corporations to pursue additional capital investments as their cost declines,” Hassett wrote. “Standard economic theory implies that the result of more productive and more sought-after labor is an increase in the price of labor, or worker wages.”Hassett described the wage effects as “long-run outcomes,” not something that would happen right away. Economists generally agree that corporate tax cuts can benefit workers, though not as much as Hassett has claimed, and not as quickly as Republicans are now suggesting.“It takes a long time,” Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said in an interview. “You don’t instantaneously get wage increases.”Boeing, AT&T and Wells Fargo announced in December they would give their workers bonuses and pay raises specifically because of the tax reform that had been signed days earlier. If it wasn’t really because of tax reform, then why would they say it was?“The cynical explanation is they have political motives,” Gleckman said, noting that AT&T needs the government to approve its acquisition of Time Warner. Boeing is a government contractor, and the Trump administration last year suggested it might reconsider fraud penalties imposed on Wells Fargo. Those are just three of several dozens of raise or bonus announcements that Republicans have been tracking, which could affect 2 million workers, or about 1.2 percent of the labor force. Republicans have amplified the message, which seems to cut against the wide array of expert analyses finding the tax bill benefits the rich more than the working class, not to mention the statements from corporate executives about using their tax windfall to buy back stock. Tax bill aside, with unemployment plunging to 4.1 percent, there are fewer workers desperate for jobs, so employers are going to have to offer higher wages in order to attract and retain employees. The economy is at or near what economists call “full employment,” which is the lowest level of joblessness that doesn’t lead to price inflation. So companies that might have planned to raise wages anyway can put out a press release crediting Republican policies and at least get a pat on the back. “This is public relations,” said Gregg Polsky, a tax professor at the University of Georgia. “This is opportunistic timing. The labor market’s gotten tighter. That causes employers to be nicer to employees.”Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), who was closely involved in drafting the tax bill, called the spate of bonus and raise announcements “icing on the cake.” “To give the employers credit, a lot of them are recognizing, ‘Look, this is so significant for us, we’ve got to make sure at the very beginning we’re communicating broadly there’s a benefit for our employees,’” Roskam told HuffPost. Roskam did not credit the possibility that companies are using the tax bill for publicity. “If you starting chasing that type of cynicism, it’s very unsatisfying and it never ends,” he said. It would make more sense to gauge possible impact of the tax bill by looking at what companies are spending on equipment or capital goods, said Dean Baker, a labor expert with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research.“For their story to hold true, we should be seeing a very quick upturn in investment,” Baker said. The government’s data on nondefense capital goods orders for the month of December will come out on Jan. 26, and January data will be available late next month. Another way of making Baker’s point: People should evaluate the policy by looking at data instead of at anecdotes. This week, Humana announced bonuses and raises of an unspecified amount for an unspecified number of its employees. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) hailed the news from the Senate floor, and a press release from House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) called it the “Human(a) Face of Tax Reform.” Spokespeople for the company did not respond to a HuffPost inquiry about whether the tax bill had led the company to reconsider laying off 5.7 percent of its workforce, or about 2,700 workers, which the firm announced it was doing in November. According to the running tally kept by Scalise’s office, nearly 200 companies have announced bonuses and increased compensation specifically because of the tax bill.“A business restructuring due to individual company performance is an entirely separate issue than having an influx of unexpected savings from tax reform that can be pumped back directly to their workforce,” Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine said.Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) represents the Louisville area where Humana has its headquarters. “What they’re doing with the bonuses is a small percentage of what they save from the tax cuts,” Yarmuth said. “I’m glad the workers are getting more money, but I’m not sure it will last.”Travis Waldron contributed reporting."

Bolling left Fox News last year and Van Susteren left Fox News in 2016, going to MSNBC for a few months in 2017. Both are among the exclusive group of 45 accounts that President Donald Trump follows on Twitter.During the breach, hackers shared a screenshot of what appeared to be Bolling’s direct messages. They also sent messages to Trump from Van Susteren’s account.Both accounts were restored within several hours, but not before Twitter users and journalists saved the tweets.Van Susteren hosted the popular Fox News show “On the Record” for 14 years before she was booted from the network in September 2016 after a reported contract dispute. Her dismissal came months after former network CEO Roger Ailes resigned in light of numerous sexual harassment allegations.Bolling, also a longtime Fox News host and co-anchor of “The Five,” was ousted from the network in September after HuffPost reported that he sent unsolicited photos of male genital to three of his colleagues.The screenshot of Bolling’s direct messages show only a portion of the last message sent in an exchange with other Twitter users. At least one message featured a cellphone number. From Van Susteren’s account, hackers appeared to have sent a direct message to Trump asking him to share a propaganda video from his personal account.While under the hacker’s control, Bolling and Van Susteren’s accounts shared messages in support of the Turkish government and President Tayyip Erdogan.One such message, written in Turkish, read: “You are hacked by the Turkish cyber army Ayyildiz Tim! We got your DM correspondence! We will show you the power of the Turk!”“We love the Turks and Muslims in the world,” another tweet, shared on Van Susteren’s account, read. “We condemn those who persecute them, especially in the United States, and we share their suffering . We love turkish soldiers , we love Erdogan, we love Turkey.”Bolling and Van Susteren appeared to have regained access to their accounts by Tuesday evening.Twitter did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for information about the hackers, but Bolling sent a tweet suggesting that the breach was done by “Legit Turkish hackers.”Van Susteren and Bolling did not return HuffPost’s requests for comment."

Trailblazer: The Story of Ballerina Raven Wilkinson begins with a forward from ballet dancer Misty Copeland, who has called Wilkinson her mentor, and ends with a letter from Wilkinson herself. The book, which was released Tuesday, looks at the dancer’s legendary career and how she opened doors for future performers.Illustrations and prose show that Wilkinson, who was born in 1935, always knew she was meant to dance. She made history in 1955, when she became the first black ballerina to sign with the touring company Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She danced with the troupe for six years and gained prestige performing in roles such as the solo waltz in “Les Sylphides.” Even after retiring from ballet, Wilkinson continued performing as a character dancer and actor until 2011.But while touring, the New York native also experienced a type of overt racism with which she was unfamiliar. Wilkinson was in danger whenever the troupe moved through the South during the Jim Crow era. She recounted some of those moments in an interview with Pointe magazine in 2014.“I remember one time in Montgomery, Alabama, the tour bus rolled into town, and everyone was running around with white robes and hoods on,” she told the publication. “They stopped traffic, there were so many of them. There was a rapping sound on the bus door, and this man jumped on in his hood and gown. Several big strapping male company dancers got up and moved toward him. He threw a fistful of racist pamphlets all over the bus before they chased him out.”Trailblazer follows Wilkinson’s career, which included stints with the Dutch National Ballet in the Netherlands and the New York City Opera, and ends with a scene of her presenting Copeland with flowers following the young dancer’s debut in “Swan Lake” ― closing with the idea that Copeland will continue what Wilkinson began.In 2015, Copeland became the first African-American ballerina to be a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre. She has also written three books, including a children’s book inspired by her relationship with Wilkerson. Copeland has said she looks to Wilkinson as an inspiration and as a sign that things can still be changed in the world of ballet. “She’s been through so much more than I could ever imagine, in the 1950s and experiencing racism in that time. It just felt like, I can do this,” Copeland told Time in an interview published Tuesday. “It made me feel really empowered not to let the negativity of racism even to this day affect me and my career. I can be strong and persevere and allow my talent to shine beyond the color of my skin.”"

The actress recently opened up about one of the couple’s dumbest fights, which occurred early on in their relationship. It all started because of music choices during a road trip to meet each other’s families.The two were riding a motorcycle from New York City to Detroit and Bell wasn’t happy with Shepard’s choice of “yacht rock outlaw country” music. During a pit stop on the trip, she decided to change the iPod to show tunes without Shepard’s knowledge. “Well, he was not happy,” Bell said, during her Tuesday appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” “Because I didn’t ask, we didn’t discuss it and it was also like, we’re both control freaks, [it’s] the beginning of our relationship.” The 37-year-old said that was just the beginning of the fight on the trip, which “got bigger and bigger” and somehow became an argument about something way more. Pretty soon, the two were fighting about helmet laws. “Dax Shepard believes that if he is in a state that does not have a helmet law he should be ‘observing the local culture’ and not wear his helmet,” she said. “This morphs into an even bigger fight and we ended up compromising on if he was on the highway, he had to wear the helmet. But if he was on side streets, he didn’t have to wear the helmet.”She added, “I’m not joking, he took side streets for like four hours just to make a point.” But things got far worse after Bell suggested Shepard wear a helmet when it started to rain. “The rest of the road trip, I think through Ohio up to Michigan, we were fighting so bad we both lost our voice because we were screaming at each other on the motorcycle,” she said. “And I refused to hold onto him, so I held onto the back of the motorcycle, like a boss.” "

Harrison admitted to police in March 2008 that he broke down a bedroom door, slapped his girlfriend in the face and broke her cellphone during an argument, but charges were dropped when he entered a counseling program.Harrison’s photo of the Draco invited backlash (and some admirers).“This is not necessary!!” one Instagram user wrote. “What kind of example you’re setting?!..Smh”“Dumbass glorifying guns,” another said.One responder referenced the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. “This is the musket the founders had in mind right?

The reality TV series, which ran on Bravo from 2003 to 2007, returns to Netflix next month in a hotly anticipated reboot. Simply called “Queer Eye,” the new version aims to please fans of the original by helping straight men refine their wardrobes, cultural pursuits and home décor once more. This time, however, the action takes place in Atlanta (which, the producers are quick to tout, is in the red state of Georgia) rather than New York. In keeping with the times, the new version is taking extra steps to be socially conscious, with nods to the LGBTQ community’s recent advances (and setbacks), the Black Lives Matter movement and more. The queer men leading the makeovers are: Antoni Porowski (food & wine), Bobby Berk (interior design), Karamo Brown (culture), Jonathan Van Ness (grooming) and Tan France (fashion).Series creator David Collins told Entertainment Weekly in December that he is excited for a new generation of viewers to discover “Queer Eye.” “The millennials don’t remember the old show,” he said. “It’s got such a great heart and soul and humor to it, so I’m excited for a new audience.”As to how “Queer Eye” will differ from its Emmy-winning predecessor, he added, “If the original round was about tolerance, this time it is about acceptance.” Queer Eye hits Netflix Feb. 7.

As Timberlake prepares to return to the Super Bowl halftime show in February, days after his new album “Man of the Woods” is set to drop, the performer is reflecting on his previous appearance on the stage.“Naturally, that’s something we talked about,” Timberlake, 36, told Beats 1’s Zane Lowe, referring to Jackson’s “wardrobe malfunction,” in his first public interview for his new album.“To be honest, it wasn’t too much of a conversation,” he continued. “It’s just one of those things where you go, like, ‘Yeah, what do you want me to say? We’re not going to do that again!’”Many believe Jackson was unfairly punished after the now-infamous TV moment dubbed “nipplegate.” MTV claimed the singer “engineered” the stunt, although Jackson and Timberlake admitted they agreed on a version of the costume reveal at the final rehearsal. They intended for the move to expose just Jackson’s red bra, but her breast was exposed when Timberlake inadvertently ripped off the bra as well. After the uproar, Jackson allegedly was uninvited from that year’s Grammy Awards, and her music videos were blacklisted. “I stumbled through it, to be quite honest,” Timberlake said of the scandal. He added: “I had my wires crossed and it’s just something that you have to look back on and go like, OK, well you know, you can’t change what’s happened, but you can move forward and learn from it.”The former NYSNC singer and Jackson didn’t speak for a period after the incident, but he said they’ve since made peace.“I don’t know that a lot of people know that,” he explained. “I don’t think it’s my job to do that, because you value the relationships that you do have with people.”While the Super Bowl scandal clearly isn’t his favorite topic of conversation, Timberlake has addressed the backlash before. In a 2006 interview with MTV, he admitted that he “got 10 percent of the blame,” while Jackson shouldered the rest. “I think America is harsher on women,” Timberlake said at the time. “I think America is unfairly harsh on ethnic people.”“I’m a part of a community that consider themselves artists,” he continued. “And if there’s something that I could have done in her defense, that was more, that I could have realized, then I would have.”Jackson, who recently completed a cross-country tour, has yet to comment on Timberlake’s return to the Super Bowl.This story has been updated to include more information on how Jackson and Timberlake’s “wardrobe malfunction” came about."

Nelson as its 17th president. Nelson, a former heart surgeon, was welcomed into the position during a live broadcast from Utah’s Salt Lake Temple on Tuesday. It was the first time in the Mormon church’s history that the announcement of a new president was streamed live around the world, in 29 languages.Speaking to reporters at a news conference, Nelson characterized his selection as “sacred and humbling.” He also paid tribute to his predecessor, Thomas Monson, who died at the age of 90 on Jan. 2. He had served as president since 2008.“No words can do justice to the magnitude and magnificence of his life,” Nelson said.At 93, Nelson is the second-oldest person in the 187-year-old church’s history to become president.Watch a recording of the announcement below.Nelson has been temporarily presiding over the church since his predecessor’s death. He was ordained for his new position during a religious ceremony on Sunday.The president of the Mormon church is believed to be a living prophet able to receive divine revelations from God. Succession is based strictly on seniority. Nelson was the longest-serving member of a church body known as the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which meant that he was next in line for the role of president. He became part of the Quorum in 1984.During the broadcast, Nelson announced that he had chosen two counselors to stand beside him in the First Presidency, the church’s highest governing body. As First Counselor, he chose Dallin H. Oaks, who has long been part of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and is next in line to be president. As Second Counselor, Nelson chose Henry B. Eyring, who served in the First Presidency under Monson.Given the church’s succession process, it’s unlikely the arrival of a new president will mean changes in how it approaches topics that have caused it controversy in recent years, such as queer sexuality and women in leadership roles.This became apparent when, after the presidency announcement, Nelson and his counselors fielded questions from reporters about the church’s future and vision.One reporter asked about outreach to queer Mormons, many of whom have said they feel ostracized by the church. In November 2015, the church adopted a policy that deemed same-sex couples “apostates.” It also prohibited children of these couples from getting blessed or baptized until they were 18 years old, at which point they need to disavow their parents’ marriage in order to join the church.Nelson said that while God loves all his children and wants them to have joy, there are certain challenges associated with following God’s commandments ― “challenges to be worthy to enter his holy presence.” Oaks was a bit more explicit in his response, suggesting that believers need to follow God’s commandments in order to receive blessings. “As leaders of the church we have a responsibility to teach love and also to teach the commandments of God,” Oaks said. Jana Riess, a Mormon blogger, said that the subtext of both men’s remarks “seemed to be a reiteration of the Church’s position that homosexual behavior is in violation of God’s commandments, but that all people are loved.” She also suggested it’s unlikely that the First Presidency’s traditional responses to concerns about women’s leadership and minority representation in the church will be satisfactory to Mormons with questions about these issues. “These will be issues to watch in the months going forward, as the new First Presidency defines its mission and eventual legacy,” Riess wrote in a blog for Religion News Service.

Aptly named “Solution,” this exfoliating skin perfector is Glossier’s answer to breakouts. Though it is the brand’s “most powerful formula yet,” it’s still surprisingly gentle for an exfoliator, using a light blend of acids to slough dead cells away rather than physical exfoliants like microbeads, grains and other harsh ingredients. Instead, this concoction uses a combination of alpha hydroxy, beta hydroxy, and polyhydroxy acids that work together to break down the gluey bonds that stick dead skin cell to the healthy ones beneath them. It’s used like a toner ― after cleansing, and before moisturizing. With daily use, Solution promises smaller pores, fewer blackheads and blemishes, and reduced redness after four weeks, in addition to Glossier’s signature smooth, glowing skin that the brand is known for. Plus, like Glossier’s other cult-beloved products, Solution is dermatologist-tested, paraben-free and cruelty-free. Try it yourself for only $24.

He never touched me or anything.”The Turpins were arrested and charged with child endangerment and torture on Sunday after police discovered 12 of their children locked inside their home, some chained to furniture and starving, in Perris, California. The 13th child ― a 17-year-old girl ― had managed to escape and alert the authorities of their situation.Flores said Wednesday that she didn’t witness the Turpins abusing their children while she lived with them briefly, but she said she did think they were “really strict.” She didn’t tell anyone about her brother-in-law’s habit of watching her in the shower because she was “young and scared,” she said.“I was treated like one of the kids kind of, so I had rules,” she said. “Now that I’m an adult and I look back, I see things that I didn’t see then.”Flores broke down in tears during the interview Wednesday, noting that her sister had cut her off from seeing the children for 20 years. She said she never thought to ask authorities to check on her nieces and nephews because her sister and brother-in-law had always been “private” people.“If it had been like two years ago that she cut us off than we might think, ‘Wow, you know, something’s not right,’” she said. ”But this has been going on before they even had children.”Officials said the 13 siblings, ages 2 to 29, had been living in “horrific” conditions and that many of them were dirty and malnourished. Still, Flores said, she is praying for her sister.“I want her to know that she’s still my blood and I love her,” Flores said. ”I don’t agree with what she did and her actions have made the whole family suffer, but I want her to know that I’m praying for her salvation.”She continued: “But mainly, I want to reach out to the kids. I want them to know that [for] years we begged to Skype them, we begged to see them ― the whole family. ... I want them to know that they do have family that ... love them.”"

Koprowski started work as the marketing director at the Heartland Institute, a right-wing think tank based outside Chicago, in July 2015. Former colleagues say he frequently raised his voice and threw tantrums if they questioned him. One described him as “violent generally.” He sent condescending emails to a female colleague, reprimanding her in almost comically sinister terms: “We will have no more insubordination.”Despite these outbursts, former colleagues say Koprowski enjoyed protected status in the office because of his friendship with Joseph Morris, a conservative Chicago lawyer who is also a major fundraiser for Heartland and a close ally to its chief executive, Joseph Bast. HuffPost spoke to three former staffers who confirmed these accounts, but requested anonymity for fear of retribution or jeopardizing future employment in the libertarian policy community.Heartland, they said, fostered a culture that allowed Koprowski, 52, to relentlessly harass a female subordinate half his age ― to the point where she took out a restraining order against him in October 2015. And though Koprowski was apparently fired sometime after the woman complained to human resources, her former colleagues say his termination came in response to other misbehavior ― not his repeated, undesired romantic pursuit of the woman who reported to him. Even after he was allegedly fired, Heartland kept the former executive in its protective orbit, former staffers say. Morris, who is listed on Heartland’s website as a policy adviser, is defending Koprowski in court against charges racked up when he contacted the woman over and over again, violating the protective order. Some of those charges were dropped in December, days after the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that a cyberstalking law used to charge Koprowski was unconstitutional, but the case is ongoing. The previously-unreported case of alleged stalking comes to light just as Heartland has become more powerful than ever. The think tank transformed itself over the past two decades from a defender of the tobacco industry ― under the banner of “smokers rights” ― to a leading proponent of climate change denial and champion of fossil fuels. Since the Trump administration came to power, Heartland has enjoyed unprecedented influence at the Environmental Protection Agency, and works closely with hard-line science skeptics in Congress such as Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt joined the members of Congress in November to speak at Heartland’s America First Energy Conference in Houston. Heartland’s contrarian skepticism on policy issues has extended to sexual harassment itself. In 2011, the organization posted a blog defending Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain against harassment accusations under the headline: “Women Crying ‘Sexual Harassment’ Should ’Man Up.’” In May 2017, the group republished an op-ed from Newsmax accusing female Fox News employees of making “disingenuous” sexual harassment allegations “seeking monetary ‘compensation’ into the millions of dollars.” Fox News hosts who dressed “sexily” in “short, short skirts and high, high heels with skimpy, skimpy tops,” it said, had “no standing to complain about male advances.” Heartland categorically denied any wrongdoing in a statement posted to its website in response to a list of questions from HuffPost.“The Heartland Institute is being targeted because our mission is fighting for a smaller, less-intrusive government and advancing free markets and greater individual liberty,” Bast said in the statement. “Our opponents in this debate cannot win on the merits of their arguments, so they stoop to circulate lies about our dedicated staff. Shame on them, and no, we will not stop until freedom is rising again.” The woman, whose name HuffPost is withholding to protect her privacy, repeatedly declined to be interviewed on the record. A former staffer contacted this reporter about Koprowski’s case after HuffPost published an article about Heartland putting a convicted child sex offender on a list submitted to the EPA. HuffPost corroborated the employee’s account with two other former staffers, internal emails provided by the tipster, and by obtaining hundreds of pages of court filings and police reports. The documents paint a disturbing picture of a man’s unabated obsession and how it terrified a younger woman who worked under him. Koprowski’s attorney has defended the relationship in court as misunderstood courtship. The alleged harassment began in September 2015. That month, Koprowski started flooding the woman’s Facebook and email with messages, mostly related to work and office gossip, according to police reports and court filings that included screenshots of the conversations. He offered her mentorship. She had lunch with him a few times. It was soon clear he wanted more. In October 2015, the woman told Koprowski that she wanted their relationship to remain strictly professional, and keep their conversations focused on work. But the woman’s account to police suggests he didn’t listen. He sent her a text message telling her how attractive she looked and how beautiful her eyes were. He emailed her to say the way she phrased a Facebook post about apple picking with her boyfriend suggested she knew, deep down, that Koprowski would be a superior lover to “that boy.” He emailed her again to tell her he was trying not to fall in love with her.The report, filed with the Tinley Park Police Department in Chicago’s southwest suburbs, states that she said she had already placed a complaint with Heartland’s human resources department on Oct. 19, 2015, and was working from home to avoid the office. What happened next is not entirely clear. According to the police report, the woman told officers Koprowski was “either terminated or resigned from her company” the next day on Oct. 20. In a company-wide email dated Nov. 21, 2015, and obtained by HuffPost, Bast said Koprowski had departed weeks later: “It didn’t work out, and he left in November.” The three former staffers say Koprowski was fired sometime that month ― because he lost his temper in front of a human resources executive and a coworker recorded one of his yelling fits, not because of the sexual harassment allegations. Either way, the former employees say Heartland gave Koprowski a week to clear out his desk, allowing him to linger in the office. “They were very responsive to donors, but very hands off in terms of its employees,” a former female staffer, who said she filed complaints about Koprowski’s abusive tirades, told HuffPost. “There wasn’t a lot of responsiveness if you had a complaint about another employee. It was very much, ‘you can deal with it yourself.’”“There’s protected status that is given to people who are friends with people who donate large sums of money,” said the former staffer, noting that work culture there made the woman who accused Koprowski of stalking “scared” to report him to higher-ups because she expected them to have his back. “It was outrageous, the things that happened at Heartland,” she added. “It was just crazy. The whole thing with Gene [Koprowski], to see an organization not take action at all after knowing that someone in their organization was being stalked and harassed, was disappointing to say the least.” According to the police report the woman filed, the woman worked from home the day after complaining to human resources, too afraid, a former colleague said, to come into the office. That day, Koprowski sent the woman an early-morning email. “I am worried about your health,” he wrote in English. Then, in Polish: “May the Lord heal you from illness.” He concluded, in Polish: “You were my joy … my love for you always.” The police included a translation in their report.The next day, Oct. 21, an attorney working for the woman sent Koprowski a cease and desist letter. He responded by calling her a liar and, according to the police report, insisting he hadn’t contacted her and that she had been stalking him. The woman told police she received a Halloween card in her mailbox the next day with a return address that listed a P.O. box in Koprowski’s name. “Let’s stay in touch! Gene,” the card read, with a smiley drawn after his name, according to the police report. The woman and her boyfriend continued to receive bizarre emails and calls that they believed were from Koprowski, including one in which he told the boyfriend he’d had sex with the woman on a work trip. This led her to file the report with the Tinley Park police on Oct. 26. A Will County judge ordered Koprowski to appear at a hearing the following month, and on Oct. 28 issued an order of protection that barred Koprowski from contacting the woman. But the police reports show Koprowski continued to contact the woman, sending a series of emails between Nov. 28 and Dec. 6. On Dec. 17, Tinley Park police arrested Koprowski for violating the order. The next day, the Will County State’s Attorney’s Office charged Koprowski on three counts of violating a stalking no-contact order, a misdemeanor in Illinois. He hired Andy Sotiropoulos, the attorney who represented him before Morris. While an intentional violation of a no-contact order is a Class A misdemeanor in Illinois, a second or subsequent violation can escalate to a Class 4 felony, according to a legal analysis on the Illinois State Bar Association’s website by Lori Levin, a Chicago attorney who handles domestic violence and stalking cases. Thomas Glasgow, founder of the Schaumburg, Illinois-based law firm Glasgow & Olsson, said how someone is charged for violating a stalking no-contact can vary by case.“The person may have violated the order of protection, and in a vacuum, each of those charges is a misdemeanor,” Glasgow told HuffPost. “But when you have multiple charges, that enhances it.” Five months after his initial misdemeanor charges, a grand jury indicted Koprowski on two felony charges of stalking, arguing that, under an existing cyberstalking statute, his repeated contact with the woman knowingly caused her emotional distress. On May 23, 2016, Sotiropoulos appeared in court and said he would no longer work for Koprowski. Reached by phone, Sotiropoulos declined to comment, citing “attorney-client privilege.” “I know where this is going and I don’t want it either way,” he said after asking from which outlet the reporter was calling. “It’s done and over.” It’s unclear when Morris took over the case. But in September 2017, he filed a motion to dismiss the felony charges, arguing that an appeals court ruling that found the cyberstalking law unconstitutional and that “ordinary, daily life consists of a series of encounters, events, conduct and speech that cause emotional distress,” makes “such a standard … nonsensical.” “If wooing a potential friend, lover, or romantic partner who is not interested in the wooer is a criminal act, then every human on the planet, male and female, runs the risk at one time or another in life of being a criminal under such a standard,” Morris wrote in the court filing. In December, the Will County State’s Attorney’s Office dropped two felony charges against him. That same month, Morris filed a motion to dismiss misdemeanor charges of violating the no-contact order, and a Will County Circuit Court judge declined to renew the woman’s order of protection. Koprowski is due back in court on Feb. 1 for another hearing. After HuffPost emailed Heartland spokesman Jim Lakely more than a dozen detailed questions, the organization responded by posting the aforementioned statement on its website, denying what it described as “false allegations” by a former employee. “We understand HuffPost may be writing an article based on a disgruntled former employee’s false allegations that The Heartland Institute has tolerated sexual harassment in the past. The accusation is completely false,” Bast said in the statement. “Heartland always has had policies and procedures in place to ensure a professional and safe environment for its employees.” Heartland then linked to a 2014 Gawker article that detailed sexual harassment allegations made against a former managing editor at HuffPost, and a recent Gizmodo story that accused the site’s former editor-in-chief, Arianna Huffington, of ignoring the alleged sexual misconduct. After this story published, Heartland reposted its statement on its website under the headline: “HUFFPOST ATTEMPTS TO SMEAR HEARTLAND AGAIN.” Heartland did not respond to questions about where the organization stands on Morris’ decision to represent its former employee. Neither Morris nor Koprowski returned calls and emails requesting comment.This article was updated to include the latest statement from Heartland. "

A Will County judge ordered Koprowski to appear at a hearing the following month, and on Oct. 28 issued an order of protection that barred Koprowski from contacting the woman. But the police reports show Koprowski continued to contact the woman, sending a series of emails between Nov. 28 and Dec. 6. On Dec. 17, Tinley Park police arrested Koprowski for violating the order. The next day, the Will County State’s Attorney’s Office charged Koprowski on three counts of violating a stalking no-contact order, a misdemeanor in Illinois. He hired Andy Sotiropoulos, the attorney who represented him before Morris. While an intentional violation of a no-contact order is a Class A misdemeanor in Illinois, a second or subsequent violation can escalate to a Class 4 felony, according to a legal analysis on the Illinois State Bar Association’s website by Lori Levin, a Chicago attorney who handles domestic violence and stalking cases. Thomas Glasgow, founder of the Schaumburg, Illinois-based law firm Glasgow & Olsson, said how someone is charged for violating a stalking no-contact can vary by case.“The person may have violated the order of protection, and in a vacuum, each of those charges is a misdemeanor,” Glasgow told HuffPost. “But when you have multiple charges, that enhances it.” Five months after his initial misdemeanor charges, a grand jury indicted Koprowski on two felony charges of stalking, arguing that, under an existing cyberstalking statute, his repeated contact with the woman knowingly caused her emotional distress. On May 23, 2016, Sotiropoulos appeared in court and said he would no longer work for Koprowski. Reached by phone, Sotiropoulos declined to comment, citing “attorney-client privilege.” “I know where this is going and I don’t want it either way,” he said after asking from which outlet the reporter was calling. “It’s done and over.” It’s unclear when Morris took over the case. But in September 2017, he filed a motion to dismiss the felony charges, arguing that an appeals court ruling that found the cyberstalking law unconstitutional and that “ordinary, daily life consists of a series of encounters, events, conduct and speech that cause emotional distress,” makes “such a standard … nonsensical.” “If wooing a potential friend, lover, or romantic partner who is not interested in the wooer is a criminal act, then every human on the planet, male and female, runs the risk at one time or another in life of being a criminal under such a standard,” Morris wrote in the court filing. In December, the Will County State’s Attorney’s Office dropped two felony charges against him. That same month, Morris filed a motion to dismiss misdemeanor charges of violating the no-contact order, and a Will County Circuit Court judge declined to renew the woman’s order of protection. Koprowski is due back in court on Feb. 1 for another hearing. After HuffPost emailed Heartland spokesman Jim Lakely more than a dozen detailed questions, the organization responded by posting the aforementioned statement on its website, denying what it described as “false allegations” by a former employee. “We understand HuffPost may be writing an article based on a disgruntled former employee’s false allegations that The Heartland Institute has tolerated sexual harassment in the past. The accusation is completely false,” Bast said in the statement. “Heartland always has had policies and procedures in place to ensure a professional and safe environment for its employees.” Heartland then linked to a 2014 Gawker article that detailed sexual harassment allegations made against a former managing editor at HuffPost, and a recent Gizmodo story that accused the site’s former editor-in-chief, Arianna Huffington, of ignoring the alleged sexual misconduct. After this story published, Heartland reposted its statement on its website under the headline: “HUFFPOST ATTEMPTS TO SMEAR HEARTLAND AGAIN.” Heartland did not respond to questions about where the organization stands on Morris’ decision to represent its former employee. Neither Morris nor Koprowski returned calls and emails requesting comment.This article was updated to include the latest statement from Heartland. "

65,WOMEN,This Badass Ellen Pompeo Interview Is A Call For Women Everywhere To Get Paid,Jenna Amatulli,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ellen-pompeo-women-pay-weinstein_us_5a5f671ee4b0ee2ff32c80ad,"The actress shared ""Grey's Anatomy"" gossip and talked about knowing your worth with The Hollywood Reporter.",2018-01-17,"Ellen Pompeo arrives at the 300th episode celebration for ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy"" on Nov. 4, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5f6dc21f00009a00db92cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ellen Pompeo’s latest interview with The Hollywood Reporter reveals an actress who has absolutely no time for gender inequality and wants you to know that had Harvey Weinstein tried anything with her, she “probably would have picked up a vase and cracked him over the fucking head.”The “Grey’s Anatomy” star is the highest-paid actress on a primetime drama and recently signed a whopping new deal that’ll take her through seasons 15 and 16 (should they be ordered) of the show. With a $20 million salary ― that’s $575,000 per episode ― and a seven-figure signing bonus, plus two full backend equity points on the series (estimated to be worth another $6 to $7 million), Pompeo clearly knows how to get her due.In a very candid interview published Wednesday, Pompeo talked about money, being bold and knowing her worth “in the hope of setting an example for others as women in Hollywood seize a new moment of empowerment and opportunity.”Pompeo said she scored her current massive paycheck because she told showrunner Shonda Rhimes she needed to be incentivized, “to feel empowered and to feel ownership of this show.” She also mentioned that she’d once asked for $5,000 more than former co-star Patrick Dempsey “just on principle, because the show is ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ and I’m Meredith Grey” ― but they wouldn’t give it to her.“I could have walked away [at that point], so why didn’t I? It’s my show; I’m the number one. I’m sure I felt what a lot of these other actresses feel: Why should I walk away from a great part because of a guy?” she explained. “You feel conflicted but then you figure, ‘I’m not going to let a guy drive me out of my own house.’”Here are some other notable quotables from the interview (bold added by HuffPost).On her talent: I’m not the most “relevant” actress out there. I know that’s the industry perception because I’ve been this character for 14 years. But the truth is, anybody can be good on a show season one and two. Can you be good 14 years later? Now, that’s a fuckin’ skill.On the current state of Hollywood:I’m not necessarily perceived as successful, either, but a 24-year-old actress with a few big movies is, even though she’s probably being paid shit — certainly less than her male co-star and probably with no backend. And they’re going to pimp her out until she’s 33 or 34 and then she’s out like yesterday’s trash, and then what does she have to take care of herself? These poor girls have no real money, and the studio is making a fortune and parading them like ponies on a red carpet. I mean, Faye Dunaway is driving a fuckin’ Prius today. Now, there’s nothing wrong with a Prius, but my point is, she had no financial power. If we’re going to invoke change, that has to be part of it.On Weinstein, the disgraced movie mogul:My agent once sent me to see Harvey, too. I went right up to his room at the Peninsula, which I would never normally do, but Harvey was a New York guy, so it made sense. Plus, it was in the middle of the day, and he had an assistant there. He didn’t try anything on me. Had he, I’m a little rough around the edges and I grew up around some very tough people, so I probably would have picked up a vase and cracked him over the fucking head. But I also feel completely comfortable saying that I walked into that room batting the shit out of my eyelashes. My goal in that room was to charm him, as it is in most rooms like that. You think, “Not only do I have to show that I’m a good actress, but that director also has to in some way fall in love with me and at least become enamored with me.” That never felt right or good to me. And I’ve had conversations with my agent 17 years later where I said, “You sent me into that room knowing …” They claim they didn’t know.You can read the entire interview here."

They sang songs, shouted cheers and made statements of support for the young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, a group of whom were watching the action from a balcony one floor up.Police arrested 82 protesters, U.S. Capitol Police communications director Eva Malecki told HuffPost. The protesters were charged for “crowding, obstructing, or incommoding” in a public building. Activists from Jewish groups, including the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Bend the Arc Jewish Action and the Anti-Defamation League, were there to demand immediate passage of the Dream Act, legislation that could protect nearly 800,000 Dreamers from imminent deportation and provide them with a pathway to citizenship. “It really speaks to who we are as a Jewish community, and specifically as an American Jewish community,” Barbara Weinstein, associate director of the Religious Action Center, told HuffPost. “We as Jews know the experience of being immigrants. And as Americans, we’re deeply aware of our history as a nation of immigrants, and that throughout that history immigrants have been a source of strength for this country.”Weinstein, who was at Wednesday’s action, said the peaceful protest was intended to bring awareness to the Dreamers’ plight and urge Congress to act on legislation that would protect them from deportation.“This is an issue that has bipartisan support ― Republicans and Democrats know this is the right thing to do,” she said. “Now it’s Congress’s responsibility to pass a clean Dream Act.”The Dream Act, a longstanding wish of immigration reformers, has found renewed support since the Trump administration announced in September it would terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

But the pope has indicated he’s interested in clarifying whether there’s historical precedent for women to serve as ordained deacons, who can perform some of the duties of a priest. A new survey of American Catholic women suggests many are ready for that change.A 60 percent majority of American Catholic women support the possibility of women being ordained as permanent deacons, according to a wide-ranging survey commissioned by America Media and conducted by the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University, in partnership with survey firm GfK.Twenty-one percent of respondents said they may be supportive but wanted to learn more before making a final decision. Only 7 percent definitely said they would not support women being ordained as deacons. Catholic women who attended Mass weekly were less likely than more infrequent Mass attenders to respond “yes” to the idea of women deacons. But even among weekly attendees, a slight majority (53 percent) agreed the church should allow women to be ordained as deacons.A permanent deacon in the Catholic church can preach during Mass, perform baptisms, witness marriages and conduct funeral services. He can be married or single, and has to be at least 35 years old. In 2016, Pope Francis created a special commission to study the possibility of women serving as deacons. Because of an emphasis on continuity and tradition in the Catholic church, Francis is likely not interested in changing the status quo or applying modern societal standards to the question of women’s ordination. The commission was only created to study whether there’s a historical precedent for women to serve as deacons.Experts in Catholic church law have supported the idea of women deacons in the past. Some scholars claim there’s ample evidence of women being ordained to the diaconate from the early years of the church and into the Middle Ages. But others fear that opening the diaconate to women could one day undermine the church’s all-male priesthood. According to Phyllis Zagano, a Catholic scholar at Hofstra University who was named to the pope’s commission on women deacons, women in the U.S. and around the world are already performing duties similar to those of deacons. She believes ordaining women as deacons would assure women they are also created in the image of Christ.“The Church and its bishops can train, ordain, and give faculties to the women already working in diaconal roles in the US and elsewhere,” Zagano told HuffPost in 2016. “In doing so, it would recognize the deep anger so many women have in being told ― implicitly or explicitly ― that women cannot image Christ.” The question about women deacons was just one part of the survey from America Media and CARA about the lives and opinions of Catholic women today. Researchers also found that while the overwhelming majority of American Catholic women believe in God, Mass attendance and participation in sacraments such as confession is dwindling, especially among younger Catholics. Only 17 percent of millennial Catholics indicated that they attend Mass at least once a week. The survey results were “a real wake-up call for the Catholic Church to focus harder on its millennial outreach and to engage them in new and creative ways,” said Kerry Weber, executive editor of America Media.The study of 1,508 self-identifying Catholic women was conducted between Aug. 3-24, 2017, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points."

Over the years, some of this vocabulary has gained wider currency, like the term “rainbow baby,” which refers to a child born after a miscarriage, stillbirth, infant death or other early loss of a child.There’s another related term that hasn’t reached the mainstream yet: “sunshine baby.”A sunshine baby is one who was born before a miscarriage, stillbirth, infant death or other early loss of a child. Just as a rainbow baby represents the hope after a storm, a sunshine baby represents the calm before. The child lost is often referred to as an “angel baby.”After losing her angel baby, Angelique Zachara turned to crafting to find healing, celebrate her sunshine baby and nurture her hope for a rainbow baby.For Zachara, a sunshine baby also represents hope. “You were able to conceive one child successfully,” she told HuffPost. “Even though that often gets brought up when going through a miscarriage, and that’s not really what you want to hear, truthfully we are lucky enough to have one, whereas some people were never given that chance or had that taken away from them.”“Most women who encounter loss believe they are flawed or broke,” said Rachael DuVall, a follower of the Facebook page Miscarriage Mamas. “We internalize and blame ourselves for our miscarriages, so sunshine babies give the hope that it is possible and there is nothing wrong with mom and dad, it was just something that happened.”Jessica Zucker, a clinical psychologist who specializes in women’s reproductive and maternal mental health, has researched the ways that loss affects family dynamics. She told HuffPost the idea of a sunshine baby can have different meanings for different families. “Depending on the circumstances of the subsequent loss, mothers might look back at the naiveté they were able to relish with the ‘sunshine baby.’ This child might come to represent a period of relative calm or, at the very least, a grief-free period of parenting,” she explained. This sentiment resonates with Zucker herself, whose second pregnancy ended in a miscarriage at 16 weeks.“Sometimes I find myself reminiscing about who I was as a woman and a mother prior to my pregnancy loss and the maze of grief I navigated afterward,” she said. “Included in those daydreams are all the moments with my ‘sunshine baby,’ my son, who came into the world after a very smooth and peaceful pregnancy. He entered a home not tinged with remnants of mourning.”Zucker believes that using symbols like “sunshine” and “rainbow” helps us talk about loss and hope.“I find the terms important in that they acknowledge the complexity of pregnancy and infant loss and the pregnancies that follow,” she said. “Losing a wanted pregnancy invariably impacts the way we feel about the children we have underfoot and/or those we hold in our hearts. I think as a culture it behooves us to recognize just how challenging these losses can be for women and families, and these terms help ground us in that.”But Misty Hernandez, a moderator for Miscarriage Mamas, doesn’t particularly like the term sunshine baby.“I honestly don’t think it is a positive thing,” she told HuffPost. “The term ‘sunshine’ is taken away from any parent whose first pregnancy resulted in a loss. Some women may mourn the loss of their sunshine even more once they realize that they will never, ever experience one.”Still, she embraces the term rainbow baby. “After every storm there is a rainbow, and rainbows bring an unimaginable amount of joy to you and even a sense of peace knowing that you have a beautiful, precious little baby,” Hernandez said."

Former “Saturday Night Live” cast member Jay Pharoah has already been picked to portray Pryor. The “Foxy Brown” actress, who wrote about her relationship with the comedian in her book Foxy: My Life in Three Acts, told Deadline that she thought Pharoah was the perfect person to play Pryor. “I watched him and heard his voice and closed my eyes and said, ‘It’s Richard,’” she said.Pharoah, who read a script by Bennie Richburg, told Deadline that the story is “heartbreaking, raw, honest and beautiful, all rolled into one testimony.”Grier is known for dominating the blaxploitation film era with classic roles in movies like “Coffy,” “Jackie Brown” and “Sheba, Baby.” She made her mark in Hollywood by becoming one of the first black female leads to star in several action films. Taraji P. Henson gave a nod to Grier’s legacy with her most recent film, “Proud Mary.”A release date for the biopic has yet to be announced. "

The illustrations are charming and the story is a nice, short read for bedtime.” ― Kyndra Elston“I give the book I wrote titled Esteban de Luna, Baby Rescuer! I wrote it after I had my son to encourage little boys to see the skills of caring and nurturing as ‘superhero’ skills. Plus, it features baby-wearing and it’s bilingual!” ― Larissa Mercado-Lopez“I Love You, Stinky Face by Lisa McCourt. For the same reasons many have said about their suggestions, no matter how gross they get, how scary or awful they behave, we will find a way to love them ― no matter what.” ― Jessica Case“The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle. I grew up with it, read it to both my girls, and now my oldest daughter reads it to her baby sister. That book is like a tradition.” ― Morgan Allen“Giraffes Can’t Dance by Giles Andreae is one of our faves to give. Everyone has their own beat and you just do you, don’t worry about what anyone else’s talents or gifts are, you have your own!” ― Amanda Hanstad“Miss Rumphius by Barbara Cooney. The illustrations are gorgeous, and the idea of the book, to find a way to make the world more beautiful, is really a lovely thought, I think.” ― Alexis Dionne Campbell“Everywhere Babies by Susan Meyers. It’s a simple board book talking about how no matter where babies are born, they have families who love them, rock them, feed them, play with them. The artwork is beautiful and I love how diverse the families are in the book.” ― Meaghan Breaux“Ten Little Fingers and Ten Little Toes by Mem Fox. Talks about how we’re all the same despite our different backgrounds and how this little child is especially precious because they’re ‘mine all mine.’ A sweet little rhyme.” ― Keren Strathearn“You Are My I Love You by Maryann Cusimano Love, illustrated by Satomi Ichikawa. This book shows the impact that parents and children have on each other. It shows the relational balance between parent and child. It is so simple and relatable.” ― Shannon Turner-Ivsek“Each Peach Pear Plum from Allan and Janet Ahlberg. Lovely to read. Beautiful rhymes and illustration. Both kids loved it. Always give it as a present.” ― Ana Camelo“The Runaway Bunny by Margaret Wise Brown. Beautiful illustrations and great message of providing support while allowing kids to have independence and adventure.” ― Suzen Ruis“Chicka Chicka Boom Boom from Bill Martin Jr. and John Archambault. I love giving this book because it’s lyrical and fun to read a lot. As babies get older, it’s fun for them to start reading as they recognize the letters and sounds.” ― Natasha Lewis“Outside Over There by Maurice Sendak. The main character is a girl who saves her baby sister. I appreciate a children’s book with a strong female character! I also love this book because it teaches children to have a good imagination with their ordinary world around them.” ― Rachel LaCour“Rosie Revere, Engineer by Andrea Beaty. It’s for older kids but the rhymes are wonderful, the theme is poignant and timely, and the drawings are colorful and warm. I love giving this book to future parents of girls.” ― Caity Yaussi“Someday by Alison McGhee. I still can’t even read it without choking up. It is about the life cycle, about your first memories with your baby, watching them grow, the conflicting feelings you have in life. It says so much with so few words. The line is something like, ‘Sometimes I watch you sleep, and I dream too...’ (seriously crying just writing this and my kid is 4-and-a-half).” ― Amber Manke“The Wonderful Things You Will Be by Emily Winfield Martin ― multicultural, with the sweetest faces and soft artwork, wondering what the little one might be like as he/she grows. And it subtly breaks gender biases, too.” ― Diane Dietz“Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? from Bill Martin Jr. and Eric Carle. All of my babies have loved this book. We all have it memorized and when we are in the car and the youngest one gets fussy we all start reciting the book, with the same pace and inflection I did when they were all babies. I always give it as a gift for a baby shower or first birthday.” ― Wendy Fortner“The Paper Bag Princess by Robert Munsch, especially for little girls. Early lessons in empowerment.” ― Rebecca Erin“Why Does Mommy Have Tattoos? by Marilyn Rondon is colorful and quick, but it was a cute read about tattoos. Most of them I have myself so my son loved pointing out mine that matched the part in the story. Absolutely love it.” ― Lauren Elizabeth Metzel“Sleep Like a Tiger by Mary Logue. The art is gorgeous and it tells the story of a little girl going to bed so gently. In response to her assertion that she isn’t tired, her parents just say, ’We understand. Please brush your teeth. You can stay up as late as you like.′ It’s just lovely and presents an example of engaging with your child that isn’t adversarial. I think it’s a nice model and so pretty.” ― Allison Sook“Let Me Hold You Longer by Karen Kingsbury. We focus so much on our kids’ ‘firsts’ but sometimes miss the last time that they’ll ever do some of these things. My grandmother gave it to me for my first child and I give it at every baby shower I go to. I can’t read it without crying but it is a beautiful book.” ― Heather Todd“Wherever You Are, My Love Will Find You by Nancy Tillman. We are a military family and right before my husband’s third deployment he recorded that book for our children. This meant so much to our children being able to hear his voice. So now I give this book to my friends/family having babies because usually I’m the one that doesn’t live close by. I want them to know I’ll love them no matter where I am.” ― Kassie Rice“Russell the Sheep by Rob Scotton. Brilliant children’s book. It’s about a sheep who can’t fall asleep like the rest of the flock.” ― Marie Aldous “Llama Llama Red Pajama from Anna Dewdney is my son’s favorite book. The baby llama wants his momma (he’s supposed to be going to sleep) and screams bloody murder when she doesn’t come back up right away. Good book for opening conversations about patience, anxiety, and nighttime fears! Ten years later, I can still recite it from memory. Also check out a recent rap version by Ludacris on YouTube.” ― Elizabeth Washburn Galbraith“Wish by Matthew Cordell. I know far too many couples who have struggled to get pregnant or who have lost babies. This is a beautiful book that outlines that struggle and the wish of the parents to have their family grow.” ― Kayla Stremel“Welcome, Baby by Barbara Reid. As a new mom wanting to read a book to her newborn it was perfect. The length was great for a newborn and infant, and it is dead-on without being over the top sappy about how it is to welcome a baby into your world.” ― Behnaz Somji“The Snail and the Whale by Julia Donaldson. A really intricate story about travel, and family, and beauty, and awe, and carving your own path, and how even small things and people can make a big impact on the world and those they love, but it’s so accessible to even small kids, and so beautifully written. Sometimes I read it just for myself.” ― Meghan Hart Arbuckle“Stellaluna by Janell Cannon. Perfect length, great story. Cute silly bits, a perfect message of inclusion and acceptance. And opens up a conversation about how to deal with embarrassment, as well as modeling non-bullying behavior perfectly.” ― Stefany Brianne Stevenson Hess“Hush Little Keiki by Kim Vukovich. Lovely Hawaiian version of the classic lullaby, but so much more beautiful. I love finding books with local relevance; this has been my favorite.” ― Erica Hanley“Something From Nothing by Phoebe Gilman. Two parallel stories happening, one about a little boy and his faith in his grandfather; the other follows a little mouse family who lives underneath the floors of the little boy. My daughter made me read it, night after night, and 10 years later I’m rereading it with my youngest.” ― Tara Dean“The ‘Lil’ Libros’ collection [by Patty Rodriguez and Ariana Stein]! If you haven’t looked them up, I recommend you do. They are amazing bilingual board books with amazing illustrations.” ― Karina Wong“The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf. He just wants to smell the roses, be happy, and be himself.” ― Stephanie Tapia“The Monster at the End of This Book by Jon Stone is my favorite to give because it speaks directly to kids and involves them in the story. It really makes them giggle, too.” ― Kristin Miller“One of the ‘BabyLit’ primer board books (Pride & Prejudice for counting, Sherlock Holmes for sounds, etc.). They’re sturdy, colorful, fun, and introduce the classics!” ― Mellissa Miller “I like Older Than The Stars by Karen C. Fox. It’s a great way to introduce scientific literacy at a young age.” ― Victoria Simms“Where the Sidewalk Ends by Shel Silverstein. It’s creative, fun, and can be enjoyed at any stage of life.” ― Amber McGawResponses have been condensed and edited for clarity."

75,POLITICS,Trump’s Racist Comments May Actually Help Some Immigrants Stay In The U.S.,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-shithole-help-immigrants-stay_us_5a5d6ec3e4b03c4189684844,Lawyers fighting the president’s policies in court love it when he speaks off the cuff.,2018-01-16,"Protestor Pierre Gabriel from Haiti carries flags during a march on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in Times Square. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5d716b220000251ab4e90d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s comments last week that the United States should try to attract immigrants from places like Norway instead of “shithole countries” like Haiti or El Salvador weren’t just racist. They also expose his immigration policies to challenge in federal court, and may even allow some of the people he’s trying to deport to stay in the U.S.Here’s why: Trump made the “shithole countries” remark while defending his decision to cancel Temporary Protected Status ― a designation that offers deportation relief and work authorization to people from countries afflicted by natural disasters or war ― for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan.Stripping people of TPS is well within the president’s authority. But if Trump did so with the intention to discriminate against them because of their national origin or race (most Haitians are black, while most Norwegians are white), his administration may once again find itself in federal court defending the constitutionality of its actions.Immigration lawyers who defend people facing deportation will be sure to cite Trump’s comments, too.“I can guarantee I’ll be making an argument that this administration is discriminating based on national origin and race when I have a client who happens to be from Haiti, El Salvador, or Africa,” said Luis Mancheno, an attorney for Bronx Defenders, a nonprofit legal services group. “Or, honestly, anyone who’s not from Norway.”No group has yet announced a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s decision to cancel TPS for countries he reportedly derided as “shitholes.” But lawyers told HuffPost the comments could be used as evidence to support a claim that Trump canceled the program with discriminatory intent. “This administration gives us an almost continual flow of circumstantial evidence that would support a conclusion of racial discrimination and bias,” Thomas Saenz, executive director of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told HuffPost. “This latest fiasco certainly provides an important piece of evidence. It’s a pretty strong indication that [Trump] has racially discriminatory views that then influence his policy concerns, including cancelling TPS.”The Trump administration already faces several lawsuits accusing the president of discrimination. The courts temporarily blocked his restrictions on travel from several Muslim-majority countries last year, partly over the allegation that he changed U.S. policy with the goal of targeting Muslims. And a lawsuit filed in New York by a coalition of 15 states, along with the District of Columbia, accuses Trump of ordering the cancellation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program as part of an “animus-driven” effort to discriminate against Mexicans. (DACA, an Obama-era initiative, allows undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as minors to avoid deportation and to work legally. More than three-quarters of DACA recipients were born in Mexico.) Those lawsuits are peppered with Trump tweets and and passages from campaign speeches. He announced his candidacy by referring to Mexican immigrants broadly as “rapists” who are “bringing crime,” the New York lawsuit notes. One of his tweets referred to protesters carrying the Mexican flag as “criminals” and “thugs.” “For those of us in the immigrant rights world who seek to defend the interests and rights of immigrants, we always welcome the president saying exactly what he feels,” Justin Cox, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups suing to overturn the DACA cancellation, told HuffPost. “Even though that can be exceedingly painful for everyone to see.”Challenging officials on equal protection grounds is often difficult. Those making such claims in court have to prove discrimination was intentional in an era when public officials rarely make overtly racist comments. Instead, those legal challenges often have to show that a new law or policy disproportionately impacts a certain group, or that authorities violated normal procedures to push through a change ― a standard laid out in a 1970s Supreme Court housing discrimination case Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.But every time Trump fires off a statement that punctures the barriers of political correctness ― like the “shithole countries” comment, or when he reportedly said the United States shouldn’t take more immigrants from Haiti because they “all have AIDS” ― he makes it that much easier to prove in court that his administration is changing immigration policy for reasons that have more to do with personal prejudice than national security. On Friday, U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued an order detailing claims the Trump administration will face in the challenge to kill DACA. He allowed the claim alleging discriminatory intent to move forward.  In that ruling, Alsup cited a case in which Arizona banned the Tucson school district from teaching Mexican-American studies classes. The lawyers who challenged the ethnic studies law based their claim that officials discriminated against Hispanic students in large part on the Arlington Heights case. But one of the officials who carried out the Mexican-American studies restrictions was John Huppenthal, the former head of the state public education system, who was outed as an internet troll in 2014. Huppenthal’s mean-spirited comments about Hispanics played a major role in overturning the ethnic studies law. “Huppenthal’s blog comments provide the strongest evidence that racial animus motivated the enforcement of” the state law against the Mexican-American studies program, Judge A. Wallace Tashima wrote in the opinion finding the restrictions unconstitutional. One day, Trump might find himself on the losing end of a similar ruling. "

Banfield also said that the “reckless” public allegation made by the woman compromised the #MeToo movement to combat sexual misconduct. “So I have to ask you: What exactly was your beef?” Banfield said. “That you had a bad date with Aziz Ansari? Is that what victimized you to the point of seeking a public conviction and a career-ending sentence against him? Is that what you truly think he deserved for your night out?”“What you have done, in my opinion, is appalling,” the anchor continued. “You went to the press with a story of a bad date and you have potentially destroyed this man’s career over it.”Banfield said the woman’s account “chiseled away” at the #MeToo movement’s efforts to combat sexual misconduct.Other opposing voices joined in through prominent media outlets. Caitlin Flanagan wrote in The Atlantic that the actor did not deserve to be “destroyed” and that the article was “3,000 words of revenge porn” intended “to hurt and humiliate Ansari.”The headline for a New York Times Op-Ed piece read: “Aziz Ansari Is Guilty. Of Not Being A Mind Reader.” The article, written by a Times opinion section editor, Bari Weiss, said, “There is a useful term for what [the woman] experienced on her night with Mr. Ansari. It’s called ‘bad sex.’ It sucks.”On Sunday, Ansari told HuffPost in a statement that he believed the sexual activity was “completely consensual.”In an interview with the website babe, the 23-year-old woman described a first date last year with Ansari in which she said he repeatedly tried to initiate sex while ignoring her verbal and non-verbal cues.“Most of my discomfort was expressed in me pulling away and mumbling,” she said. “I know I was physically giving off cues that I wasn’t interested. I don’t think that was noticed at all, or if it was, it was ignored.”She eventually characterized the encounter as “sexual assault” and went public after watching Ansari wear a Time’s Up pin at the Golden Globe awards show earlier this month. The star of the Netflix show “Master of None” won the award for Best Actor In A Television Series Musical or Comedy."
79,ENTERTAINMENT,Jason Gould: Baring His Soul And Singing His Song,"Dustin Fitzharris, ContributorJournalist in New York",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jason-gould-baring-his-soul-and-singing-his-song_us_5a5d4fa9e4b003efadb6b06d,"Jason Gould's first full-length CD, Dangerous Man, has the big notes and sweeping vocals of a Josh Groban, but if you scratch",2018-01-16,<p>“I am somebody who cares about being as authentic as possible.” - Jason Gould</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5d59691f00004700db8dd0.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jason Gould's first full-length CD, Dangerous Man, has the big notes and sweeping vocals of a Josh Groban, but if you scratch beneath the surface, you’ll find his storytelling is more Joni Mitchell. The 12 songs—a combination of original material and standards—gives you a window into Gould’s journey of love, forgiveness and self-acceptance. Gould is an appealing, adult contemporary artist with a soothing yet soaring sound. His powerful, mid-range voice can also send a note into a thrilling falsetto. With his long, curly brown locks and charming smile, he is reserved, modest and some say even shy. Gould is seemingly more concerned about others and the environment than he is about anything else. Except, of course, his dog Eli! If Gould’s talent seems effortless, it comes naturally. He’s the son of Barbra Streisand and Elliott Gould. Although he grew up in the spotlight, he has always been fiercely private. Now he’s ready to open up about what he's learned through his years in therapy and recovery programs. ""I'm not deceived by the material world. Having grown up around all of that stuff, it gives one a different perception,” Gould says. “I know what matters in life.” In a rare interview, Gould talks about his new album produced by Quincy Jones, letting go and standing in his own truth with his art. When people hear your voice and these songs on “Dangerous Man,” what do you hope they take away?I have no control over what other people think. As far as I’m concerned it’s an offering. It’s going to touch some people and others may not respond to it, and that’s okay. I don’t claim to know what it’s going to do for anybody. I really think this is a record about intimacy. I didn’t even know that until now that it’s done and it’s out. Every song is really about a different aspect of intimacy—intimacy with others, intimacy with ourselves, intimacy with God or a higher power. The CD is called “Dangerous Man.” Are you a dangerous man?I don’t think I’m dangerous. I do think it is provocative, and I do like to be provocative. I don’t think I’m dangerous; unless you consider vulnerable or honest dangerous. For some people that is dangerous. What is the biggest misconception about you?I have no idea what anyone thinks about me. When you are in the public eye in some way people do make assumptions about you, and often those are not true. I am somebody who cares about being as authentic as possible. That’s part of what my path in life is about. You've said that you're a strong proponent of self-awareness. What are you aware of about who you are? I really value honesty and self-responsibility. These are things that have taken time and commitment to get to in myself, and I’m attracted to those qualities in other people. I’m not drawn to people who are caught up in superficiality and ego. I see through that really quickly. I think only from that place of knowing yourself can you really connect with another person at the deepest level, which is what so many of these songs are about. ""Dangerous Man"" has a song called “My Song.” In it you sing: ""I tried so hard to please, denying my own needs."" Are you a people pleaser? I think that’s something I’ve grown out of. When I was younger I thought that if I molded myself to the way that I thought you wanted me to be then you would like me or love me. Now I’ve learned that’s not the way.You promoted the CD on Twitter by saying, ""Available for dating, I mean download, or either."" It was really cute.Well, I can be cute. I can have a sense of humor. I guess that goes along with misconceptions. Some people probably think of you as a serious person.I think you can be spiritual and silly at the same time.""All's Forgiven” is a song that moves with great intensity and contains the lyrics: ""I know you did the best you could, forgiving you has done me good."" Who or what are you singing those words to?There could be many people in my life. For me the song is about the power of forgiveness. What I’m interested in is freedom. I’ve learned that only through forgiveness can you achieve freedom. I’ve experienced anger, hurt and disappointment in many relationships. When I was writing that song I was thinking about kids who grow up where they are not accepted by their own family about being gay or transgender or whatever it is. That was an inspiration, but it’s not limited to that. We are only in the first few weeks of 2018, but if a genie gave you a lamp and said you can make three wishes for this year, what would they be?I’m very excited about women claiming and reclaiming their power. I think we’re in the midst of a revolution of female energy. I’d love for more women to step into positions of power in terms of politics. I so care about the state of this planet. Obviously this administration is not terribly concerned about that, but I certainly hope there is a shift there. Do you need one more? Nothing is coming to me right now.Have you always been this humble and gracious?I mean, I’ve never been an arrogant prick. As I’ve done more and more work on myself, I know who I am, and that’s a quality [humility] that I like in myself and others.What do you do for fun?I’m a pretty laid-back guy. I like hanging out with friends, going to the movies and playing games. I have a dog, which brings me tremendous joy. I’m not somebody who is going to be out at the clubs smoking a cigarette and drinking. The simple things in life fulfill me.

Refugee Agency (UNHCR), responding to the plan, said they were concerned about forcibly repatriating over 650,000 Rohingya who fled to neighboring Bangladesh after a conflict erupted in western Rakhine state in August.Statements from the Myanmar and Bangladesh foreign ministries said Bangladesh would set up five transit camps on its side of the border. Those camps would send Rohingyas to two reception centers in Myanmar. The repatriation process would start next Tuesday, the statements said.Myanmar said it would build a transit camp that can house 30,000 returnees.The Bangladesh statement said “Myanmar has reiterated its commitment to stop (the) outflow of Myanmar residents to Bangladesh”.Guterres said the UNHCR had not been involved directly in the agreement and that “it will be very important to have UNHCR fully involved in the operation to guarantee that the operations abide by international standards.”“A huge effort of reconciliation is needed to allow it to take place properly,” Guterres told reporters. “The worst would be to move these people from camps in Bangladesh to camps in Myanmar, keeping an artificial situation for a long time and not allowing for them to regain their normal lives.”Myanmar stressed the need for both sides to take preventive measures against possible Rohingya attacks and said it gave Dhaka a list with the names of 1,000 alleged militants.The crisis erupted after Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts on Aug. 25 in Rakhine triggered a fierce military response that the United Nations denounced as ethnic cleansing. Some 650,000 people fled the violence.The military denies ethnic cleansing, saying its security forces mounted legitimate counter-insurgency clearance operations.The Bangladesh statement called for repatriating orphans and “children born out of unwarranted incidence”, a reference to cases of rape resulting in pregnancy, said a Bangladesh foreign ministry official who declined to be identified.The rape of Rohingya women by Myanmar’s security forces was widespread, according to interviews with women conducted at displacement camps by U.N. medics and activists. The military denies it was involved in any sexual assaults.VERIFICATION PROCESSA UNHCR spokesman said on Tuesday the Rohingya should return voluntarily only when they feel it is safe to do so.“Major challenges have to be overcome,” UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic told a news briefing in Geneva. “These include ensuring they are told about the situation in their areas of origin ... and are consulted on their wishes, that their safety is ensured.”Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay told Reuters last week the returnees could apply for citizenship “after they pass the verification process”.Myint Kyaing, permanent secretary at Myanmar’s Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population, told Reuters this month Myanmar would begin processing at least 150 people a day through each of the two camps by Jan. 23.The meeting that concluded on Tuesday in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw was the first for a joint working group set up to hammer out the details of a November repatriation agreement.Left out of the talks were the fears and concerns of the refugees themselves, “as if they are an inert mass of people who will go where and when they are told,” Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters in an email.“Where are considerations for protection of the Rohingya from Myanmar security forces who months ago were raping and killing them? How come the discussions ignore the deprivation of rights of people held in indefinite detention, which is what these so-called “temporary” accommodations may become?,” Robertson asked. ‘LIVING LIKE PRISONERS’A group of refugees at the Kutupalong Rohingya camp near Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh expressed doubt about the camps Myanmar has agreed to establish on its side of the border.Mohammad Farouk, 20, who arrived in Bangladesh following the Aug. 25 attacks, said exchanging one camp for another made little difference - except “the camps in Myanmar will be far worse, because we will be confined there and there will be a risk to our lives.”Another resident of the Kutupalong camp compared the new transit camps to ones set up near the Rakhine state capital of Sittwe following bouts of violence in previous years “where people are living like prisoners”.“First, ask the military to give those Rohingya their homes and property back, then talk to us about returning,” said the Rohingya refugee who did not want to be identified.Some said the kind of violence they witnessed toward their community in Myanmar made it hard for them to trust the military. “Even if I don’t get food or anything else here, at least there is safety. I won’t feel safe if I go back to Myanmar,” said Rashid Ahmed, 33.Noor Alam, 37, who came to Kutupalong five months ago, wondered if he could ever get a job in Myanmar. “They don’t even call us Rohingya. Until they consider us citizens we won’t go back.”Some young men in the camp worried they might be arrested on accusations of terrorism if they returned to Myanmar.Camp conditions in Bangladesh are dire enough, but more than 520,000 Rohingya children are at even greater risk ahead of the cyclone season that generally begins in April, the United Nations Children’s Fund said on Tuesday.“Hundreds of thousands of children are already living in horrific conditions, and they will face an even greater risk of disease, flooding, landslides and further displacement,” said Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF Representative in Bangladesh.Nearly 1 million Rohingya live in Bangladesh, including those who came after previous displacements dating back to the 1990s.(Reporting by Ruma Paul and Yi-mou Lee; Additional reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in Cox’s Bazar, Shoon Naing, and Serajul Quadir in Dhaka, Michelle Nichols at the United Nations; Editing by Bill Tarrant and Frances Kerry)"

The male swamp wallaby got to the other end of the bridge and well into the city before it was apprehended by bemused officers.Police posted a video of the episode on Facebook, showing officers cruising next to the wallaby as it bounded across the bridge. At one point, the wallaby stopped and an officer warily approached, before it hopped off again. The video also shows a motorist slowly passing the wallaby in the overtaking lane. “Officers took the startled macropod into police custody near the Conservatorium of Music, with the Police Mounted Unit arriving on scene soon after to take it to the zoo for veterinary assessment,” police said in a tongue-in-cheek statement, adding that it “initially evaded officers.”Police said the wallaby likely came from a golf course in the suburb of Cammeray, in the north of Sydney. If so, that would be nearly a six kilometre (3.5 mile) hop before it was captured.News program Sunrise captured footage of the wallaby being captured by police.Wildlife experts at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo examined the wallaby and said it had sustained some minor injuries.“The animal was thoroughly assessed by Senior Veterinarian Dr. Larry Vogelnest, including a full body X-Ray, which thankfully revealed the animal had not received any significant injuries. The wallaby has been administered pain medication and fluids and is currently in Taronga’s Wildlife Intensive Care Unit for recovery and further monitoring,” Taronga said on Facebook. “At this stage, it doesn’t appear to have any serious injuries. However, it will be carefully assessed over the next 24-48 hours,” Vogelnest said.The wallaby is expected to be released back into the wild. “I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” a woman named Michelle told Sydney radio station 2GB. “I was so worried about the poor little thing. It was just hopping northbound in lane eight.”“I thought ‘no, no way do you see a kangaroo in the city like that.’”"

Madsen, who admitted in October to dismembering Wall’s body, also was charged with indecent handling of a corpse, as well as sexual assault without intercourse of a particularly dangerous nature.Madsen, 46, could face life imprisonment if convicted. The trial was scheduled to start on March 8. A defense lawyer for Madsen told HuffPost she planned to meet with her client later in the day, but had no immediate comment.Wall, a 30-year-old freelance journalist from Sweden, was working on a profile about the amateur rocket builder and entrepreneur last summer when she was reported missing.She was last seen aboard Madsen’s 56-foot submarine as it left Copenhagen on Aug. 10. The next day, Madsen was rescued from his vessel, which police believe he deliberately sank, and Wall was reported missing.Madsen initially told police he had dropped Wall off on shore before his submarine sank.But 10 days after she went missing, bags containing Wall’s torso and legs were found floating in the sea near Copenhagen. Madsen then changed his story, telling police that a heavy submarine hatch had accidentally fallen onto her head and killed her. Wall’s head was found in early October.Madsen later admitted he dismembered Wall and threw parts of her body into the sea, but maintained he didn’t kill her. He claimed she died of carbon monoxide poisoning aboard the submarine.A police examination of Madsen’s computer uncovered video of women being tortured and decapitated, according to The Guardian. He has told prosecutors that he was interested in sadomasochism."
