It came five years after a political scandal wrecked his previous bid.That attempt to buy Sky through his News Corp business provoked uproar among some UK politicians, who said it would give the billionaire owner of The Sun and The Times newspapers too much control over Britain’s media.It collapsed in 2011 when Murdoch’s UK newspaper business was engulfed in a phone-hacking scandal. It intensified political opposition, resulted in a criminal trial, and led to the closure of his News of the World tabloid newspaper.Cable said the issue was the same five years on.“This is yet again a threat to media plurality, choice, just as it was six years ago when I referred this to the competition authorities and it should be investigated,” he said.“The ownership of the media, whether you’re looking at press, radio, television is very highly concentrated and this makes it even more concentrated.”EASIER RIDEHowever, analysts and Murdoch allies said Friday’s proposal was likely to have an easier ride, partly because News Corp has now separated from Fox, which means the bidding firm no longer owns UK newspapers, and because there are little or no competition issues, with very significant changes in the market for news in the UK since 2010.They also said the British government was keen to promote investment in the wake of the Brexit vote and could present the deal as a sign of confidence in the economy.“It’s very likely that even if there is a plurality investigation that this will go through,” Claire Enders of Enders Analysis told BBC radio. “It is a different situation and the entities have been structured differently.”Similarly Wilton Fry, analyst at stockbroker RBC Capital, saw “a high likelihood” of a deal being approved.It will be up to Karen Bradley, the Conservative government’s culture, media and sport minister to decide whether the plurality situation has materially changed since 2010.“Will the government really say he can’t own more than 39 percent of it? I don’t think so,” David Yelland, a former editor of Murdoch’s Sun newspaper, told Reuters.“It takes a lot of negative energy to block a deal like this and I just don’t see it happening this time around.”(Editing by Jeremy Gaunt and Ros Russell)"

3,POLITICS,Michigan Supreme Court Slams The Door On Jill Stein's Recount Case,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michigan-supreme-court-jill-stein-recount_us_584c20e5e4b0bd9c3dfd1458,The Michigan election recount is over.,2016-12-10,"Workers were recounting election ballots in Waterford, Michigan, on Dec. 5.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584c21d4120000dc00eee9c5.jpeg?cache=Jpx7OmMN9o&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Michigan Supreme Court on Friday shot down Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein’s request to hear an appeal of a lower court ruling that had halted the state’s election recount.The decision effectively ends the Michigan recount ― and in so doing, ends any hope that Stein’s broader recount efforts would change the election result. Stein has sought recounts in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania as well, but Hillary Clinton needed to be declared the winner in all three states to best Donald Trump in the Electoral College.“Although we are deeply disappointed in today’s decision by the Michigan Supreme Court not to hear our appeal that would have allowed Michigan’s recount to finish, we are not surprised given the political motives of the majority. The fact is that in Michigan, political cronyism, bureaucratic obstruction, and legal maneuvering have run roughshod over the democratic process,” Stein said in a statement responding to the Michigan Supreme Court’s decision.Stein will hold a “rally for democracy” protesting the decision in front of Detroit’s Cobo Center on Saturday at 2 pm ET.The recount in Michigan had begun this past Monday, after the initial legal skirmishes concluded with a federal judge’s order to proceed. It stopped Wednesday evening, when the same judge effectively upheld a Michigan Court of Appeals decision halting the recount. Stein then moved to challenge the Michigan Court of Appeals decision at the state’s Supreme Court.Michigan’s top court, by a 3-to-2 vote, declined to hear Stein’s appeal. The opinion written by Justices Brian Zahra and David Viviano, and joined by Justice Stephen Markman, affirmed the Michigan Court of Appeals’ conclusion that Stein had failed to allege that she was “aggrieved” in any way by any potential “fraud or mistake” in the counting of the votes. In other words, what difference would any possible shift in Michigan’s vote count make to someone who had finished a very distant fourth place in the presidential election?Only five of the Michigan Supreme Court’s seven justices considered whether to hear the appeal. Chief Justice Robert Young and Justice Joan Larsen recused themselves after Stein questioned whether they could decide the case independently, since President-elect Trump had put them on a list of preferred candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court.The recount that Stein initiated in Wisconsin continues and will be complete by this coming Monday. Thus far it has barely changed Trump’s margin of victory in the state.Stein is suing Pennsylvania in federal court to force a statewide election recount there. U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond is expected to issue a decision early Monday on her request to investigate possible tampering in the Keystone State’s voting systems."

She repeatedly blamed Russia for trying to sway the election.When the Green Party’s Jill Stein launched her recount campaign in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania (the three states that gave Trump the victory), Stein’s announcement quoted her on her website as saying that because “foreign agents” had “hacked into party databases, private e-mail servers, and voter databases in certain states, many Americans are wondering if our election results are reliable.” Stein’s page was then updated to eliminate reference to “foreign agents” in her quote.But her recount petition filed in Wisconsin begins by saying “it was widely reported that foreign operators breached voter registration databases in at least two states and stole hundreds of thousands of voter records.” The petition then says the U.S. intelligence community is “confident” Russia was behind the hacks. There is “well-documented and conclusive evidence of foreign interference in the presidential race before the election ... [that] call[s] into question the results and indicate the possibility that (a) widespread breach occurred,” Stein’s lawyers wrote.In fact the intelligence community has never made public its evidence for independent computer experts to weigh in on. After the election, the Obama administration said it had no proof of Russian interference in the election tallies and that the results “accurately reflect the will of the American people.”Citing the PressNevertheless, Exhibit A in Stein’s petition is an affidavit from Professor J. Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science at the University of Michigan, who alleges that Russia hacked the election. Halderman took part in a conference call with the Clinton campaign last month trying to convince the campaign to seek a recount, which it only did after Stein launched her effort.Exhibit B from Stein’s petition is an article from Wired Magazine about Russia’s alleged role in the hack. Exhibit C is a New York Times article quoting DellSecureWorks, a private security firm, saying Russia was behind the hack of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The company says Podesta clicked on a phishing link to gain access to his account. The Times relied on the company’s word that Russian spies were behind the phishing expedition, without also offering any proof that could be analyzed by other computer security experts.Exhibits D through G ― meaning all of Stein’s exhibits ― are on alleged Russian hacking. One article is about an alleged, attempted Russian hack of the 2014, post-coup Ukrainian election.In her many media appearances since launching the recount campaign, Stein has carefully avoided mentioning Russia, or foreign agents, as she did in her initial web posting. But her petition is about nothing else but Russia’s alleged hacking of the election.Stein left no doubt what one of the main aims of the recount is. On her web page she wrote: “Whether these machines were hacked by foreign or domestic agents will be determined by using the mechanisms available to us in each state we conduct a recount.”Scott McLarty, the Green Party national media coordinator, told me in an email that the Green Party has “not taken a position on meddling by foreign agents.” Since then, top Green Party officials have distanced themselves from Stein, including her running mate, Ajamu Baraka.“I’m not in favor of the recount,” Baraka told CNN. He said he told Stein “it was a potentially dangerous move” because it “would be seen as carrying the water for the Democrats.”Margaret Flowers, the Green’s Senate candidate in Maryland, posted an open letter signed by several prominent party members saying, “While we support electoral reforms, including how the vote is counted, we do not support the current recount being undertaken by Jill Stein.”While he first ignored, and then slammed the recount bid Donald Trump’s surrogates have gone to court in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin trying to stop the recounts. So far the action has failed to stop them, but it could create a legal mess down the road. The litigious Trump can be expected to fight to the Supreme Court to prevent the vote from being overturned. Lobbying the ElectorsBut since recounts that overturn the vote totals seem unlikely, it appears the Clinton campaign’s Plan B is to use any evidence of tampering that it can pin on Russia to lobby electors to change their votes to Clinton when the Electoral College meets in state capitals on Dec. 19.Trump won the electoral college 306 to 232. That means 38 Republican electors would have to be convinced to change their vote to Clinton to reach the required 270 to win the White House.Finding evidence of hacking of election computers that can somehow be blamed on Russia could be crucial for the Clinton team in their effort to convince electors to change their vote.Russia has been blamed in the U.S. for many things and though proof never seems to be supplied, it is widely believed anyway. It has been accepted as fact by American corporate media, for instance, that Russia invaded Ukraine and had a hand in shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, though no conclusive proof for either has ever been presented. Emotional appeals to elector’s patriotism and defense of the American system against interference by Russia could make a persuasive argument, however.At an event at Harvard University last week, Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, repeatedly blamed Russia for hacking and tampering with the election. “Congress has got to investigate what happened with Russia here,” said Mook. “It is outrageous that a foreign aggressor got involved in our election.”Robert Reich, labor secretary under President Bill Clinton and a Hillary supporter, argued that one reason the electors should flip to Clinton is to “stop foreign interference in an election.”Quoting an article, he wrote on Facebook: “The Framers were extremely concerned about infiltration by rivals including Great Britain. In Federalist No. 68, Hamilton wrote that one major purpose of the Electoral College was to stop the ‘desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.’ He said that the college would, ‘Guard against all danger of this sort ... with the most provident and judicious attention’ from the electors.”Reich continued: “There’s incontrovertible evidence Russia interfered in the campaign by hacking the email accounts of top Democratic officials and cooperating with WikiLeaks’ parallel campaign to undermine Hillary Clinton campaign.” If such incontrovertible evidence exists, the Obama administration’s intelligence community has not shared it with the public.Clinton operatives are also making her victory by more than 2 million popular votes part of their appeal to electors to switch sides.Twenty-four states do not legally bind electors to the popular vote in their states. Elsewhere, electors face fines of about $1,000 if they vote against the will of the people of their states.Laurence Tribe, a well-known and connected Democratic lawyer, has offered to defend pro bono any elector who breaks the law by changing their vote to Clinton. And there are plans to mount a constitutional challenge against the 26 states that legally bind the electors’ to their state’s popular vote.Accompanying Media CampaignThe lobbying effort to blame Russia and get the electors to flip their votes is being accompanied by an intense media campaign.In the announcement that the Clinton campaign would join the recount, campaign counsel Elias aligned the campaign with an unverified Washington Post article based largely on a shadowy, anonymous group that smears a list of 200 alternative media sites for spreading Russian propaganda to influence the election, without providing any evidence.“The Washington Post reported that the Russian government was behind much of the ‘fake news’ propaganda that circulated online in the closing weeks of the election,” Elias wrote.A Huffington Post article said one of the eight reasons the electors should overturn the election is because “Russian covert action influenced the election.”The staunchly pro-Clinton Daily Kos wrote that “Even if they never touched a voting machine, there’s absolutely no doubt: Russia hacked the election.”If evidence of hacking is found in the recounts, the Clinton campaign would be greatly aided in lobbying electors with confirmation from the Obama administration that Russia was behind it. But on the day before the Clinton team joined the recount, the Obama administration appeared to throw a wrench into the plan to blame Russia.The administration said it remained “confident in the overall integrity of electoral infrastructure, a confidence that was borne out,” adding: “As a result, we believe our elections were free and fair from a cyber-security perspective.”The timing of that statement may have been intended to undermine Clinton as a split was reported between President Obama and Hillary Clinton over whether to have a recount.Not satisfied with the administration’s conclusion, a group of Democratic senators on Thursday asked that information about Russian hacking should be declassified and released to the public.White House press secretary Josh Earnest responded that the administration would take a look at the request. But he added that the intelligence community “did not observe an increase in malicious cyber-activity on Election Day from the Russians that was directed at disrupting the casting or counting of ballots.”CIA LeakDespite this stance, the White House gave in to pressure from Congressional Democrats and announced on Friday an intelligence review of Russia’s alleged attempt to influence the election. The administration said the report would be completed before Obama leaves office. Leaks, however, were to be expected. And they came on Friday night.The Washington Post first reported that “the CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency.” The New York Times reported that the Russians also hacked Republican officials but only released dirt on the Democrats. Neither paper reported any evidence to back up the assertions of unnamed officials, who are simply to be believed.Neither the Post nor the Times speculated on what this means for the electoral college voters. But it’s clearly a message to them. Shortly after the articles appeared, Reich posted on Facebook: “The fact that the CIA has concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency bears on the upcoming decision of the Electoral College about whether Donald Trump becomes our next president. The framers of the Constitution intended that the Electoral College guard against the possibility that a foreign power influences the outcome of a presidential election. The CIA report must be made public immediately, and the Electors of 2016 should take careful note.“Nor does either newspaper say the CIA has evidence that the voting machines were hacked, only that Russia gave hacked Democratic emails to Wikileaks, which Julian Assange has denied. If it was Russia, it does not change the content of the emails. Without hard evidence that Russia actually tampered with the voting, we are left with a CIA-certified public relations campaign to question Trump’s election and perhaps influence the electors or Congress when it meets on Jan. 6 to certify the vote. A second Washington Post story on Friday notes that Republicans Lindsey Graham and John McCain support a Congressional inquiry into the Russian “hacks.” So not all Republicans may be with Trump if his election is challenged by one Senator and one Representative on Jan. 6, forcing a vote in both Houses on whether Trump should be president.This scenario is playing out almost exactly as I predicted in The Huffington Post three days before the election."

As Trump spoke at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as part of his post-election “Thank You Tour,” some supporters began chanting “lock her up” ― a common refrain during the Republican convention and Trump’s campaign events. “No, it’s okay,” Trump said as the crowd jeered a reference to Clinton. “Forget it. That plays great before the election. Now, we don’t care, right?” Trump threatened during the second presidential debate to prosecute Clinton. “I didn’t think I’d say this, but I’m going to say it, and I hate to say it, but if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception, there has never been anything like it and we’re going to have a special prosecutor,” he said.Trump backed away from that claim shortly after the election, telling The New York Times he doesn’t “want to hurt the Clintons.”“She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways,” Trump said.That sentiment doesn’t sit well with many Trump supporters. A HuffPost/YouGov survey found that 68 percent of Trump voters favor the president-elect appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton."
6,POLITICS,Bombshell Secret CIA Report Says Russia Aimed To Steal White House For Trump,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-hacking-trump-election_us_584b658ae4b04c8e2bb01356,"Trump camp dismisses The Washington Post's report, saying it's time to ""Make America great again.""",2016-12-10,Russian President Vladimir Putin drew praise from Donald Trump during the presidential campaign. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584b71a51800002c00e41ee4.jpeg?ops=crop_1213_587_2317_2358%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A shocking secret CIA assessment has concluded that Russia interfered with the U.S. presidential election expressly to help Donald Trump win, according to an exclusive report Friday by The Washington Post.Until now, intelligence sources have indicated that Russian hacking throughout the campaign that repeatedly exposed information overwhelmingly embarrassing for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was an effort to undermine Americans’ faith in their government.Now the intelligence community has concluded that Russia was clearly after a Trump victory and manipulated information to that end, according to sources who spoke to the newspaper.“It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia’s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,” a senior U.S. official briefed on the CIA assessment told The Washington Post. “That’s the consensus view.” The Trump camp has dismissed the report — along with the credibility of the U.S. intelligence community. “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,” said a statement by the Trump transition team. “The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It’s time to move on and ‘Make America great again.’”(The claim that Trump had won one of the “biggest Electoral College victories in history” is simply not true. He ranks 44th out of 54 electoral votes of presidents since the 12th Amendment passed, Mother Jones reports.)It’s no surprise Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted Trump in the White House. Trump praised the former KGB leader throughout the presidential campaign. He even called Putin a “more effective leader” than President Barack Obama.Leaked information through hacking operations traced by U.S. intelligence to Russia was eerily silent on Trump and the Republican Party throughout the presidential campaign. Yet the same operations exposed troves of secret, sometimes embarrassing, personal communication involving Clinton and internal planning by the Democratic National Committee. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia hacked the Republican National Committee but chose not to release the information, according to a report in the New York Times late Friday.In addition, intelligence officials discovered breaches by Russian government-linked hackers into the voter registration databases of at least two states.Links to hackers and the Russian government were detected by U.S. intelligence earlier this year. But Trump dismissed a Russian hand in the operations. He again this week blasted the intelligence findings, even before the latest assessment emerged, as politically motivated and not based on hard evidence.“I don’t believe it. I don’t believe [Russia] interfered,” Trump told Time magazine in his “Person of the Year” interview released Wednesday.“That became a laughing point, not a talking point,” he added. “Any time I do something, they say, ‘Oh, Russia interfered.’”The hacking, he said, “could be Russia, it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.”Yet at one point during the campaign in July, he appeared to appeal to Russia for hacking help, saying: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing” from Clinton’s email servers. The seeming request for a foreign government to breach U.S. internet security sparked a storm of controversy, and Trump later insisted he was only being “sarcastic.”In a September intelligence briefing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) reportedly expressed suspicion about Russian links to campaign hacking. He hasn’t commented on The Washington Post’s report on the latest CIA information.The chilling assessment that it’s “quite clear” Russia’s goal was to get Trump elected was shared with key senators last week in a Capitol Hill briefing, the Post reported. CIA officials cited a mounting body of evidence from several sources. Intelligence agencies have identified specific individuals with connections to the Russian government who are believed to have provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails, according to The Washington Post.Obama has ordered a “full review” of Russian hacking in the campaign following pressure from Congress, the White House announced Friday. He expects to receive an intelligence report on any election interference before he leaves office. Congress will also be briefed on the report.“We’ve seen in 2008, and this last election system, malicious cyber-activity,” Obama’s counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters. “We may be crossing a new threshold, and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after-action, to understand what has happened and to impart those lessons learned.” This article has been updated to include new details on where Trump ranks in electoral votes of presidents."

I don’t think it’s relevant,” he told Fox News on Friday.“He is going to be the executive producer of the American government and a huge TV show called ‘Leading the World.’”Gingrich suggested Trump turn the program over to his three eldest children. “He ought to just relax, give the executive producer to Eric or Donald or Ivanka. I think he is still going through some transition things here where it hasn’t quite sunk in totally,” he added.The president-elect announced his plans on Thursday to continue his relationship with the NBC reality franchise. He’ll run the show in his “spare time,” Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said Friday, dismissing concerns that he won’t have much downtime as president.“Were we so concerned about the hours and hours and hours spent on the golf course by the current president?” she said on CNN, in reference to President Barack Obama. “I mean, presidents have a right to do things in their spare time or their leisure time. I mean nobody objects to that.”But Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) slammed Trump for continuing with the program when he apparently doesn’t have time for regular intelligence briefings, Politico reported. “I consider it bizarre,” he said. The president-elect has a “big stake” in the NBC production, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told ABC. And that’s what worries critics concerned about Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the White House.It would be difficult for him to be impartial about issues such as telecommunication laws, a rival TV program or legislative decisions that may affect brands advertising on his program, if Trump continues his association with the show, they believe.NBC’s parent company, Comcast, is a media conglomerate regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, which he will soon oversee.Trump will “be tempted, consciously or otherwise, to favor NBC or use the White House to promote this source of revenue,” Norm Eisen, who served as Obama’s chief ethics lawyer, told the Chicago Tribune.The show that brought the New York City businessman to national attention is due to air again with new host, actor and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) in January."

Chief Arvol Looking Horse entering the Oceti Sakowin Camp.2) An estimated 5,000 U.S. veterans showed up to camp, prepared to be human shields for the water protectors. While they were there, they apologized to Native elders for the atrocities against Native peoples committed by the military units they belong to. This is a huge breakthrough, and 3) Two winter blizzards, with single-digit temperatures, strong winds, and icy roads, made life at camp extremely difficult.Then Standing Rock Chairman Archambault, in light of all these changes, thanked the supporters and said it is time for people to leave the camp and go home.That said, Energy Transfer Partners insists that the pipeline will go through.So what is the plan now to secure this win?The main Oceti Sakowin Camp is not longer accepting new arrivals. The conditions are too difficult. There is much work to be done nonetheless.Trump is likely to try his best to reverse the Army Corps' position and give DAPL a green light. So the top priority -- and something you can do from home -- is to keep up the pressure on investors and bankers to pull out.Break Up With Your BankBanks are feeling the heat from the protests and from their own customers. One bank, DNB of Norway, has responded to pressure by divesting from Energy Transfer, the parent company of the Dakota Access pipeline. DNB is reportedly reconsidering more than $400 million in credit. The ING Bank of the Netherlands, which prides itself on its sustainability and human rights stance, posted a statement on its website expressing concern about excessive police force at Standing Rock.If your bank is one of the direct investors in DAPL or one of the investors in its parent companies, Energy Transfer and Sunoco Logistics, ask them to withdraw support. Tell them you plan to close your account if their support continues. Photograph yourself cutting up your credit card, or share your letter on your social media networks. I posted my break-up letter to Chase Bank on my blog and on Facebook and Twitter--and was surprised by how many responded that they planned to do the same.If you have a retirement fund or mutual fund, find out if it is invested in Energy Transfer Partners, Energy Transfer Equity, or Sunoco Logistics--or any of the 38 banks offering credit to the pipeline project. If so, let those investment companies know you object and tell them you would like the fund to divest or you'll shift your account to a socially responsible investment fund.Consider planning or participating in a nonviolent protest at a bank branch or headquarters. Sacred Stone Camp has posted a map to find bank branches near you and recommends actions beginning Dec. 1.Banks are risk-averse, and this pipeline project has become quite risky because of public relations problems as well as the oil price bust and reduction of oil extraction in North Dakota. Banks and investors may be hoping for an excuse to back out. Your action could help tip the balance.And reinvest your money in credit unions, community banks, or generative investments that build the new economy.Call off the policeThere were dozens of law enforcement agencies participating in the multi-state force that was shooting water cannons, pepper spraying, and shooting various ""sub-lethal"" weapons at unarmed water protectors. Many political leaders responded to public pressure by recalling their officers. If yours are still in North Dakota, contact elected officials, write to local papers and local blogs, and contact local media to object to law enforcement involvement at Standing Rock.Contact government decision-makersThank President Obama for his decision. But also urge him to insist that an Environmental Impact Statement will be necessary before any permit can be issued. Here's a good analysis of the legal questions at stake.President Barack Obama Phone: 202-456-1111 Email: president@whitehouse.govYou can also call Denis McDonough, White House chief of staff, at 202-456-3182.DonateThere are many needs, still for cash. Here are three that I can vouch for:• The Standing Rock Tribe, spent a huge amount of money for their substantial legal expenses and for providing facilities for the camp. Help them out: standwithstandingrock.net/donate/.• Oceti Sakowin Camp is the largest of the water protector camps, the closest to the front lines: ocetisakowincamp.org/donate.• The Water Protector Legal Collective (formerly the Red Owl Collective), which has been providing legal support to the many who have been arrested at Standing Rock: https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/11B5z8You can also support some of the key indigenous organizations that are leading this movement nationwide and worldwide:• The Indigenous Environmental Network• Honor the EarthYou can raise more money for these and others by organizing support events and fundraisers in your community. Invite people who are curious about the issues as well as people who are already passionately engaged. Make it a celebratory or prayerful event in whatever way makes sense to your community.Other optionsResist extraction where you live. Join work to stop the pipelines, coal trains, fracking, and export terminals in your city or state and include #NoDAPL and #WaterisLife messages to remind people of the link to Standing Rock.Resist but also renew. Remember that as you resist the dystopian world of extraction, Donald Trump, violence, and racism, you can also use your activism to build up the world you want. Do your own ""just transition,"" switching to clean energy, conserving, protecting the water, rebuilding the soil--while including everyone in a way of life that is more soul-satisfying and joy-filled.Resilience for the days aheadWhen I talked to people at Standing Rock, I felt the trauma and pain but also the resolve. The young people spoke of being the Seventh Generation, the ones that were prayed for. And many endured enormous to ensure the next generations has the clean water they will need to survive.That resolve can energize us and inspire as we take the lessons of Standing Rock home.LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, founder of Sacred Stone Camp, said ""We are in our home, we are strong, and we have prayer."" That is an ethos we can take with us, as we protect Mother Earth and stand together for the well being of future generations, wherever we live.Sarah van Gelder is co-founder and editor at large of YES!

Under the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu, the official temperature in Romania was never below 10 degree Celsius. No matter the snow and ice, the weather reports would always have temperatures above 10 degrees. The reason? Below that, the law required the heating to be turned on in public places, and Romania could not afford this. It is hard to say what is stranger about the story. A dictator who feels so omnipotent that he pretends he could change the reality of the weather? Or a population so misled, misinformed, or disillusioned that it will put up with the weather reports over what it knows to be true?Today, the story is not so strange anymore, nor do we need to look to countries far away. Today, the story is happening right here in the United States. Our Ceaușescu is the minority president-elect, Donald Trump. And our Romanian winter is climate change.We know climate change to be true with as much certainty as we can know things. We know it as the Romanians knew how cold it was. We know it not only because we see wildfires in Tennessee and flooding in Louisiana. We know it not only because we have to turn on the air conditioning on Christmas. No, we have seen the science reports that temperatures rise faster than they ever have. We have seen data suggesting that the arctic ice sheet is collapsing. We know not only that nearly all scientists agree that climate change is man-made; we also know why they agree.It is not just scientists who know this. The US military knows it and considers a great stability risk. Companies know it and are beginning to adapt. Exxon knows it and has known it since at least 1977. Trump must know too, but he pretends otherwise. Before being elected, he repeatedly called climate change a hoax. After the election, despite occasional signals that he had an open mind, he named a man to run the EPA who has so far demonstrated his opposition to the institution and its mission.What goes through his mind? An answer may come from an article he linked to on Facebook. Among that article's many absurd statements, the worst may be the suggestion that ""a broad array of climate activists ... continue to argue that increased solar activity, not rising carbon dioxide, has driven recent climate trends"" and that therefore Obama's endorsement of man-made climate change is ""a potentially flawed ideology.""Yes, the idea that climate change is man-made is still disputed by some (though the article tellingly talks of activists, not scientist). Many things are disputed. Some believe that Auschwitz was not a death camp. Some believe that Neil Armstrong did not walk on the moon in 1969. Some believe that the Egyptian pyramids were built to hold grain. Science needs dissent, but it insists on ways to test it. The idea that increased solar energy caused our climate change came up in the 1980s; it has long been refuted. Calling the near-consensus of scientists a ""flawed ideology"" is nothing short of scandalous; it is itself purely ideological. It is one thing for a paid hack to write nonsense. (The author's online profile includes ""website content, promotional articles, and ghost-written op-eds and editorials,"" for $ 44.00/hr. Below the article, we are told that he ""has served as ""media director for both the Alliance for American Manufacturing (AAM) and the U.S. Business & Industry Council (USBIC)""). It is quite another thing for the man bound to become President of the US to endorse it.Yes, Presidents lie about many things, from mistresses to weapons of mass destruction. But Trump's lying is of a different kind entirely. Trump lies against facts that are clear for us to see. Trump pretends the facts are not facts. And his supporters willingly go along with him.This is bad for more than for the environment. Trump's open disdain for truthful speech shows clear signs of authoritarianism, as Jacob Levy points out. Trump's lies in the face of clear facts are a demonstration of power, characteristic of totalitarian leaders.   As Levy writes: ""Saying something obviously untrue, and making your subordinates repeat it with a straight face in their own voice, is a particularly startling display of power over them. It's something that was endemic to totalitarianism. Arendt analyzed the huge lies and blatant reversals of language associated with the Holocaust. Havel documented the pervasive little lies, lies that everyone knew to be lies, of late Communism. And Orwell gave us the vivid ""2+2=5.""'So what is stranger? A President-elect, soon-to-be head of state of the most powerful country in the world, who pretends he can change the realities of the climate? Or a population so mislead and misinformed, or disillusioned that it will put up with the lies over what we know to be true?It is important for us to not put up. We need to point out that such false statements are not just lies. They are efforts to break the foundations of society. They are efforts to establish a system in which the truth is determined by those in power. We must deny this.Or we will face a long Romanian winter.[Thank you to Joseph Biello for valuable suggestions.]"

Trump had previously picked Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who is also close to Putin, to be his National Security Advisor. And Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, who is under FBI investigation for his ties to Putin, is back giving counsel to Trump.Where Is the Outrage?Trump is setting up a Government ""Over the American People, By the Russians, and For the Russian and American Oligarchs.""Where is the outrage? Where are the patriots? Where are Republicans? Where, for that matter, are most of the Democrats? Where are the voices of the media? This is our country, for God's sake! Stand up and stop them before it's too late!We are talking about a hostile foreign power stealing an American election and making their stooge President of the United States! Why isn't there supreme outrage and discussion, not of how this may affect Tillerson's confirmation hearings in January, but how it should affect the Electoral College vote on December 19? The media went wild (rightly so) over Watergate, and over Monica Lewinsky, but they are being very timid about confronting this scandal that is vastly worse than Watergate. The stealing of an election through actions by a hostile foreign power is both the greatest scandal in American history and precisely the sort of evil that the Framers of the United States Constitution sought to block through the Electoral College. In The Federalist No. 68, Alexander Hamilton foresaw the danger to the Republic that could come from someone like Vladimir Putin, warning of ""the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils."" ""How,"" Hamilton asked rhetorically, ""could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union?"" The Electoral College was meant to be a safeguard against such foreign treachery.Surely, Hamilton and other Framers believed, the Electors would have the wisdom and the patriotism to block a man backed by a hostile foreign power from becoming President of the United States.The question to be determined over the next nine days is whether the 2016 Electors will have the wisdom and patriotism the Founders assumed they would and save America in the time of our nation's gravest crisis since the Civil War.Under the circumstances now, I think it would be unwise for Hillary Clinton yet to make the sort of call on Democratic Electors that I suggested a few days ago. Instead, she and other leading Democrats should work out a proposed Compromise of 2016 and call upon leading Republicans to redeem the souls that most of them have sold to the devil-horned man who appeared on the cover of Time by divorcing themselves from Trump and Putin and coming up with their version of an acceptable compromise Government of National Unity.After each side comes up with a proposal, leaders from each group can enter negotiations to reach an agreement acceptable to both by next weekend that can be announced before December 19, with a call on Electors from both parties to support the chosen candidates. In light both of her large margin of victory in the actual vote and of the Russian intervention against her, it is entirely reasonable that the president chosen in these negotiations should by Hillary Clinton, with a Republican Vice President. Only if acceptance of that outcome proves impossible to achieve should Mrs. Clinton agree to step aside and call for the Electors from both parties to join together in choosing a ticket of sane people not under the influence of Mr. Putin.Let us update Thomas Paine's immortal words from the year of our country's birth: ""THESE are the times that try a nation's soul. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he and she that stand by it now, deserve the love and thanks of man and woman.""{Historian Robert S. McElvaine teaches at Millsaps College and is the author of ten books. He has just completed a draft of his first novel.}"
13,HEALTHY LIVING,Okay...THAT Happened. Now What?,"Kaia Roman, ContributorMindfulness Teacher, Author of 'The Joy Plan' (Coming July 201...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/okaythat-happened-now-wha_b_13554550.html,,2016-12-10,2016-12-10-1481411488-7346304-americanflag378143_1920.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-10-1481411488-7346304-americanflag378143_1920-thumb.jpg,"Many people found themselves in shock after last month's election results. But many others rejoiced. And others--they couldn't be phased either way. Regardless of which camp you fit into, anytime an event happens in which people see things from vastly different perspectives, it gives us a chance to examine, reassess, and move forward in a new way. This applies to everything from an election to a simple family squabble.Here's how that works:First, the disconnection. Whenever two sides can't understand each other's point of view--whether it's political parties we're talking about, or a married couple--it's time to try harder to understand each other. Set your ideas aside for a minute and really listen. Next, understand fear. Fear is a powerful force that motivates many of our actions much of the time. Fear activates the amygdala, and that creates a fight, flight, or freeze response in the brain. When you're in survival mode, it's difficult to think of others' needs. Which begs the question, ""What are we so afraid of?""Then, find the commonality. We actually want a lot of the same things. In this country, for example, I think most people want affordable healthcare and quality education (even if we disagree on the best way to go about it). In other situations where there is disagreement, if you search deeply enough, I'm betting you'll also find agreement.There's no going back. A shocking event shakes things up and starts a new era, for better or for worse. In the case of the election, it brought to light how much about our old system isn't working. If it was, we wouldn't have so much polarity in our country. Since there's no going back, we may as well make the most of it. It's time to be all in. However you're called to serve, now is the time to do it. If you're a writer, now is the time to write. If you're a spiritual light worker, now is the time to meditate and radiate your light. If you're inspired to work for women's rights, immigrants, the LGBTQ community--get to it. While we never need a reason to be active in the community, if you were looking for one, you can find it now.Change is an opportunity. Even though it's uncomfortable sometimes, change is inevitable. How we handle change is everything. Will we have an explosive reaction or a proactive response? Transformation doesn't come from the light, it comes from moving through the darkness.Unifying doesn't mean we have to agree. We can move forward together with respect even when we don't agree on everything. Again, this applies to a situation as big as a country in turmoil or a couple who is arguing about the dishes. We can agree to disagree and move on together, putting our differences aside. So yeah, that happened. It won't be the last shocking thing we'll go through. And whether you're still in shock or never were, let's not waste this opportunity for growth--as individuals, as a culture, and as a world. Now is the time to focus on SOLUTIONS rather than PROBLEMS, even though there are plenty of both. Ready or not, it's time to roll up our sleeves, embrace the change, step up our collective game, yell ""Bring it On!"" and jump in, armed with kindness, empathy, and gratitude.It's time for ACTION rather than ANXIETY."

18,POLITICS,The Russians Came And They Chose Our Next President,"Lorraine Devon Wilke, ContributorSass & Sensibility",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-russians-came-and-the_b_13011852.html,"He may be Russia's choice, but without winning an unassailably honest election in America, by Americans, he will not be ours.",2016-12-10,2016-12-10-1481386893-8409813-bt41lw9i6kcrishabhvarshney.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-10-1481386893-8409813-bt41lw9i6kcrishabhvarshney-thumb.jpg,"Let's be completely honest, America: we've just been handed an election result that was hand-picked, paid for, gift-wrapped, and delivered by our committed comrades from across the sea.And while the recipient of that noxious gift-giving, Donald Trump, sniffs that we should reject the bombshell findings released this weekend and just allow him to get on with the task of ""making America great again"" (colluding with foreign dictators apparently part of his protocol), the rest of us are left wondering just how much more it will take for the powers-that-be in this country to declare Election 2016 to be null and void. Fraudulent. Manipulated. Corrupt. Unacceptable. It's one thing to shake our heads and parse the fact that Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by as many votes as President Obama won in 2012 but is still considered ""the loser"" (which should make abolishing or amending Electoral College rules a priority). It's one thing to review the unprecedented and outrageous move of FBI Director James Comey to, right before the election, make ultimately pointless claims of more email trouble for Clinton (how has he not been sanctioned for that?), and feel outrage that this shattered her then-12-point lead and likely aided Trump's win.It's one thing to consider the daily, weekly, monthly drip-drip-drip distraction (and fodder for haters and conspiracists) from Wikileaks and their sleazy founder Julian Assange (still in hiding from law enforcement over sexual assault allegations), and question why they only targeted Democrats and how much their biased hackery impacted the election. It's one thing to consider the possibility that Russian actors were behind that hackery and likely had a hand in manipulating what got released and when, and ponder the heinous thought that our election itself might have been hacked at the behest of foreign interests and preferences. It's one thing to grasp how much fake news -- much of it directed by Russia -- with its bilious lies directed particularly at Hillary Clinton -- misguided and misinformed the electorate, and feel churned by the fact of America's gullibility. BUT IT'S A WHOLE OTHER THING to read the bombshell reports that have come out this weekend: Now the intelligence community has concluded that Russia was clearly after a Trump victory and manipulated information to that end, according to sources who spoke to the newspaper.Every single thing about that should stir waves of anger and revulsion, brandish red flags so voluminous they're canopies; ring alarm bells far, wide, and loudly across the entire United States of America. In all our myriad doomsday imaginings, in all the conspiracy theories and Cold War drills, fears of invasion and terrors related to ""The Russians are Coming,"" what is patently clear at this moment is that the Russians came and they chose our next president. And that cannot stand. In addition to the other election corruptions listed above, this is an unequivocal tipping point. This should not be a partisan issue; this should not be about Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump; this should be about the fact that an antagonistic foreign power just got up close and personal with our domestic presidential election and coerced it in favor of its preferred candidate. Russia's preferred candidate lost the popular vote. Russia's preferred candidate is Donald J. Trump. Russian's preferred candidate cannot be our next president.That Russia worked so nefariously to tilt this election, and succeeded in doing so, cannot be dismissed along with Comey, Wikileaks, fake news, etc. It makes the election's results null and void. Our country's leadership, law enforcement, Homeland Security, and every single one of its citizens should agree with that thesis. Whatever we are or are not, America is a free and democratic nation. If we are forced to accept election results that are fraudulent, manipulated, and corrupt, there will be no uniting behind this president. He may be Russia's choice, but without winning an unassailably honest election in America, by Americans, he will not be ours.

Washington is first black man or woman appointed to the position in the academy’s 70-year history, according to multiple reports. Washington, who has received multiple Emmys as an executive producer for CBS’ “Amazing Race” will helm the annual Emmy Awards during his two-year term. Since his appointment, the industry vet has vowed to advance the Academy’s efforts towards diversity and inclusion.“I am honored to have been selected to lead the Academy and look forward to serving our membership alongside the governors, executive committee, Foundation and staff,” Washington said to Variety. “This is a time of considerable change for our industry and I am deeply committed to ensuring that the Academy is at the forefront as we move towards a more inclusive future.”Prior to chairing the Television Academy, which begins Jan. 1, Washington served a five-year term as a governor in the producers branch of the organization, according to Variety.Washington’s historic appointment follows a number of industry changes this year intended to confront television and film’s disappointing statistics when it comes to diversity and inclusion.In addition to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences inviting a record 683 new members to include more women and minorities in its Oscar voting ranks, this year’s annual Primetime Emmy Awards included performers of color in each leading category for the first time in the show’s 68-year history. The show also marked Viola Davis’ historic win as the first black actress ever to win Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series."

In a bid to reclaim the remaining 7 percent, “a software update will be released starting on December 19th that will prevent U.S. Galaxy Note7 devices from charging, and will eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices,” Samsung said.The South Korean electronics manufacturer ceased producing the smartphones entirely in September, following reports that the devices were spontaneously catching fire. A program to swap early-production Note7s with replacement models was a failure: At least one “fixed” phone also caught fire.In a high-profile incident, one of the replacement models ignited aboard a Southwest Airlines flight after the owner had powered the phone down. The fire started while the plane was still on the tarmac, and no one was injured.As of October, the FAA has prohibited passengers from carrying Note7s onboard aircraft.While Samsung hasn’t elaborated much on the cause of the fires beyond blaming a “tiny error” in the battery manufacturing process, a report by Instrumental, a tech manufacturer, attributed it to the “aggressive” battery design itself. See more on that report in the video below:At least one major U.S. carrier says it will not follow through with Samsung’s update, however. Verizon said Friday it “will not be taking part in this update because of the added risk this could pose to Galaxy Note7 users that do not have another device to switch to.”The telecommunications giant, which owns The Huffington Post’s parent company, AOL, expressed concern that the update would disable phones “in the heart of the holiday travel season.”“We do not want to make it impossible to contact family, first responders or medical professionals in an emergency situation,” the company said.

For these patients, the risk of suicide was three times higher during the six months after their diagnosis than it was for the comparison group, the researchers found.The risk of suicide also increased with age and with frequency of healthcare system use.Donald Edmondson, director of the Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, told Reuters Health the study’s data are strong and people should pay attention to the results.While emergency department physicians and cardiologists are becoming aware of the psychological impact of cardiac events, there is not enough information yet to say what might lead patients to suicide, said Edmondson, who wasn’t involved with the new study.“We should be careful about the management of depression after a heart attack,” said Dr. Samir Kapadia, who is a cardiologist and section head of interventional cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.“Maybe people taking care of depressed patients should also ask them about chest pain and heart problems, because they go hand in hand,” said Kapadia, who also wasn’t involved with the new research.People feeling depressed after a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome should feel free to open up to their doctors so they can be treated, Kapadia told Reuters Health.Edmondson said family and friends should also be aware and prepared to connect patients with the appropriate resources, if necessary.“Even though your husband, wife or whoever had one of these events and is going to be fine in terms of cardiovascular health and longevity, they may not be able to tell you the true psychological impact it’s having,” he said."

Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) just before the 2016 election.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5849ebfe120000dc00eee563.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC run by former aides to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, raised an astonishing $39 million in the three weeks before the 2016 election, according to a report filed on Thursday. The huge injection of money helped backstop Senate Republicans and protect their majority on Election Day.The gigantic fundraising surge for the super PAC pushed its total above $100 million, making it one of the best-funded super PACs of the 2016 election cycle. The late contributions from usual suspects among Republican donors paid for advertisements that helped protect incumbent Sens. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and elect newcomer Todd Young in Indiana. Many of those donors will have key interests in front of the next legislative session.Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam combined to give $15 million ― the largest donation to McConnell’s group. Adelson, the billionaire casino operator, has long pushed for Congress to ban online gambling. Republicans have introduced legislation in the past two sessions to do this.The second-biggest donor to the super PAC is unknown, because it came in the form of a $9.2 million contribution from One Nation, a dark-money nonprofit run by the same people as Senate Leadership Fund. The group ran millions of dollars in advertisements early in the campaign season attacking Democratic Senate candidates.Stephen Schwarzman, chairman of the private equity titan Blackstone Group, contributed $2.2 million. Schwarzman is an avowed opponent of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. He supports radically reducing regulations for financial firms and cutting taxes, or keeping them as low as they already are, for billionaires like himself.“We’re so overregulated as a country that we just crushed our productivity,” Schwarzman said in the past. “That’s temporary because it’s reversible if anybody politically chooses to reverse it. If they wanna accelerate it, good luck.”After President Barack Obama called for raising the tax rate on carried interest, which is how private equity investors make their money, Schwarzman said, “It’s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.”Blackstone Group spent more than $2 million on lobbying through September on issues ranging from tax reform, financial regulation, support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and housing. The private equity company owns Hilton Worldwide, a hotel competitor of President-elect Donald Trump. Blackstone bought up at least 50,000 foreclosed homes in the wake of the financial crisis and ensuing bank-led fraud that immiserated millions by wrongly evicting them from their own homes. Blackstone is now taking its home-rental business public.Paul Singer, a billionaire hedge fund manager known for investing in distressed foreign debt, gave $2 million to Senate Leadership Fund. Singer and other hedge fund and private equity managers recently created a new industry lobbying group called CIRCA to advocate for policies favorable to billionaire investors like themselves.Collectively, members of the billionaire DeVos family of Michigan contributed $1.2 million. These contributions came from 11 members of the family. Their wealth derives from Richard DeVos Sr., who founded the multi-level marketing company Amway. His son, Richard DeVos Jr., is married to Betsy DeVos, picked by Trump to be the next education secretary. The Senate will vote on her nomination.Petrodome Energy, an oil and gas company owned by investor W. Ed Bosarge, gave $1 million. This contribution, however, does not relate to the energy industry, but rather to another business run by Bosarge. The multi-millionaire owns stem-cell company Bosarge Life Sciences that has been lobbying Congress to pass legislation that would speed Food and Drug Administration approval of medications and medical devices by bypassing final regulatory scrutiny of whether the products actually work. Legislative language very similar to this was included in the just-passed 21st Century Cures Act. The provision was denounced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as a “special deal” for a “major Republican donor.”There also was a contribution to Senate Leadership Fund from an oil and gas company still interested in energy policy. Polar Tankers Inc., a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, gave $1 million. The oil giant has been lobbying on issues related on natural gas pipelines and Alaska oil exploration.Republican senators also chipped in money from their own leadership PACs to Senate Leadership Fund to help colleagues win tough races.Sen. Orrin Hatch’s (R-Utah) OrrinPAC gave $500,000. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) gave $250,000 from his Freedom Fund PAC. McConnell’s own Bluegrass Committee gave $150,000. Sen. John Cornyn’s (R-Texas) Alamo PAC also gave $150,000. Sen. Tim Scott’s (R-S.C.) Tomorrow is Meaningful gave $100,000, as did Sen. John Thune’s (R-S.D.) Heartland Values PAC and Sen. John Barrasso’s (R-Wyo.) Common Values PAC. Other leadership PAC contributions came from Sens.

24,POLITICS,San Francisco Mayor Rejects Tough Restrictions On Airbnb,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/san-francisco-airbnb-regulations_us_584af753e4b04c8e2bafabbc,The measure was aimed at easing the area's housing crisis.,2016-12-09,San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee vetoed an attempt to crack down on short-term rentals.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584b2e551c00002d000eace2.jpeg?ops=crop_8_99_3992_2568%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee (D) vetoed a bill Thursday that would have restricted short-term rentals in the city to 60 days a year, notching another win for Airbnb and other home-sharing companies.The bill, introduced by San Francisco city supervisor London Breed and approved by the board of supervisors in a 7-3 vote last month, would have significantly reduced the number of nights residents can rent out units for short-term use per year. Under existing law, residents can rent short-term units an unlimited number of nights if they plan to live in the home during the rental period. Unhosted rentals, meanwhile, are capped at 90 days a year.Breed’s bill would have capped all short-term rentals at 60 days annually. If passed, the regulations would have been among the toughest in the country.In a veto message, Lee expressed concern over the lack of distinction in the bill between hosted and unhosted units.“Most San Franciscans agree that there is a difference,” he said. “I have concluded that this legislation will make registration and enforcement of our short-term rental regulations more difficult and less effective, and risks driving even more people to illegal rent units.” The bill marked a shift for Breed, who opposed a 2015 ballot initiative to restrict unhosted short-term rentals to 75 days a year, among other regulations. (Voters rejected the measure.) At the time, Breed said she wanted to give existing home-sharing regulations time to work before imposing new ones. One year later, after deciding those regulations weren’t working, she introduced the new bill. Breed told the San Francisco Chronicle she was disappointed with the veto, but would continue to work with Lee to improve regulations. Another supervisor, John Avalos, was far more critical of Lee, hinting at the mayor’s reputation for putting the priorities of tech companies ahead of the city. “I’m sure Ed Lee is smart enough to understand how devastating short-term rentals have been to our housing stock, so it’s safe to say the mayor cares more about Airbnb’s bottom line than preventing homelessness,” Avalos said. San Francisco and the wider Bay Area is in the throes of a years-long housing crisis, thanks in large part to Silicon Valley’s tech renaissance over the last decade. Housing prices have skyrocketed in the region, pushing out long-term residents who simply can’t compete with Google executives and venture capitalists. And while there are projects underway to build more affordable housing, it’s not enough to keep up with demand or match the rate of units being taken off the rental market. Housing advocates point to short-term rentals, such as those offered by Airbnb, as part of the problem. Landlords can benefit from evicting tenants and renting vacant units on a short-term basis at a much higher rate than they could charge for a long-term rental. Caps like the one proposed in San Francisco would make such ventures much less profitable, and in theory would put units back on the rental market. An Airbnb spokesman didn’t return a request for comment on the latest bill, but the $30 billion San Francisco-based company has fought hard against previous efforts to curb its effect on the housing market. Airbnb has rejected the idea that it removes units from the market, and has argued that its business actually helps individuals afford expensive mortgages by allowing them to rent a spare room. Cities and states across the country are considering legislation similar to the bill in San Francisco. Most notably, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed a bill in October making it illegal to rent apartments on a short-term basis. Airbnb is challenging the law in court, arguing the regulation does “irreparable harm” to its business.Meanwhile, the company has agreed to enforce limits on rentals in London and Amsterdam."

Corner Grocer describes the item on Seamless as an “emergency contraceptive reduces chance of pregnancy after unprotected sex ― not for regular birth control.”There is one unfortunate hitch: The bodega lists the item at $76.99, which is about $30 more than Plan B’s average price of $49.99.

A group of investors in Silicon Valley came up with an idea: Provide free or discounted rides through the ride-sharing taxi services Uber and Lyft. Funding came through a super PAC called My Ride to Vote. But at the time, no one knew who provided the money.This is one of many cases in which super PACs spent money on the election in the final weeks of the election without having to disclose their donors until after the election. The cutoff for pre-election disclosure is Oct. 19. Those donations were revealed Thursday.Those who took advantage of My Ride to Vote’s services were getting their Uber or Lyft rides subsidized by Google co-founder Sergey Brin. The billionaire donated $1 million to fund the ride-sharing super PAC.Some of these late-stage donations went to super PACs whose purposes were already well-known. Priorities USA Action, the main super PAC supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign, raised a little more than $15 million in the final three weeks of the election. There were no surprises among the late donors, just more money from the same mega-donors who help make Priorities USA Action the most well-funded super PAC ever. The group did end the election with $2.1 million cash on hand. Perhaps some of this money could have been spent in Michigan or Wisconsin.A coterie of pro-Donald Trump super PACs also reported their late contributions. Future45 raised the most, with $11.3 million in contributions raised in October and November. Casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, contributed the most with $10 million combined. The second biggest donor was World Wrestling Entertainment’s Linda McMahon, Trump’s pick to head the Small Business Administration, with a $1 million donation. McMahon had previously donated $6.2 million to pro-Trump super PACs.Future45 also donated $100,000 to another anti-Clinton super PAC called Character Counts. The group had not reported any donations prior to Election Day. Another pro-Trump super PAC that had not reported any prior donations, RallyPAC, disclosed Thursday that it got $250,000 from banker Andy Beal.Rebuilding America Now, another pro-Trump super PAC, raised less in its final days with just $2.1 million. The biggest donor was Los Angeles real estate developer Geoff Palmer, with a $1 million. Cerberus Capital Management head Stephen Feinberg, a major private equity investor, gave $975,000, while the private prison company GEO Group chipped in $125,000. The final major pro-Trump super PAC, Make America Number 1, raised $1.1 million. It received $1 million from Trump’s biggest Silicon Valley ally, Peter Thiel, and $100,000 from the presidential campaign committee of Dr. Ben Carson. Carson has since been named to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and an associate of Thiel’s has been floated as a potential head of the Food and Drug Administration.There were other late contributions to groups in down-ballot races, too. In the Nevada Senate race, the super PAC Silver State PAC received a late boost to help Rep. Joe Heck, the Republican candidate for Senate, in the form of a $100,000 contribution from billionaire hedge fund investor Robert Mercer. Heck, however, lost the race.Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) won his Senate race against Democrat Deborah Ross and was aided by late spending from the super PAC Grow NC Strong. The group had raised only about $400,000 before Oct. 20 but received a $1 million boost from the Reynolds American tobacco company in the final weeks to help Burr.A similar situation played out in Missouri, where Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) won election with support from Heartland Resurgence, a super PAC run by his former chief of staff-turned-lobbyist Gregg Hartley. The group had not raised much before the final weeks of the campaign, but then it received over $1 million for the last stretch, including checks of $250,000 each from Missouri-based donors David Humphreys and Sam Fox.The National Horizon super PAC reported no donations before Oct. 20. This meant that no one knew who was behind the attacks it ran against Pennsylvania Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty and New York Democratic House candidate Zephyr Teachout in the last days of the campaign. A disclosure filed Thursday reveals that Ronald Lauder, an heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune, donated $700,000 and the conservative Club for Growth, a nonprofit that does not disclose its donors, gave $500,000.In Louisiana, a super PAC called Prosperity With Accountability ran ads promoting Democratic Senate candidate Carolyn Fayard. The group ran ads that compared Fayard to barrier-breaking Rep. Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.) and attempting to tie the other Democrat in the race, Foster Campbell, to noted racist and Trump supporter David Duke. The ads did not work. Campbell finished in the top two on Election Day, which in Louisiana means he moved on to a runoff that will be held Saturday.As for who was behind Prosperity With Accountability’s attempt to boost Fayard. It was her mom, Cynthia Fayard."

It started trending on Twitter, though some of the tweets were criticisms of the hashtag.Posobiec, a conservative with 58,000 Twitter followers who has also pushed the conspiracy theory that the “Comet Pizza” gunman was an actor, appears to have been the first one to use the hashtag #DumpStarWars, although he was not the first one to call for a boycott of the film.That push started in earnest following Donald Trump’s election last month, when “Rogue One” screenwriter Chris Weitz tweeted, “Please note that the Empire is a white supremacist (human) organization,” to which fellow “Rogue One” screenwriter Gary Whitta replied, “Opposed by a multi-cultural group led by brave women.” Both those tweets have since been deleted, but another from Nov. 11 remains — in which Weitz stated, “Star Wars against hate. Spread it,” along with an Alliance symbol adorned with a safety pin — angering conservatives.But what makes Posobiec’s hashtag different is that it was promoted alongside blatant lies. His most popular tweet in the series alleged that “Rogue One” was rewritten to “add in Anti Trump scenes calling him a racist [sic].” Hours later, he tweeted out a screenshot featuring a photo of “Rogue One” Felicity Jones in her “Star Wars” costume alongside fake CNN-like chyron that read, “WRITERS: TRUMP IS A NAZI.” While it is true that the film did do some reshooting this summer, and that Weitz and Whitta appear to not be the biggest Donald Trump fans, a representative for Disney told The Huffington Post that there is “absolutely no truth” to the rumor that the movie was reshot to include anti-Donald Trump scenes.When someone asked Weitz about the Posobeic’s claims on Twitter, he called them “completely fake,” and Posobeic a “liar” to boot. But before news of the lies could make the rounds, the hashtag had already taken off with their help.Soon, conservative voices like Barack Obama’s half-brother, Malik Obama, and self-identified “American nationalist” Mike Cernovich were using the hashtag in tweets. “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” opens Dec. 16. Before then, and after, be on the lookout for claims that seem too good to be true. Strangely enough, even Jack Posobiec can agree with that. "

Bush, told Fox Business.Bolton, a hawkish conservative seen as being among the contenders to be Trump’s secretary of state, said Trump expected countries to live up to commitments they have made on issues such as trade.“The Chinese have not just been doing that,” Bolton said, while also highlighting what he said were China’s political and military steps “to make the South China Sea into a Chinese province.”Asked if he thought Trump’s remarks were a statement of intent and an opening negotiating position, Bolton said, “I think that’s at least what it is, and it may be more than that as well. You could use the Taiwan relationship to play off against their performance in the South China Sea.“I think it was very important that he mentioned what I’ve seen for the past 15 years, which is that China says they’re being helpful with the North Korean nuclear weapons program, when in fact they’ve done precious little,” he said.In an opinion article last January in The Wall Street Journal, Bolton proposed using degrees of escalation on Taiwan that could start with receiving Taiwanese diplomats officially at the State Department and lead to restoring full diplomatic recognition, to pressure China to step back from its pursuit of territory in East Asia.Experts saw Trump’s call with Tsai on Dec. 4 - the first by a U.S. president-elect or president with a Taiwanese leader since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in 1979 - as an opening salvo in a risky test of wills with Beijing.However, Trump followed this by saying he would nominate Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, a long-standing friend of Beijing, as the next U.S. ambassador to China, a move which that country’s state news agency said was a positive sign for ties.(Reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

Trump's choice for labor secretary is head of that brand.",2016-12-09,"If Andrew Puzder is confirmed as labor secretary, he would be coming to Washington directly from an industry his department would be responsible for regulating.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584ac1101c00002d000eaad9.jpeg?ops=crop_206_6_2794_1647%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"President-elect Donald Trump named a fast-food chief executive to be the next labor secretary Thursday. If confirmed, Andrew Puzder ― the head of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. burger chains ― would be responsible for enforcing the country’s labor laws and holding unscrupulous employers accountable.Puzder apparently has some experience when it comes to wage law enforcement, albeit on the other side. According to a review of Labor Department records, Hardee’s Food Systems Inc., a subsidiary of CKE Restaurants, agreed to pay $58,000 in back pay to a group of 456 workers after a wage-and-hour investigation by the agency in 2006 and 2007. At the time, Puzder was head of CKE, which fully controlled Hardee’s Food Systems, according to financial disclosure forms.Records indicate all the money was owed for overtime. Asked for more information on the case, the Labor Department would provide only limited details. The investigation was company-wide, and Hardee’s Food Systems had failed to include workers’ incentive bonuses when it computed overtime pay, making the payouts smaller than they should have been. The department does not say whether an investigation was initiated by the agency or resulted from a worker’s complaint.A Hardee’s spokeswoman referred questions to an official with the Republican National Committee on Friday. That official could not immediately be reached for comment.Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, hourly workers are due time-and-a-half pay for any hours they work over 40 in a week. If he becomes labor secretary, one of Puzder’s top responsibilities would be enforcing the overtime standard. In addition to the Hardee’s Food Systems case, several Hardee’s franchisees have been investigated over wage theft allegations in recent years.In one case in Tennessee, a franchisee agreed to pay 29 workers more than $7,600 in back pay. In a case out of Michigan, a franchisee was found to have shorted seven workers nearly $5,000. And a Missouri franchisee agreed to pay four workers nearly $4,000 for failing to meet the minimum wage. In each of those cases, the franchisee, rather than CKE Restaurants, was held responsible for the violations.The Hardee’s investigations should underscore why advocates for low-wage workers are concerned with Trump’s choice. Puzder would be coming to Washington directly from the top of an industry that the Labor Department is responsible for policing. Wage theft is a widely documented problem in the fast-food business, which pays some of the lowest wages in the country. Labor Department investigators often find that restaurants have failed to follow minimum wage and overtime law.As the nation’s workplace watchdog, Puzder would be the top official responsible for potentially suing Hardee’s restaurants ― the very franchisees he has worked with as the head of the Hardee’s brand ― when they don’t pay workers what’s due them.Christine Owens, director of the National Employment Law Project, said a fast-food executive should not be charged with enforcing wage laws. “Puzder will be there for his low-wage-industry CEO buddies, who are now salivating over the prospect of rolling back the Obama administration’s efforts to raise pay for low-wage workers, improve workplace safety, and increase corporate accountability for wage theft and other violations,” Owens said.You’d be hard-pressed to find a fast-food brand that hasn’t been cited or sued for breaking wage laws over the years. During the 2016 fiscal year alone, the Labor Department found that 10,300 fast-food workers were owed more than $5.4 million in back wages. Investigators discovered violations in 86 percent of their fast-food cases.As with other companies like McDonald’s, CKE Restaurants itself is typically not the target ― its franchisees are. For example, in 2013, a Hardee’s franchisee in Michigan agreed to pay nearly $10,000 to a group of workers after being taken to court by the Labor Department. Roughly half of that sum was for wage violations, the other half for damages, according to settlement records.The franchisee, Ishaan Enterprises, had been paying workers in a way that avoided having to pay them overtime. When workers logged more than 40 hours in a week, they didn’t get time-and-a-half pay on those extra hours ― they only got paid “straight time.” One worker alone was owed nearly $2,700 in back wages.Obama’s Labor Department has made a point of targeting the fast-food industry for enforcement because they say they find so many violations there. Meanwhile, the Fight for $15, a union-backed campaign to raise the minimum wage and bring collective bargaining to fast food, has brought a host of lawsuits against companies like McDonald’s over alleged wage theft and discrimination.Trump has made clear through his nominations that he wants business-friendly Cabinet members who’ve criticized Obama’s policies. His choice for health secretary, Rep. Tom Price, has fought to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, and his pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, has sued the very agency he would be leading.Labor watchdogs worry that enforcement would be far more lax under someone like Puzder.Investigations into wage theft or workplace hazards are carried out by career civil servants at the Labor Department, who keep their positions regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican occupies the White House. But, as at all federal agencies, priorities are set by the political appointees at the top. Enforcement can be strong or lax, depending on the administration and its deputies.Puzder has been a public critic of the labor reforms championed by the Obama administration, including the White House’s attempts to raise the minimum wage and grant overtime protections to more salaried workers. Puzder himself has penned opinion pieces and made television appearances criticizing the sitting president’s reforms as job killers.Earlier this year, the Obama administration tried to overhaul the nation’s overtime rules to make them more generous to workers. Under the changes, which are currently blocked in court, an additional 4.2 million salaried workers would be guaranteed time-and-a-half pay when they work over 40 hours in a week. The overtime changes would be the most significant labor reform of the Obama era.Writing in The Wall Street Journal in 2014, Puzder said the rules would hurt the workers they were intended to help, like the fast-food managers who work for Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. Many of those managers would be newly entitled to overtime. “Overtime pay has to come from somewhere, most likely from reduced hours, reduced salaries or reduced bonuses,” Puzder wrote.Have you worked for Puzder, CKE Restaurants, or Hardee’s/Carl’s Jr.?

Sarah Anderson, co-editor of Inequality.org at the Institute of Policy Studies, believes the legislation could “spread like wildfire” to other cities across the nation.“People are now even more skeptical that anything will happen at the federal level to reduce inequality,” Anderson told HuffPost on Thursday.She said the threat of “draconian cuts to the social safety net” during a Donald Trump presidency could push leadership from other cities to explore similar innovative sources of revenue.More than 500 companies will be affected by the new rule, including Walmart, Honeywell, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and General Electric, according to a statement from IPS.Anderson said companies affected by this law will have three different options for responding to the tax. They can either narrow the gap by paying their lowest paid workers more, pay their highest paid workers less or do nothing and pay the penalty tax.“Whichever way they respond, this is going to be good for reducing income inequality,” she told HuffPost.This progressive law is made possible under Dodd-Frank legislation by a Securities and Exchanges Commission rule that will require publicly traded companies to disclose the pay gap between CEOs and average workers starting next year.Though Trump has vowed to dismantle parts of Dodd-Frank legislation, Novick isn’t too concerned.“Donald Trump himself has railed against outrageous CEO pay,” Novick told HuffPost. “I think this would be a particularly embarrassing part for them to repeal.”Still, an op-ed by the Wall Street Journal editorial board last month warned the legislation could encourage businesses to abandon Portland, but Anderson “can’t imagine” that would happen.“If they stopped operating here, that would be absurd,” Novick told HuffPost. “Corporations can exist without paying theirs CEOs hundreds of times what they pay their typical workers.”"

Sign up for HUFFPOST HILL and get a cheeky dose of political news every evening! Donald Trump tapped another Goldman Sachs guy for a top job, because apparently his strategy for draining the swamp involves a leveraged buyout of said swamp, firing the swamp’s entrenched managers, and then declaring the swamp bankrupt. Trump cheerleader Bill Mitchell is thinking about writing a book, so spare a thought for whatever sucker has to edit it. And new filings reveal Trump’s campaign paid his businesses $12 million during the campaign, so at this rate, he might be a real billionaire some day.OBAMA MAY TRANSMIT THIS ABOUT VLADIMIR - This might reveal details on the alleged Russian interference in the U.S. presidential race, which half the country has decided not to care about anyway. Akbar Shahid Ahmed: “President Barack Obama expects to receive a U.S. intelligence report on security breaches during the 2016 election before he leaves office on Jan. 20, his homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters Friday…. The U.S. intelligence community announced on Oct. 7 that it believes hackers supported by the Russian government were responsible for meddling in the election process, including by targeting the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton adviser John Podesta and other notable political figures, like former Secretary of State Colin Powell.” [HuffPost]Meanwhile… Putin’s tovarisch, President-elect Donald Trump, doesn’t seem to care much about actual U.S. intelligence reports, Reuters’ Mark Hosenball and Patricia Zengerle report.AMERICA IS TRUMP’S BIGGEST MARK YET - And we ain’t seen nothing yet. S.V. Date: “Donald Trump’s presidential campaign sent Donald Trump’s businesses $2.9 million in the final days prior to and the weeks following his election…. The burst of spending brings to more than $12 million the total Trump has funneled back to his businesses since the start of the campaign. It continues his pattern of choosing to spend donors’ money at his own properties for events and on his own airplane for travel, even though it meant spending considerably more than comparable alternatives.” [HuffPost]THE PRICE FOR CABINET SEATS IS HIGHER THAN EVER - Matea Gold and Anu Narayanswamy: “With his choice of restaurant executive Andrew Puzder to serve as his Labor secretary, President-elect Donald Trump has now tapped six big donors and fundraisers to serve in his administration, lining up an unprecedented concentration of wealthy backers for top posts. Together with their families, Trump’s nominees gave $11.6 million to support his presidential bid, his allied super PACs and the Republican National Committee, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal campaign filings. One single appointee — WWE co-founder Linda McMahon — contributed $7.5 million to back his White House run before Trump selected her to run the Small Business Administration this week. She and her husband Vince were also the top outside donors to Trump’s private foundation.” [WashPost]Congressional Republicans don’t give a rat’s patootie about Trump’s ethics, because tax cuts.BULLY PULPIT - Obama had ISIS. W had the Axis of Evil. Reagan had the Evil Empire. Trump has an 18-year-old kid. Jenna Johnson: “About a year ago, 18-year-old college student Lauren Batchelder stood up at a political forum in New Hampshire and told Donald Trump that she didn’t think he was ‘a friend to women.’ The next morning, Trump fired back on Twitter — calling Batchelder an ‘arrogant young woman’ and accusing her of being a ‘plant’ from a rival campaign. Her phone began ringing with callers leaving threatening messages that were often sexual in nature. Her Facebook and email inboxes filled with similar messages. As her addresses circulated on social media and her photo flashed on the news, she fled home to hide…. Five days before the election, she received a Facebook message that read: ‘Wishing I could f―-ing punch you in the face. id then proceed to stomp your head on the curb and urinate in your bloodied mouth and i know where you live, so watch your f―-ing back punk.’” [WashPost]Chuck Jones, the union leader getting death threats from Trump supporters this week, told HuffPost Hill today he’s been getting mostly supportive messages since he stood up to Trump’s mean tweets yesterday. He’s hoping for a sitdown with the president-elect. Beer summit?FIRST, THEY CAME FOR THE CLIMATE SCIENTISTS - How soon before someone doxxes these civil servants? Catherine Traywick and Jennifer A. Dlouhy: “Advisers to President-elect Donald Trump are developing plans to reshape Energy Department programs, help keep aging nuclear plants online and identify staff who played a role in promoting President Barack Obama’s climate agenda. The transition team has asked the agency to list employees and contractors who attended United Nations climate meetings, along with those who helped develop the Obama administration’s social cost of carbon metrics, used to estimate and justify the climate benefits of new rules. The advisers are also seeking information on agency loan programs, research activities and the basis for its statistics, according to a five-page internal document circulated by the Energy Department on Wednesday.” [Bloomberg]SWAMP RE-SWAMPED - Goldman Sachs always wins. Ben Walsh: “Trump’s latest pick continues that trend, with the president-elect choosing Gary Cohn, the president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, to head the National Economic Council, NBC News reports. The NEC advises the president on economic policy, and its director works in the White House…. Trump’s decision to invite several Goldman Sachs employees to join his administration certainly defies the populist image he cultivated while he ran for office. The president-elect closed his campaign with an ad that bashed the political and financial establishment, pairing classically anti-Semitic phrases with images of Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein, billionaire investor George Soros, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and other finance figures.” [HuffPost]Trump, who campaigned against the “elites,” says he prefers rich people.FILL THE SWAMP WITH OIL - Peter Nicholas and Bradley Olson: “Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Rex Tillerson has emerged as the leading candidate to become President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, according to two transition officials, marking the latest twist in a multi-week search for the nation’s top diplomat.” [WSJ]LOL RUDY - Tal Kopan and Daniella Diaz: “Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has removed himself from consideration for a position in President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, Trump announced in a statement Friday.” [CNN]TRUMP ADMINISTRATION POISED TO LITERALLY SELL AMERICA - Amy Harder and Michael C. Bender: “President-elect Donald Trump is expected to tap Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.) to lead the Interior Department, according to a person familiar with the matter. Ms. McMorris Rodgers, a senior member of the House of Representatives, if confirmed by the Senate, would lead Mr. Trump’s efforts to open up federal lands and waters to fossil-fuel development and reverse environmental policies the Obama administration has pursued over the past eight years…. She supported legislation opening up federal waters to oil and natural-gas drilling, including the Atlantic Ocean, and preventing the Interior Department from regulating hydraulic fracturing, a controversial oil and natural-gas extraction technology.” [WSJ]Like HuffPost Hill?

Follow us on Twitter - @HuffPostHillLOYALTY IS A ONE-WAY STREET FOR TRUMP - Still, it’s hard to feel badly for this gang. Alex Isenstadt and Kenneth P. Vogel: “They’ve been with him from the beginning — when no one believed he could win, and when the Republican Party establishment wanted absolutely nothing to do with him. But now, as President-elect Donald Trump builds out his administration, the loyalists who helped launch his campaign and powered its stunning early victories are growing worried they won’t be getting plum jobs.Many of them say they’ve heard nothing about their career prospects and, during furtive huddles, have been commiserating with one another about how they can’t seem to get their calls to top Trump transition brass returned.” [Politico]Get yr hot Bill Mitchell news here, courtesy of HuffPost Hill’s Eliot Nelson: “Bill Mitchell, one of Donald Trump’s most outspoken backers on Twitter, tells HuffPost he’s meeting with publishers about writing a book. Mitchell doesn’t want to elaborate much on what the book would entail, other than that it would ‘detail my thoughts on the campaign.’ However, he says he is not ruling out other publishing options. ‘I may put together a coffee table book of some of my best tweets,’ Mitchell said, ‘what was happening when I tweeted this, what I was thinking.’ Asked if he would be interested in being the president-elect’s press secretary ― after all, few people have publicly defended Trump with such unwavering enthusiasm ― Mitchell was of two minds. ‘I would be great at that job. One of the things I’m good at is seeing the pattern in the chaos. I think I would be a very good press secretary,’ he replied. ‘On the other hand, I don’t want to work in Government.’”TRUMP EYES ROMNEY’S NIECE FOR RNC - Awkward! Eliana Johnson, Kenneth P. Vogel and Alex Isenstadt: “Ronna Romney McDaniel has emerged as Donald Trump’s likely choice to lead the Republican National Committee, two sources familiar with the president-elect’s decision told POLITICO. McDaniel, the niece of 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, is currently chair of the Michigan Republican Party. Trump’s decision could be announced as soon as Friday, a transition official said, when he is scheduled to visit Grand Rapids in the course of his post-election “thank you” tour. Several sources close to the decision-making process, however, said the final decision had not yet been made and it was possible that another top contender could be selected.” [Politico]TRUMP MAKES UGLY INSINUATION ABOUT IMMIGRANTS - Violent crimes are always a good opportunity to trash innocent people. Julie Hirschfeld Davis: “President-elect Donald J. Trump said Thursday that the stabbing attack by a refugee last week at Ohio State University was a ‘tragic reminder’ of the need to take a hard line on immigration, arguing that his administration would put the safety of Americans first in a way the Obama administration never has. Mr. Trump, who visited the university’s campus on Thursday before speaking at a victory rally in Des Moines, said the attack — carried out by a Somali-born refugee who Mr. Trump has said should not have been in the country — had been ‘yet one more tragic reminder that immigration security is now national security.’ ‘No more games, folks, no more games,’ he told several thousand people in a large event hall in downtown Des Moines, packed with supporters wearing bright-red caps emblazoned with Mr. Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ mantra.” [NYT]DURBIN AND GRAHAM DREAM OF A HUMANE AMERICA - Elise Foley: “Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) unveiled legislation on Friday to protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation under President-elect Donald Trump ― now the question is whether it will work. The bipartisan bill, called the Bridge Act, would effectively maintain the protections of President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. More than 740,000 young people were granted deportation reprieve and work permits under the program, but could now lose those protections, should Trump follow through on a promise to end DACA immediately upon taking office.” [HuffPost]TRUMP’S LABOR SECRETARY PICK IS A REAL EXPERT ON LABOR LAW - But not in a good way. Dave Jamieson: “President-elect Donald Trump named a fast-food chief executive to be the next labor secretary Thursday. If confirmed, Andrew Puzder ― the head of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. burger chains ― would be responsible for enforcing the country’s labor laws and holding unscrupulous employers accountable. Puzder apparently has some experience when it comes to wage law enforcement, albeit on the other side…. Puzder would be coming to Washington directly from the top of an industry that the Labor Department is responsible for policing. Wage theft is a widely documented problem in the fast-food business, which pays some of the lowest wages in the country. Labor Department investigators often find that restaurants have failed to follow minimum wage and overtime law.” [HuffPost]WHEN ELECTORAL COLLEGE MEMBERS DEFY THE POPULAR VOTE - But maybe don’t get your hopes up this time, liberal Twitter. Nina Agrawal: “Since 1900, there have been only nine faithless electors who defected for individual reason​​​​​​s, including one who abstained from voting altogether. Here’s a rundown of who they were and why they did it.” [LA Times]TRUMP BARNSTORMING FOR LOUISIANA SENATE CANDIDATE - Ken Thomas and Jonathan Lemire: “Tending to party politics, President-elect Donald Trump is rallying supporters in Louisiana on Friday ahead of the state’s Senate runoff election, aiming to pad the Republican majority he will inherit. Trump was campaigning for Republican John Kennedy in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and then making another stop on his ‘thank you’ tour in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a state that helped him prevail against Democrat Hillary Clinton in last month’s election.” [AP]MANHATTAN WILL NEVER LOVE YOU, DONALD TRUMP - Alexander Burns: “Mr. Trump has long been an intermittent source of irritation for New Yorkers, from his days as a tabloid exhibitionist to the long months of the 2016 campaign. But that clash has reached a new and potentially explosive phase since Nov. 8, as he has transformed his signature building — home to his penthouse apartment and business headquarters, and previously his campaign office — into a base of operations for his frenzied presidential transition. By signaling that he plans to keep a presence in New York after taking office in January, Mr. Trump, a Republican, has animated a confrontation unlike any in modern American politics: between a president who clings to his hometown and yearns for its affection, and a city that wishes he would simply disappear.” [NYT]INBOX: “Governor McCrory Finalizes Boundary Between North and South Carolina.”A LEFTIST CONSPIRACY THEORY, FOR A CHANGE - Ex-Rep. Chaka Fattah (D-Pa.) looks like he’s facing a long prison term for corruption, but some extra-woke former aides think something’s rotten in Center City. William Bender, Chris Brennan, and Jeremy Roebuck: “It’s not looking good for ol’ Chaka. But Fattah wouldn’t even have been convicted in June if Bartle hadn’t dismissed the lone holdout on the jury. That’s the theory, at any rate, at a mysterious new website called thefattahcase.com, which claims to be run by a dozen former Fattah staffers - all of whom insist on anonymity….

36,THE WORLDPOST,South Korea's National Assembly Votes To Impeach President Park Geun-Hye,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/south-korea-president-impeachment_us_5846ee67e4b0ebac5806b10c,The leader was embroiled in a scandal that prompted millions to take the streets in protest.,2016-12-09,"Protesters hold candles during an anti-government rally in central Seoul on Nov. 19, 2016, aimed at forcing South Korean President Park Geun-Hye to resign over a corruption scandal.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5849ca4f1800002c00e41a80.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"South Korea’s national assembly voted on Friday to impeach President Park Geun-hye, escalating the country’s enormous political scandal and potentially paving the way for early elections next year. 234 out of 300 lawmakers cast their ballots for Park’s impeachment, with 56 voting against it. The move needed a two-thirds majority in Parliament to pass. At least 60 members of Park’s own party voted against her in a sign of how deeply unpopular the president has become.Park’s impeachment follows months of protests and opposition demands for her to step down for alleged abuse of power, corruption and influence-peddling. The president’s approval ratings plummeted to lows of 4 percent as she desperately tried to maintain control of the government.The impeachment vote, which marks the most significant moment in South Korea’s ongoing political crisis since October, now puts added pressure on Park to resign, although she has said she will wait for the results of a constitutional court ruling in the case.Park faces a wide range of accusations that range from colluding to extort businesses to hosting cult rituals in the presidential Blue House. Most of the allegations relate to Park’s actions with her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, who opponents say secretly controlled aspects of the government despite holding no official title.The scandal initially broke in October, when a South Korean cable news outlet found marked-up edits of Park’s speeches on Choi’s tablet computer amid allegations of Choi’s involvement in financial corruption.The revelation set off a cascade of other accusations, including allegations that Choi was rewriting policy speeches and even telling Park what to wear.A large part of the outrage stemmed from the fact that Choi is the daughter of Choi Tae-min, the founder of an obscure Catholic sect and a mentor to Park until his death in 1994. Opposition politicians allege that the younger Choi took on her father’s role of advising Park, exerting a shadowy influence on the elected president. Choi, who now faces criminal charges, was arrested in late October and stands accused of colluding to use her personal influence and political connections to extort businesses into making financial donations. Dozens of companies, including major brands such as Samsung, donated a total of $65 million to two foundations Choi controls, investigators say.The scandal cast a pall over Park’s administration and infuriated South Koreans. A series of rallies, some numbering as many as 1.7 million demonstrators, have filled South Korea’s streets. In late October, a man tried to drive a construction vehicle into the gate of the prosecutor’s office, where Choi was being questioned, and later admitted he was on a mission to kill her.Park initially denied any wrongdoing, but as more media reports about Choi’s influence emerged, she issued a tearful apology and asked the nation to forgive what she called her “carelessness.” She denied many of the more bizarre accusations against her, however, including hosting cult-like rituals in the presidential residence. The president attempted to further quell the scandal by firing a number of top aides in early November. She also tried to remove Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, but Parliament opposed the move ― Hwang will now become acting president following the impeachment. Meanwhile, the public and the political opposition were not pacified by Park’s apologies or actions. Rolling protests and efforts to impeach her continued throughout the past month, culminating in the impeachment vote on Friday. Now, Park will be forced to hand over power to the prime minister as she waits for the nation’s constitutional court to decide the validity of the impeachment vote. If the court rules that the impeachment is legitimate, South Korea will have 60 days to hold a presidential election. "

New research suggests the island's enormous ice sheet is more unstable than scientists previously believed.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584a78e61800002c00e41bf9.jpeg?cache=aX2SfrGMaL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If the ice sheet that blankets most of Greenland should melt, it would be catastrophic because sea levels would rise more than 20 feet. This would submerge coastal cities worldwide and threaten land that’s home to at least 15 million Americans.Scientists had believed that the world’s second largest ice body had been relatively stable during the recent geological past. Even during periods of warming, the massive mantle of ice had remained largely intact, they thought.But new research suggests that this assumption may be grossly off the mark.The country’s ice sheet appears to have melted nearly completely at least once in the not-too-distant geological past, according to a groundbreaking study published on Thursday in the journal Nature.By studying a sample of bedrock taken from beneath Greenland’s ice deposit, researchers found that the autonomous Danish territory was ice-free (or “deglaciated”) for “extended periods during the Pleistocene epoch,” stretching from 2.6 million years to 11,700 years ago. Researchers estimate that the ice sheet shrunk to less than 10 percent of its current size and stayed that way for at least 280,000 years. Greenland’s mighty ice sheet, it seems, may not be as impregnable as previously believed.“Unfortunately, this makes the Greenland ice sheet look highly unstable,” said study co-author Joerg Schaefer, a paleoclimatologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, in a news release.Interestingly, another study published this week in the same edition of Nature revealed a significantly different picture of the ice sheet’s past. Also a result of bedrock testing but from a sample taken from a different location, the paper concluded that Greenland had maintained at least some ice cover for the past 7.5 million years. Scientists say, however, that the two studies aren’t necessarily contradictory ― and may in fact inform the other. Nearly all of Greenland’s ice could’ve melted at certain times in the past, but some ice might’ve remained in areas of higher elevation. “Both studies show that there’s the potential for the ice sheet to be quite dynamic and change over time,” University of Vermont professor Paul Bierman, lead author of the second study, told Time magazine.Authors of both papers agree that more research needs to be done to better understand the ice sheet’s history. And global warming should be taken as a real and present threat to the future of the ice body ― and the planet as a whole. “We do what we’re doing with the atmosphere right now at our own risk,” Bierman told Time. “We’re dealing with an incredibly complex system on Earth and we don’t know the half of it. There are surprises lurking out there.” Schaefer had a more direct warning. “We have to be prepared that this ice sheet might go again, and it might go again soon,” he said, according to MIT Technology Review. “Soon,” of course, is relative to geological time. It could take centuries or even millennia for all that ice to melt.But there’s still plenty of reason to be concerned. Greenland currently contributes about a quarter of the three millimeters that global sea levels rise every year ― and climate change could greatly accelerate the speed of the ice sheet’s melting. “Projections of sea-level rise during this century hover around 3 or 4 feet, but many, including the one from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, do not take Greenland into account,” states a blog post on Columbia’s website. The impacts of climate change on Greenland are already being seen. The island’s ice mantle is melting five times faster than it was in the 1990s, according to a 2012 study.A Google Earth timelapse of northeast Greenland between 1984 and 2016 shows just how dramatic the melt has been on some parts of the country (use the scrollbar to move backwards and forwards in time):Clarification: The article previously referred to Greenland as a “Northern European” country. The reference has been removed since geographically it is part of North America, although it is now politically a part of Denmark."

And global warming should be taken as a real and present threat to the future of the ice body ― and the planet as a whole. “We do what we’re doing with the atmosphere right now at our own risk,” Bierman told Time. “We’re dealing with an incredibly complex system on Earth and we don’t know the half of it. There are surprises lurking out there.” Schaefer had a more direct warning. “We have to be prepared that this ice sheet might go again, and it might go again soon,” he said, according to MIT Technology Review. “Soon,” of course, is relative to geological time. It could take centuries or even millennia for all that ice to melt.But there’s still plenty of reason to be concerned. Greenland currently contributes about a quarter of the three millimeters that global sea levels rise every year ― and climate change could greatly accelerate the speed of the ice sheet’s melting. “Projections of sea-level rise during this century hover around 3 or 4 feet, but many, including the one from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, do not take Greenland into account,” states a blog post on Columbia’s website. The impacts of climate change on Greenland are already being seen. The island’s ice mantle is melting five times faster than it was in the 1990s, according to a 2012 study.A Google Earth timelapse of northeast Greenland between 1984 and 2016 shows just how dramatic the melt has been on some parts of the country (use the scrollbar to move backwards and forwards in time):Clarification: The article previously referred to Greenland as a “Northern European” country. The reference has been removed since geographically it is part of North America, although it is now politically a part of Denmark."

The lawmaker behind the bill, Pablo Ferreryra, told the Argentine newspaper the objective is “to prevent and punish sexual harassment that occurs in public spaces or places accessible to the public in which harassment, ill-treatment or intimidation affects the general dignity, freedom of transit and the right of a person’s physical or moral integrity based on their gender, identity or sexual orientation.” The law stipulates that harassment goes beyond catcalling, including indirect or direct references to a person’s body, photographing or filming private parts without consent, improper or unwelcome physical contact, persecution or cornering of a victim; masturbation and indecent exposure. “Street harassment is deeply violent because it is an unwanted and undesired practice that has negative psychological impact,” Ferreryra told La Nación.It’s an important move for Buenos Aires, whose former mayor Mauricio Macri was criticized in 2014 for saying on radio he didn’t believe women who said they didn’t like being catcalled, even when comments were accompanied by crude language like “what a nice ass you have.” Macri became president of Argentina in 2015. The need to change sexist or misogynist attitudes has become an important topic in the country, particularly after the rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl in Argentina’s coast sparked protests and outrage across Latin America in October. The powerful #NiUnaMenos (#NotOneMore) movement was also evoked after a 7-year-old indigenous girl in Colombia’s capital was kidnapped, raped and murdered on Dec. 4. The new Buenos Aires law could also force offenders to do community service, according to the BBC, and it plans to go beyond punishing transgressors by also facilitating public education campaigns aimed at changing cultural attitudes that normalize sexual harassment.Ferreryra even responded to those who defended catcalling as a cultural norm. “Some manifestations of sexual harassment are accepted as folkloric or traditional, and that should not be an argument to tolerate this transgression,” he said. “No form of violence should be sponsored with pride by any society.” "

Grupo Folklorico, comprised of middle- and high-school students from Instituto Blaise Pascale in Oaxaca, was planning to visit the sister city of Palo Alto, California, in April.However, after Trump’s election, parents started to cancel, according to Neighbors Abroad of Palo Alto, a volunteer group that coordinates sister city activities.“They are parents like... parents anywhere,” said Bob Wenzlau, the organization’s president. “When they are sending their children without their being there, there’s a heightened sensitivity, like any of us have.”Palo Alto is an affluent city in the progressive San Francisco Bay area, but that distinction may not mean much to parents in a faraway part of Mexico, a country that was often targeted by Trump during the presidential election. “We know we can tell them things are safe here,” Wenzlau said. But in their view, sending the kids to anywhere in the U.S. in this climate could still be risky.“These are parents that are afraid to send their children into a little bit of harm’s way up here,” he said. “They’re a long way away.”Wenzlau shared a portion of an email from the event’s organizer in Mexico, which cited “the socio-political situation in the U.S.A.” as the reason for the cancellation. The story was first reported by the local Palo Alto Online. It’s as yet unclear what effect, if any, Trump’s presidency will have on tourism, especially from Mexico. However, last week Canada lifted visa requirements on Mexican visitors in a bid to encourage both investors and tourists ― and perhaps capitalize on concerns among Mexicans leery of visiting the United States as Trump takes office next month."

He later said he plans an appeal.The charges against Wilders stem from a 2014 campaign rally, when he led a group of supporters to chant they wanted “Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!” Moroccans in the Netherlands. A smiling Wilders concluded: “we’re going to take care of that.”Reading the decision of a three-judge panel, Presiding Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said “no one is above the law”, including politicians. Wilder had planned the inflammatory remarks beforehand and incited others to discriminate people of Moroccan origin, he said.“If a politician crosses the line, that doesn’t mean free speech is being restricted,” he said. “A crime cannot be protected by the right to free speech.”In a videotaped response to the verdict, which he did not attend in person, Wilders said: “I will never be silenced” and the ruling was an attempt to “neutralize the leader of the largest and most popular opposition party in the Netherlands.”Steenhuis said Moroccans form a clearly defined population within the Netherlands that Wilders had “singled out ... (as having) less rights” to reside in the Netherlands. There are roughly 400,000 people of Moroccan origin in the Netherlands.“This statement can be regarded as affecting the dignity of this group as a whole. It is insulting for the entire group,” the ruling said.In closing remarks on Nov. 23, Wilders told judges his remarks were obviously not intended as a call to genocide ― he has never advocated violence ― but rather a reference to his official party platform.Measures he endorses that could lead to fewer Moroccans include a ban on immigration, expelling Moroccans with dual nationality who commit crimes, and a “voluntary repatriation” policy.Prosecutors, who rejected Wilders’ assertions the trial was politically motivated and an unfair attempt to limit his right to free speech, had asked that a fine of 5,000 euros ($5,300), but no prison sentence, be imposed.Wilders appeal is likely to last throughout the parliamentary election campaign, which runs for six weeks before voting on March 15.A previous attempt to prosecute Wilders for anti-Islam remarks, such as likening the religion to Nazism and calling for a ban on the Koran, ended in acquittal in 2011. That process was widely seen as strengthening his reputation as a defender of freedom of speech and increased his popularity.(Reporting by Toby Sterling, editing by Larry King)"

The country recognized same-sex marriage in 2013 and hosts some of the world’s largest gay pride festivals.Human rights groups including Amnesty International say homophobic violence is endemic in Brazil, where there were 326 murders in the community in 2014.Some Evangelical pastors, who are becoming increasingly popular in Brazil, have adopted overtly homophobic rhetoric.Luciana Jesus Silva, a bisexual woman and organizer of the occupation, asked the FLM to offer space to LGBT people after she learned that one of her gay friends had been hospitalized after a hate attack only to have his mother throw him out of the house, saying he was the work of the devil.“We who are the most marginalized and repressed by society have to stand together,” said Silva, 45, a mother of four.More than two dozen LGBT people have joined the occupation, though many more come.The occupation of several buildings in central Sao Paulo has lasted several months because of a Brazilian law that makes it hard to evict squatters.

45,POLITICS,"The Army Halted The Dakota Access Pipeline, But No One Is Sure What That Means",Michael McLaughlin and Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/army-halt-dakota-access-pipeline_us_5849a3a3e4b0905b344240c2,The pipeline developers could still complete the project using the same route.,2016-12-09,The Standing Rock Sioux have been fighting to keep the pipeline from being routed beneath Lake Oahe.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5849fac6120000dd00eee581.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FORT YATES, N.D. — Supporters of the Standing Rock Sioux rejoiced when the Army announced it would not allow construction of the final piece of the Dakota Access pipeline. That perhaps sounded like a definitive answer after months of protests, but insiders from the tribe and their allies knew that the fight over the pipeline remains far from over.Opponents of the pipeline aren’t even necessarily in agreement about exactly what the Army decided.The most optimistic interpretation comes from the attorney representing the Standing Rock Sioux. Jan Hasselman can envision the Army allowing the pipeline to proceed only if it were rerouted away from the tribe’s reservation. “It would be surprising to say the least” if the disputed section gets built beneath Lake Oahe, Hasselman said. The tribe’s members fear a leaky pipeline could contaminate their water source, and they contend it violates an 1851 federal treaty.Indeed, Sunday’s statement from the Army sounds clear. The Department of the Army said it “will not approve an easement that would allow the proposed Dakota Access pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe in North Dakota,” Army Assistant Secretary Jo-Ellen Darcy said Sunday. But there are a few reason for pause. A key tangible in the fate of the pipeline will be the change in administration. President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team indicated this week that he supports completing Energy Transfer Partners’ pipeline and will review it once in office next month.Sierra Club lawyer Doug Hayes doesn’t believe the Army’s statement completely ruled out using this route favored by the developer. Other options will be considered while the Army Corps of Engineers conducts an extensive study, called an environmental impact statement, or EIS.Hayes said it’s conceivable officials could still pick Lake Oahe as the best course. “Everything remains unclear as far as scope, process and timing,” Hayes said of the environmental impact statement. “To me, that indicates that that crossing is still an option.” Environmentalists who oppose the entire 1,172-mile project will favor an EIS that examines more than just the Lake Oahe section. The wider scope may look at other federal waterway crossings and grasslands and may uncover more potential risks that could cripple the developers’ plans. Energy Transfer Partners is likely to seek an EIS that just examines the small area around Lake Oahe, according to Hayes. The Army Corps normally accepts public comments before setting the scope of an environmental impact study. The corps didn’t respond to The Huffington Post’s inquiries for clarity on the issue. Thousands of pipeline opponents have flocked to the area, often camping in tents, tipis and other simple lodgings for weeks or months. More than 500 activists, calling themselves water protectors, have been arrested in Morton County during repeated confrontations with law enforcement.Some of the water protectors vow to keep up their resistance on federal land through the bitter cold, because they don’t believe the Army’s ruling will hold off Energy Transfer Partners. “That’s just a ploy. It’s not going to do anything to stop the corporation,” said protester Billy McMaster, 49, of Boise. “They’re just going to go ahead and do it, and then as soon as Trump comes in, it’s just going to be a wash because he’s just going to come in and pull his muscle and his might and push us out.”Before the EIS gets sorted out — a process that takes roughly six months to one year — the pipeline designed to carry up to 570,000 barrels of oil per day could be affected by court challenges. First up is a conference in a Washington federal court on Friday involving the developer and the Sioux tribe. After vowing to complete the pipeline despite the Army’s decision, Energy Transfer Partners on Monday filed court documents asking a judge for permission to build under the pivotal Lake Oahe reservoir. The company said in court documents filed Monday that the Army wrongly withheld the easement because it succumbed to “political pressure” and violence orchestrated by protesters, according to Reuters.“We don’t think much of that [argument], and we don’t think the government will think much of it either,” said Hasselman, an attorney representing the Standing Rock Sioux. A decision is unlikely Friday, but Energy Transfer Partners expects to prevail.“For more than three years now, Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules,” the company and Sunoco Logistics Partner said in a joint statement Sunday. “As stated all along, ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this Administration has done… changes that in any way.”The delays are eating into the company’s coffers and have cost $450 million, according to documents cited by The Wall Street Journal.The dispute over the pipeline in North Dakota has attracted the bulk of the media’s attention, but landowners in Iowa and the Sierra Club will be in an appeals court Dec. 15 contending that the Iowa Public Utilities Board misused eminent domain by condemning farmland. They will argue that creating a path for a private company to transport oil falls short of the public benefit that justifies seizing private property.“It goes against a lot of thrifty Iowans’ idea of what’s a good use of money,” said Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network. “Why would you privilege one property owner over another?”"

It was a cover up that evolved from uncontrolled chaos to an institutionalized and disciplined medal-winning conspiracy,” McLaren told a news conference on Friday.“It was a cover-up of an unprecedented scale and the second part of this report shows the evidence that increases the number of athletes involved as well as the scope of the conspiracy and cover up.“We have evidence revealing that more than 500 positive results were reported as negative, including well-known and elite-level athletes, who had their positive results automatically falsified.”McLaren said Russia won 24 gold, 26 silver and 32 bronze medals at London 2012 and no Russian athlete tested positive.“Yet the Russian team corrupted the London Games on an unprecedented scale, the extent of which will probably never be fully established,” he said.“The desire to win medals superseded their collective moral and ethical compass and Olympic values of fair play.“For years international sports competitions have unknowingly been hijacked by the Russians. Coaches and athletes have been playing on an uneven field.”The report said a urine sample-swapping technique used at Sochi became regular practice at the Moscow laboratory that dealt with elite athletes.It added that four Sochi gold medalists had samples with physiologically impossible salt readings, while 12 Russian Sochi medalists had evidence of tampering with the bottles containing their urine samples.The report detailed how a clean urine bank existed in the Moscow laboratory, where salt and coffee were added to clean samples to try to fool officials testing “B samples” in supposedly tamper-proof bottles.The report included evidence of DNA mismatches, where a tampered B sample did not match the DNA of previous specimens and cases of sample swapping between male and female athletes.The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) said in a statement that 53 percent of the athletes whose details had been shared with them by McLean’s investigation team had been sanctioned or were currently undergoing disciplinary proceedings.The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said the full findings of the report were unprecedented and astonishing.“They strike right at the heart of the integrity and ethics of sport,” Paralympic sport’s governing body said in a statement.Yelena Isinbayeva, the twice Olympic pole vault champion and now a Russian anti-doping official, however, said it was unfair to single out Russia for criticism.“If we want to clean up world sport, let’s start,” she said. “We don’t need to concentrate on just one country. I think banning clean Russian sportsmen is impractical and unfair.”The original McLaren report, released in July, revealed widespread state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.The July report found Moscow had concealed hundreds of positive doping tests in many sports ahead of the Sochi Games and led to a partial ban of Russian athletes competing in the Rio Olympics in August.Although Russian track and field athletes and weightlifters were banned from competing at Rio, the International Olympic Committee rejected a blanket ban and let international sports federations decide which athletes should be eligible to compete.The evidence contained in the report can be found at the website: here(Editing by Ed Osmond)"
47,ARTS & CULTURE,Book Publishers Are Scrambling To Release Trump 'Survival Guides',Maddie Crum,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-survival-guide-books_us_584aea24e4b04c8e2baf9342,Several forthcoming new books center on coping with the new president-elect.,2016-12-09,"President-elect Donald Trump speaks at a ""victory tour"" rally on Dec. 8.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584aea8f1800002d00e41d16.jpeg?cache=RFUxvNUrnF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The day after Donald Trump’s election win, many Americans experienced feelings akin to grief. And, actually, searches for the five stages of grief spiked on Nov. 9.If the fifth stage in the grieving process ― which, by the way, is far from universally accurate ― is acceptance, the sixth, for Never Trumpers, might be mobilization. If your fears have been realized, what do you do? Apparently, book publishers are swooping in to provide the answer. Yesterday, Publisher’s Weekly wrote about three titles being released in January that are aimed at providing guidance for those who struggle to cope with Trump’s upcoming inauguration. Two of the three books are essay collections. What We Do Now: Standing Up for Your Values in Trump’s America will feature writing from the likes of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren; Radical Hope will compile heartening takes on the power of optimism and activism. The third title, The Trump Survival Guide, sounds like a jokey stocking stuffer but will actually feature practical advice.All three titles were, of course, conceived after election night, making the turnaround time for their respective publishers ― Melville House, Vintage and Dey Street ― much quicker than usual. But, rushing out timely titles isn’t unheard of. The Guardian points out that “a handful of books have been revised and rushed out in the runup to Christmas, to meet demand for information in the wake of the Brexit vote.” A reissue of the book Glory & Bollocks: The Truth Behind 10 Defining Events in British History has been revised by its publisher, Oneworld, with an added chapter on Brexit.Both U.K. and U.S. publishers have already responded to Trump’s candidacy and election with less-serious books, too. In July, Michael Ian Black released a jokey riff on children’s literature, A Child’s First Book of Trump, published by Simon & Schuster; next week, Bard of the Deal: The Poetry of Donald Trump, a goofy parody, will come out from HarperCollins.For more earnest analyses, more time is needed. After an election cycle fueled by regional divides and fake news shared on social media, it’s heartening to see publishers contributing much-needed, deliberately arranged collections to the conversation. One hopes it’s not too little, too late. "

Denver’s 9News reports the letter was sent anonymously two weeks ago.“The hatred by some against people of color is one of the reasons we are where we’re at in the world today, and they wonder why we feel the way we do and take the stances that we take,” Marshall wrote in a caption accompanying a photo of the letter’s first page. “I received this letter at work.”It’s unclear who sent the letter, which has penmanship you’d expect from an ailing KKK enthusiast who relies on racial epithets popular in the 1930s and WRITES ONLY IN ALL-CAPS.“WE ARE ‘CHANNELING’ A DEVASTATING HARD HIT FOR YOU!!” the author writes. “SOMETHING TO MAKE YOU INVALID IN A WHEEL CHAIR!! HA HA HA HA HA HA.” Most of the letter is unfit for print.Marshall said Friday he was “taken aback” by the “disgusting, disheartening, deplorable” missive and its threats. “That kind of stood out to me that somebody would have that much hate or malice toward me or would put so much energy into writing something like that and send it to me,” he said.The Broncos did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post. Coach Gary Kubiak said after practice Friday that the team was investigating.“I was not much aware of it until this morning, but our organization is on top of it,” Kubiak said, in comments relayed by ESPN. “That’s all I can tell you.”Racist incidents and hate crimes have jumped after last month’s election of Donald Trump. New York Giants fullback Nikita Whitlock’s apartment in New Jersey was vandalized Tuesday night with swastikas and epithets, including the word “Trump.”Marshall was one of many NFL players who took a knee this season during the national anthem as a protest against social injustice and police brutality.“I’m not against the military, I’m not against the police or America,” Marshall said at the time. “I’m against social injustice.”He quit protesting at the Nov. 6 game, after he had met with Denver police officials and discussed the department’s policy on the use of force. Marshall pledged to donate $300 for every tackle he makes to a variety of nonprofits.“Going forward, I will be standing for the national anthem ― not because everything is perfect, or because I’m changing my stance on things,” Marshall wrote at the time. “But because of my hope for what we can become.”"

But because four other justices did, he joined them. “To afford them the opportunity to more fully consider the suitability of this case for review, ... I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy,” Roberts wrote in the Nov. 3 late-night order sparing Thomas Arthur’s life for now.Perhaps the move was a sign of comity in the midst of a divisive election season, Bloomberg’s Greg Stohr wrote. In August, a similar courtesy was extended in a high-profile transgender rights case ― that time a liberal justice joined the four conservatives. For a moment, it seemed as if the Supreme Court was trying to rise above its differences.But courtesy fell apart late Thursday. In quick succession, the Supreme Court granted, denied, granted and then again denied last-minute requests to halt the execution of another Alabama inmate, Ronald Smith.The most notable order came earlier in the evening. To that first denial of a stay, four justices — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — added a sentence noting that they would have temporarily spared Smith, presumably so they could have more time to consider the merits of his argument about the constitutionality of Alabama’s death sentencing system. This time, however, Roberts didn’t join them.So Smith’s lawyers submitted two more petitions, alleging a double standard. In one of them, they said the Supreme Court’s “inconsistent practices ... in capital cases clash with the appearance and reality both of equal justice under law and of sound judicial decision-making.”In the other, the lawyers seemed to call out Roberts directly ― for being courteous in the Arthur case, which is still pending, and not in their client’s case.“For a fifth courtesy vote to be permitted to grant Mr. Arthur a stay of execution but for this Court to fail to do so on Mr. Smith’s behalf is arbitrary action that violates the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause,” the lawyers wrote. “There is no rational basis for the Court to take such action.”One of those two petitions was briefly granted ― essentially to give the justices time to think ― and then both were almost as quickly denied. Late Thursday night Alabama executed Smith, who had been convicted of killing a store clerk in 1994.“Smith heaved and coughed for 13 minutes during the 30-minute-long execution,” The Associated Press reported. “He clenched his fists and raised his head during the early part of the procedure.” Another Alabama reporter present at the execution observed that Smith’s “left eye also appeared to be slightly open.”There’s a significant chance that Smith’s death sentence ― if not the method of execution itself ― was unconstitutional. Alabama is alone in the nation in allowing judges to condemn defendants to death even after juries have recommended life imprisonment instead. A jury, on a 7-5 vote, had recommended a life sentence for Smith.But the judge thought otherwise and gave him death.Justice Sotomayor, pointedly dissenting three years ago in a related dispute, listed Smith’s case on a chart of 95 “life-to-death” judicial overrides in Alabama. She suggested such overrides are “constitutionally suspect.”Why do Alabama judges show this “distinctive proclivity” for reaching harsher sentences than the jury recommends, Sotomayor asked. “The only answer that is supported by empirical evidence is one that, in my view, casts a cloud of illegitimacy over the criminal justice system: Alabama judges, who are elected in partisan proceedings, appear to have succumbed to electoral pressures,” she wrote.In January, the Supreme Court declared a similar judge-centric system in Florida unconstitutional. But Alabama is still holding out. In September, the state’s highest court found no conflict between that January decision and the state’s own practice of allowing judges to contradict jurors on the ultimate question.The Arthur case could change things for Alabama’s capital defendants.

It was eventually found last year at a street market by paleontologist Lida Xing of Beijing’s University of Geosciences. “I never expected we could find a dinosaur in amber. This may be the coolest find in my life,” Xing told NPR.“It’s a once in a lifetime find,” his research partner Ryan McKellar of Canada’s Royal Saskatchewan Museum told CNN. “The finest details are visible and in three dimensions.”They’re believed to be the first-ever non-avian dinosaur feathers found preserved in amber, which are providing a fascinating glimpse into the early evolution of feathers and flight.The feathers, brown on top with white undersides, cover eight vertebrae in the specimen dating to the mid-Cretaceous period. Because the bones are articulated, and not fused together as in modern birds, the creature was a dinosaur and not a prehistoric bird capable of flight, according to the scientists, who reported their findings in Current Biology.The weak structure of the crude, early feathers that lack the interlocking architecture of ones developed up the evolutionary ladder was also not conducive to flight, according to the researchers. The feathers are missing a strong central shaft, known known as a rachis.Instead of providing the capability of flight, the feathers, which likely covered the entire dinosaur, may have provided temperature regulation or some kind of signal, McKellar speculated to the National Geographic.Scientists believe the tail belonged to a juvenile coelurosaur, part of the family of theropod dinosaurs related to Tyrannosaurus rex as well as others that developed into modern birds. Researchers have nicknamed the specimen Eva. Intriguingly, tissue around the bones still held had traces of ferrous iron, the remains of hemoglobin from Eva’s blood. Eva was likely the size of a sparrow at death, but would have grown to the size of an ostrich had she lived.Eva adds a key new piece to the feather puzzle.“It’s a spectacular little glimpse,” McKellar told NPR. “It gives us, basically, a pathway that gets us to modern feathers.” "

Heroin deaths in particular rose 23 percent year over year to 12,989; synthetic opioid deaths rose 73 percent to 9,580.“I don’t think we’ve ever seen anything like this. Certainly not in modern times,” Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch of the CDC, told the Associated Press.The new figures are a tragic expression of the United States’ urgent addiction problem. As it stands, more than 20 million Americans have a substance use disorder and 12.5 million report misusing prescriptions painkillers, behaviors linked to the aggressive marketing and overprescription of opioids in the 1980s-90s. It doesn’t take long for prescription use to evolve into misuse. According to a new Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation survey, a third of Americans who took a prescription opioid for two months or longer became addicted to or physically dependent on painkillers. It’s a problem health officials know well. In November, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a 400-page report entitled “Facing Addiction in America,” urging everyday Americans to rethink their views on addiction. Murthy also called for doctors and policymakers to expand proven treatment programs, invest in substance use prevention and fund treatment research. “For far too long people have thought about addiction as a character flaw or a moral failing,” Murthy told HuffPost last month. “Addiction is a chronic disease of the brain and it’s one that we have to treat the way we would any other chronic illness: with skill, with compassion and with urgency.” The new numbers are grim, but policymakers seem to finally be paying attention to the crisis. Earlier this month Congress approved $1 billion in grant money to fight the opioid epidemic as part of the 21st Century Cures Act. The funds ― which will go toward prescription drug monitoring, expanding access to treatment and other addiction-related public health initiatives over two years ― will prioritize states hardest hit by opioids, Vox reports."

Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) worked together on a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58495eda1800002d00e4189d.jpeg?cache=hmZsTdJNa2&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) unveiled legislation on Friday to protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation under President-elect Donald Trump ― now the question is whether it will work.The bipartisan bill, called the Bridge Act, would effectively maintain the protections of President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. More than 740,000 young people were granted deportation reprieve and work permits under the program, but could now lose those protections, should Trump follow through on a promise to end DACA immediately upon taking office. The Durbin-Graham measure could serve two purposes: If it passes, so-called Dreamers could live without constant fear of deportation and continue to legally work and drive. If it doesn’t, it could still put pressure on Trump to keep away from DACA recipients. He and other Democrats, joined by only a few Republicans, are scrambling to find ways to protect the Dreamers they’ve urged to come forward to the government. Durbin has been one of the top advocates for Dreamers. He introduced the Dream Act that gave them their name in 2001 and he pushed for Obama to create DACA when that legislation failed.“I feel, as President Obama feels, a personal responsibility to help these young people weather this political storm,” Durbin told a small group of reporters. The Dream Act would have granted Dreamers a path to legal status, as would the 2013 immigration reform bill that Durbin and Graham helped draft. The new bill would put DACA recipients into a new type of status, “provisional protected presence,” that would last for three years from enactment. It would not be constrained to only those who currently have DACA: eligible individuals who have not yet applied could be granted provisional protected presence as well. All would have to pay a fee, undergo a background check and meet the eligibility requirements for DACA. The bill would also ensure that information individuals gave the government for DACA or for the new provisional protected presence could not be used for immigration enforcement, with exceptions for national security or non-immigration felony investigations. The politics could be tough, but Durbin said he is hopeful. Thus far, the Bridge Act has three other co-sponsors: Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). Durbin said there is a long list of Democrats who want to join, but they are aiming to add people in pairs ― one Republican and one Democrat. They will reintroduce the bill in 2017. Durbin said he thinks other Republicans might sign on. Even though they don’t say it publicly, Durbin said, “most of them feel it’s only fair to take care of these young people.” Graham explained his decision to push for the bill in a series of tweets Friday afternoon. Durbin told reporters that Trump’s recent comments on DACA recipients were, at least in tone, relatively sympathetic to them. Like Trump’s previous efforts at softening on immigration, this should probably be taken with many grains of salt. A Trump aide later told the Associated Press that the president-elect still plans to end DACA. “We’re going to work something out that’s going to make people happy and proud. But that’s a very tough situation,” Trump told Time Magazine. “They got brought here at a very young age, they’ve worked here, they’ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they’re in never-never land because they don’t know what’s going to happen.”Durbin acknowledged that Trump often contradicts himself, but said he was encouraged anyway. “I’m going to seize on every encouraging word,” he said. Durbin also noted that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) had expressed sympathy for DACA recipients. Ryan said on Thursday that they “should have something that balances the concerns of all parties involved and makes sure that we don’t pull the rug out from under people.” Some Democrats have argued that Obama should do something more to protect DACA recipients before he leaves office. The White House has said that isn’t an option, especially House Democrats’ pleas for him to issue pardons for DACA recipients. Those Democrats say this would be legal and that he can do so for civil offenses even in a way that would preemptively pardon future unlawful presence in the U.S.; White House officials and Durbin have said that is not the case.On Thursday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest once again shot down the idea of pardons for DACA recipients. He said Obama and his team were briefing Trump and his team on why they decided to create the program and its benefits.  “We’re also continuing to encourage Congress to take action,” Earnest said in a press briefing. “Ultimately, the kind of executive action that President Obama has pursued was largely pursued because of congressional inaction.”Since the Bridge Act would only last for three years from enactment and because it doesn’t include everyone, it would be crucial to continue to press for broader immigration reform, Durbin told reporters. Democrats and Republicans have been opposed to piecemeal immigration reform efforts in the past, and Durbin said he had heard concerns about pushing for a bill that would leave out so many other undocumented immigrants. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), for example, spoke on the Senate floor on Thursday about the need to protect DACA recipients’ parents, neighbors and others as well. Durbin said he and Menendez had talked about the matter repeatedly. Menendez’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether he supports the bill.“We still have an important job in comprehensive immigration reform,” Durbin told reporters, “but it would be disastrous and just wrong to say that we are going to ignore what’s going to happen to the lives of these DACA individuals.”This story has been updated to reflect that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) signed on as a fifth co-sponsor and to include tweets from Sen. Lindsey Graham. "

The state is close to outlawing bestiality thanks in part to a national campaign by animal rights advocates.Believe it or not, there are nine states in the U.S. where no laws exist banning sex with animals. But the Ohio Legislature has now passed a law prohibiting sex abuse of animals and the selling of animals for sex.The measure is awaiting the signature of Ohio Gov. John Kasich. He has 10 days to sign or veto it.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Kasich’s former Republican presidential primary rival, signed a bill banning bestiality in his state last year.Leighann Lassiter, an official with the Humane Society of the United States, hailed the measure as a “great victory for the animals of Ohio.”Lassiter said the measure would protect animals as well as crack down on animal “sex rings.” Some people train animals to have sex, Lassiter noted. “It is a very, very seedy world,” she told the Guardian.Last-minute GOP maneuverings almost torpedoed the Ohio bill. Republican lawmakers tacked on rules about communities’ ability to stop telecom companies from putting up wireless antennas and a ban on cities raising the minimum wage, reported the Dayton Daily News. That led to 40 legislators, mostly Democrats, voting against the package including the ban on sex with animals. But it still passed.In June, Warren became the first town in Ohio to outlaw bestiality after a man was sentenced to 90 days in jail and ordered not to have any contact with animals for five years after an incident with two dogs. One politician who backed the measure insisted, however, that it was not an “epidemic in our city,” the Youngstown Vindicator reported.Other than in Ohio, bestiality is still currently legal in Vermont, Texas, West Virginia, Kentucky, Nevada, Hawaii, Wyoming, New Mexico — and in Washington, D.C. The states have animal cruelty laws, but they’re usually inadequate for animal sex abuse, according to the Humane Society.New Hampshire outlawed sex assault on animals in June. Some farm industry representatives were worried that farmers could conceivably face prosecution for normal animal husbandry practices, reported the Concord Monitor. "

It will now be up to the Michigan Supreme Court’s five remaining justices to decide whether to hear Stein’s appeal.Stein is seeking to challenge a Michigan Court of Appeals opinion on Tuesday evening claiming she had no standing to demand a recount, since as a fourth-place finisher, she was not an “aggrieved party.” A federal judge effectively upheld that ruling on Wednesday night, halting the recount effort, which had begun on Monday.Young and Larsen’s formal statements acceding to Stein’s demand represent their first public comments about being considered by Trump for the highest court in the country.Young dedicated most of his statement to disparaging the basis for Stein’s request, since at age 65, he argued, the possibility that Trump would nominate him is “extraordinarily remote.” Nonetheless, acknowledging the “national attention” the case has drawn, Young wrote that he would agree to the request “so my colleagues in this case will not be legitimately challenged by base speculation and groundless innuendo by the partisans in this controversy and beyond.”He engaged in more than a little sardonic humor in his statement and hinted that he considered the recount effort illegitimate, faulting federal Judge Mark Goldsmith for allowing it to proceed in the first place. In a footnote explaining why he was taking extreme care to show “judicial restraint,” Young took to task his “law school classmate” Goldsmith for “[taking] it upon himself judicially to alter the recount process our Legislature has unambiguously created.”Larsen, who is 48, addressed the issue more matter-of-factly.“My appearance on the president-elect’s list and his presence as a party in these cases creates a conflict requiring my disqualification,” she wrote.Trump’s repeated campaign promises to appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court were a key part of his attempt to allay right-wing concerns about his candidacy.As a presidential candidate in May, Trump released a list of people he would consider nominating to the Supreme Court that included Larsen. In September, he put out an expanded roster of potential nominees that included Young."

The history of perpetual partnerships and marriage among Cherokees supports the conclusion that Cherokee citizens have a fundamental right not only to choose a spouse but also, with mutual consent, to join together and form a household irrespective of sexual orientation.The decision followed a request made by the tribe’s tax commissioner for an official opinion on the issue a few weeks ago.“We were increasingly being contacted by departments in the Cherokee Nation on how to handle certain issues with same-sex marriage,” Chrissi Nimmo, assistant attorney general of the Cherokee Nation, told The Huffington Post on Friday.Native American nations are governed by Congress, not the federal courts. So the 2015 Supreme Court decision to recognize gay marriage in all 50 states did not legally affect the Cherokee Nation, but Nimmo said the bulk of Friday’s decision was indeed informed by it.Hembree’s decision was also influenced by historical Cherokee Nation sexuality narratives. He wrote in Friday’s decision:Our oral history teaches us also that the Cherokee and Euro-American worldviews differed dramatically regarding appropriate gender roles, marriage, sexuality, and spiritual beliefs. Indeed, while the majority of Cherokees subscribed to the traditional gender roles, evidence suggests a tradition of homosexuality or alternative sexuality among a minority of Cherokees.“It think it’s a really interesting part of the decision,” Nimmo told HuffPost. “Through historical research, we were able to identify research sources that indicate there was some type of historical recognition of homosexuality.”Hembree’s opinion nullifies a law the tribe passed 12 years ago called the Cherokee Nation and Family Protection Act, which banned same-sex marriage among tribe members. Though same-sex marriage is still illegal in some Native American tribes, like the Navajo Nation, Nimmo believes most tribes don’t take a stance on it either way. “I think you will see a mixed reaction [to Friday’s decision] like you do in the American public at large,” Nimmo told HuffPost. “Without a doubt, there will be tribal members and officials who support this and are proud of this, and there will be others ... who don’t like it.”The Cherokee Nation’s legal recognition of same-sex marriage will take effect immediately. Nimmo said Hembree’s decision is “binding and considered legally valid,” though it can be challenged by other Cherokee officials at any time.“I don’t really know who would challenge it,” Nimmo added.Supporters of the decision shared their excitement on social media:"

He was the second military officer of his rank to be shot dead in as many weeks.Hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed in an Islamist insurgency led by Islamic State in the Sinai Peninsula.Attacks have stepped up since the military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt’s oldest Islamist movement, in 2013 following mass protests against him.Judges, policemen and senior officials have been targeted by radical Islamists angered by long prison sentences imposed on members of the now-outlawed Brotherhood."

It’s a sexy news angle considering that Gov. Pat McCrory (R) has spent the past month trying desperate measures — including calling for a statewide recount and alleging voter fraud — to hold on to the state’s highest office following a brutal loss on Election Day. But North Carolina Republican lawmakers deny that they plan to expand the state’s Supreme Court. And the whole idea seems to have spread not because of any reporting about Republicans’ actual plans, but because of a television green-room conversation between three journalists last month.Expanding North Carolina’s state Supreme Court has not been brought up for consideration at all, the state House deputy majority leader and state Senate deputy president pro tempore told The Huffington Post. North Carolina state Rep. Chuck McGrady said he hopes the assembly doesn’t take up legislation that would expand the number of seats on the court. And state Rep. Jay Adams said in an email that the rumor “did not originate in the NC Republican Party or in the mind of any Republican” he knows and that “it is another issue made from thin air by the Left.” Not too many people know how the rumor that Republicans would pack the court spread so widely — but Mitch Kokai, a reporter for the right-leaning Carolina Journal, has an idea.On Nov. 10, Kokai was at a local TV station in North Carolina, waiting to record a program, when he struck up a conversation with two other reporters. As the trio chatted, both reporters mentioned the rumor that state Republicans were thinking about adding justices to the state’s Supreme Court. The maneuver would be a blatant attempt to override the election of Judge Mike Morgan, whose addition to the court flipped its political lean from 4-3 with a Republican advantage to 4-3 with a Democratic advantage. Kokai didn’t think too much of it until he got an email from a third reporter at one of the state’s largest newspapers, who wasn’t involved in the original conversation, with the subject line: “Would it take a conditional amendment and referendum to pad the NC supreme court from 7 to 9-10?” The reporter said in the body of the email: “Sounds like that is being considered as possibility for any Hurricane Matthew special session to take away left-leaning 4-3 advantage on the court.” “That was my first exposure to this rumor — two reporters talking about it Thursday morning and then another reporter sending me an email asking me if I knew whether it would take a constitutional amendment to do this,” Kokai told The Huffington Post. “I had no idea, but I did have a North Carolina constitution sitting right behind me.” When he saw that the court could be expanded by two justices, Kokai wrote a blog post on the topic that became somewhat of a viral sensation. The New Republic called the posting “a plan” for Republicans to pack the court since the Carolina Journal is owned by conservative think tank the John Locke Foundation. The John Locke Foundation receives most of its funding from Art Pope, a former state representative and businessman who’s been heavily criticized for using money to influence political elections in the state. Kokai thinks the expansion is unlikely and that the benefits of doing it “would be far outweighed by the negative political costs.” “That was probably a discussion before someone said it would be a bad idea and then shelved it,” he said. Democrats are still on their guard. There’s good reason to believe Republicans will attempt to tip the court in their favor on Dec. 13, insists North Carolina state Sen. Terry Van Duyn (D). “There have been multiple things they have done to demonstrate their willingness to influence who is seated on our Supreme Court,” she said. In February 2013, a month after McCrory took office, Republican leaders blitzed Democrats and proposed Senate Bill 10, which would have allowed the governor to fire sitting members on several key oversight and advisory boards. A second provision in the bill would have expanded the state Supreme Court by two justices, but was dropped after it lost steam with Republicans in the state House. Two years later, the Republican-dominated legislature passed a bill that would allow Supreme Court justices to appear on the ballot unopposed in retention elections where voters simply marked “yes” to keep a justice or “no” to remove them. The next three judges up for re-election were Republican and the maneuver “would have assured a Republican majority for the foreseeable future,” Van Duyn said. The bill was struck down by the state Supreme Court this year. There’s another reason Dems fear that Republicans will expand the court: They’ve expanded another court themselves. In 2000, two of the five seats in the North Carolina Court of Appeals up for grabs were won by Republicans. That December, Democrats expanded the court from 12 to 15 members, allowing then-Gov. James Hunt (D) to appoint the new members. Pope, then a member of the North Carolina House, promptly sued state Democrats. But the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the General Assembly was allowed to expand the court.“It’s not exactly the same thing as the state Supreme Court but it’s same principle and the same idea of the General Assembly wanting to add people of their own party to the courts,” Kokai said. Van Duyn hopes the Republicans keep their word not to pack the court on Dec. 13, but her skepticism remains. “What I have seen in my brief tenure is that should they change their minds between now and Monday,” she says. “We won’t know about it until we are debating that legislation in committee.”Related Coverage"

President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Pruitt to serve as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58499d7d1800002c00e4199c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Two of the Senate’s fiercest environmental advocates are advising their fellow Democrats to use Scott Pruitt, Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, as a rallying point for the party.Democrats are aware that they will have to choose their battles once the president-elect takes office if they want a viable chance at reclaiming the Senate or the White House in 2020.But they argue that Pruitt, the fossil fuel-friendly Oklahoma attorney general, is just the type of nominee Senate Democrats can take a strong stand against. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said Thursday he is not only opposed to Pruitt because he is a climate change denier. He says Pruitt’s impending nomination is “a matter of corruption” because he has spent “his entire life in service” dedicated to the oil and gas industry, working against everything the EPA stands to protect. “We need rally points in our cause and this appointment ought to be a rally point,” Whitehouse said on a call with reporters hosted by the nonprofit League of Conservation Voters. “First for our [green] groups and for young people, who feel that climate change is a vitally important issue. And it should be a rally point for some for our corporations who talk a very good game on climate ― but none of whom take serious action [with] Congress.”Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) called Trump’s decision to pick Pruitt “a full-fledged environmental emergency.”“This is going to be litmus test for every member of the Senate who claims not to be a denier,” he said, adding that a number of Republicans have said they agree with Democrats that the question of whether climate change is real has been settled by scientists.“It’s one thing to occasionally flirt with the truth,” Schatz argued, but Republicans who support tackling greenhouse gas emissions must now decide if they “are going to stand with science, stand with clean air and clean water, or stand with Mr. Pruitt, who has made a profession out of undermining the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.”Under Pruitt, Oklahoma is part of a coalition of states currently suing the EPA over the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, which requires the nation’s coal-fired power plants to cut carbon dioxide emissions 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. According to a 2014 New York Times report, Pruitt and Devon Energy ― one of Oklahoma’s largest oil and gas companies ― engaged in an “unprecedented, secretive alliance.”Pruitt would be the “worst-ever administrator” of the EPA if he’s confirmed by the Senate, said League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski.During the call, a Fox News reporter asked why Karpinski, Whitehouse and Schatz insisted on calling Pruitt a climate change “denier” when there are a number of scientists who say the science behind climate change isn’t settled. Karpinski referenced the oft-cited fact that 97 percent of the scientific community agrees that the earth is warming due to human activity. The Fox News reporter then asked Karpinski for the source of the figure ― something a quick Google search or visit to NASA’s webpage will produce.Karpinski said he would be happy to talk to the reporter once Fox stopped pushing fake news and accepted scientific fact. “Putting aside that crap ... ” the reporter began to say. But Karpinksi interrupted. “Excuse me, how did you describe science?” "
61,QUEER VOICES,A Veteran LGBTQ Activist On Resistance And Key Lessons Of Political Backlash,James Michael Nichols,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelangelo-signorile-political-backlash_us_58477ed6e4b0b9feb0da3821,Remember Reagan?,2016-12-08,HuffPost Queer Voices' Editor-at-Large Michelangelo Signorile,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584781771700002500e7e2f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you’re a millennial, as I am, you likely haven’t personally experienced full-blown political backlash against LGBTQ rights in your lifetime. But the reality is that anti-LGBTQ backlash is something that the queer community should prepare for and anticipate in President-elect Donald Trump’s administration.I recently sat down with Michelangelo Signorile for a candid conversation in an effort to understand and shine a light on queer experiences under other presidential administrations. During our discussion, the veteran activist, who has been involved in the community for over three decades and is HuffPost Queer Voices’ Editor-at-Large, chatted about his history fighting against institutions of power — including the religious right — the danger of minority tokenization and the lessons he thinks young queer people should take away from the experiences of those who have been through similar periods of retaliation against queer people in the past.Signorile became a prominent member of AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in the late ‘80s, a grassroots advocacy organization formed in 1987 in response to President Reagan’s refusal to adequately address the devastating AIDS crisis. ACT UP was ― and still is ― committed to effective, tangible political action, and has a history of engaging in creative, high-profile demonstrations, such as staging a “die-in” at President Bush’s vacation home in 1991 and disrupting the CBS evening broadcast to shout “Fight AIDS, not Arabs!” during the Gulf War.Signorile believes that comparisons of the Reagan years and Trump’s rise are apt for a number of reasons, but perhaps most strikingly for the overwhelming support both men have received from the religious right, which gained relevance as a political force during Reagan’s campaign and remains a massive political force today. “They voted for Trump in ways that are comparable to or even surpassing any Republican presidential candidate before,” Signorile noted.Much like Trump, Reagan made promises to the religious right while campaigning for president ― promises that ended up negatively affecting the most vulnerable Americans, particularly the LGBTQ community.Signorile foresees this same pattern playing out under Trump, with the president-elect rewarding the religious right’s loyalty by selecting people who advocate for issues and policies important to their worldview to join his administration.“Reagan stacked religious and conservative leaders through the agencies of the federal government,” Signorile explained. “Whether it was the National Institute of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Housing, the Department of Labor, the Department of Education ― which are all issues that would affect queer people – they all operated through the prism of these religious conservatives.”With Trump in office, we may not see political leaders actively speaking out against queer rights or trying to sway public opinion against the queer community. Instead, people granted positions of power, Signorile thinks, will be given control of valuable and life-saving programs for LGBTQ people and other minority groups through governmental agencies, granting them the potential ability to roll-back or dismantle programs that benefit the most vulnerable Americans.We can already see the foundation of this nightmare in Trump’s picks thus far. The notoriously anti-LGBTQ Ben Carson is slated to head Housing and Urban Development; Secretary of Education pick, Betsy DeVos, has a history of anti-gay activism, while Attorney General pick Sen. Jeff Sessions voted to advance a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. And with Trump and Mike Pence, his dangerous, anti-LGBTQ vice president, leading the country, the list of appointees who oppose queer rights continues to grow. Signorile emphasized that the community must not only actively scrutinize these appointments, but also be critical of the tokenization of queer people ― gay men in particular ― as a smokescreen for severe anti-LGBTQ platforms.Peter Thiel, who’s been named to Trump’s transition team, can be seen as an example of this tokenism, Signorile told me. The tech billionaire is perhaps best known in recent months for backing the lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker after he alleged that the company outed him.“Using Peter Thiel was window dressing to say look, I brought a gay man on, first one I ever brought on. So is Donald Trump using the term LGBTQ,” Signorile said. “There was a time when maybe the Republicans didn’t say ‘black people’ or didn’t say African Americans. So this is suddenly seen as ‘oh my god’ but it’s nothing – it’s tokenism... what I’ve seen is Thiel believes that there should be very limited government. And where we’ve gone and where we need to go in this movement is federal protections and federal government doing the kind of work that helps people. And that’s what helped the Obama administration grow in all of the departments, and then Obama’s executive orders as well.” Reflecting on all of this is crucial to understanding the threats to queer rights going forward. There are also a number of important take-aways that can be gained from understanding the rich histories of queer organizing, protesting and resistance, all of which offer a valuable array of practices that can be implemented today.For Signorile, there are four core messages from his years as a veteran activist that he’d like young queer people to consider and adopt.1. Don’t WaitThe queer community waited too long to organize and act in the 1980s. Unfortunately, inaction only gave the Reagan administration and the religious right more power, Signorile said, and created space for exacerbated stigma against the LGBTQ community.“Thankfully Larry Kramer fired people up and ACT UP formed,” Signorile reflected. “But it came very late and we should’ve started earlier. Don’t wait until they do things. Don’t listen to any of this ‘let him have a chance.’ I think people need to organize now... and I think the opportunity to do this now is so much greater and easier thankfully because of social media ― because we were doing it with wheat-pasting on the street [in the ‘80s]! We were handing out flyers.”2. The Importance Of IntersectionalityAs we saw with the wide-spread protests that took place in the wake of Trump’s election, this is an intersectional struggle, and intersectional resistance must follow suit. If you are a minority ― or someone who embodies a multiplicity of marginalized identities ― in this country, your rights and equality may soon be at risk. It’s important that we remember this as we engage in resistance against what is increasingly becoming a white nationalist hate movement.“It has it be Latino queer people, it has to be African-American queer people, it has to be many other groups at the forefront who are going to be dealing with other oppressions from this administration,” Signorile elaborated. “Because I think ― especially among progressives ― we really have made just enormous strides. I mean, progressives and Democrats support queer equality! There isn’t going to be that sort of resistance that even we felt – we felt isolated, you know? Because we had to rebel against our own party! We were hated at that time. I think it’s different now. I think across millennials, it’s got to be across all of these groups. And there’s no reason why it can’t be because everyone does support each other’s agenda.”3. Protest CreativelyPrevious queer activists were creative in their protests in order to expand their reach and impact. Signorile believes we should follow in the steps of ACT UP’s highly visible forms of protest and consider the ways in which past demonstrations ― like protesting naked outside of Penn Station the night before the Republican National Convention in 2004 ― are still talked about today.“The size of the protests and the types of protests are not as important as the creativity of the protest and the captivating nature of the protest,” Signorile said. “The whole idea of a protest is to hijack the media and change the discussion and get voices heard. And that can be done with a small number of people or large – large numbers of course always get attention. If thousands and thousands of people are on the doorstop of someone that gets attention. ACT UP often worked in large numbers, you know, invading the New York Stock exchange with many protestors outside. But at that same time, one solo activist literally got into the CBS evening news and got on camera!”4. Remain Intergenerational In Our ResistanceIt’s also critically important that we include the voices and perspectives of older leaders and activists who have fought anti-LGBTQ political backlash before in order to understand and engage the most effective forms of resistance. The LGBTQ community, after all, has a massive problem when it comes to intergenerational division and ageism.“We need to include all of the older people,” Signorile explained. “ACT UP was people in their 60s and 70s and it was people who were 20.

Broome County District Attorney Steve Cornwell described an “obstacle course” inside the house that firefighters had to get through.“There were gas cans, full gas cans and other containers full with flammable material, placed throughout the home as if it were an obstacle course to get around,” he said at a press conference Tuesday.Authorities say they found a “Blue Lives Matter” flag outside the home and a spray-painted message on a wall reading: “Lie with pigs, fry like bacon.”Cornwell called the message, which he refused to repeat, a “despicable display of how law enforcement should be viewed in society today.” He suggested that the message was meant to throw off investigators into believing anti-police protesters were to blame. He declined to speculate on a possible motive.At the time of the incident, the family suggested that the fire was a targeted attack against them, WBNG reported.Stokes was released Wednesday on $10,000 bail. An attempt to reach him for comment Thursday was not immediately successful. The Press & Sun-Bulletin of Binghamton reported that Stokes has worked as a firefighter with the Endicott Fire Department since March 2005. He has been placed on administrative leave following the charges.A trial date is set for April 17."

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) to be the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee.“Representative Ellison meets the high standard working people expect from leaders of our political parties,” AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a written statement. “He is a proven leader, who will focus on year-round grassroots organizing to deliver for working families across America.”The AFL-CIO represents 56 different labor unions. The New York Times reported last week that a few labor unions had pushed back against the federation offering an early endorsement in the DNC Chair race, but several large unions, including Communication Workers of America and United Steelworkers, had already announced their support for Ellison, as had key labor figures like the chiefs of the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The official nod from the AFL-CIO, moreover, suggests that a recent smear campaign attempting to brand Ellison as anti-Semitic is not scaring off major Democratic-allied institutions. Ellison would be the first Muslim to head the party.Ellison has long been one of the most aggressive congressional supporters of the American labor movement. He has repeatedly rallied with striking workers, and participated last month in a demonstration by Minneapolis fast food employees seeking a $15 minimum wage. His DNC policy platform calls for Democratic leaders to embrace “labor as a full partner,” which would represent a shift from recent decades in which union concerns have been subjugated to Wall Street and Silicon Valley interests within the party.Ellison backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during the Democratic presidential primary, and his candidacy has quickly converted the DNC race into a proxy battle over the direction of the party after Hillary Clinton’s loss to president-elect Donald Trump. Ellison is pressing to refocus party attention on working people by emphasizing small-dollar fundraising, much as the Sanders campaign did. Most recent DNC chairs, including Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), have focused on major corporate donors.The AFL-CIO endorsement consolidates Ellison’s status as front-runner in the DNC race. More than 100 lawmakers have already backed his candidacy, including Sanders and progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), along with establishment leaders like Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). But the DNC election remains more than two months away, and other candidates have also secured prominent supporters. South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison, a former corporate lobbyist, has been endorsed by the third-ranking House Democrat, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.). President Barack Obama has signaled support for either Labor Secretary Thomas Perez or former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who both endorsed Clinton in the Democratic primary. New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley won the endorsement of his state’s all-woman Democratic congressional delegation on Thursday."

He leaves behind a 10-year-old daughter.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5849bde21800002c00e41a41.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A teenager sent to a troubled-teen center in Utah is in custody after an alleged escape attempt that left one staff member dead and another seriously injured. The 17-year-old, who is not being named because he is a juvenile, was at Turn-About Ranch for less than a week before allegedly killing James “Jimmy” Woolsey, 61, on Tuesday, the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. Turn-About Ranch is a private youth rehabilitation center in Escalante, Utah, that aims to treat 13- to 17-year-olds considered to have behavioral problems, according to its website.Students spend their days working on a cattle ranch in an effort to teach them “concepts like leadership, teamwork, accountability and responsibility,” the site says.Early Tuesday morning, the suspect and another teen built a campfire, made breakfast and began to work on chores, the Deseret News reported. At approximately 7:30 a.m., Woolsey ― who had worked at the facility for five years ― came to check on them. That’s when the suspect struck Woolsey on the back of the head with an unknown weapon, police say, and continued to hit him while he was on the ground.Garfield County Sheriff James Perkins said he did not believe the attack was “personal,” but that the teen was desperate to escape.“It’s just that Jimmy was there,” Perkins told the Deseret News. “I don’t know why he did that. It was nothing personal. It’s just these are troubled kids.”The teen, who had been at the facility for four or five days, had told others of his plan to escape, authorities said.“I don’t really think there was any conversations about murdering somebody, just that he was going to leave,” Perkins said.After allegedly bludgeoning Woolsey, the teen allegedly attacked 35-year-old Alicia Keller, a staff member who had come to investigate after hearing screams. Authorities say the boy smashed Keller’s hand with the unknown weapon and hit her over the head, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Keller was able to stop the attack by throwing her car keys on the sidewalk, allowing the teen to take her vehicle. The boy then allegedly led police on a high-speed car chase that ended in his arrest after deputies managed to stop his vehicle by smashing into its side. Woolsey died en route to the hospital of blunt force trauma to the head. Keller was also transported to the hospital and is in stable condition.“It was a brutal, vicious, violent, very violent attack,” Perkins told the Deseret News. The facility is part of an almost entirely unregulated industry rife with allegations of abuse. A 2008 Government Accountability Office report found, for instance, that at least 1,500 children in 30 states had alleged they were abused at private treatment facilities in 2005 alone. A 2012 lawsuit levied against Turn-About alleged that workers in 2005 routinely abused a young girl, threatening her with physical violence, subjecting her to sleep deprivation and denying her food. The ranch “forced her regularly to put her hands in a sink filled with bleach to wash dishes until they bled, leaving to this day scars on her knuckles,” the lawsuit claimed. The suit was eventually dismissed because it had passed the statute of limitations. In 2004, a female student was allegedly sexually assaulted by a staff member at Turn-About, a former staff member told state regulators and the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office. The girl was also allegedly duct-taped and restrained by staff, Salon reported.Woolsey, however, was well-liked among the children at the ranch, Perkins said. Even the accused killer had mentioned at one point that he liked the man.“He had spoke very highly of this guy,” Perkins told the Deseret News. “He was just simply unhappy to be there and he wanted to leave. Why he [did] what he did, I don’t know.”Turn-About released a statement Wednesday extending condolences to Woolsey’s family, including his 10-year-old daughter.“Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and with everyone involved in this tragic incident,” the statement said. “His caring personality and loyal dedication to helping the youth in our program will be greatly missed. His good nature and commitment to our students had a positive impact on those who attended and worked at Turn-About Ranch.”Friends of Woolsey have set up a GoFundMe page to help cover his funeral expenses.

The election of Donald Trump ― who has called climate change a “hoax,” though he has also spewed a bunch of occasionally sympathetic non sequiturs about it ― was clearly a sign of better days for those who disagree with the vast majority of scientists about human influence on the climate.Individual sessions at the all-day event included “Is CO2 Really a Pollutant?” and “A Conversation on Climate Intimidation.” They featured the small group of very vocal scientists who dispute the overwhelming evidence that human activity is causing the planet to warm.The keynote speaker just before lunch was Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), the upper chamber’s most vocal climate change denier and the guy who brought a snowball to the Senate floor last year to prove his point.In her introduction of the senator, the Heritage Foundation’s Becky Norton Dunlop praised Inhofe as “one of the great champions for truth in our country today.” Inhofe started off with a pitch about a drawing later in the day for a copy of his book, The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future.Inhofe was particularly happy about Trump’s selection of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency. It’s a dream to have his fellow Oklahoman fill that role, Inhofe said, and the audience’s applause suggested they felt the same.“You will love this guy,” he said.Inhofe praised the “army of 200” assembled in the room: “You are voices out there in the wilderness, out there with me.” He also praised the scientists there, who included Willie Soon, who has worked at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and Patrick Michaels of the Cato Institute ― both of whom, incidentally, have received fossil fuel funding to support their efforts to undermine climate science.“All of my heroes are on the program,” said Inhofe. He said he felt the climate change deniers “are winning this thing very clearly.”Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), another congressional climate change denier, told the crowd that he, too, is “so encouraged by the nomination” of Pruitt.“This is a man who understands federalism and separation of powers and has been a warrior, a champion to help restore those things,” said Lee. Pruitt “has spent years being ignored and being pushed around by Washington. So he knows the kind of dangerous bureaucratic mindset he’s up against.”The afternoon offered presentations from several of Inhofe’s “heroes.” “I like to call this the CO2 Anti-Defamation League,” said Dr. William Happer, a physicist at Princeton University who said he spoke to counter the “myth that CO2 is a dangerous pollutant.”“It’s undergone decade after decade of abuse for no reason,” Happer said.The event also featured Craig Idso, a geographer who argued that the science on climate change is “tenuous at best.”But Inhofe cautioned against overconfidence, warning that people who agree with him “have to be careful.”“I don’t want people to think this is over,” he said. “It’s never over.”"
68,MEDIA,Trump Won't Have One Of His Favorite Reporters In The White House. But She Will Be On CNN.,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/monica-langley-cnn-trump_us_5845c73de4b028b32338ab23,"The Wall Street Journal’s Monica Langley will continue covering ""billionaires and CEOs,"" though she enjoys nearly unmatched access to the new administration.",2016-12-08,Monica Langley got more access to Donald Trump and his team than most journalists. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5849c0e31800002d00e41a50.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― While most reporters camp out in the Trump Tower lobby and pepper visitors with questions, The Wall Street Journal’s Monica Langley heads straight upstairs. Trump spoke to Langley from his “speeding SUV” during the “last hours of his presidential campaign,” and again four days later for his first post-election interview, conducted in his office on the tower’s 26th floor. Langley returned to Trump Tower on Nov. 28 and relayed insights gleaned from her discussions with the transition team that night on CNN. CNN host Anderson Cooper introduced Langley on Monday night as the network’s newest political analyst and someone who has spent “a lot of time at Trump Tower.” She then proceeded to run through some likely scenarios for Trump’s family in the coming months. An internal CNN announcement sent two days later noted Langley “will continue to cover Trump as he moves into the White House.”Langley is not in the same mold of past CNN contributors, who worked directly for Trump (Corey Lewandowski) or were brought on board because they were boosters for his campaign (Jeffrey Lord). But the access she has to the president-elect may be just as deep. Some of her peers seem jealous of her relationship with Trump, but more show derision for the light touch they claim she gives him.Langley interviewed Trump more than a half-dozen times during the campaign, and her history with him sparked speculation inside and outside the Journal that she could be in line for a job as press secretary ― the public face of the White House, sparring with reporters daily in the briefing room. But Langley has no plans to join the incoming White House team, a Journal spokesman told The Huffington Post. The spokesman said Langley’s “job has been, and will remain, to cover billionaires and CEOs,” while “the Journal’s White House reporters will cover the Trump Administration on a daily basis.”Though Langley won’t be reporting daily on Trump, her direct line to the soon-to-be-president should ensure future scoops for the paper. Her ascension to a contributor role at CNN may further elevate her importance to the famously cable-news-obsessed president-elect. Langley has never been a full-time political reporter for the Journal, but holds the title of senior special writer. Her speciality, according to her Twitter bio, is “page-one profiles of CEOs, billionaires, presidential candidates and key news figures.” Over the years, Langley has gained a reputation for writing largely flattering profiles of major executives that feature behind-the-scenes color and anecdotes portraying them as decisive leaders during difficult times. Trump, a high-flying CEO-turned-politician embroiled in controversy, was no exception. The candidate in Langley’s articles over the past 15 months bears little resemblance to the dishonest demagogue and misogynist Trump has been depicted elsewhere in the media. At the end of her pen, Trump comes across as a hands-on executive and political outsider guided by instinct ― a not wholly inaccurate portrayal, but one that brushes aside criticism that Trump is unqualified and temperamentally unfit for the presidency. Langley conducted a series of interviews with Trump early in the presidential race in his Trump Tower office and on his private jet, with the pair appearing in a photo she tweeted along with one of her articles. Trump has turned to Langley several times during moments of crisis. He gave her the first interview following the October publication of a 2005 “Access Hollywood” outtake in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women. “I never, ever give up,” Trump told Langley amid calls to quit the race. Days later, Langley described Trump as being “upbeat” and “re-energized” as the controversy played out, according to advisers, resolving “to fight harder against his opponents” inside and outside the Republican Party. Trump told Langley during another moment of campaign tumult that he’d “do whatever it takes and do it the way I think will win.”And when Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto disputed Trump’s claim the two men didn’t discuss costs for Trump’s proposed border wall, the Republican candidate gave his version of events to Langley that night.She also wrote favorably about others in Trump’s orbit, including Lewandowski, who boasted in a February article about his then-boss working 20-hour days. Later in the article, Trump returned the compliment (and added another), telling Langely that Lewandowski “has tremendous energy, a wonderful vision for politics and the greatest candidate ever.”Members of Trump’s family also have provided Langley with access and praise. “Monica, we love you,” Eric Trump said to Langley during the Republican National Convention, a day after he and brother Don Jr. spoke to her for a story on how the Trump children would be taking center stage that week. The soft treatment and close relationships have caused some discomfort within the Journal’s ranks, as reporters worry their coverage of the next president has been colored by the splashy, largely friendly takes from his preferred reporter. Langley continues to enjoy access since the election, while others digging into topics uncomfortable for Trump may not get their calls returned. On Thursday, the Journal published an investigation into Trump’s opaque business operation and the difficulty of assessing the extent of his many conflicts of interest around the world. The article noted that “aides to Mr. Trump didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.”"
69,POLITICS,Trump Is Doing Exactly What He Promised To Do About Conflicts Of Interest: Almost Nothing,Ben Walsh and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-conflicts-of-interest_us_5849a199e4b04002fa804550,Eleven months ago he said his kids would run his business.,2016-12-08,Donald Trump doesn't plan to sell his stake in his company.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5849a2c71c00002d000ea87d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President-elect Donald Trump is doing exactly what he always said he was going to do with his company, the Trump Organization. But he’s spinning it as a new decision — and the press is buying it.The New York Times, citing unnamed sources, reported Wednesday evening that Trump won’t sell his stake in his company. His adult sons will run the business, but he won’t transfer ownership to them. And he certainly won’t be doing anything remotely resembling divesting or installing an independent administrator to run the Trump Organization.It’s a plan that does almost nothing to address the massive conflicts of interest inherent in owning a real estate and branding business while serving as president of the United States.It’s also the same thing he’s been promising to do for months.You don’t need to rely on unnamed sources to know that Trump plans to have his adult children run his business while he’s in the Oval Office. He said so on live TV during a Republican primary debate in January. He said so in September. His son Donald Jr. has said the same thing. On Nov. 10, two days after Trump won the election, his attorney said the president-elect’s children were already running the business with, he claimed, no involvement from their father. (Heightening the conflicts of interest is the fact that his three oldest children are also on his transition team’s executive committee.)The only notable difference reported in the New York Times story is that Trump’s daughter Ivanka will also step aside from the business. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, are reportedly moving to Washington, D.C., to work in some as-yet-to-be-determined roles in her father’s administration. (Kushner’s potential position brings its own multibillion-dollar conflicts and, given his marriage to Ivanka, may also violate anti-nepotism laws.)And the president-elect’s team is making sure reporters know he may still change his mind. “No final decisions have been made,” Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told HuffPost. Hicks added that, as previously announced, Trump will publicly announce his plan on Dec. 15.“This leaves us exactly where we thought we would be,” said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It is, assuming this is what he announces next week, an entirely inadequate approach to avoiding conflicts.”By maintaining a stake in his company, Trump will not relieve himself of his conflicts of interest, current or future, or any appearance of conflicts. He will maintain an enormous private financial interest that could at any time clash with American interests. His private business interests create a conflict for the president-elect whenever he assesses what the United States should do or say about the actions of world leaders.Consider the brutal state campaign of murder led by President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. Trump has his name on a tower in metro Manila and would benefit from an amicable relationship between Duterte’s regime and the U.S. government. Last week, Trump invited the Philippine leader to Washington and reportedly praised the way police in that country have been killing people suspected of using or dealing drugs. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway did not respond when she was asked about the invitation on Dec. 3.Domestically, Trump will soon appoint a new head of the General Services Administration, which oversees the lease for Trump’s D.C. hotel. Each year, that person will have to renegotiate terms of his boss’s lease with his boss’s adult children. This appointment is an immediate conflict of interest for Trump; the relationship will be an ongoing conflict for the incoming GSA head.The same will be true of Trump’s appointments to the National Labor Relations Board, who will be able to rule against union organizing efforts at Trump’s casinos and hotels.Trump’s reported refusal to divest from his business — despite the recommendations of ethics experts from both parties as well as in a bizarre stream of tweets by the Office of Government Ethics — may technically be allowed under federal law. His foreign holdings and debts, however, could very well be unconstitutional under the emoluments clause, which bars government officials from receiving payments or gifts from foreign governments or foreign government-owned corporations.Trump owes hundreds of millions of dollars to the government-owned Bank of China, while the Trump Tower in New York City rents space to the government-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. Since his election, the Trump International Hotel in D.C. has become a hotspot for holiday events held by foreign governments, including Bahrain and Azerbaijan.The appointment of Donald Jr. and Eric Trump as joint heads of the Trump Organization will also do nothing to alleviate any concerns about conflicts of interest. They serve on the executive committee of their father’s transition team, thus negating any separation between the business and his administration. They can use their two roles to advance their own and their father’s private financial interests. The president-elect obviously wants his company to succeed ― to keep him rich, to keep his children employed and successful, and to ensure them great wealth upon his retirement.These aren’t just apparent conflicts of interest. They are actual conflicts of interest.“It goes to the core of what presidents are supposed to do,” said Norm Eisen, former ethics adviser to President Barack Obama. “They’re there to serve the public interest and not the private interest, and the worst private interest of all is their own financial interest.”That’s the interest Trump seems to be refusing to leave behind as he enters office.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

70,POLITICS,Democratic Governors Vow To Hold The Line Against Donald Trump,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-governors-trump_us_58486633e4b0d0df1837902e,"Washington Gov.

But the GOP dominance in the nation’s capital doesn’t mean that there won’t be any progressive movement ― for that, Democrats should look to the states. “The states are where the action is,” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) told The Huffington Post. “This is a place where we can make progress. This is where we can defend our basic values. ... [We want to] be a beacon of hope to the extent there is a darkness coming out of Washington, D.C.”Republicans dominate in the states, too, holding 33 gubernatorial seats. But in those other areas that are blue, or at least purple, Democratic governors say they’ll stand up on key issues like immigration, climate change, health care, religious freedom, education and civil rights, no matter what President-elect Donald Trump does. “If the president acts in a way that is not supported by the constitution of the United States, then we’ll do that which we feel is necessary ― whether that’s a challenge in court or a challenge in the political process,” said Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy, chair of the Democratic Governors Association. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) scoffed at the idea of Trump becoming president in an October interview with HuffPost. In the crazy, offhand chance that he did win, she vowed to “continue to fight like hell” to move Oregon forward in a way that opens the door to all.“One of the wonderful things about being at the state level, at the state and local level, we are the place where innovating policymaking is happening,” she said. “My thinking is, we continue to be aggressive around a progressive agenda that helps families.”But what about pushing back on Trump, a man who seems to embody everything that Brown and other Democratic leaders oppose? She could at least demand he release his long-form birth certificate. She liked that idea.“Oh, we might have a little fun,” Brown said. “OK, yes.”California state Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León said during a visit to Washington, D.C., that they weren’t looking for a fight. “But we will defend our progressive gains,” he added. “Anything that undermines or threatens our economic prosperity ... will be met with resistance.”Already some states have taken proactive steps. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) plans to set up a public-private legal defense fund to help immigrants who need legal representation, regardless of their documentation status.Inslee and Malloy, along with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) all told HuffPost they would not participate in Trump’s vow to round up and deport undocumented immigrants.“The mayors of our larger communities have come right out and said, ‘Our police force is not going to be involved in rounding up, arresting and detaining members of our community who haven’t broken any laws,’” Hickenlooper said. Governors say they’ve also been concerned about a rise in reports of discrimination and hate crimes since the election. Hickenlooper said his son, who is in ninth grade, told him about a palpable level of fear fellow students from different backgrounds have about what may happen to them under a Trump administration. “We’ve really tried to reach out and reassure people that their homes and their families are not at risk,” he said. Cuomo has set up a special police unit to fight what he calls an “explosion” in post-election hate crimes, along with a hotline to report incidents. He is also pushing to expand the state’s human rights law to protect all students who face discrimination. In Pennsylvania, Wolf issued directives to help schools deal with, and report, incidents of racism and intolerance in schools. But it’s Trump’s promise to repeal Obamacare that has many governors most worried. All four of the governors who spoke with HuffPost have expanded Medicaid coverage in their states under the law, meaning low-income beneficiaries could be left in the cold unless Republicans come up with a comparable alternative.“I have almost half a million families in my state today who have health coverage through the Medicaid expansion,” said Inslee, who called repeal “one of the greatest threats” to Washington. “And this was a bipartisan success in my state. Democrats and Republicans both saw the wisdom of expanding Medicaid.”Inslee said he’s already urged his state’s GOP members of Congress to think fully about the consequences of repeal before making it happen.“This is a little bit like the dog that caught the care here,” he said. “The Republicans have been saying, ‘Oh, this is no problem, we’re going to take care of it.’ ... But now they’ve caught the car, and they have to figure out what to do with it.” Moving forward, governors hope that the Democratic Party will pay more attention to what they’re doing in the states, tying economic proposals to actual impacts and results that people can see.Wolf represents a state that both Trump and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) won this year. Like many others in the Democratic Party post-election, he counseled the party to have a laser-like focus on the issues of the middle class ― and to make sure the public knows what Democrats are doing. He pointed, as an example, to his plan to invest $300 million in the Port of Philadelphia ― a move that would create about 2,000 jobs.“We Democrats need to make sure that we get credit for doing this and focusing on this in a way that folks who vote recognize that when they feel frustration or anxiety or concern about the future, that the party that actually addresses their concerns is the Democratic Party,” he said. Credit is something that Trump has had no problem claiming already, touting a deal that his team put together that stops Carrier from sending some jobs to Mexico. President Barack Obama however, has been less successful at this sort of showmanship. His stimulus package had far more economic benefits for communities all around the country, but many beneficiaries still have no idea that it was Obama’s initiative that brought them the money.“I do think that the economic messages that the Democrats put forward were not well-received,” Malloy said. “I think we have to understand what that is ― part of that is people’s anger. ... There were people who would applaud the line of doing away with Obamacare and not understand that that would have a direct impact on their own personal bottom line. Clearly, we did not do a good enough job of speaking about the benefits of changes to health care that have come about.”There’s been a significant amount of soul-searching in the Democratic Party about why many working-class white voters went to Trump, even though they may have traditionally voted Democratic. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), for example, challenged Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for her job as House minority leader, arguing that he represents the type of area and voters that need more focus.But de León said he’s worried that the Democrats ― who did, after all, win the popular vote in the presidential election ― may focus too much on one small group of people.“It’s about all working families, not siloing ― not taking one subset of America and saying, ‘Let’s shower all of our attention on this subset, and then all of our problems will be done,” he said. “We’ll be back in power.’ ... It’s advocating by addition, not by subtraction.” Wolf said he thinks it’s possible to do both ― reach those voters who found Trump appealing by also emphasizing fairness and inclusion. As a business owner for most of his life, he made sure to have a diverse workforce, he said.“I tried to build that in not because I had some ideological affinity for that,” Wolf added. “I did, but also it actually made practical sense. You don’t cut yourself off from a big chunk of the substantial workforce simply because you don’t want people of a certain color or gender working for you.”When asked whether Democrats should follow the model of progressives like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who tend to focus more on economic issues than race, de León disagreed. “I’m a person of color,” he said. “I’m the youngest child of a single immigrant mother. I’m not from Vermont, and I’m not from Massachusetts. I respect those individuals, I don’t know them personally, but it is an issue of race and income. But that’s coming from a person of color.”Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth, here."

72,THE WORLDPOST,British Spy Chief Says Islamic State Plotting Attacks As Russia Makes 'Desert' Of Syria,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/isis-revenge-attacks_us_58496f48e4b0d0aa037f6ed9,This was Younger's first public speech since winning the top intelligence job.,2016-12-08,"Civil defense team members carry out search and rescue works after the war crafts belonging to the Syrian Army bombed the bazaar in the Etarib district of Aleppo, Syria on December 6, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5849710c120000dd00eee314.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Islamic State militants are using turmoil sown by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s bombing in Syria to plot attacks against the United Kingdom and her allies, Britain’s foreign intelligence chief said on Thursday.In his first major public speech since winning the top job at the Secret Intelligence Service in 2014, MI6 chief Alex Younger said Russia and Bashar al-Assad were hindering the defeat of militants by attempting to make a “desert” out of Syria.“As I speak, the highly organized external attack planning structures within Daesh (IS), even as they face military threat, are plotting ways to project violence against the UK and our allies without ever having to leave Syria,” Younger said at MI6’s Vauxhall Cross headquarters in central London.Younger cast Putin’s intervention on the side of President Assad as a crude tactical ploy that aligned Russia with the minority Alawites whose members are viewed with suspicion among the majority Sunnis.“In defining as a terrorist anyone who opposes a brutal government, they alienate precisely that group that has to be on side if the extremists are to be defeated,” he said. “Russia and the Syrian regime seek to make a desert and call it peace.”Syria’s civil war, which began in 2011, has become a theater for competing global powers, with Russia and Iran supporting Assad, and the United States, Gulf Arab and European powers such as Britain backing rebels who want to depose him.A career spy who joined MI6 as the Soviet Union was crumbling, Younger said civil war in Syria was a major threat to the United Kingdom which he said was facing an unprecedented threat from terrorism including 12 foiled plots since June 2013.BREXIT, TRUMP, BONDYounger said he had been repeatedly asked about the future of intelligence cooperation with the United States and EU powers since the Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election.“My answer is that I will aim for, and expect, continuity,” Younger said. “The need for the deepest cooperation can only grow. And I am determined that MI6 remains a ready and highly effective partner.”Younger, one of the West’s most powerful spies, said Britain faced “hybrid warfare” from unidentified hostile states through cyber-attacks, propaganda and the subversion of the democratic process.By inviting selected journalists to MI6’s green and cream Vauxhall Cross headquarters for the first public speech by a serving Chief, or “C”, Younger sought to cast one of the most secretive organizations on the planet as a diverse and dynamic spy service which was hiring the best.He said the experience of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, when flawed intelligence was used as a justification for war, had shown that spies needed to speak truth to power and to challenge assumptions.“If we are doing our job, the facts we reveal to government and the choices they present will be uncomfortable,” he said.MI6, depicted by novelists as the employer of some of the most memorable fictional spies from John le Carré’s George Smiley to Ian Fleming’s James Bond, operates overseas and is tasked with defending Britain and its interests.“I am conflicted about Bond. He has created a powerful brand for MI6 - as C, the real life version of M - there are few people who will not come to lunch if I invite them,” Younger said.But Younger had some bad news for those aspiring to be the maverick, hard-drinking, womanizing James Bond of Fleming’s novels: “Were Mr. Bond to apply to join MI6 now, he would have to change his ways.”(Editing by Ralph Boulton)"
73,POLITICS,Trump Talks To Leonardo DiCaprio In Latest Ploy To Misdirect Public On His Climate Agenda,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-leonardo-dicaprio-climate-change_us_58499298e4b08283d6b4e4f9,But did the president-elect actually listen to the climate advocate?,2016-12-08,Leonardo DiCaprio apparently pitched Trump on how clean energy can create jobs.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584994351800002c00e4196f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President-elect Donald Trump met with Leonardo DiCaprio on Wednesday to talk about clean energy jobs, just two days after Trump talked to Al Gore about climate change. But don’t get too excited.Meeting with celebrity climate advocates, even one who is a former vice president, does little to soften the blow that Trump dealt Wednesday by selecting Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.Pruitt, who has close ties to the fossil fuel industry, has been a harsh critic of the EPA. Under his lead, Oklahoma joined with other states in the lawsuit to block the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, which would grant the EPA power to force utility companies to cut emissions. Oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm ― a contender to run Trump’s Department of Energy ― led Pruitt’s 2013 re-election campaign. Pruitt even once sent a letter to the EPA criticizing emission estimates for natural gas drilling sites that was actually written by lawyers for Devon Energy, one of his state’s largest oil and gas companies.Pruitt’s environmental record stands in stark opposition to DiCaprio’s recent efforts, as he has become Hollywood’s leading advocate for the climate.In October, DiCaprio released “Before the Flood,” a 96-minute documentary on climate change that some have called the “new ‘Inconvenient Truth’” ― a reference to Gore’s 2006 film that mainstreamed the issue of global warming. DiCaprio gave Ivanka Trump a copy of the new film during Wednesday’s meeting, The Associated Press reports. The actor’s conversation with the Trumps focused on “how to create millions of secure, American jobs in the construction and operation of commercial and residential clean, renewable energy generation,” said Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation.Yet the president-elect’s meetings with DiCaprio and Gore barely amount to a fig leaf over Trump’s actual plans for environmental policy.“Donald Trump has made it clear that he intends to wage war on clean air and clean water,” Benjamin Schreiber, climate and energy program director at the nonprofit Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. “Trump has also put our climate in peril and shown he is out of step with the American people.”Indeed, 65 percent of Americans ― an all-time-high and up 10 points from last year ― said climate change is being caused by human activities, according to a Gallup poll released in March. But the incoming president has repeatedly dismissed climate change as “a hoax” and “a bunch of bunk.”Trump has also staffed his transition team and is filling his Cabinet with people known for denying the evidence of humans’ role in global warming, despite the sweeping scientific consensus. Myron Ebell, a virulent climate science denier, led the transition team on the EPA. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump’s pick for attorney general, claimed last year (in audio obtained by The Huffington Post) that efforts to combat climate change hurt poor people, although many impoverished countries suffer the worst effects of global warming. Trump has even floated Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as a possible secretary of state, while the giant oil company fights accusations that it covered up evidence of climate change.“Don’t think Al Gore is resurrected. He’s not,” Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) said Thursday at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation’s “Energy and Climate Policy Summit” in Washington, D.C. “It just shows that we have a guy who was elected president who will talk to anybody.”For now, Trump’s talk with climate advocates appears to be little more than hot air.Kate Sheppard contributed to this report.

74,POLITICS,Obama Administration To Open Temporary Shelters In Texas For Surge Of Immigrant Families,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/temporary-shelters-immigrants-texas_us_5849b015e4b0905b3442559a,The number of migrants crossing the border without authorization is up more than 40 percent compared to the same month last year.,2016-12-08,"Central American immigrant families walk through the countryside in Roma, Texas, in April after crossing from Mexico into the United States to seek asylum. Customs and Border Protection will open a new temporary shelter to handle an influx of migrants on Friday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5849b1c51c00002d000ea8bf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Customs and Border Protection will open a new temporary shelter on Friday in Donna, Texas, to handle a sharp increase in the number Central American families and unaccompanied children crossing into the United States, the agency announced Thursday.  U.S. authorities have struggled since the summer of 2014 to accommodate an influx of Central American families and children, who often arrive seeking asylum or other humanitarian relief. After rising and falling over two years, the numbers jumped sharply this fall.  The set of tents and showers at Donna comes in addition to a similar facility that CBP opened last month in the West Texas town of Tornillo, outside El Paso. Each facility can hold up to 500 detainees. “It got to the point where we simply could not handle the amount of people who were coming here and requesting asylum,” said David Higgerson, Laredo field operations director, according to KENS5 Eyewitness News. Each of the shelters cost about $3.8 million to establish, KENS5 reports. The number of apprehensions at the border has surged this year, with 46,195 people crossing into the United States without authorization in October ― a figure that includes people who request asylum or other humanitarian relief. That number marks a 41 percent increase compared to the same month last year. Unaccompanied minors and mothers traveling with their children accounted for more than 19,000 of the new arrivals. “This effort is designed to minimize the impact to border security operations while fulfilling our humanitarian efforts,” Manuel Padilla Jr., commander of the Joint Task Force-West South Texas Corridor, said in a press statement. “We will work closely with all our partner agencies to maintain efficient operations.” Those passing through the shelters are supposed to remain in custody for three days or less. The development comes as the Obama administration faces legal setbacks to its family detention policy and criticism from a Department of Homeland Security-fielded panel of experts over its reliance on for-profit prison contractors to run immigrant detention centers.

Prior to that, Senate Republicans had filibustered a historically high number of Obama’s federal nominees.Democrats lost their Senate majority in 2014. But the diminished power of the Senate minority will become more relevant in 2017, when President-elect Donald Trump will need only a simple majority to seat his nominees. The modification does not apply to Supreme Court nominees, which can still be filibustered.Reid acknowledged that the new rules would make things more challenging for Democrats, but insisted that it was still the right thing to do.“I doubt any of us envisioned Donald J. Trump’s becoming the first president to take office under the new rules. But what was fair for President Obama is fair for President Trump,” Reid wrote.“To be sure, persuading a majority of the Senate to your side is harder than blocking a confirmation on a procedural vote. But it is also fairer,” he added.Reid also counseled his Senate peers to use the filibuster more sparingly on legislation in his farewell speech on Thursday morning. Senate rules continue to allow senators to use the filibuster to block legislation, rather than a president’s nominees.“I do hope my colleagues are able to temper their use of the filibuster,” Reid said.Barring that, Reid predicted, the filibuster “will be gone. It will be gone first on nominations, then it will be gone on legislation.”“This is something you have to work on together,” he concluded. “Because if you continue to use it the way it’s been used recently, it’s going to really affect this institution a lot.”"
80,POLITICS,Federal Judge Halts Jill Stein's Michigan Recount,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-judge-halts-jill-stein-michigan-recount_us_5848b0aee4b0d0aa037f3537,That recount effort is now on life support.,2016-12-08,Jill Stein's Michigan election recount faces an uncertain future after a federal judge halted it on Wednesday night.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5848b118170000620fe7e62f.jpeg?cache=9D40oINYb5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith on Wednesday night halted a Michigan election recount launched by Green Party nominee Jill Stein that had been underway since Monday.Stein’s campaign condemned the judgment and promised to challenge the Michigan Court of Appeals decision Goldsmith effectively upheld with his ruling. “We are not backing down from this fight ― a fight to protect the hard-fought, hard-won civil and voting rights of all Americans. Our campaign will seek immediate relief in Michigan’s Supreme Court to ensure the recount that is already underway in all Michigan counties continues,” Hayley Horowitz and Jessica Clarke, the Stein campaign’s lead lawyers in Michigan, said in a statement.“With so many irregularities in Michigan ― including more than 75,000 under-votes, many in urban areas, and widespread carelessness, and perhaps interference, with preserving ballots ― there is a real possibility the rights of voters in Michigan may have been suppressed during this election,” they continued.John Bursch, attorney for Michigan’s Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette, who had challenged Stein’s case for a recount, praised Goldsmith’s decision.“This ruling is a huge victory for Michigan taxpayers and the rule of law,” Bursch said in a statement.All signs suggest that Stein’s Michigan recount effort, which has already endured multiple judicial challenges, is nearing an end.Goldsmith’s Wednesday decision undoes an order he issued early Monday morning requiring the state to proceed with a recount by noon that day and jettison a planned two-day waiting period. Goldsmith made that judgment with the intention of enabling the state to complete the recount by Dec. 13, the deadline needed to allow for sufficient time before the Electoral College meets on Dec. 19.Goldsmith insisted at the time that any state court decision to halt the recount on the merits of the recount claim itself would require an additional ruling by him to proceed. On Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld Goldsmith’s ruling.But in Goldsmith’s Monday ruling, he only weighed in on the timing of the recount, not the merits of the case for it. And moments after the 6th Circuit’s decision on Tuesday, a panel of judges on the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled that Stein was not an “aggrieved party” with standing to call for a recount, since her fourth-place finish was too distant for a new tally to redress the effects of any alleged electoral tampering.The Michigan Court of Appeals’ decision did not take effect immediately, however, since the 6th Circuit had upheld Goldsmith’s order that his court needed to rule on any additional cessation of the recount.As a result, the case went back to Goldsmith on Wednesday. The federal judge, who had not previously deliberated on the merits of the case, effectively agreed with the opinion of the Michigan Court of Appeals that Stein is not an “aggrieved party.”He also rejected Stein’s additional argument that there is a constitutional right to demand an election recount without an extremely tight margin or substantial evidence of election tampering or fraud.“There is no case law recognizing an independent federal right to a recount that either this Court or the parties have come across, in the absence of actual deprivation of voting rights,” Goldsmith wrote.He acknowledged the concerns about the vulnerability of electronic voting technologies to hacking or tampering, but said that there needed to be more evidence that such interference had occurred in order for there to be grounds for a recount.“The vulnerability of our system of voting poses the threat of a potentially devastating attack on the integrity of our election system. But invoking a court’s aid to remedy that problem in the manner Plaintiffs have chosen — seeking a recount as an audit of the election to test whether the vulnerability led to actual compromise of the voting system — has never been endorsed by any court, and would require, at a minimum, evidence of significant fraud or mistake — and not speculative fear of them,” he concluded. “Such evidence has not been presented here.”"

Greg Lake will stay in my heart for ever, as he has always been,” Young wrote on the Emerson, Lake and Palmer Facebook page. It was not clear where Lake died.Lake’s death comes less than a year after the suicide in March of keyboard player Keith Emerson, who was found at his Los Angeles home with a gunshot wound to the head. He had been battling depression.Drummer Carl Palmer on Thursday paid tribute to Lake’s “soaring voice and skill as a musician.”In a note on his Facebook page, Palmer said he had fond memories of “those great years we had in the 1970s and many memorable shows we performed together.”“Having lost Keith this year as well, has made this particularly hard for all of us. As Greg sang at the end of Pictures At An Exhibition, “death is life.” His music can now live forever in the hearts of all who loved him,” Palmer added.Lake first joined King Crimson in 1968, spending about a year with the group and playing on albums “In the Court of the Crimson King” and “In the Wake of Poseidon”.He later met up with Emerson, and formed Emerson, Lake and Palmer. The trio recorded eight albums, including “Pictures at an Exhibition,” that fused classical music with rock and jazz before breaking up in 1979, and later reuniting in the early 1990s for two more albums.Lake’s biggest success however was the 1975 Christmas single “I Believe in Father Christmas,” released as a solo effort, and which is still played around the holidays.Lake was quoted as telling Britain’s Guardian newspaper in an interview last month that the song was intended as a riposte to the commercialization of Christmas."
82,POLITICS,House Passes Bill To Extend Tax Relief Deadline For The Wrongfully Convicted,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wrongfully-convicted-tax-relief-extend_us_58484d77e4b0d0df1837686d,"The extension is critical for these men and women, some of whom spent decades behind bars for crimes they never committed.",2016-12-08,Exonerees are often given little assistance as they try to readjust to freedom.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58485c391800002d00e4169c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In less than two weeks, the application period for a federal law that allows exonerees to receive tax relief on any compensation they received for their wrongful conviction will expire ― even though many exonerees still don’t know the law exists or how to take advantage of it. But on Tuesday, the House took the first steps toward a remedy, unanimously passing a bill to extend the deadline for a full year. The extension (H.R. 6438) applies to the Wrongful Conviction Tax Relief Act, signed into law in 2015 by President Barack Obama, which prohibited the federal government from taxing compensation paid to the wrongfully convicted. Retroactively, it opened the door for all exonerees, no matter the year they were compensated, to request an IRS refund of any tax, interest and penalties paid on that money.However, there was a catch: There was no mechanism for notifying those eligible for a refund, and for anyone who had paid taxes prior to 2013, the law provided only a one-year window to claim a refund. And the expiration date, Dec. 19, is rapidly approaching.Reps. Sam Johnson (R-Texas) and John Larson (D-Conn.), who introduced the original bill last year, also introduced the extension earlier this week. Both lawmakers had pledged just last month in statements made to The Huffington Post that they would fight to extend the deadline. The lawmakers were critical of the Internal Revenue Service, which they said failed to release its guidance on the law for six months, effectively cutting the original one-year timeline in half. “Americans who have been wrongfully convicted suffered enough,” the lawmakers said in a joint statement on their new bill’s passage through the House. “While we can never right this wrong and return to them the time they spent behind bars, we can help these folks as they move forward with their lives. The deadline extension is the right thing to do, as is evidenced by its full support of the House.”The extension proposal must still pass through the Senate and be signed by the president before it would go into effect. On Tuesday, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) introduced a companion bill to Johnson and Larson’s House version. Jon Eldan, an attorney in Oakland, California, and founder of the nonprofit After Innocence, has been spearheading an enormous effort to contact as many exonerees as possible before the deadline hits (The Huffington Post profiled that initiative in November). Eldan said that a one-year extension would allow “the time necessary to notify and assist the exonerees across the country who are eligible for the benefits that Congress intended with this law.”Eldan’s After Innocence provides free post-release assistance to exonerees nationwide, helping to ensure that they have access to ― and actually use ― the health care and social services they are eligible for, and that they have legal assistance for any problems they might face upon re-entering society.The National Registry of Exonerations lists 1,928 men and women who have been cleared in the United States since 1989. They served, on average, about nine years in prison and, collectively, lost 16,000 years behind bars. Some had been on death row. Some were minors when they were convicted or had intellectual disabilities. All of them had been swept into a justice system that failed them.When released, these exonerees often are given little assistance as they try to readjust to freedom, update job skills and re-enter society after years, even decades, behind bars. Thirty-one states, Washington, D.C., and the federal justice system have enacted some form of compensation for the time spent unjustly imprisoned. But those statutes vary widely in terms of who qualifies and what is offered. The vast majority of exonerees do not receive meaningful compensation for having their lives derailed. And many of those who had been compensated, either through a state law or a civil rights suit, faced an additional burden: paying taxes on that money. For years it was unclear if they were obligated to pay taxes on the compensation, because prior to the 2015 law, the status of money paid for wrongful incarceration was vague under IRS rules. If it was deemed compensation for physical injury, it was not taxable. If it was determined to be for something else (such as lost wages), it was taxable. Eldan has been working day and night for the better part of a year trying to identify, contact and assist as many people on the National Registry of Exonerations as he can to guide them toward any tax relief they may be eligible for. Using data compiled largely from media reports that the registry tracks, he identified about 750 people who received some form of compensation for being wrongfully convicted. But the registry does not compile contact information for those on the list, so Kroll, a large corporate investigations firm, is donating its help, and law students from the College of William & Mary and Stanford University are also digging up contact information. When Eldan does reach eligible exonerees, he can refer them to the Reed Smith LLP law firm, which coordinates free assistance for filing refund claims.In a letter 23 innocence organizations, including After Innocence, sent to Johnson and Larson last month, the groups urged the lawmakers to move to extend the deadline by two years. They indicated that there would not be enough time to reach all of those Eldan has identified as having received compensation nor the 1,000 more whose compensation status remains unknown.Eldan had contacted more than 330 wrongfully convicted individuals nationwide and identified nine who may qualify for tax relief when he spoke with HuffPost in November."

Bush before him had failed to keep the group’s size in check.The new limit was tucked into the 1,587-page National Defense Authorization Act, which is now on its way to Obama’s desk after passage by the Senate on Thursday. The House had approved it on Dec. 2.Trump’s transition team did not respond to a query about its view on the change.Lawmakers on both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees started looking for ways to rein in the size of the council two years ago, amid reports that Obama’s NSC had upward of 400 staffers.The administration said that estimate was overblown, but nevertheless began its own internal review.“To ensure the NSC staff is a lean, nimble, and policy-oriented organization, we are reversing the trend of growth across successive Administrations to align our staffing with our strategic priorities,” wrote NSC staff director Suzy George in a White House blog post in June 2015. “This is not about downsizing for its own sake; it’s about gradually right-sizing the NSC staff.”NSC spokesman Ned Price said the current staff level is already below 200 thanks to that work.“We have made good progress on this effort,” Price said. “Since we initiated the rightsizing review, the NSC staff has realized a 13 percent reduction, and has done so in a way that is aligned with national security requirements.”The new legislative mandate takes effect in 18 months and does not include support staff ― for example, people whose jobs entail maintaining equipment or meeting rooms.The NSC was created immediately after World War II as a way of coordinating the various intelligence and defense agencies. Through the years, though, the council has come to consolidate increasing power and taken on a greater decision-making role within the White House."

As it turns out, that might not be the last we’ll see of Will, Grace, Jack and Karen. In a new interview with PrideSource, series star Megan Mullally hinted that there was “a very good chance” that the show would be returning again in the future ― even though viewers shouldn’t be setting their DVRs just yet. “All I can say is that there is a very good chance that that might happen. It’s not happening right this second. I mean, we’re not rehearsing or anything like that,” she said. “But there is a very good chance that something is going to materialize.”That “something,” she added, could mean “coming back to NBC for 10 episodes,” though she stressed that she was only “speaking theoretically [and] in a completely made-up world.” When PrideSource’s Chris Azzopardi pressed for details, Mullally remained mostly tight-lipped, but noted that the show’s all-inclusive message would be particularly relevant following Donald Trump’s election victory. “I mean, it couldn’t possibly be better timing,” she said. “I think more so now than even when we started!”The 58-year-old, who will next be seen opposite James Franco and Bryan Cranston in the big-screen comedy, “Why Him?,” said that “words can’t really describe” how proud she is to have been a part of a series that broke fresh ground in terms of portraying LGBTQ people on television.“To have been a part of a show that actually not only helped people come out to their parents, or to come out period, or to not to feel like they were alone [was great],” she said. “I’m not saying ‘Will & Grace’ is responsible for gay marriage; I’m saying that maybe there was an element that helped in some way.”To read the full PrideSource interview, head here.

But it’s the fact that you can reduce my whole life to one word, whatever it is, my entire career, my service to my country, my academic rigor, my courage in going to interview terrorists, and refugee camps, and third-world prisons. It’s reducing my entire professional career and background to this one word. I just figured, for the most part, mainstream networks stopped using it. Those are small brush fires. The election made me realize we’ve got forest fires that we collectively need to be focused on.”She described the double standard that’s been applied to her and Petraeus, saying she wants people to understand that she’s still trying to bounce back all these years later. Her career was ruined as a result of the affair, she said, while Petraeus has been granted numerous opportunities.“I was an academic and I lost my assignment at Harvard,” she said. “Meanwhile, he gets invited to Harvard to become a fellow.”She also noted how disturbing the focus on her appearance was, especially coming from female journalists. She still feels like she was a victim of media bias, she added.Why was there this focus on my physical characteristics? I was shocked at that. On the other hand, my reaction was, as a feminist, I’ll wear whatever I want to. If I’m strong, I’m not going to apologize for being strong. I was really incredulous at that coverage, especially because it was written by a woman.She was shocked when she heard the news about Petraeus’ potential cabinet position, she said. At the same time, she argued that Petraeus is “the best person for the job.”“He’s exceptionally talented,” she said. “Our country could use someone like him right now.”Broadwell, who has asked that various news outlets cease using the word “mistress” in their coverage, discussed her desire to address the media in an interview that aired Thursday on “CBS This Morning.”“Sometimes it’s better to remain silent,” she said. “But I’ve reached a point where I feel I need to fight back for my life.”"

His words cut through the audience as he recounts his Black Panther father, or more accurately, the absence of his long-imprisoned Black Panther father. The speech is partly a recognition of the paternal greatness that came before the Cub, but more so an indictment of the recklessness and abandonment of a generation of activism that he feels hasn’t paid off yet.At least, not for the generation coming of age today, still fighting against police brutality and other forms of institutionalized racism. The music-infused play, created by the theater ensemble Universes and developed by “Eclipsed” director Liesl Tommy, eventually culminates in a reunion between these generations. Facilitated by artists-slash-activists Malik (the Cub) and Jimmy, the confrontational gathering pits an older group of people, profoundly proud of their struggle to provide health benefits to a community so often denied them, against a youthful contingent, resentful of the fact that their parents sacrificed so much ― namely, their families ― to start a revolution with no end in sight. A generation confused as to what their role in fighting injustice should be.Jimmy isn’t a descendent of Panthers, though. Jimmy is the nephew of a member of the Young Lords, which, according to the Bronx Museum, was “a radical social organization led by poor and working-class Puerto Rican youth in the 1960s.” History books have been unkind to the Black Panthers, often misrepresenting their role in instituting necessary social programs across the U.S., but the Young Lords have largely been denied a story entirely. Very few students learn about the Young Lords’ activism, advocating for affordable housing, higher employment, and police reform. “If you truly do your research on the Black Panthers [...] they were about coalition building,” Steven Sapp, Universes co-founder, explained to The Huffington Post. He cited Fred Hampton’s Rainbow Coalition, consisting of the Black Panthers, Young Lords, Young Patriots, members of the American Indian Movement, Brown Berets, I Wor Kuen, and even the White Panther Party. “It is important for us to see this type of unity that existed then and should continue now. It is this type of effort that should cross color lines, to show that liberation is a human struggle that can crush white supremacy, and will fight it as a coalition.”“Party People” is currently running at the Public Theater in New York City. Ahead of the show’s closing this month, we spoke to the director, Tommy, to discuss the power of coalition-building, the gaping divides between generations, and the legacy of activism people in the Black Lives Matter movement are coming to terms with today.What initially drew you to the subject matter of “Party People” ― the history of the Black Panthers as well as the Young Lords?Well, you know, I’m originally from South Africa. I grew up there during the apartheid era. I come from an activist world. And when my family immigrated to the states, my father was someone who made sure that I had heard a lot about freedom struggles around the world. So I thought when I came to this country that I was in some ways more familiar with this slice of American history than the average American was. That’s not really something that they taught in school. But revolutionary movements, that was just something that I grew up being aware of because we were in the midst of a revolutionary struggle ourselves. Obviously, a lot of Black Panthers’ history has been unfortunately censored or distorted throughout the years; it’s barely taught in most schools. But the history of the Young Lords is probably even less visible to a lot of people. Oh my gosh, some […] have no idea there was even a movement called the Young Lords.I mean, to be quite honest, I didn’t either. So I was wondering, was it important for you and the production team to not only pay homage to 50 years of the Black Panthers but to also pay tribute to these lesser-known allies who were also fighting the liberation?Oh, 100 percent. Because Universes, the writers, they’re all from New York. They are Puerto Rican and African-American, and they grew up sort of as the beneficiary of some of the Young Lords’ social programs. When they came up with the idea to do the show, the Young Lords and the Black Panthers were very, very much for them equally potent and important.What kind of research went into this production for you? How closely did you work with Universes?Well, Universes, they got the commission from OSF [Oregon Shakespeare Festival]. OSF does this American Revolution series where they commission writers to write on certain topics. And Universes, they were the ones who said, we want write about the ‘60s and the revolutionary movement of that time. That was, for them, the world of the Black Panthers.And then they got a grant and they were able to travel all around the country and interview Young Lords and Black Panthers. After they had done that for a year and they had all of this material it was time to pick a director. That’s when they reached out to me and I was brought on board. Before there was a play, they had written a lot of songs and poems and kind of spoken-word pieces in response to their interviews. They had a massive amount of writing. But what they wanted for this particular show is different than anything that they’ve done before. What they wanted was a narrative ― you know, characters ― and they wanted a story arc. And because I did a lot of play developments, they felt like I’d be able to help them unpack it.And also because of my background and the kind of work that I’ve done. You know, I’m a person who’s done Shakespeare, I’ve done political work. And that’s what they do. Their work was really language-based. It’s new. It’s political. There’s a lot of movement and there’s a lot of music. They wanted someone who could speak all of those languages.Are the primary characters sort of just amalgams of historical figures?Yes. The thing that’s really interesting to me about this kind of work is that with “Eclipsed,” that also came from a lot of interviews that Danai Gurira did. You know, I do a lot of work that involves a tremendous amount of historical and political research. And what happens with every single one of these projects is you fall in love with people and you fall in love with stories. And so you make connections and that’s where you build the narrative. And the hardest part was figuring out which of these incredibly moving and incredibly powerful and incredibly inspiring and incredibly tragic and incredibly funny stories makes it into the play. There’s just so much carving and sculpting that has to happen.All of the characters in the play are a composite of many, many people. And many, many stories.I don’t think that it’s explicitly stated whether or not Malik and Jimmy are sort of representatives of the Black Lives Matter movement. But was that sort of part of the intention, of drawing a line from the Black Panthers and the Young Lords to today’s activist environment, which I think in many ways is probably grounded by the Black Lives Matter movement?That’s a very interesting question. I think what I was actually interested in was Jimmy and Malik being a parallel for Universes. Because Universes, as artists, have been activists their whole lives. They started off as activists and artists, and that’s what I am as well. So the question, when you are an artist and you also believe in having a political point of view in your work, is that question of, Are you doing enough? Have you gone far enough? Is it really political? You know, it’s always there.But what you are identifying is absolutely true. What we all cared a lot about is the evolution of activism among youth today. Because when we started doing this ― we did this the first production in 2012, our second production in 2014, and now in 2016 ― youth and activism has changed so much over the last six years. When we did the play the first time there was no Black Lives Matter movement. But when we did it at Berkeley in 2014, we were living through ― Ferguson had just happened, Trayvon. Things were so potent. So we thought we had to address what was going on. We did a rewrite for the end of this production because, you know, the conversation between this generation of activists and the earlier generation of activists is very much alive and evolving.I want to get to a question that I have about the end of the production. But first I wanted to talk about the pains of the generational divides that you guys are painting in “Party People” that are just incredibly visceral. One of the ways that you do that is that you have all these nods to technology. I loved how the older generation was talking about archives and tapes and collections and then the younger generation was, you know, streaming on Facebook Live. Do you see technology as a primary driver of generational dissonance?I absolutely do. Sometimes I think about my parents ― my father in the ‘70s. And then I think about him using his iPad [today]. The violence with which he puts his fingers on the screen. I’m like, Dad, you don’t need to be that rough with it. Just gently tap it, it will respond to a gentle touch. It’s crazy how fast things are changing in terms of technology. That moment you’re referring to in the play, when the younger generation talks about the power of clicking “Share,” in terms of activism. And how shut down the older generation is about that being a real thing. The real thing for them was being in the community and making change, right? The question I think this generation is grappling with is the meaning of being in the community and making change and technology and clicking “Share.” How do you marry the two objectives?At the end of the production, there’s a semblance of resolution in terms of the fact that the two generations come to what seems like a temporary détente. But it doesn’t feel entirely complete. So do you feel like the dialogue between generations, it’s just something that’s continuously ongoing and incomplete?I like the kinds of questions you’re asking me because I recently got into a really vigorous argument with friends of mine about the so-called millennials. Two of them are professors. And I was listening to them going on and on about millennials. This is crazy to me […] there’s always ridiculous articles in Time magazine about this generation or that generation. Why do we do this? As a culture? It happens all the time. So that’s something that I find endlessly fascinating. It happens with every single generation, where you have to name the generation coming up. And then you have to tear them apart. Why?Do you find any sort of benefit in that friction? Like, is that sort of necessary to move us forward?I think that as long as there is dialogue and there’s some knowledge there. What’s exciting to me about working on this play is that the younger generation slaps back. So that it’s not just the older generation telling them all the ways that they were wrong. They fight for their point of view because a younger generation challenging the status quo is the only way that change happens.And I feel passionately about this because I come from a culture where it was always youth movements that propelled political unrest in Africa during the struggle, you know, because the leaders were always arrested and banned and exiled and murdered. So the demonstrations often came out of high school student movements. I understand the necessity for youthful challenge of status quo. It’s essential to the growth of society.One of the other characters that I was really interested in was Clara, because through her we sort of witness this desire to opt out of politics completely. Yes.You know, while Malik and Jimmy are trying to be advocates for change in a different way than their parents, Clara initially feels burdened by the idea that she’s required to fight for change in any way.  Correct.Why was it important for you and the team to explore this stance?I feel that this is very real stance. Universes spent a lot of time with what are called Panther Cubs. These are the children of activists and we spend a lot of time in the show talking about that generation and the rejection that they felt and the inadequacy that they felt when they have these towering influences in their lives.How do you be the next generation? It’s very difficult. There’s a potent inadequacy that these young people felt. And one way of dealing with it is to just completely distance yourself from it because you know it’s very draining to live a life of activism. It is very, very taxing. It’s why the majority of people in this world just you know do their job and then do their families. You know I mean? To be woke is very emotionally, psychically, physically taxing. And I have to say that I really connect with Clara, because when I came to this country I used to give speeches about divestment. And then I went to college and I felt really sick of the sound of my own voice. I was always so outspoken and I was always telling people what to think, because that was the world I was raised in. When I got to college, I was like, I’m going to be a new me. [...] That didn’t last very long, unfortunately. That’s not really how I was meant to roll in this world.I think that Clara having grown up with so much turmoil and passionate people fighting for their lives and fighting for the lives of everyone around them, she just wants peace and quiet. And I totally relate to that on some level. And also, you don’t have to feel inadequate if you’re not putting yourself out there. So I think she’s a really important voice in terms of legacy. Because that’s the other thing we’re dealing with in this show is the legacy of these activists. I really like this description that Playbill used when describing you. They said that you are a person driven to make political work that is also entertaining. So I just wanted to ask you how you, in all of your shows, toe this line between wanting to create something that’s politically aware but also striving to keep audiences simply entertained. Yeah, I mean, I would be a journalist if I wasn’t interested in entertaining. You know what I mean? Or I would write pamphlets or I would be a college professor, if it was really just about making political statements. I really love it when audiences laugh and I love it when audiences cry and I love it when audiences get angry. Because that is the point for me of theater. It’s about a communal discussion.It’s vital as an artist to create an environment where we get to look at ourselves together and laugh together and cry together and challenge ourselves together. That is the purpose of theater and a live experience. So for me I’m always asking: Is this thing funny enough? Is this dangerous enough? Is this scary enough? How do you make it as engaging as possible for the audience? Because that’s my job.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.“Party People” is running at the Public Theater in New York City until Dec. 11, 2016."

Petraeus resigned Nov. 9, 2012, citing an extramarital affair with Broadwell. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5848a451120000dc00eee1d4.jpeg?cache=M9y3Oq38JS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While disgraced former CIA Director David Petraeus has emerged as a contender for secretary of state, Paula Broadwell, with whom he shared classified information and had an affair, is still waiting to hear what further military punishment she may face. In her first big interview since the 2012 scandal, Broadwell, now an Army Reserve major, spoke out against her disproportionate treatment, saying that she’s “happy” that Petraeus’ career has recovered, but she had hoped for the same opportunity to rebuild her life.“I want to fight back,” she told “CBS This Morning” host Norah O’Donnell in the interview that aired Thursday. “Sometimes it’s better to remain silent … but I’ve reached a point where I feel I need to fight back for my life.”“As I woke up to the news, and it was a bit of shocker that he was being considered for a Cabinet position, I was both shocked that I’m still in this tenuous position and yet happy because I think he should be able to go on with his life. He’s earned it. And so should his family,” she continued. “But then it begs the question: Why shouldn’t I be able to go on?”In 2012, both were punished when reports revealed that Petraeus, then director of the CIA, had shared classified information with Broadwell, who was writing a book about him. During the course of her research for the biography, the two also had an extramarital affair.Petraeus resigned, pled guilty to his charges and is serving two years of probation after his April 2015 sentencing. But now his career is on the rise, as President-elect Donald Trump reportedly considers him as a possible secretary of state.Broadwell, an Army intelligence officer, was demoted. The Army is still weighing whether to impose more formal punishments. She resigned from her post last summer, but the Army has yet to accept it.She said she’s ready to return to service.“I’m not a benchwarmer,” she said. “I’m fighting to take back my own narrative. I also believe on principle I have something to offer the world.”As The Huffington Post’s Emily Peck noted Tuesday, the difference between Petraeus’ and Broadwell’s fates illustrates a sexist double standard:It’s hard to begrudge Petraeus his second act; he’s a widely respected general with a long and storied history.In the CBS interview, Broadwell said that she’s just asking to be treated with dignity “and also to be treated with the same standard by the military, and to be able to move forward.”She equated her situation to a “potential cancer hanging over my head.”“I mean, that’s basically what it’s been like over the past five years,” she added. “When there’s constant uncertainty, it’s kind of soul-eating.”This article has been updated to include video footage of the CBS interview and fresh quotes."

Twenty-seven states moved to join a series of lawsuits against it, alleging that it is an overly burdensome regulation that will hurt farmers and other businesses. But few people have been more vocal in their opposition than Pruitt, who describes himself in his official biography as “a leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda.”He has sued the EPA numerous times, including on the matter of the Clean Water Rule last year.In a 2015 op-ed in The Hill, co-written with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Pruitt called the rule “unlawful” and “breathtaking in its overreach.” He has also described the rule as a “brazen effort to stifle private property rights.”The matter remains tied up in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals with oral arguments set to begin next year. The current leadership of the EPA sees things much differently.Speaking before the American Water Summit in Miami Wednesday morning, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy described the rule as an important mechanism for protecting the quality of the nation’s water supplies.McCarthy added that she is “confident the Clean Water Rule will move forward in the courts.”Environmental groups that support the rule share McCarthy’s confidence, though many expressed concern at the news of Pruitt’s nomination.In a Wednesday statement, Bob Irvin, president of the American Rivers advocacy group, said the nomination “raises serious alarms for all Americans who value rivers and the clean water they provide.”“By filing suit to overturn the Clean Water Rule, Scott Pruitt called into question his commitment to protecting clean water for every American,” Irvin said.For many, that concern extends beyond the fate of the controversial rule itself.Jan Goldman-Carter, director of wetlands and water resources at the National Wildlife Federation, told The Huffington Post that Pruitt’s record of staunch opposition to the rule suggests other water-protecting legislation, like the broader Clean Water Act, could be in jeopardy.Neither Pruitt nor Trump could simply eliminate the Clean Water Rule with the stroke of a pen, however.If the Trump administration decides to stop defending the rule in court, there are several environmental and conservation groups that have already intervened in the lawsuit and would continue to defend the rule, Environment America senior attorney John Rumpler said.And if the court sent back the rule to be rewritten, its revision would involve a lengthy rulemaking process, including a public comment period.That process would somehow need to invalidate the scientific evidence cited in support of the rule during its initial process, something environmentalists say is not possible because that evidence is so thorough.“They’re going to have to confront the overwhelming scientific evidence in factor of these waterways being protected,” Rumpler said. Another route to eliminate the rule could involve Congress amending the Clean Water Act to overturn it. The House already voted earlier this year to overturn the rule, a vote President Barack Obama vetoed.This time around, a presidential veto would almost certainly not be a factor, though Rumpler still believes such action in Congress would ultimately fail.“The fight for clean water at this point is still very much alive,” Rumpler said, “and the fate of this historic rule has not yet been written.”Despite the complicated path to eliminating the rule, it’s likely the Trump administration will at least make an effort to do so.It also seems likely that Pruitt, a longtime defender of fossil fuel interests, would not take action to fight climate change, which is already putting major stress on our nation’s water supply.In a National Review op-ed he co-bylined earlier this year, Pruitt described the scientific “debate” on climate change as “far from settled” ― even though scientists overwhelmingly agree that climate change is a real and serious issue.Nevertheless, some environmentalists are holding on to optimism.Michael Kelly, spokesman for Clean Water Action, a nonprofit, said he believes Americans are passionate about where their water comes from. National polls have found that drinking water issues are among Americans’ top green concerns. Kelly is confident those people would not take the elimination of the water rule lying down.“We are not ready to give an inch when it comes to clean water,” he said. “We will fight and we are ready to fight.

90,POLITICS,John Boehner Knows That He Won The 2016 Election,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-boehner-2016_us_58488964e4b06410414594c9,"He got out while the getting was good, that's for sure.",2016-12-08,John Boehner is very happy with his life decisions. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584889e61700002500e7e5c9.jpeg?cache=kiTdzKUEdp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In retrospect, it’s funny to think about how way back in 2011, President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner came oh so close to inking the sort of entitlement program-cutting “grand bargain” that would have sent the Beltway pundit class into heights of orgiastic ecstasy while, you know, economically immiserating millions of people. Had Boehner been the leader of the smarter GOP-majority caucuses of Houses of Representatives past, he would have gone down in history as a speaker who’d pulled off a major heist, smoothly extracting a raft of major concessions from a Democratic president.Alas, Boehner came to power at the very time smart was going crazy, leading a caucus bent on the sort of zero-sum game that held that if Obama was able to earn a concession for himself ― or, really, save any face at all ― it was a bad deal all around. And so Boehner spent his latter days as speaker stuck between a president that wouldn’t give away the entire store and House colleagues that were willing to go to ridiculous lengths and resort to dangerous stunts to show how committed they were to their particular ideological pretensions. It pretty much saved America’s earned benefit programs, but it made governing all but impossible.And so, in the fall of 2015, Boehner decided that all of this could just as easily be somebody else’s problem and he announced that he was going to resign. As CNN relayed Wednesday, Boehner, if nothing else, has a real appreciation for his sense of timing: Former House Speaker John Boehner says he is thankful that he did not have to participate in the 2016 presidential election.Indeed, if you look at the way the coming fight over just how Obamacare should be repealed and ― let me stifle a little laughter ― replaced is shaping up, it’s looking like the precise type of internecine fracas that drove Boehner to the merlot.Republican leadership is planning to pull off what’s been called a “repeal and delay” maneuver in which the Affordable Care Act’s funding structures are gutted through a budget reconciliation process as soon as the next Congress is ready, but they leave themselves a three-year-long off-ramp to provide enough time to gin up some sort of ersatz “replacement.”But the House’s “Freedom Caucus” isn’t having any of it ― they want this matter to be accomplished by the 115th Congress. The group’s leader, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), has vowed that any plan to extend the process beyond that window will be met with “major resistance.” It’s the precise sort of battle that inspired Boehner to get out of the game.CNN goes on to note that Boehner was always very bullish on Donald Trump’s electoral chances and that the two men were, for a time, “texting buddies.” But when all is said and done and the new year brings about other political retirements, you shouldn’t be surprised if this jokey bit from this year’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner doesn’t herald the future of Boehner’s post-political relationships.~~~~~ Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.

91,PARENTS,"Kellyanne Conway Slips Up, Implies Trump White House Will Be Terrible Place For Women",Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kellyanne-conway-working-mothers-donald-trump_us_584987dee4b04002fa801b47,There's a sad subtext to her comments about why she won't officially join the administration.,2016-12-08,"Kellyanne Conway, speaking at Politico's Women Rule Summit in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58498821120000dd00eee376.jpeg?cache=vIKPHXTzsH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kellyanne Conway suggested on Wednesday that she would turn down an official role in the White House because of the strain it would put on her family. Conway, who managed Donald Trump’s campaign, added that she would continue to advise the president-elect.Conway did not, as some twisted media reports claimed, say that mothers generally shouldn’t work at the White House. Nor did she play the “woman card,” as one opinion columnist in The Washington Post tried to argue.But what she did say at “Women Rule,” a conference hosted by Politico, signals that the environment for women in the Trump administration will be difficult. Men are the ones who rule in Trumpland, which adheres to “traditional” male-female roles when it comes to work and family. Modern notions don’t seem to apply.Conway, who turns 50 on Inauguration Day, has four children under the age of 12 at home and a husband who works full time as a litigator at a prestigious law firm. Her choice makes sense. It’s also possible her comment was just an elegant ― and classic ― way to dump Trump. Leaving a job to “spend more time with family” is a time-honored politician dodge.Conway noted on Wednesday that Trump works all the time. “It’s a mystery to us when he actually sleeps,” she said, according to Politico. And although there are more and more opportunities for women in government and politics, she said there are limits to what women can do if they have kids.Then things get even more sad.From Politico:She recalled discussions about what role she could play in Trump’s administration, remarking that senior campaign officials would say, “I know you have four kids but …”It’s not all good, Kellyanne!There are other ways these senior officials could’ve fielded your question. They could have said: “Kellyanne, if my wife had the opportunity to work in a powerful position in the White House, I’d scale back my career for a few years and support her and take on more of the burden at home. Maybe your husband can do that.” Or, maybe they could say, “Kellyanne, you’ve been a key member of the team. We will make sure you get the flexibility to make this work.” Instead, their apparently uniform reaction makes it clear that in Trumpland, the burden of parenting always falls on the mother. She will always be the one to pull back at work. The idea that a mother could perhaps share parenting responsibilities with a partner or, god forbid, look to social policy for support is not on the table. There is only one table. Men sit at it. The end.This way of thinking is at the core of why U.S. women haven’t achieved anything resembling equality in the workplace. On average, women still make 80 cents for every $1 earned by a man. Women ― who make up half the population ― hold only 20 percent of the seats in the U.S. Congress. And while women hold nearly 52 percent of professional jobs in the U.S., there are only 21 female CEOs in the Fortune 500. That’s 4 percent.Trumpland thinking is what the Obama administration had been working to change both with policy ― efforts on equal pay and paid leave, for starters ― and within the White House itself.Conway’s comments are a flashing red sign ― a state essentially banning abortion because of the new administration is another ― that winter is coming for the women of this country. Of course, this shouldn’t be surprising. But it is, a little. Yes, Trump is the guy who bragged about grabbing women by the pussy because he can. And he has insulted women’s looks at every turn. Based on some of his older interviews, he also seems to think parenting is women’s work. “There’s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife, and you know, there’s a lot of husbands that listen to that,” he said in a 2005 radio interview that BuzzFeed unearthed. “I mean, I won’t do anything to take care of them. I’ll supply funds and she’ll take care of the kids. It’s not like I’m gonna be walking the kids down Central Park,” Trump said in an interview with Howard Stern that same year.Yet, Trump has also tried to portray himself as someone who advances women in the workplace. His website has a page titled “Donald J. Trump’s History of Empowering Women,” which was posted in October and offers anecdotes about how Trump encouraged and supported the women in his organization.His daughter Ivanka Trump also likes to market herself as a champion for #womenwhowork ― or at least women who make enough money to buy office apparel from her clothing line. And it was heartening that Conway, the first woman to run a Republican presidential campaign, had such a high-profile role. But her comments Wednesday were deflating.Conway lives in the wealthy enclave of Alpine, New Jersey, with her kids and her husband, a partner and litigator at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. It’s safe to assume he works nonstop. Her hesitation to do the same makes complete sense. Working in the White House is not a 9-to-5 gig. Anne-Marie Slaughter, who worked in the State Department for Hillary Clinton, wrote powerfully about her struggle to make that work in her famous essay “Why Women Still Can’t Have It All.”Anyone with young children can tell you raising kids is a full-time job. A draining, once-in-a lifetime, crucially important job. And if you want to work and raise a family ― or if you need to work, as so many American women do ― you have to make hard choices. That’s particularly true in the U.S. We live in a country that offers working families essentially no support. No paid maternity leave. No paid sick leave. A school day that ends in the middle of the workday. A horrifying daycare system. Countries that offer these benefits see the percentage of women entering the workforce go up. The U.S. is pretty low on the list of countries with high female labor force participation. The lack of support helps reinforce the gender pay gap, particularly at the top where the difference between what men and women earn is widest.These were not big issues for Trump on the trail, although Ivanka mentioned them at the Republican National Convention.Crucially, the workplace was structured by and for men ― although it’s changing somewhat ― and is rooted in the understanding that men will give their all to their job while someone else watches the kids. “Someone else” is typically the mom, of course.Now, the Obama administration understood this and made these issues a priority. There was a real effort at the policy level to advance the U.S. in terms of supporting working families. And although working parents in the White House didn’t have it easy, they were supported. President Barack Obama himself famously stopped working at 6:30 p.m. most nights so he could eat dinner with his kids.Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Obama and an outspoken advocate for changing how we think about work and family, later told the audience at the Politico event that she saw Conway backstage and tried to change her mind.“There are a lot of women who did raise young women in the White House,” Jarrett said. “I think tone starts at the top.”Yep."
