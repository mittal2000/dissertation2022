In the feature, which GQ published online Wednesday, the Grammy-nominated musician revealed that he’s learned to embrace the term “rapper” although he’s aware that rappers are sometimes looked down upon. “I hate that when you introduce yourself, and you’re a rapper, sometimes you gotta say, ‘I’m a musician.’ Or, ‘I’m an artist.’” Chance told the magazine. “I’m a rapper! You should be able to say that shit and, like, make someone scared in a good way. Like, ‘Oh shit, you might know the president!’ It should feel that way.”He also gave his input on everything from romance to “Make America Great Again.” He even went on to share his thoughts on fellow Chicagoan and controversial mentor Kanye West saying, “I don’t think I ever wanted to be like Kanye in personality.” The February issue of GQ magazine, which Chance also shares with The Weeknd, will be available on newsstands beginning January 24.

The recognition of the burial ground and two shooting sites is especially poignant following a year of horrifying gun violence and the months-long protest at the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.“These 24 new designations depict different threads of the American story that have been told through activism, architecture, music, and religious observance,” U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell said. “Their designation ensures future generations have the ability to learn from the past as we preserve and protect the historic value of these properties and the more than 2,500 other landmarks nationwide.”Receiving National Historic Landmark designation may provide properties with extra protections from development and may also make them eligible for preservation grants and technical preservation assistance. The Kent State shooting occurred on May 4, 1970, when the Ohio National Guard opened fire on unarmed college students protesting U.S. military operations in Cambodia. The officers killed four students and wounded nine others, setting off a national protest of more than 4 million students and ultimately shaping public opinion of the Vietnam War. The black civil rights activist Medgar Evers was assassinated outside his Jackson home in 1963. The Department of the Interior release notes that Evers “was the first nationally significant civil rights leader to be murdered.”Decades later, police brutality and violent attacks on the black community remain ongoing social justice issues in the U.S. The Wyandotte National Burying Ground, meanwhile, stands as “tangible evidence of the consequences of federal American Indian removal policy to a tribal population” and is associated with the movement to give federal protections to tribal burial grounds, DOI said. In 2016, threats to those protections resulted in a months-long protest at the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota, where tribe members said the planned Dakota Access oil pipeline would disturb sacred lands and burial grounds and possibly contaminate their water supply. The full list of newly designated National Historic Landmarks can be found here. "

Gov. Dan Patrick has introduced a bill to limit access to bathrooms for transgender people. He also wants to use local law enforcement to crack down on unauthorized immigration.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58755f3a1b00002c006e6bab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas ― The state legislative session opened on Tuesday, with a conservative majority promising to push hard-line immigration measures that dovetail with the harsh stance that carried President-elect Donald Trump to the White House. Texas Republicans have for years pushed the heavy-handed immigration enforcement policies Trump campaigned on. Now, emboldened by his win and holding a comfortable majority in both statehouse chambers, a growing number of these hard-liners stand to turn the state with the second-largest undocumented population into one of the country’s most eager collaborators with federal immigration authorities. Republicans have filed multiple bills that would cut state funds for “sanctuary cities,” which shield undocumented immigrants by limiting local cooperation with U.S. immigration authorities. One proposal would make local jurisdictions that defy a federal request to hold undocumented immigrants liable for damages for four years if the released person commits a felony (unless the victim is also undocumented). Another bill would increase jail time for undocumented immigrants convicted of a felony, with life sentences for first-degree offenses. Some Texas Republicans, like state Rep. Will Metcalf, look to Trump as a willing partner. “I think it is fantastic that we will have leadership at the federal level that finally starts enforcing our immigration laws,” Metcalf, who filed one of the anti-sanctuary city bills in the House, wrote in a statement to HuffPost. “It is incomprehensible to me that we allow political subdivisions to blatantly ignore state and federal laws.” Perhaps most worrisome for reformers, a growing number of conservatives want to repeal the state “Dream Act,” which allows undocumented immigrants to pay college tuition at the in-state rate. Last month, Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted a threat to cut funding to universities that try to keep immigration authorities off campus, contradicting a law that guarantees undocumented students’ access to state colleges. The hard line reflects the major shift in Republican attitudes about immigration over the last decade and a half. Back in 2001, then-Gov. Rick Perry signed the state Dream Act legislation, which sailed through both chambers with bipartisan support. Now, immigrant-rights defenders will be lucky to get through the six-month legislative session without a major defeat. Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans, campaigned with a get-tough stance on immigration, often casting the issue as a security threat. Patrick, who presides over the state Senate, has promised to prioritize immigration enforcement bills as part of a conservative agenda that also includes school-choice legislation and a law that would require people to use the bathroom of the gender they were assigned at birth. Much of the immigration legislation Texas will consider has failed in the past. Democratic legislators, more than half of them Hispanic, contend that the measures are a misguided distraction from working-class families’ concerns in a state with a constricted budget. “Trump Republicans are in it for themselves, while kids and workers fall victim to red-meat distractions,” Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement Tuesday. But this year, it will be harder for Democrats to stop the anti-immigrant push. The Texas Senate has rules that require a two-thirds majority to bring a bill to the floor for debate. But for this year’s session, the Republican majority dropped that requirement to three-fifths ― 19 votes in a body where the GOP holds 20 seats. That doesn’t mean Republican legislators will steamroll the opposition, though, according to political scientist Mark Jones. He said the GOP generally thinks that “some signal needs to be sent” on immigration because of the issue’s strong emotional tug on Republican voters. But at the same time, many moderate Republicans worry that staking out too strident a position on immigration will scare the business community and further repel Hispanic voters, who already lean Democratic in this majority-minority state. “The Republican Party isn’t unified in Texas regarding a hard-line stance on immigration,” Jones said. “There’s still a split within the party between those that have a hard-line view on immigration and those that have a more pragmatic, George W. Bush view on immigration.”If the more extreme measures on immigration fail to pass, it will likely be because moderates, like House Speaker Joe Straus (R-San Antonio), put up roadblocks or killed them before they could reach a vote, Jones said. Straus has long opposed the repeal of the state Dream Act. But with so much pressure from his party’s base and top leadership to deliver stricter immigration laws, Straus likely will make compromises. The question is what they will be. "

6,POLITICS,Trump’s EPA Pick Slammed State AGs For Trying To ‘Police The Global Warming Debate',Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-pruitt-climate-change-letter_us_5873d40fe4b099cdb0fea2f4,"As Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt took part in a “deeply disturbing” effort defending gas and oil companies against climate fraud allegations.",2017-01-11,"Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt in a meeting in Oklahoma City, July 29, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5873d4d41700008501928ff0.jpeg?cache=Zo3gJxwpRu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of state attorneys general announced last year that they were undertaking a probe into whether Exxon Mobil and other corporations misled investors and the public on the risks of climate change. But President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, appears to believe that the probe is stifling “debate” on the issue.Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, joined a dozen other Republican attorneys general in signing an open letter on June 15 that argued Exxon’s record on climate change is “not a question for the courts.” The letter, which The Huffington Post reported on earlier this year, was seemingly aimed at the AGs United for Clean Power group, which includes Democratic attorneys general from New York, Massachusetts and California.Pruitt and the Republican AGs argue that their Democratic counterparts’ probe “targets a particular type of market participant” in focusing only on Exxon Mobil and not similarly targeting clean energy companies or environmental advocacy nonprofits that could be “exaggerating” climate change risks to benefit their bottom line. The letter goes on to urge the Democratic AGs to “stop policing viewpoints” on climate change, describing the science of climate change as part of a “vigorous debate,” and alleging that the probe “chills” free speech by signaling that “one side of the climate change debate should fear prosecution.”A lengthy, multi-part investigation by InsideClimate News and The Los Angeles Times previously claimed, based on conversations with former Exxon employees and a review of company documents, that top Exxon executives knew as early as 1977 that fossil fuels contributed to global warming.Nevertheless, the investigation reports, the company pushed back against initiatives to cut greenhouse gas emissions as part of a campaign that environmentalists have compared to Big Tobacco's previous efforts to downplay the dangers of smoking.Kathy Mulvey, manager of the climate accountability campaign at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, described the letter’s assertions as “deeply disturbing” given the volume of evidence that fossil fuel companies like Exxon Mobil may have misled the public on climate change risks.“I think what we see in this letter and in the efforts by Exxon Mobil and its allies to block these investigations is a twisted interpretation of the first amendment,” Mulvey told The Huffington Post. “Attorneys general have a duty to defend the citizens of their state against fraudulent practices. That there would be an effort by colleagues to prevent even an investigation into these issues is alarming.”The letter was later a key subject of conversation during a closed-door session on climate change at a Republican Attorneys General Association summit in Colorado in July 2016.The Center for Media and Democracy confirmed that two signers of the letter, Pruitt and Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, both planned to participate in a panel titled “Climate Change Debate: How Speech is Being Stifled,” along with Myron Ebell, the climate-denying head of Trump’s EPA transition team and Chet Thompson, president of American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a powerful fossil fuel industry group.Pruitt did not ultimately appear on the panel due to an illness, according to a CMD transcript of the event, but Thompson took the opportunity to thank him and the letter’s other 12 signers for their “instrumental” work “speak[ing] up” for the oil and gas industry.That collaboration is just one example of a seemingly cozy relationship between Pruitt, other Republican attorneys general and the fossil fuel industry. As a 2014 New York Times investigation revealed, the group of Republican attorneys general appear to be a part of an “unprecedented, secretive alliance” with fossil fuel companies that has worked to fight environmental regulations regulations they reject as federal government overreach.Industry lobbyists actually drafted the letters Pruitt sent to the EPA and other federal departments objecting to various air pollution and other regulations, according to the Times report. In return, the oil and gas industry contributed more than $215,000 to Pruitt’s two most recent campaigns.Oil and gas industry groups have also helped fund the work of the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a nonprofit through which Pruitt and other Republican attorneys general coordinated multiple lawsuits targeting the EPA. One of the group’s funders, the Koch-backed Freedom Partners organization, donated at least $175,000 to the organization. Six Democrats on the Senate’s Environmental and Public Works Committee are pressing Pruitt for details on those ties.With Pruitt now set to lead the EPA ― as long as his confirmation hearing goes well, of course ― environmentalists fear that fossil fuel interests will have unprecedented access to the agency tasked with regulating it. The relationship could severely undermine efforts to reduce climate-changing emissions.But New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the other Democratic attorneys general leading the Exxon probe do not appear to be backing down.In a statement provided to HuffPost, Schneiderman said he is “proud to be leading a coalition of states that is already aggressively fighting back against efforts to reverse the progress this country has made in combating climate change over the past eight years.”Meanwhile, Exxon’s climate change record was back in the spotlight Wednesday morning as the confirmation hearing for Trump secretary of state nominee and former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson began. Tillerson refused to answer multiple questions on the matter.―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

The directing duo is said to be partnering with Annapurna Television on a new limited series called “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” ― and it’s a Western. That’s a genre the brothers already have plenty of experience with, thanks to past films “No Country for Old Men” and “True Grit,” although they are best known for other works like “The Big Lebowski” and “Fargo.” The latter was previously adapted by Noah Hawley into an FX series.The Coens wrote the “Buster Scruggs” script based on an original idea, and will direct it. The project will also be produced through their company, Mike Zoss Productions; Producer Megan Ellison (”Her”) and Annapurna president Sue Naegle have also signed on as executive producers, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “We are very excited to be working with Megan and Sue on this project,” the brothers said in a statement obtained by THR.At the moment, plot details for the miniseries are unknown, but Variety reports six different storylines will intertwine with each other. “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” is the latest project for Annapurna Television, which also has a series adaptation of Maria Semple’s novel Today Will Be Different on the way. That series will reportedly star Julia Roberts."

Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) on whether that means he would support the programs, he demurred, claiming he knows little about the policies beyond how much money is spent. “If confirmed, and I had the opportunity to examine all aspects of the program,” he said, when asked if he would support the continuation of the initiatives. “I just am aware that we do spend about half a billion dollars now.” In December, the Trump transition team set off a wave of panic at the State Department when it asked for information on staffing and funding for all of its programs on gender equality. Some believed this was the beginning of the end for these programs. The transition team issued a statement affirming its commitment to women’s rights.Still, that didn’t calm critics concerned with Trump’s history of disparaging comments toward women.Tillerson himself has spent his entire career at Exxon, a male-dominated company with a lousy track record on gay rights. Even today only 16 percent of managers at the oil giant are women and the company has fought off efforts to reveal data on whether it has a gender pay gap. It was only in 2015 that Exxon made benefits for employees with same-sex partners. At a time when most white-collar employers offer paid parental leave to all employees who welcome new children, Exxon only gives leave to women who physically give birth. Adoptive parents are not included. It’s not very clear where Tillerson stands on these issues. “I have seen firsthand the impact of empowering women, particularly empowering women’s participation in economic activities in the lesser developed part of the world,” Tillerson said Wednesday. “There is study after study to confirm that when you empower women in these developing parts of the world, you change the future of the country because you change the cycle in that family.”“Whether that woman has daughters or sons, when you empower women and see them participating on an economic level it changes the way they see things as they grow,” he added.Exxon Mobil’s new chief executive may want to take heed.

It follows government agent Major Motoko Kusanagi, a human-cyborg hybrid, as she chases down a mysterious computer hacker known as The Puppet Master. Fans of the original series were furious that Johansson was cast as Major Matoko Kusangi in the live-action version, produced by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks. It’s a blatant example of Hollywood whitewashing (yet again) a traditionally Japanese role, they said.Critics became even more frustrated when reports surfaced that the film’s producers were testing visual effects to make Johansson appear more Asian. Paramount admitted to the tests, but denied that any visual effects were used to alter Johansson’s appearance.Asian-American actresses, including “Fresh off the Boat” star Constance Wu, spoke out against the controversial casting and critics launched a petition demanding the film’s producers to consider an Asian actress for the role.Showings of the original “Ghost in the Shell” film will play more than a month ahead of the live-action film, which debuts in the U.S. on March 31. But its resurrection doesn’t seem to be in response to the backlash against the live-action film.When Lionsgate and Funimation announced the original film’s return to theaters, they also detailed plans to release a Blu-Ray collector’s edition of the anime film to the market on March 7.“‘Ghost in the Shell’ is truly a seminal work in anime cinema and it helped firmly establish a market for the genre with U.S. movie audiences,” Fumination founder and chief executive Gen Fukunaga said in a press release Monday. “We’re excited to be partnering with Lionsgate to bring the original ‘Ghost in the Shell’ movie back to U.S. theaters.”The original Japanese “Ghost in the Shell” film will air in theaters with English subtitles on Feb. 7, while the English-dubbed version of the anime film will play in theaters on Feb. 8. You can find a list of theaters featuring the film here.Below, watch a side-by-side comparison of “Ghost in the Shell’s” original 1995 anime film and the upcoming 2017 live-action version."
11,POLITICS,"Donald Trump Won't Divest From His Business Interests, Opening Door To Years Of Ethics Conflicts",Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-conflict-of-interest_us_587660f3e4b05b7a465cdf13,He will still retain an interest in the company.,2017-01-11,"Donald Trump and his family attend an official ribbon-cutting ceremony at the new Trump International Hotel in Washington on Oct. 26, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58766a971200002d00ad6fdd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he would place his two sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, in charge of his multibillion-dollar Trump Organization.“My two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company,” Trump said at a press conference in New York. “They are going to be running it in a very professional manner. They’re not going to discuss it with me.”Sheri Dillon, a financial adviser at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said at the event that Trump’s sons would have no business-related contact with their father while he serves as president, and the company will appoint an ethics adviser to oversee any possible conflicts. The president-elect and his daughter Ivanka Trump, whose husband will become a senior White House adviser, will resign all positions in the Trump Organization, Dillon said.Dillon added that the Trump Organization will not make any new foreign deals during his administration. The company will still pursue domestic deals.The decision to put his two adult sons in charge of his company while the president-elect maintains a financial stake in the business will do little to alleviate concerns about the conflicts of interest he will face in office.Norm Eisen, the top ethics adviser to President Barack Obama, laid out a simple test for Trump prior to the press conference.“Is he turning it over all to the trustee or not?” Eisen said. “Clean break, blind trust or equivalent as every president has done for four decades. If he fails that test, he’s failing the presidency, he’s failing the American people, he’s failing the Constitution and failing all of us.”Trump’s announcement falls far short of that standard. He will maintain a financial stake in his business, meaning that he will be subject to certain laws and constitutional provisions targeting financial conflicts of interest of the president of the United States.At the end of his press conference, the president-elect made clear to note that he would still maintain a stake in his company that he could return to later. “I hope at the end of eight years I’ll come back and say, ‘Oh, you did a good job,’” he said. “Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I’ll say, ‘You’re fired.’”Dillon said during the press conference that Trump did not pursue a sale of assets because any effort to sell the company would be hampered by the fact that its largest asset is the brand name associated with the president-elect.“Selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale,” Dillon said. “President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built.”She added that Trump could not pursue a blind trust, as he knows what he owns and which buildings have his name on them. This is a point that’s been made by ethics experts, who have advocated for Trump to appoint an independent trustee to sell his assets and put the proceeds into a true blind trust.Richard Painter, the former top ethics advisor to President George W. Bush, said that Trump’s plan for his business “does not work because he’s retained an ownership stake and all the existing conflicts of interest are in place.”“It’s completely unprecedented,” he added, noting that every other president has extricated themselves from their business conflicts, “except for this one.”Questions about Trump’s conflicts of interest related to his business holdings barely made noise during the presidential campaign. He was asked in debates and television interviews what he would do with his business if he won. “I would have nothing to do with my company,” he said in September. He floated handing off the business to his three adult children.After his victory on Nov. 8, it became readily apparent that Trump, his campaign and his business had no plans for how to extricate the president-elect from business conflicts. Numerous foreign business partners attended his election-night celebration. Two of his Indian business partners came to Trump Tower to pay their respects and try to solidify new deals with the man about to assume the highest office of the United States. Trump promoted one of his partners in a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.In a conversation with Nigel Farage, former head of the right wing anti-immigrant United Kingdom Independence Party, Trump asked Farage to agitate against offshore wind farms in Britain. Trump has long opposed the construction of a wind farm in the waters off one of his golf courses in Scotland because he feels it will ruin the view. Trump also appointed all three of his children to the executive committee of his presidential transition. In those positions, they helped direct policy, interviewed candidates for Cabinet positions and met with foreign dignitaries. These appointments mixed business roles with governmental and policy roles, making it impossible to avoid conflicts if any of the children were appointed to head the Trump Organization.In November, Trump angrily denounced those reporting on his financial conflicts of interest.And in an interview with The New York Times, Trump dismissed any concerns about conflicts of interest with his business by stating that it is not illegal if the president does it. “The law’s totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest,” Trump said.Conflict of interest rules mandate that Cabinet officials divest from holdings that would conflict with their official duties on behalf of the American people. Those rules do not apply to the president or the vice president.But since the adoption of these laws, every president has acted as though they have applied to their office. In addition, there are both laws and constitutional provisions that necessitate the divestment of certain business holdings to avoid legal conflicts.Trump’s failure to fully extricate himself from his business also means that he will remain as the beneficiary of his Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. The hotel’s lease with the General Services Administration specifically states that an “elected official of the Government of the United States” cannot “be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.” If Trump still retains a financial stake in the hotel, this means that he and his company will be in violation of his lease.Since the election, the hotel has pitched its expensive luxury rooms to foreign diplomats as a way to curry favor with the incoming Trump regime. Some foreign governments, including Bahrain and Azerbaijan, and corporate lobbying groups have since held events at the hotel.At the press conference Wednesday, Dillon announced that the Trump Organization will voluntarily direct all profits made from any foreign governments using any Trump hotel property to the U.S. Treasury. Dillon did not clarify if this meant the hotels would direct all payments to the Treasury, or only the profits.Trump initially announced plans for a Dec. 15 press conference solely devoted to laying out plans for the Trump Organization, but postponed it as it became clear that the task would be far more complicated than initially thought.The president-elect and his aides have made conflicting statements since then. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told CNN in December that “it’s a very unconventional situation.” But Trump said later in the month, “Honestly, it’s a very routine thing. It’s not a big deal. You people are making that a big deal — the business.”The reality is that the Trump Organization is actually just a string of interlocking LLCs that each individually own specific properties and specific debt. Many of these individual LLCs are linked to one of the more than two dozen foreign business deals Trump has been engaged in over the years.Beginning in December, the Trump Organization began to extricate itself from some foreign business deals. The company cancelled deals to license the Trump name to buildings in Brazil; Azerbaijan; Argentina; Georgia; and Pune, India.In Brazil, a federal prosecutor opened a criminal investigation into the real estate development company that sought to license the Trump name for a Trump Tower and Trump hotel. The plan to build a Trump-named building in Buenos Aires, Argentina, faced increased scrutiny after it was reported that Trump pressed President Mauricio Macri to help get the proper permits from the city government. Both Trump and Macri denied this topic of conversation coming up in their call. Even though these business deals were canceled, many others continue apace. Two Trump-named resorts are being developed in Indonesia by the developer Hary Tanoesoedibjo, who also runs his own political party in the world’s third-largest democracy. Tanoesoedibjo is reportedly coming to Trump’s inauguration to help solidify his business relationship with the Trump Organization.“I have to underline that it’s a business relationship,” Tanoesoedibjo told Bloomberg in an interview on Monday. “I’m sure when he becomes president, Mr. Trump, everything won’t be much different from now.”UPDATE: 6:45 p.m. ― Morgan Lewis released a white paper describing the plan to hand President-elect Donald Trump’s business to his two adult sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump.

The dad responded with a simple “thank you,” but then decided to follow-up with a snarky text. “Maybe your weather app will pay for your college,” he wrote.Chris posted the screenshot of the exchange on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for laughs, but he did not anticipate the hundreds of thousands of likes and reactions that would follow.Many teens and fellow meteorologists praised the dad’s sharp reply. Chris told The Huffington Post that Claire thinks the viral fame is “pretty cool.”“This text is just typical banter that I have with my daughter. It’s all in good fun,” he said.“I also think it struck a chord with many parents since many teens and young adults think they have all of the answers, even though their parent may be an ‘expert’ on certain subjects,” he added. “I’ve had doctors reach out to tell me that their kids often question them on health concerns in the family.”Chris said he believes parents should actually encourage their kids to ask questions and share their thoughts with them. He also hopes his viral story will inspire parents to connect with their kids and have fun with them in similar ways. It hasn’t all been positive though. “We are getting a good lesson in the power of social media ― we are learning that some people are judging and perceiving us and our relationship,” the dad explained. “Some have concluded that I have a bratty daughter, others have concluded that I’m a bad dad with this response. I can assure you my daughter is not bratty!”At the end of the day, one burning question remains: Did it snow or not?“We did get some snow in our zip code, but not as much as I was predicting,” Chris told HuffPost. “The app said no snow and it did snow a little.

Not Worried About Bathroom Bill Costing The State Money,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-bathroom-bill_us_587691fce4b092a6cae4ea22,But business leaders are.,2017-01-11,"Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick speaks at the Republican Party of Texas State Convention, May 12, 2016, in Dallas. He considers passing a North Carolina-style bathroom bill a priority.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587692ac120000c301ad70ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas ― Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) isn’t worried about scaring businesses away from his state with a bathroom bill widely viewed as hostile to transgender people. Speaking in an interview with Texas Tribune CEO Evan Smith Wednesday, Patrick repeatedly said the economic fallout from the proposal would be minimal, brushing off concerns that Texas would repeat the experience of North Carolina. When North Carolina passed a similar bill last year, legal fees, canceled events and lost tourism cost the state about $400 million over six months, according to Wired. A study by the Texas Association of Business found that Texas could jeopardize 180,000 jobs and cost the state $8.5 billion annually in lost business as a result of similar boycotts and companies refusing to set up shop here. But Patrick, who likened such businesses’ attitudes to “extortion,” said Texas will be fine.“I’m not concerned,” Patrick said, later adding: “Let’s say there is some economic impact. Are we for sale?” The proposal would require people in Texas schools and public facilities to use the bathroom that corresponds to the sex on their birth certificates. Any schools that adopt policies letting people use the bathroom that most closely matches their gender identity would face the threat of lawsuits and could be made to pay thousands of dollars in penalties.  Patrick insists the bill, which he helped craft with state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst (R-Brenham), is different from the controversial North Carolina measure. The Texas version doesn’t include the term “original birth certificate” ― an omission that Patrick says is meant to accommodate transgender people, who are permitted to change the sex on their birth certificates later in life. The only people who oppose the Texas bill are “Anglo liberals,” he said. “Why is it that you want to have this basic bill that says men shouldn’t be in ladies’ rooms and teenagers shouldn’t be showering together, and somehow you’re discriminating?” Patrick said. “When we introduce men into ladies’ rooms, we introduce a danger... It’s not the transgender community, because they can get their birth certificates changed if it’s legitimate.” But Mara Keisling, who heads the National Center for Transgender Equality, says the Texas bathroom bill is just as discriminatory as North Carolina’s. Keisling points out that the North Carolina bill doesn’t actually make a distinction between original and current birth certificates. A survey conducted by Keisling’s group in 2015 found that only 9 percent of trans people changed the sex on their birth certificates, generally because of the bureaucratic obstacles and costs. This essentially means that Texas’ bill would be targeting trans people to address a fabricated security threat, according to Keisling. “People aren’t coming home and saying, ‘Honey, we have to do something about this transgender-people-in-the-bathroom problem,’” Keisling told The Huffington Post. “People want their public officials to work on important things. They don’t want them to pick on transgender people over a non-issue, to hurt children on a non-issue.”Patrick presides over the Texas state Senate and has named the bathroom bill among his priorities for the year. Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature as well as the governorship, but the bill might face opposition from moderate Republicans in the House of Representatives concerned about harming the state’s business environment.

20,SPORTS,Don't You Dare Sell The Atlanta Falcons Short!,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/atlanta-falcons-underrated_us_586fd247e4b02b5f8588925c,"With bets raining down for the Patriots and Packers, nobody is talking about the equally dangerous Dirty Birds.",2017-01-11,Wide receiver Julio Jones (left) and quarterback Matt Ryan both earned First-Team All-Pro honors this season.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586fef331700002500928945.jpeg?cache=gZgxKeWj8w&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Heading into the NFL Playoffs last weekend, the New England Patriots were the clearcut Super Bowl favorite, according to Las Vegas oddsmakers. With the Pats listed at 7-5, Dallas came in at 7-2, followed by red-hot Green Bay at 8-1.The Atlanta Falcons, meanwhile, were listed at 10-1, alongside perennial playoff disappointment Kansas City. Hardly any action has come in on the Falcons either.To be sure, Las Vegas spreads are not the barometer for postseason success ― they’re merely designed to drum up equal betting action on both sides. But they do tell us which teams are being ignored by the betting public, and Atlanta is certainly one of them. And that seems dumbfounding ― as I’ve written before ― when we examine the Falcons.Atlanta, the NFC South champs and second-seeded in the conference, is set to host (and seek revenge) against NFC West winners Seattle in the Divisional Round on Saturday.From an offensive standpoint, Atlanta may be the most lethally balanced unit in the league. First Team All-Pro quarterback Matt Ryan ranks second in the NFL with 38 touchdowns ― eclipsed only by Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers ― and he has the best passer rating in the game at a robust 117.1. And he’s achieved all this while heaving the ball down the field: Ryan leads this season in yards per attempt. The next closest quarterback, fellow MVP candidate Tom Brady, trails him by more than a full yard.In fact, ESPN reports, “Ryan completed 30 of 60 passes thrown 20 or more yards in the air down the field for 1,116 yards with 10 touchdowns and no interceptions.” According to ESPN, only the Colts’ Andrew Luck and the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson have better completion rates this season.Of course, the knock on Ryan in years past has been his slew of turnovers, particularly in critical situations. Last year for example, he trailed only New York’s Eli Manning with six red-zone interceptions, according to Pro Football Focus. This season, however, Ryan has limited his mistakes, tossing just seven picks (one in the red zone) and ranking third behind Rodgers and New Orleans’ Drew Brees in red-zone efficiency.Ryan’s prowess is undoubtedly due in part to the spectacular play of wide receiver Julio Jones. The 27-year-old Jones is second in the league in both receiving yards (1,409) and 20-plus yard catches (27). His average of 100.6 yards per game ranks first, and he has dropped just three balls over a staggering 125 times as the targeted receiver.If we go back to 2012 ― when Atlanta was merely one short completion away from the Super Bowl ― we see that the offense was buoyed by a balanced attack. Roddy White remained a viable second option alongside Jones, and tight end Tony Gonzalez was a First-Team All-Pro. This year’s Falcons roster doesn’t possess a player like the future Hall of Famer Gonzalez, but the 11-5 team has fielded a quartet of receiving threats other than Jones. Free agent acquisition Mohamed Sanu is a productive big body inside the 20s, while Tevin Coleman (421 receiving yards) and Devonta Freeman (54 receptions) are two of the premier pass-catching backs in pro football. Freeman, the back-to-back Pro Bowler, lacks no confidence and boasts a 4.8 rushing average, along with 13 total touchdowns.Perhaps the real surprise has been the 5-foot-8-inch speed demon Taylor Gabriel, who went undrafted in 2014. More recently, the third-year man out of little-known FCS Abilene Christian had been cut by the lowly Cleveland Browns. But after amassing just eight catches through Atlanta’s first eight games this year, Gabriel ― who’s not unlike the Chiefs’ Tyreek Hill in dynamic ability ― caught fire, totaling 27 catches over the last eight games. His main contribution could be his explosiveness: He has seven total touchdowns, including individual plays of 47, 26, 76, 35, 64, 31 and 27 yards. In fact, Gabriel’s 18 percent touchdown rate would be tops in the NFL if he had the qualified number of touches.That being said, maybe the biggest reason why the public seems to underrate the Falcons is its defensive unit, which ranks just 25th in total defense and 27th in opposition scoring. And that’s a fair complaint.But it’s not as if this defense lacks a slew of talented playmakers. (That was more of a glaring issue during the 2015 campaign.)While Pro Bowl cornerback Desmond Trufant has been lost for the year with a shoulder injury, second-year edge rusher Vic Beasley Jr. earned First-Team All-Pro honors and leads the NFL with 15.5 sacks. He is a viable Defensive Player of the Year candidate.Additionally, standout rookies Keanu Neal and Deion Jones both have over 100 tackles, including more than 70 solo. Neal, a highly touted first-rounder out of Florida, has received more publicity because of his five forced fumbles, while Jones has three picks, two of which he returned for touchdowns.“They have a real knack for the football,” head coach Dan Quinn said during his team’s playoff bye week.Better yet, Neal and Jones clearly pass Quinn’s “CT grade,” which he described to The Huffington Post last season. “[General manager Thomas Dimitroff] and I both think that toughness is a talent,” Quinn said. “You have to be freed up mentally so you can make full-speed decisions. We love when we see that in guys. ... We grade guys on a ‘CT’ [competitive and toughness] grade, and that means something to me.” With a dominant offense and an opportunistic, if not spectacular, defense, Atlanta has as good a chance as anyone to run the table in the NFL’s single-elimination tournament. The NFC in particular appears wide open, with question marks surrounding Dak Prescott and top-seeded Dallas, along with the struggling Seahawks and streaking Packers. But the bottom line could be Ryan. This is a quarterback-driven league, and the Falcons may have the league MVP in him.CORRECTION: The Atlanta Falcons are this season’s NFC South champions, not the NFC North champions.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report."
21,SPORTS,Don't You Dare Sell The Atlanta Falcons Short!,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/atlanta-falcons-underrated_us_586fd247e4b02b5f8588925c,"With bets raining down for the Patriots and Packers, nobody is talking about the equally dangerous Dirty Birds.",2017-01-11,"Matt Ryan, the 31-year-old quarterback, tossed 38 touchdowns this season and is a front-runner for league MVP.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586ff74c1200002d00ad613b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Heading into the NFL Playoffs last weekend, the New England Patriots were the clearcut Super Bowl favorite, according to Las Vegas oddsmakers. With the Pats listed at 7-5, Dallas came in at 7-2, followed by red-hot Green Bay at 8-1.The Atlanta Falcons, meanwhile, were listed at 10-1, alongside perennial playoff disappointment Kansas City. Hardly any action has come in on the Falcons either.To be sure, Las Vegas spreads are not the barometer for postseason success ― they’re merely designed to drum up equal betting action on both sides. But they do tell us which teams are being ignored by the betting public, and Atlanta is certainly one of them. And that seems dumbfounding ― as I’ve written before ― when we examine the Falcons.Atlanta, the NFC South champs and second-seeded in the conference, is set to host (and seek revenge) against NFC West winners Seattle in the Divisional Round on Saturday.From an offensive standpoint, Atlanta may be the most lethally balanced unit in the league. First Team All-Pro quarterback Matt Ryan ranks second in the NFL with 38 touchdowns ― eclipsed only by Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers ― and he has the best passer rating in the game at a robust 117.1. And he’s achieved all this while heaving the ball down the field: Ryan leads this season in yards per attempt. The next closest quarterback, fellow MVP candidate Tom Brady, trails him by more than a full yard.In fact, ESPN reports, “Ryan completed 30 of 60 passes thrown 20 or more yards in the air down the field for 1,116 yards with 10 touchdowns and no interceptions.” According to ESPN, only the Colts’ Andrew Luck and the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson have better completion rates this season.Of course, the knock on Ryan in years past has been his slew of turnovers, particularly in critical situations. Last year for example, he trailed only New York’s Eli Manning with six red-zone interceptions, according to Pro Football Focus. This season, however, Ryan has limited his mistakes, tossing just seven picks (one in the red zone) and ranking third behind Rodgers and New Orleans’ Drew Brees in red-zone efficiency.Ryan’s prowess is undoubtedly due in part to the spectacular play of wide receiver Julio Jones. The 27-year-old Jones is second in the league in both receiving yards (1,409) and 20-plus yard catches (27). His average of 100.6 yards per game ranks first, and he has dropped just three balls over a staggering 125 times as the targeted receiver.If we go back to 2012 ― when Atlanta was merely one short completion away from the Super Bowl ― we see that the offense was buoyed by a balanced attack.

22,POLITICS,Obama Supporters Gather To Look Back On Once-In-A-Lifetime Presidency,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-chicago-farewell_us_5875bedde4b05b7a465c77a8,President Barack Obama delivered one last message of hope before a hometown crowd.,2017-01-11,"Andrea and Carol Bercos, in the shirts they wore at President Barack Obama's 2008 election night victory celebration in Chicago, hold bumper stickers from 2008 during the president's farewell address, Jan. 10, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5875c9221b00002c006e6cf7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CHICAGO — Andrea Bercos stood arm in arm with her mother Tuesday night, ready to say goodbye to President Barack Obama the same way they greeted him eight years ago in Chicago’s Grant Park ― tearful, hopeful and wearing blue shirts that read “Change.”The 38-year-old social worker and her 65-year-old mother, Carol, were among the thousands of people who poured into the McCormick Place convention center Tuesday to mark the end of the Obama era. “It’s so amazing and sad, really,” Carol, a retired social worker from Libertyville, Illinois, said through tears. “I never thought I’d see a candidate like him in my lifetime.” Carol was inspired by the inclusive message of Obama’s presidency ― something reflected in the ages, identities and races of the supporters Tuesday night ― but less optimistic about what a Donald Trump administration may hold. She said she worries about the support for issues like immigration and marriage equality and laments what she called a “sexual predator mentality that is now the norm.”Seeing Obama one last time as president is something of a salve.“I’m excited that I get to see my hero,” Carol said.Excitement was the dominant emotion throughout the night, along with feelings of bittersweetness. Supporters considered the difference in tone and tact that a Trump presidency will likely have in contrast to Obama’s, but their moods rarely darkened at the thought.Instead, supporters like Anita President (”That’s my real name!” she said), who was serving as a volunteer usher, said they were encouraged to be optimistic because of the positive tone Obama was setting as he departs. “I’m trying to stay hopeful and prayerful that a lot of [Trump’s] talk is just rhetoric,” she said as she steered attendees into lines.President said she attended Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago when the Obamas were parishioners, and has followed his career. Tuesday night she proudly wore an Obama T-shirt that she bought when she came to the venue on Saturday to pick up a free ticket to the event. “I know it’s a historic thing. I know I’ll never see something like this in my lifetime again,” President said. Fatima Mohammad of Bolingbrook, Illinois, was aware of the historic nature of the event and brought her young children. The entire family wore matching T-shirts that read, “The Mohammads came to say goodbye to Obama.”“I wanted the names of two great men next to each other,” the 33-year-old said, adding, ”I’m very happy we got to experience him as the president.” Mohammad said she liked Obama’s message of inclusiveness and respect, and that she finds Trump more distasteful than worrisome.“We are where we are,” she said. “I’m not exactly sure what he’ll be like. Is he going to treat everyone the same?”Despite Trump’s often bigoted remarks about Muslims and other groups, Mohammad suggested her outlook was more optimistic because of her faith in the strength of American democracy.Jerry Hunt, a 25-year-old Marine from suburban University Park, Illinois, said he’s trying to maintain a hopeful outlook. Hunt was just a sophomore in high school when he hopped the train to the city to see Obama’s election night victory in 2008.“It opened my eyes to a whole new world,” Hunt said. “It influenced me. I wasn’t always into politics, but I was spoiled — having the first African-American president so young.”He said he’s saving his ticket from Tuesday’s farewell address to give to his children someday.Hunt, who said he was able to discuss political matters more freely now that he’s finished his military service, said he would take a “wait and see” approach to Trump.“I think we’re gonna give him the chance Republicans didn’t give Obama and see what he does,” he said.Supporters who were interviewed largely agreed that health care would be Obama’s biggest legacy from a policy standpoint. They predicted that his legacy would withstand political tinkering by the new Republican-controlled Congress; they were more concerned that the law itself would not. Linda K., who volunteered for Obama back in 2007, noted that her grandson who was born with a pre-existing condition was able to get corrective surgery under the Affordable Care Act that he would not have had otherwise.While she feels undeniably positive toward Obama for passing the law, she said she admires the president’s behavior as much as his actions. “He wasn’t just change ― he was change from a less-than-well-prepared president,” Linda said, referring to Obama’s predecessor, President George W. Bush. “Obama was an intelligent, wise and dignified person,” she added. “That’s why I wanted to be here tonight. I wanted to witness history. I wanted to hear what he had to say.” "
23,POLITICS,New York May Finally Do Something About Its Awful Voting Process,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andrew-cuomo-new-york-early-voting_us_587549bde4b03c8a02d3aed5,The proposed changes include early voting and same-day voter registration.,2017-01-10,New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) wants to bring early voting and same-day voter registration to his state.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58754d7c1200002d00ad6cd7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is proposing a series of changes aimed at making it easier to vote in his state after a disastrous primary election in 2016.The proposed changes include implementing early voting in every New York county at least 12 days before the election and providing one polling site for every 50,000 residents. Cuomo is also pushing for automatic and same-day voter registration. New York is one of 13 states that does not have early voting and requires voters to provide a special reason to obtain an absentee ballot.Cuomo also proposed that New Yorkers automatically be registered to vote when they submit an application to the DMV, with an option to opt out. A similar approach in Oregon has produced an increase in registered voters.New York has a closed party system and if residents wanted to change their party ahead of the 2016 primary, they had to do it at least six months in advance. The rules prevented many independents who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) from voting for him in the Democratic primary. Nearly 126,000 voters found they had been purged from the voting rolls in New York City during the April primary.“Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy. This past election shined a bright light on the deficiencies of New York’s antiquated election laws and the artificial barriers they create that prevent and discourage voters from exercising this sacred right,” Cuomo said in a statement on Sunday. “These proposals will modernize and open up our election system, making it easier for more voters to participate in the process and helping to make a more fair, more just and more representative New York for all.”Cuomo proposed early voting and same-day registration in his budget last year, but it was never implemented, according to the New York Daily News.The proposal to expand voting access comes at a time when Republicans around the country are pushing voter ID measures that make it disproportionately more difficult for minorities and low-income Americans to vote. It also comes at a time in which Cuomo has moved to raise his national profile.The New York Republican Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D) praised the proposal and noted in a Sunday statement that his office’s election hotline had received the most comments in its history.“There is no good reason New York lags the country, lacking early voting, same day voter registration, and streamlined online voter registration,” he said. “On Primary Day last year, my office’s voter hotline received ten times more voter complaints than anytime in history, with over 1,500 New Yorkers reporting cases of long lines, inaccurate voter rolls, and confusing and inconsistent policies at polling places across New York. That needs to change.” Common Cause New York, a government watchdog group, urged Cuomo to act unilaterally to implement the changes. “We note that Governor Cuomo has once again expressed his support for improving our state’s election administration, joining the growing momentum here in New York to improve the voter experience and expand voting rights,” Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York said in a statement. “While we look forward to working with the Governor and the legislature in the new session to see a package of voting reforms become law, we urge the Governor to consider following the lead of Connecticut, where their Secretary of State established automatic voter registration administratively, without legislative delays.”"

The new policy, which will go into effect at the start of February, permits new recruits to have tattoos fully covering their chest, back, arms and/or legs, according to a statement that the Air Force released Monday. A “25 percent” rule had previously restricted Air Force personnel. It meant tattoos could not cover more than 25 percent of the body part the ink was on without written approval from a service member’s commander. “As part of our effort to attract and retain as many qualified Airmen as possible we periodically review our accessions policies,” Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement. “In this instance, we identified specific changes we can make to allow more members of our nation to serve without compromising quality.”The relaxed policy still comes with some basic restrictions. Personnel cannot have tattoos associated with gangs or extremist groups, or ones that advocate any kind of discrimination. The Air Force also bans face, neck, and head tattoos.“We are always looking at our policies and, when appropriate, adjusting them to ensure a broad scope of individuals are eligible to serve,” Chief Master Sgt. James A. Cody said in the statement. “These changes allow the Air Force to aggressively recruit talented and capable Americans who until now might not have been able to serve our country in uniform.”The new policy comes on the heels of the U.S. Army’s decision last week to allow servicemen and women at the brigade level to wear turbans, beards, and hijabs in accordance with their faith.“Based on the successful examples of Soldiers currently serving with these accommodations, I have determined that brigade-level commanders may approve requests for these accommodations,” wrote Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning in a letter announcing the decision."

Volkswagen said with the addition of the fine, its diesel costs will exceed the nearly 18.2 billion euros ($19.2 billion) it has set aside to handle the problem. VW also said it will face oversight by an independent monitor over the next three years.Reuters reported earlier the company’s supervisory board is set to meet on Wednesday to approve a civil and criminal settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over the automaker’s diesel emissions. VW said the supervisory board and the management board would meet Tuesday or possibly Wednesday to approve the deal.VW is expected to plead guilty as part of the settlement as early as Wednesday, a source familiar with matter said. The plea deal will need the approval of a U.S. judge.Evercore ISI said in a research note it believes the “settlement is intended to draw a line under all remaining U.S. related legal risk. This is good news.”VW had raced to get a deal done before President Barack Obama leaves office on Jan. 20. A change in administration could have delayed a final settlement for months if not longer.“The most important news is that VW managed to come to an agreement that allows the company to move on from here. It’s a major relief that this doesn’t get dragged into the new U.S. administration,” Evercore ISI said.VW admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner than they were on the road, and that as many as 11 million vehicles could have similar software installed worldwide.On Monday, a VW executive, Oliver Schmidt, the second VW employee charged by U.S. prosecutors, was accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States over the company’s emissions cheating and the automaker was accused of concealing the cheating from regulators.The Justice Department settlement with VW will not end the Justice Department’s investigation into individual misconduct and more executives may face charges, sources said.VW still must spend the next two years buying back or fixing dirty U.S. vehicles and faces unresolved lawsuits from U.S. investors and about 20 U.S. states.Volkswagen’s expected guilty plea is in contrast to Justice Department deferred prosecution agreements with Toyota Motor Corp and General Motors Co, which were both accused of misleading regulators or consumers and paid fines of $1.2 billion and $900 million, respectively, but were not required to plead guilty.VW warned in a financial disclosure the impact of the U.S. settlement on 2016 group results cannot be quantified yet, citing “various further factors.”VW said in late October it expected the group operating margin to come in at the upper end of a 5 to 6 percent target range before one-off items, compared with 6 percent in 2015.The carmaker is due to announce 2016 results on March 14.Separately, Porsche SE, the main shareholder of VW, issued a profit warning after the VW news.The settlement on U.S. criminal and civil fines will negatively affect Porsche SE’s results for 2016, the company said, adding it is possible the net result may drop below the previously reported range of 1.4-2.4 billion euros.Volkswagen had previously agreed to spend up to $17.5 billion in the United States to resolve claims by U.S. regulators, owners and dealers and offered to buy back nearly 500,000 polluting vehicles.Much of the company’s senior management departed following the scandal, including chief executive Martin Winterkorn.VW Group said on Tuesday it had record sales in 2016 of 10.3 million vehicles, including a 12 percent increase in December. That figure should put VW ahead of Japanese rival Toyota Motor as the world’s largest car producer by volume for the year.On Monday, VW shares rose 4.2 percent to their highest since September 2015 on optimism about the expected U.S. criminal settlement, topping the German blue-chip DAX index. The shares are still 10 percent below pre-scandal levels.VW shares closed up less than 0.2 percent in trading Tuesday in Frankfurt before the company’s announcement.(Reporting by David Shepardson in Detroit, Andreas Cremer in Berlin and Ilona Wissenbach in frankfurt; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Jeffrey Benkoe and Bernard Orr)"

GOP leaders argue this budget is just to repeal Obamacare, not to lay out a fiscal blueprint, which is why they took debt projections in line with those from the Congressional Budget Office. But conservatives are worried about the message of rubber-stamping so much new debt.They’re also worried Republican leaders are rushing a repeal vote without discussing details of their alternative.On Monday night, the Freedom Caucus emerged from a weekly meeting saying they would urge leaders to delay the vote.“It’s like saying, ‘I’m going to get in that taxi and make good time, but I don’t know where I’m going,’” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the Freedom Caucus. “I want to know where I’m going.”On Tuesday morning after the conference meeting, however, Meadows was a bit softer about where things stand.“It is our hope that there will be a lot more specifics that are answered,” he said. “If those specifics are answered, we’re willing to vote today.”Meadows repeated his call for details on a replacement and the process for that legislation, such as “when are we going to repeal, when we’re going to replace, how long is that process going to take.”“We just need to make some decisions that perhaps are difficult,” Meadows said, “but we need to go ahead and make those decisions now as a conference.”Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the former Freedom Caucus chairman who still meets with leadership every week as a representative of the group, said there is still a chance House Republicans will delay the Friday repeal vote.“That’s the calendar, but we’ll be talking about that,” Jordan told The Huffington Post.GOP leadership appears to be seizing on the overwhelming consensus among Republicans that they want to replace Obamacare while ignoring the disagreement over what to replace it with.The No. 4 House Republican, Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), said Tuesday during a leadership press conference that “no one who has coverage because of Obamacare today will lose that coverage.” She also said Republicans would “protect coverage for people with pre-existing conditions” and that “our sons and daughters can stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re 26.”That plan sounds a lot like the current version of Obamacare, though there could be a vast difference between protecting coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and ensuring that their premiums and deductibles don’t skyrocket under a new plan with high-risk pools.Still, it’s much closer to Obamacare than the plans conservatives seem to favor. If you listen to Freedom Caucus member Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), Republicans don’t need to do much ― or anything ― after repealing Obamacare because the system before the 2010 overhaul would come back.“As a matter of law, if there is a repeal, then we revert back to the best health care system the world has ever known, and that’s the health care system America had in 2008,” Brooks said Tuesday.Pressed that the health care system has dramatically changed in those intervening years, and that millions of people would lose their health insurance and people with pre-existing conditions potentially wouldn’t be offered plans, Brooks said other people would see their cost of insurance drop.“There are pros and cons to everything,” he said. “So the question is: Do you want to continue to force Americans who work for a living to pay for the health care of those who don’t work for a living or don’t work well enough to pay for their own needs?”Between those very different ends of the Republican spectrum ― one that generally agrees with the basic tenets of Obamacare, and another that believes the problem of insurers not offering sick people health care plans is that those people don’t work hard enough ― leaders are trying to find 218 votes in the House, and, eventually, 60 votes in the Senate.But the first step is upheaving the health insurance market with a speedy repeal before Congress can ever hold a hearing.Laura Barron-Lopez contributed reporting."

Of Utah, Planned Parenthood Help 3,000 Women Get Birth Control",Jenavieve Hatch,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/univ-of-utah-planned-parenthood-help-3000-women-get-birth-control_us_5874eb6fe4b02b5f858b0ab2,"And they plan to help 4,000 more before March.",2017-01-10,Rep. Jason Chaffetz and Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards shake hands during Richards' September 2015 testimony. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5874f4491b00002c006e695a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Planned Parenthood has teamed up with the Univ. of Utah to provide free birth control access for Utah women. The HER Salt Lake Contraceptive Initiative will work with three participating health centers in the Salt Lake area to provide contraceptive education and access for women. The HER initiative began in 2015 as a contraceptive counseling and education program ― and in March of 2016, the initiative was changed to not only counsel and educate women about their options, but to provide contraception free of charge.HER Salt Lake has set a goal of providing birth control to 7,000 women in the state ― according to the Daily Utah Chronicle, the initiative has thus far provided contraception for 3,000 women. “We know that birth control is not one-size-fits-all and that people may need to switch methods to find the best birth control for themselves,” HER representative Kyl Myers told the Chronicle. “So HER Salt Lake helps participating patients continue or switch methods, for free, for up to three years.” Women can access their free contraception through HER until March 2017.The program is funded by both Univ. of Utah and Planned Parenthood, and has partnered with other research funds and foundations, like ANSIRH and Society of Family Planning. A partnership between Planned Parenthood and a public, Utah-based university may seem surprising considering Utah legislators’ hostility toward Planned Parenthood and reproductive health care access ― in September 2015, Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz was one of the most outspoken members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee during the testimony of Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards. The testimony came about after heavily edited videos, produced by the anti-abortion rights group Center for Medical Progress, went viral that summer. On top of Planned Parenthood animosity, Utah lawmakers have attempted on more than one occasion to make it more difficult to access abortion. In March of 2016, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed legislation requiring all women who have an abortion after 20 weeks to receive anesthesia. And just last month, two Republican state representatives announced that they are trying to pass a law that will force doctors to tell patients that the “abortion pill” (a medical abortion) is reversible. Similar anti-abortion legislations should take note of the HER initiative ― after all, research shows that access to contraception significantly lowers the rate of unplanned pregnancies and abortion.According to FiveThirtyEight, abortion rates in many states have fallen over the years ― arguably thanks to the Affordable Care Act’s contraception mandate that makes birth control more accessible for women. And, in Colorado, where free IUDs were provided over a six-year period, the teen pregnancy rate lowered significantly. The New York Times called Colorado’s effort a “startling success.”Read more about (or donate to) to the HER initiative here.

America can be “defined by one word,” Biden said. “Possibilities.”“It’s all about possibilities. Stamped in the DNA of every naturalized American citizen, and native-born, is the notion that nothing is beyond our reach,” he continued. “Think of any other country in the world where there’s less regard for orthodoxy than here. It’s a good thing. You can’t make new things unless you break the old things.”Biden also credited immigration as one of the fundamental building blocks of the country. He said immigrants who come to the U.S. in search of better opportunities have “enormous courage, an incredible sense of optimism and absolute determination that they will succeed ― all the features, if you go around the world as I do, that are used by others to define who Americans are.”Biden stopped in Detroit ahead of his trip to Chicago for President Barack Obama’s farewell address on Tuesday evening. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan invited the vice president to speak at a ceremony for the latest round of winners in the Motor City Match program, which offers grants to small businesses that open or expand in the city. Fifteen winners received a total of $600,000, partially funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Duggan said Tuesday.Duggan said his relationship with Biden was “the luckiest thing that happened” to him, and thanked the vice president for his efforts to help the city as it went through Chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings that lasted most of the mayor’s first year in office.“The president calls me ‘the vice president of Detroit,’” Biden quipped later. Biden touted the White House’s efforts to stimulate the economy and said he was was one of the early champions of the initially unpopular auto industry bailout ― a reminder of the Obama administration’s role saving auto jobs as President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly takes credit for manufacturers keeping jobs in the U.S.“One of the things I’m most proud of is this city, like the country, has come back in the last eight years,” Biden said. “Because of the grit and determination of the American people ― there’s no quit in America, it does not exist ― we’ve gone from crisis to … resurgence.”“We never bend, we never break, we always endure, we always overcome, we always move forward,” he added. “That’s America, and Detroit is a single shining example, when you think of any one place in America, to demonstrate that that’s who we are.”"

President-elect Donald Trump lashed Meryl Streep as “over-rated” after she sharply criticized his “bullying” as she accepted an award Sunday. But as recently as 2015 he named her as one of his favorite actresses.Asked in a Hollywood Reporter interview in August 2015 if there were any actresses he “loved,” Trump named Julia Roberts and Streep. “Meryl Streep is excellent; she’s a fine person, too,” Trump said. That regard dissolved into a vicious Twitter tirade against the star after Streep took him to task for his anti-immigrant stance and his apparent mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter at a campaign rally. He blasted Streep as a “Hillary flunky” and “one of the most over-rated actresses of her time.” Trump also insisted he didn’t mock the reporter (”would never do that,” he tweeted), but only showed the journalist “groveling.”Streep was honored at the 2017 Golden Globes with a Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award. She has been nominated over her career for 19 Academy Awards, more than any other actress, winning three. Streep has also won two British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards and eight competitive Golden Globes honors, among several other honors.Trump also slammed hit Broadway musical “Hamilton” as “overrated” in November after cast members made a case to audience member Vice President-elect Mike Pence for protecting American diversity. The musical won 11 Tony Awards in 2016, the second-most ever won by a single play in the history of American theater.CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that Pence was booed by the “Hamilton” cast; he was booed by members of the audience."

He killed nine congregation members who were attending a Bible study there, and admitted his guilt to FBI agents after being arrested. “I am guilty,” he said during a two-hour talk with agents, a video of which was shown to jurors. “We all know I’m guilty.”Roof didn’t show any remorse as he spoke to jurors during his closing arguments on Tuesday. “I felt like I had to do it, and I still feel like I had to do it,” he said, adding that he didn’t know “what good that would do” to ask for life in prison. Prosecutors have asked the jury to give Roof the death penalty. If jurors don’t unanimously determine to do so, he automatically will be given a life sentence.“They welcomed a 13th person that night ... with a kind word, a Bible, a handout and a chair,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson said during his closing argument at Roof’s sentencing. “He had come with a hateful heart and a Glock .45.”Roof killed Cynthia Hurd, Ethel Lance, Susie Jackson, Daniel Simmons, Tywanza Sanders, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, DePayne Middleton-Doctor, Myra Thompson and Clementa Pinckney, who was the pastor of the church.

The CEOs agreed to take steps to help give unemployed job seekers ""a fair shot.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586ff0d1170000250092894e.jpeg?ops=crop_11_60_2989_1645%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"This piece is part of a series on Obama’s legacy that The Huffington Post will be publishing over the next week.WASHINGTON ― After President-elect Donald Trump successfully bullied a manufacturing firm into keeping a plant in the United States last November, some people wondered why President Barack Obama hadn’t similarly made an example out of a business or two and taken a stand for workers. Actually, he had ― though in ways that exemplify the difference between ragey Trump and calm, consensus-loving Obama.One example is how Obama approached the problem of prolonged joblessness, a signature economic challenge of the Obama era. The president frequently highlighted the suffering of laid-off workers, but some companies decided that they just didn’t want to hire the jobless. The phenomenon first cropped up in 2010 with job listings that specified applicants “must be currently employed.”Democrats, including Obama, proposed outlawing such ads ― an idea that had no hope of garnering Republican support or becoming law. A ban on such discriminatory ads would have been ineffective anyway, since employers can easily screen the unemployed without being explicit about it.So Obama used the White House megaphone.“I’m challenging CEOs from some of America’s best companies to hire more Americans who’ve got what it takes to fill that job opening but have been laid off so long no one will give their résumé an honest look,” Obama said in a July 2013 speech.Instead of calling out specific companies for their callous hiring practices, six months later Obama hosted a bunch of CEOs and a formerly unemployed worker at the White House. Several dozen executives signed a pledge saying they would commit to hiring unemployed people, or at least commit to not not hire them specifically because they’re unemployed. The pledge was nonbinding, its results difficult to verify.The following October, the White House said one company, the telecom firm Frontier Communications, hired more than 250 unemployed people after signing the pledge. (The company declined to make any hirees available for an interview for this story.)Obama’s symbolic effort to make companies hire the jobless may have been inconsequential ― which is, of course, the trouble with symbolic gestures.Far more consequential was his effort to get a massive spending bill through Congress in the early days of his administration, which included money for unemployment benefits, infrastructure projects and tax cuts. Many, but not all, economists credit the stimulus for helping prevent a full-blown economic depression.The economy turned around and unemployment fell in Obama’s first term, but there was still a significant problem. Many of the new jobs came in low-paying industries like retail and restaurants. From 2010 to 2013, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported this year, the national economy added far fewer middle-wage jobs than either high-paying or low-paying ones ― a “job polarization” scenario that further contributed to an already historic income inequality problem. But from 2013 to 2015, the job polarization trend may have reversed. The Labor Department’s Heidi Shierholz wrote in a September blog post that there has been a “notable decline in the number of workers in very low-wage jobs,” which was “likely due to workers moving into a higher wage category rather than experiencing job loss.” When the Census Bureau reported that median household income had grown by more than 5 percent in 2015 ― a record annual growth rate ― White House economic adviser Jason Furman called it the best annual income report ever. The current low unemployment rate, at 4.7 percent, masks some problems, most notably the fact that fewer working-age people are “participating” in the labor force by actively looking for jobs, probably because some believe decent work is not available. Low participation can push the overall jobless rate down, since people aren’t counted in the “unemployed” tally if they aren’t actively searching for work. “We’re moving in the right direction,” said Elise Gould, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that says there are more than 2 million such “missing workers.” “We’ve made huge amounts of progress. We’re just not there yet.”Another problem is that long-term unemployment remains above normal. It’s an experience from which many Americans do not fully recover. Take, for example, Jeff Adams, 61, who spent two years unemployed after losing his defense procurement job in 2010. He wound up working as a home health aide, work that doesn’t require any higher education and typically pays poorly. It’s one of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S., thanks to an aging population. Adams initially become a home health aide because that was the only kind of work he could find, but now such menial work is the only kind he wants. He also dealt with cancer while he was out of work, which further dampened his desire to pursue a high-stress career.“If you’ve got your health and enough money to feed yourself, those are two things that are so important, and I realized time is the most important thing we have,” Adams said.In December, he told HuffPost he was once again unemployed but planning either to return to home health care work, get a job in a home goods store or become an Uber driver. The percentage of workers in nontraditional gigs, like driving for Uber, has risen in recent years.The persistence of long-term joblessness has been an urgent, immediate crisis. Another problem for Obama has been an ongoing decline in decent jobs for people without a college education. He described the problem most vividly in his 2011 State of the Union address, when he said it used to be people could just show up at their dad’s factory right out of high school. “Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown,” Obama said.  “Maybe you’d even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company.”About 8 percent of U.S. jobs are in manufacturing, and they’re more than symbolically important because they tend to pay higher wages than other jobs available to workers with little education. Less manufacturing means lower wages for everyone, since laid-off machinists and gauge setters wind up competing for the same jobs at Walmarts and Amazon warehouses. Manufacturing employment had been on the decline in the U.S. well before Obama became president, due to increased automation and productivity. The steepest drop occurred right before he took office, thanks to the Great Recession, and one of Obama’s most significant responses was the auto bailout. The Center for Automotive Research estimated the special bankruptcy process for General Motors and Chrysler saved 1.5 million jobs, including thousands of factory positions. In his 2012 State of the Union address, Obama said he wanted to see “an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers and a renewal of American values.”He also praised Master Lock, manufacturer of locks and other security devices, for shifting some production from overseas back to a highly automated plant in Milwaukee. He’d previously highlighted the company at an event at the White House with executives from several companies that had boosted production in the U.S. “You’ve heard of outsourcing. Well, these companies are insourcing,” Obama said. In 2012, Obama pledged to create 1 million American manufacturing jobs by the end of 2016. Manufacturing employment has increased by about 315,000 jobs since then. Overall manufacturing employment remains below where it had been at the beginning of 2009.Still, Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing ― an advocacy group funded by steel companies and the United Steelworkers union ― said Obama’s symbolic focus on manufacturing deserves praise. Obama called low-skill factory jobs a relic, but Paul liked that the president did such things as holding a rally at a truck plant in 2013 and bringing a smattering of trade-enforcement cases against countries in the World Trade Organization.“Obama’s approach was nuanced,” Paul said in an interview. “He very much viewed manufacturing as a special sector for various reasons.”Like Obama, Trump has held up manufacturing as a symbol of lost greatness, but he has not been nuanced. Instead of saying the loss of some manufacturing jobs is inevitable and that workers must adapt, Trump said the opposite. Instead of praising specific companies for insourcing, he has attacked them for outsourcing.“We’re going to bring our manufacturing back,” Trump said in July, singling out the heating-and-air-conditioning manufacturer Carrier. “We’re not going to let Carrier come in, make air conditioners in Mexico and sell them to us across a very strong border.”Obama mocked Trump’s hectoring of Carrier and claims that he could stop the company from closing an Indianapolis furnace factory that employs 1,400 workers. “He just says, ‘Well, I’m going to negotiate a better deal,’” Obama said in June. “How exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have?”Trump wound up striking a deal with the company to keep 800 jobs in the U.S. instead of shifting all its production to Mexico; his magic wand may have been the massive amount of contracting Carrier’s parent company does with the federal government. Though it only affected one company, workers at other firms shifting production abroad have said they’re heartened by Trump’s symbolic victory with Carrier. Don Zering said his dad got him a job at Rexnord Corp.’s ball bearings plant in Indianapolis ― about a mile from the Carrier factory ― four days after he graduated high school in 1973. He said he started as a janitor, then worked his way up to a machinist position that he’s held ever since. He’d originally planned to go to trade school, but the money was good. “My dad raised our family, four people, he did that and I knew what it was like,” Zering said. “It was firm good work.”Last year Rexnord announced plans to shut the plant down and shift production to Mexico, where its labor costs will be lower. Trump dissed Rexnord in a tweet, but the company doesn’t seem to care.Zering said he didn’t vote for Trump, but he didn’t recall anything in particular Obama had done or said about manufacturing. “I’m not blaming him one way or the other, but he didn’t make that call like Trump did,” Zering said.

A ban on such discriminatory ads would have been ineffective anyway, since employers can easily screen the unemployed without being explicit about it.So Obama used the White House megaphone.“I’m challenging CEOs from some of America’s best companies to hire more Americans who’ve got what it takes to fill that job opening but have been laid off so long no one will give their résumé an honest look,” Obama said in a July 2013 speech.Instead of calling out specific companies for their callous hiring practices, six months later Obama hosted a bunch of CEOs and a formerly unemployed worker at the White House. Several dozen executives signed a pledge saying they would commit to hiring unemployed people, or at least commit to not not hire them specifically because they’re unemployed. The pledge was nonbinding, its results difficult to verify.The following October, the White House said one company, the telecom firm Frontier Communications, hired more than 250 unemployed people after signing the pledge. (The company declined to make any hirees available for an interview for this story.)Obama’s symbolic effort to make companies hire the jobless may have been inconsequential ― which is, of course, the trouble with symbolic gestures.Far more consequential was his effort to get a massive spending bill through Congress in the early days of his administration, which included money for unemployment benefits, infrastructure projects and tax cuts. Many, but not all, economists credit the stimulus for helping prevent a full-blown economic depression.The economy turned around and unemployment fell in Obama’s first term, but there was still a significant problem. Many of the new jobs came in low-paying industries like retail and restaurants. From 2010 to 2013, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported this year, the national economy added far fewer middle-wage jobs than either high-paying or low-paying ones ― a “job polarization” scenario that further contributed to an already historic income inequality problem. But from 2013 to 2015, the job polarization trend may have reversed. The Labor Department’s Heidi Shierholz wrote in a September blog post that there has been a “notable decline in the number of workers in very low-wage jobs,” which was “likely due to workers moving into a higher wage category rather than experiencing job loss.” When the Census Bureau reported that median household income had grown by more than 5 percent in 2015 ― a record annual growth rate ― White House economic adviser Jason Furman called it the best annual income report ever. The current low unemployment rate, at 4.7 percent, masks some problems, most notably the fact that fewer working-age people are “participating” in the labor force by actively looking for jobs, probably because some believe decent work is not available. Low participation can push the overall jobless rate down, since people aren’t counted in the “unemployed” tally if they aren’t actively searching for work. “We’re moving in the right direction,” said Elise Gould, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that says there are more than 2 million such “missing workers.” “We’ve made huge amounts of progress. We’re just not there yet.”Another problem is that long-term unemployment remains above normal. It’s an experience from which many Americans do not fully recover. Take, for example, Jeff Adams, 61, who spent two years unemployed after losing his defense procurement job in 2010. He wound up working as a home health aide, work that doesn’t require any higher education and typically pays poorly. It’s one of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S., thanks to an aging population. Adams initially become a home health aide because that was the only kind of work he could find, but now such menial work is the only kind he wants. He also dealt with cancer while he was out of work, which further dampened his desire to pursue a high-stress career.“If you’ve got your health and enough money to feed yourself, those are two things that are so important, and I realized time is the most important thing we have,” Adams said.In December, he told HuffPost he was once again unemployed but planning either to return to home health care work, get a job in a home goods store or become an Uber driver. The percentage of workers in nontraditional gigs, like driving for Uber, has risen in recent years.The persistence of long-term joblessness has been an urgent, immediate crisis. Another problem for Obama has been an ongoing decline in decent jobs for people without a college education. He described the problem most vividly in his 2011 State of the Union address, when he said it used to be people could just show up at their dad’s factory right out of high school. “Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown,” Obama said.  “Maybe you’d even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company.”About 8 percent of U.S. jobs are in manufacturing, and they’re more than symbolically important because they tend to pay higher wages than other jobs available to workers with little education. Less manufacturing means lower wages for everyone, since laid-off machinists and gauge setters wind up competing for the same jobs at Walmarts and Amazon warehouses. Manufacturing employment had been on the decline in the U.S. well before Obama became president, due to increased automation and productivity. The steepest drop occurred right before he took office, thanks to the Great Recession, and one of Obama’s most significant responses was the auto bailout. The Center for Automotive Research estimated the special bankruptcy process for General Motors and Chrysler saved 1.5 million jobs, including thousands of factory positions. In his 2012 State of the Union address, Obama said he wanted to see “an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers and a renewal of American values.”He also praised Master Lock, manufacturer of locks and other security devices, for shifting some production from overseas back to a highly automated plant in Milwaukee. He’d previously highlighted the company at an event at the White House with executives from several companies that had boosted production in the U.S. “You’ve heard of outsourcing. Well, these companies are insourcing,” Obama said. In 2012, Obama pledged to create 1 million American manufacturing jobs by the end of 2016. Manufacturing employment has increased by about 315,000 jobs since then. Overall manufacturing employment remains below where it had been at the beginning of 2009.Still, Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing ― an advocacy group funded by steel companies and the United Steelworkers union ― said Obama’s symbolic focus on manufacturing deserves praise. Obama called low-skill factory jobs a relic, but Paul liked that the president did such things as holding a rally at a truck plant in 2013 and bringing a smattering of trade-enforcement cases against countries in the World Trade Organization.“Obama’s approach was nuanced,” Paul said in an interview. “He very much viewed manufacturing as a special sector for various reasons.”Like Obama, Trump has held up manufacturing as a symbol of lost greatness, but he has not been nuanced. Instead of saying the loss of some manufacturing jobs is inevitable and that workers must adapt, Trump said the opposite. Instead of praising specific companies for insourcing, he has attacked them for outsourcing.“We’re going to bring our manufacturing back,” Trump said in July, singling out the heating-and-air-conditioning manufacturer Carrier. “We’re not going to let Carrier come in, make air conditioners in Mexico and sell them to us across a very strong border.”Obama mocked Trump’s hectoring of Carrier and claims that he could stop the company from closing an Indianapolis furnace factory that employs 1,400 workers. “He just says, ‘Well, I’m going to negotiate a better deal,’” Obama said in June. “How exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have?”Trump wound up striking a deal with the company to keep 800 jobs in the U.S. instead of shifting all its production to Mexico; his magic wand may have been the massive amount of contracting Carrier’s parent company does with the federal government. Though it only affected one company, workers at other firms shifting production abroad have said they’re heartened by Trump’s symbolic victory with Carrier. Don Zering said his dad got him a job at Rexnord Corp.’s ball bearings plant in Indianapolis ― about a mile from the Carrier factory ― four days after he graduated high school in 1973. He said he started as a janitor, then worked his way up to a machinist position that he’s held ever since. He’d originally planned to go to trade school, but the money was good. “My dad raised our family, four people, he did that and I knew what it was like,” Zering said. “It was firm good work.”Last year Rexnord announced plans to shut the plant down and shift production to Mexico, where its labor costs will be lower. Trump dissed Rexnord in a tweet, but the company doesn’t seem to care.Zering said he didn’t vote for Trump, but he didn’t recall anything in particular Obama had done or said about manufacturing. “I’m not blaming him one way or the other, but he didn’t make that call like Trump did,” Zering said.

37,POLITICS,Democrats Form Congressional Caucus To Support Public Education,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/public-education-caucus_us_5875183ee4b099cdb0ffb0c2,The members of Congress say Trump's pick for education secretary is a threat to schools.,2017-01-10,"Members of Congress, spurred by the nomination of Betsy DeVos as education secretary, have formed a caucus to support public education.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587526311200002d00ad6bf7.jpeg?cache=y9mnkw51Ck&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Members of Congress have formed a new caucus to support the goals of public education under Donald Trump’s presidency. Although the caucus has been in the works for over a year, Trump’s election and his nomination of Betsy DeVos as education secretary has given the group heightened urgency, according to those involved with the effort.Several Democratic members of Congress announced the effort alongside the presidents of the nation’s two largest teachers unions at a press conference on Tuesday.Members expressed fear that public education will be under attack if DeVos is confirmed. Although DeVos’ Senate confirmation hearing was originally scheduled for Wednesday, it was pushed back to next week “at the request of the Senate leadership to accommodate the Senate schedule,” according to a statement from the leaders of the Senate education committee. The move comes after Democrats called on the Senate to delay the hearing until an Office of Government Ethics review of DeVos is complete. DeVos did not attend public schools as a child and did not send her children to public schools. She has never been employed by a public school. Critics of DeVos say her strong advocacy for school voucher programs and other alternatives to traditional public schools show that she wants to dismantle the public education system. School voucher programs use taxpayer money to send children to private schools. Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.), who spent over two decades as a public school teacher and is part of the caucus, said at the press conference that DeVos’ lack of experience gives her an “incredibly narrow view of public education in America.”“She will insert a profit motive into children’s education that will cripple our public schools and punish the millions of students who attend them everyday,” Takano said. “Betsy DeVos will create a race to the bottom line.”Indeed, DeVos has been heavily involved in the expansion of Michigan’s charter schools. Michigan has more for-profit charter schools than any other state. Another caucus member, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), said he has never worked as a teacher, but his years in the Wisconsin Legislature showed him the havoc school choice can wreak on children. “I’ve watched this experiment firsthand,” Pocan told The Huffington Post. “I’ve watched dollars be thrown away with no results ― in fact negative results.” Takano said he has heard from concerned constituents, teachers and former students regarding DeVos. He said he is especially concerned that DeVos won’t act to support the nation’s LBGTQ students and other vulnerable children. Indeed, DeVos’ foundation has donated heavily to anti-gay groups. Takano called her work in that area “a huge disqualifying point.”“The public education caucus in the congress is more important than ever, now that we have a nominee for secretary of education who I believe is hell-bent on dismantling public education,” Takano told The Huffington Post. “I don’t have confidence Betsy DeVos has the background or history or commitment to make sure every students’ rights are enforced.” So far, in addition to Pocan and Takano, the caucus includes Democratic Reps. Alma Adams (N.C.), Suzanne Bonamici (Ore.), Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), Mark DeSaulnier (Calif.), Raul Grijalva (Ariz.), Sheila Jackson Lee (Texas), Jared Polis (Colo.), Jamie Raskin (Md.) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (N.J.). The group hopes to attract more members in the upcoming days.In recent days, key Republican players have expressed support for DeVos, including the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and a group of 20 Republican governors. Ed Patru, spokesman for the group Friends of Betsy DeVos, said in a statement Tuesday afternoon that the education secretary pick does support public education:“Every member of the house public education caucus understands that funding for public schools occurs at the local level and Washington couldn’t get rid of public education even if it wanted to. Having said that, Betsy is a supporter of public education. Like the majority of Americans, she believes public schools and schools of choice can coexist and that together they strengthen education.”This post has been updated with a statement from Patru.― ― Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

38,POLITICS,Trump AG Pick Claims He Would Enforce Waterboarding Law He Disagrees With,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-trump-ag-pick_us_58751686e4b043ad97e5efa4,But he'll still enforce the legislation that outlawed torture.,2017-01-10,"Protesters take positions at the start of a Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for U.S. Attorney General-nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., January 10, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587517c217000088019293d0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s candidate for attorney general said on Tuesday he was against banning Muslims from entering the country and would enforce a 2015 law that outlawed waterboarding terrorism suspects, even though he had opposed the law.During the 2016 election campaign Trump said waterboarding, which simulates drowning and is widely regarded as torture, was an effective technique and vowed to bring it back and make it “a hell of a lot worse.”Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, a close ally of Trump’s and his nominee to be attorney general, told a Senate confirmation hearing that the law was “not the right step” and should not have applied to the “higher ups” in the military and intelligence community.However with his remarks on enforcing the law, he indicated a willingness to resist the president-elect.The hearing for Sessions, in line to be the country’s top prosecutor and legal adviser to the president, was the first in a series this week for nominees to Trump’s Cabinet ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration. Protesters charging Sessions has a poor record on human rights interrupted the proceedings several times.Sessions, 70, became the first sitting senator to endorse Trump for the presidency in early 2016 and has remained an adviser on issues such as immigration. He is being reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, a panel on which he serves, and is widely expected to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate.President George W. Bush’s administration was strongly criticized at home and abroad when intelligence agencies used waterboarding. More recently Trump has said retired Marine Corps General James Mattis, his nominee for secretary of defense, had persuasively argued against it.On another counterterrorism issue, Sessions said he would not support banning anyone from the United States on the basis of religion, and said Trump’s intentions were to block people coming from countries harboring terrorists, not all Muslims. During his campaign, Trump at one point proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.CLINTON EMAILSSessions also said he would recuse himself from investigating Hillary Clinton’s email practices and charitable foundation if confirmed as attorney general, and he would favor the appointment of a special prosecutor for any such investigation.“I have said a few things,” Sessions said about his comments during the presidential race accusing former Democratic presidential candidate Clinton of illegal activity. “I think that is one of the reasons why I should not make a decision in that case.”Trump, who defeated Clinton in the Nov. 8 election, said during the campaign that if elected he would ask his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to see that Clinton go to prison for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and her relationship with her family’s charitable foundation.“We can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute,” Sessions said. “This country does not punish its political enemies but this country ensures that no one is above the law.”Many questions on Tuesday aimed to establish how closely Sessions hewed to Trump positions.Sessions said he agreed with Trump in opposing Democratic President Barack Obama’s executive action that granted temporary protection to immigrant children brought to the country illegally by their parents and would not oppose overturning it.Sessions, who has represented the deeply conservative Southern state of Alabama for 20 years, has a long record of opposing legislation that provides a path to citizenship for immigrants. He has also been a close ally of groups seeking to restrict legal immigration by placing limits on visas used by companies to hire foreign workers.As head of the Justice Department, the attorney general oversees the immigration court system that decides whether immigrants are deported or granted asylum or some other kind of protection. A key plank of Trump’s election campaign was his pledge to deport illegal immigrants and to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.Sessions also said he agreed with his many of his fellow Republicans that the military prison for foreign terrorism suspects in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba remain open. The Obama administration has sought to close the prison, opened by Bush in 2002, and bring its prisoners to U.S. civilian courts to be tried.DEFENSE AGAINST RACISMSessions several times defended himself against charges of racism. He said allegations that he harbored sympathies toward the Ku Klux Klan, a violent white supremacist organization, are false.“I abhor the Klan and what it represents and its hateful ideology,” Sessions said in his opening remarks.“End racism Stop Sessions,” and “End hate Stop Sessions,” read some of the signs carried by protesters.Sessions was denied confirmation to a federal judgeship in 1986 after allegations emerged that he made racist remarks, including testimony that he called an African-American prosecutor “boy,” an allegation Sessions denied.Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said the Senate Judiciary Committee had received letters from 400 civil rights organizations opposing his confirmation to the country’s top law enforcement post.“This job requires service to the people and the law, not the president,” Feinstein said.“There is a deep fear about what a Trump administration will bring in many places. And this is the context in which we must consider Senator Sessions’ record and nomination,” Feinstein added.Sessions has opposed abortion and same-sex marriage as a senator, but said on Tuesday that if confirmed as attorney general he would follow the Supreme Court rulings that legalized both abortion and same-sex marriage.He also said he opposed lowering mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders and did not see voter identification laws as a barrier to voting, a reversal of two key stances of the Obama administration.(Additional reporting by David Alexander, Sarah Lynch, Dustin Volz and Ian Simpson)"
39,POLITICS,"10,000 Jobs Donald Trump Doesn't Care About At All",Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-retail-jobs_us_58751307e4b099cdb0ffa13d,He's ignoring the struggles of a huge number of working class Americans.,2017-01-10,"In a speech on jobs and the economy in New York in September Trump offered a look at his philosophy on jobs, it seemed clear that working-class jobs to him were primarily factory jobs.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5875145a1200002d00ad6b9e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Facing seismic shifts in the way Americans shop, Macy’s recently announced it was closing 68 stores around the country, laying off thousands of workers ― many of them low-paid sales associates, plenty of women and people of color, many working at failing malls where jobs are getting harder to come by. In total, after Macy’s is done cutting back, more than 10,000 people will lose their jobs. President-elect Donald Trump doesn’t appear to care about those workers. Trump, who ran on a platform of bringing back and creating jobs, responded to Macy’s layoff news with glee ― as a personal victory for himself.“@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%,” Trump tweeted. “Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.”At first glance, the tweet is easy to understand: In the summer of 2015, Macy’s cut ties with Trump in response to the offensive remarks the then-GOP presidential candidate had made about Mexicans. Trump and his followers launched a boycott. So, of course, the president-elect sees the company’s news in personal terms. But there’s something else going on. And it has everything to do with the kinds of jobs Trump feels are worthy of attention. So far, he has been almost totally concerned with old-school factory and manufacturing jobs, on the whole a declining part of the job market. Meanwhile, he’s ignored retail jobs, which employ a huge segment of working-class Americans. About 15 million Americans work in the retail industry, a number projected by the Labor Department to grow to 16 million by 2024. Manufacturing jobs are projected to decline by 2 million over that time period.The problem is: retail jobs aren’t great jobs. The median hourly wage for a retail salesperson is $10.47 an hour, according to the Labor Department. The benefits are poor. Women make up the majority of low-paid retail workers, according to a 2015 report from progressive think tank Demos. A common misconception about who works in retail is that they are teenagers and students putting themselves through school, but the Demos report paints a different picture. Among low-wage earning retail workers who are women, 36 percent have children at home. “Donald Trump isn’t worried about losing these jobs or aiming to raise standards for people working in these jobs,” Amy Traub, associate director of policy and research at Demos told The Huffington Post.But retail jobs aren’t going away and as increasing numbers of working families depend on the wages from these jobs, it’s imperative to find a way to improve them. Americans depend on their wages from retail jobs to raise families. They need to be able to get time off to deal with sick kids or a pregnancy, they need to put food on the table, to see the doctor.Traub notes that the way you make these jobs better is hardly a secret. First, you raise the minimum wage. Second, you enact paid sick leave and paid parental leave. You put in place better regulations around scheduling ― as some states have done ― so that working parents aren’t at the mercy of daily changing schedules. It’s worth noting that the factory jobs Trump is so keen on saving didn’t used to be great jobs. Unions fought for better working conditions and pay and the federal government put in place laws to protect these unions. “Making it easier for workers to organize may be the key to turning service jobs into good jobs, as well,” Traub said. Don’t hold your breath for a Trump administration that supports unions. Trump’s pick to head up the Department of Labor, fast-food CEO Andy Puzder, vehemently opposes the Fight for $15 movement, which seeks to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 from its current $7.25. Union officials see him as an opponent of working people. And yet Trump models himself as the champion of the working man.“Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it’s their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration,” Trump said in a speech on jobs in September in New York.He proposed turning this situation around by lowering taxes, reducing regulations and offering working families a child care tax credit. (None of those moves would’ve saved the jobs of those Macy’s workers, by the way.)Macy’s is facing immense competition from the web and from speciality and discount stores that are steadily stealing away its clientele. These days, women buy their makeup at stores like Sephora, and their clothes at discount retailers like TJ Maxx. And of course, everyone shops online where Amazon is seeing tremendous growth. All of this has spelled doom for the nation’s malls, where Macy’s once dominated as the anchor store that brought in the business. Other middle-of-the-road department stores are struggling too, including Kohl’s, JC Penney and Sears.Even if Macy’s hadn’t insulted Trump, there’s little reason to believe he would’ve intervened to save the jobs of its workers. Their struggles simply don’t fit Trump’s view of the American job market or who gets to be a real American worker.“More than 10,000 layoffs at Macy’s and we hear nothing from the president-elect compared to 700 jobs in Indiana,” Traub said, referring to a tax deal Trump put together to save 800 jobs at Carrier Corporation’s gas furnace factory. “By ignoring this, Trump is telling his base these aren’t real jobs and the people working at them aren’t real Americans.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated the year that Macy’s cut its business ties with Donald Trump as 2016; it was 2015."
40,POLITICS,Rex Tillerson Can Expect A Lot Of Questions About His Record On Climate Change,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rex-tillerson-confirmation_us_5875425be4b043ad97e64a1e,President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state spent the last 41 years working for Exxon Mobil.,2017-01-10,Rex Tillerson served for the last 10 years as chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587542ac17000085019294a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rex Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, will likely face plenty of tough questions during his confirmation hearings on Wednesday: about his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, deals his former company made with Iran, and the secretive oil venture he oversaw in the tax haven of the Bahamas. But senators will also probably focus on the outgoing Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO’s climate change record. Tillerson, 64, is a Texas-born oil man who spent 41 years at the world’s largest publicly listed energy company and has a complicated history on the subject. Under his decade-long tenure as chief executive, Exxon Mobil shifted its public messaging on climate change by ending years of funding a Big Tobacco-style disinformation campaign and finally acknowledging that human activity is causing the Earth to get warmer. The company announced in 2009 that it was in favor of taxing carbon and that it had begun investing in algae-based biofuels. It came out in support of the Paris climate accord in 2015, which more than 180 countries have signed. Despite these attempts to burnish Exxon Mobil’s public image, Tillerson’s record at the helm remains less straightforward. The company has continued to lavish money on think tanks and advocacy groups that deny fossil fuels worsen climate change, even though it pledged in 2007 to stop doing so. Its political donations overwhelmingly have gone to Republicans who have battled environmental regulations, including the Obama administration’s rules curbing greenhouse gas emissions. And Tillerson has openly mocked the renewable energy industry, even as rival oil giants sunk money into wind, solar and battery storage projects. “While we’ve seen some shifts in rhetoric, the company’s conduct does not back up its words,” Kathy Mulvey, climate accountability campaign manager at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Huffington Post on Monday. “We’re still seeing Exxon Mobil, for example, playing a leadership role in funding groups that spread disinformation on climate science and policy.” Despite the firm’s supposed evolution on global warming, neither Exxon Mobil nor Tillerson owned up to the years the company spent funding organizations whose chief purpose seemed to be seeding doubt over climate science. That funding has been under increased scrutiny since October 2015, when InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times published documents revealing that Exxon Mobil chose to continue funding disinformation campaigns even though its scientists understood global warming decades ago. The reports provoked a group of state attorneys general to begin investigating corporations, including Exxon Mobil, for allegedly misleading the public on climate change. “I’m deeply interested in the record of Exxon Mobil when Mr. Tillerson was in leadership in funding organizations that tried to muddy up or deny the reality of climate science,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who sits on the Senate committee tasked with grilling Tillerson, said Tuesday on “CBS This Morning.” “Exxon Mobil is an organization filled with scientists and engineers and from what I’ve read, they understood decades ago that humans were affecting climate in ways that could be dangerous, but the allegation is that they then made the decision to cover that evidence up as long as they could for their own financial benefit,” Kaine said. “And I want to explore what Mr. Tillerson knows about that.”Five of the 10 Democratic senators on the committee scored 100 percent on the League of Conservation Voters’ 2015 ranking, meaning they voted in favor of environmentally friendly bills whenever presented with one. Kaine ranked the lowest, with 88 percent, despite a 91 percent lifetime score. The environmental advocacy group NextGen Climate released an ad on Tuesday that shows Tillerson, while in his role leading Exxon Mobil, telling an audience at the University of Texas that he was “not here to represent the United States government’s interests.” Tom Steyer, the group’s billionaire founder, said the ad shows how Tillerson “puts corporate interests over American interests” ― and may continue to do so as secretary of state.“The American people deserve more assurance than we’ve received so far that he will be able to represent their values when U.S. policy goals conflict with Exxon’s ongoing corporate interests,” Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) said in a statement. Tillerson’s meager record of public service could become another sticking point as senators probe his résumé. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Monday that he planned to pepper Tillerson with questions about how his career as an oil executive qualified him to lead the State Department. “After talking with him, I still have significant questions about Mr. Tillerson’s foreign policy views and how his four-decade career at one of the largest oil companies in the world prepares him to be our nation’s top diplomat,” Merkley said in a statement. “I look forward to further exploring Mr. Tillerson’s views at his confirmation hearing.”"

But one year",2017-01-10,An old Chinese billboard ad calling for a stop to domestic violence. A new law that came into effect in March last year finally recognizes spousal abuse as an offense in its own right. But activists say the law is not being implemented effectively enough.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5875216d1200002d00ad6bdc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In December 2015, the Chinese government passed the country’s landmark first bill against domestic violence. But one year on, campaigners warn that not enough people know about it, and victims remain uncompensated.Lu Yanxia was six months pregnant when her husband beat her so badly that her face was left swollen beyond recognition. The violence had begun only a few short weeks into their relationship. Although he had begged her for forgiveness, the beatings didn’t stop. He was also psychologically abusive, stopping her from meeting friends and taking control of her money. The last beating was so severe that, bruised and heavily pregnant, she finally found the courage to flee.“There was pressure from his family to put up with it, to stay with him because of the child,” she says. “And I felt I couldn’t call the police station, it was still close to his home. So I ran away where he couldn’t find me and filed for divorce.”Women are often pressured by family to stay in abusive relationships, and it’s one of the central reasons why spousal abuse is underreported in China, where domestic violence is generally still seen as a private, family matter. Official government figures suggest around one in four married women have experienced domestic violence at least once, but experts place the number much higher – as high as 40 percent, according to research by U.N. Women in China.This hidden epidemic finally gained official attention a year ago, when China’s first Family Violence Law was ratified in December 2015. It was a hard-won achievement that took almost two decades of campaigning from NGOs and experts, who joined together to form the now-defunct Anti-Domestic Violence Network. The landmark bill covers not just physical but also psychological abuse, applies to both married and cohabiting couples, and allows relatives to file a complaint on behalf of victims. The new law means domestic violence is now a valid reason for divorce and marks this type of violence as a recognized offense in its own right, with abuse potentially leading to seven years in prison. Crucially, it also introduced a system for obtaining protective restraining orders – the first of which were issued just days after the law came into effect in March 2016 – and set out clear procedures for police dealing with domestic violence cases.But despite the promising start, campaigners are concerned the momentum is stalling.“We can see some progress in the first year since the law was accepted,” says Feng Yuan, cofounder of women’s rights NGO Equality. “We can see more protection orders issued, more police issuing warning cards to perpetrators and we can see more women seeking help, as well as more NGOs starting to work in this field.“However, we see a lot of gaps. For example, there isn’t enough capacity-building in implementation agencies such as the police, lawyers, social workers. They can’t handle all the cases properly and aren’t clear enough on procedure.”China has plenty of women’s shelters, but many of them remain empty, lacking the facilities, security and information they need to protect and assist the women who come to them for help. In some cases, advocates say women seeking refuge are persuaded to return to their husbands instead.And in many cases, women who are being abused simply can’t afford to leave. Although legal aid centers exist across the country, Gao Mingyue, a family lawyer and founder of For NGO, an organization that helps other NGOs in the country to do their work, says the centers are reluctant to help if the victim has any assets, even if they all belong to the abusive spouse. Currently there is no provision in the law for financial compensation to victims, something campaigners are calling for in future amendments.“We feel now that the law has been enacted that it also has to be upscaled,” says Julia Broussard, head of U.N. Women in China. “We have been working in three counties – Hunan, Gansu and Sichuan – but that’s a drop in the bucket for the number of counties in China. We really need to find the funding and support to roll out what we’ve been doing in those pilot counties.”U.N. Women has been running programs in China to raise awareness of women’s rights and provide legal advocacy, while also working with the police and the legal system to help women access the services available to them and offering activities to show men and young people how to prevent domestic violence before it starts.“Police everywhere have to be trained, judges everywhere have to be trained, the media has to know how to report on this issue,” says Broussard. “There’s no end to the work that has to be done.”Activists say there is a disconnect between the rights enshrined in the law and the system that implements it. For example, says Gao, judges have previously been reluctant to consider domestic violence in divorce proceedings, and mindsets are slow to change. “The judge’s perspective is that if [the couple] is already getting divorced, [the problem] is finished,” he says. “Legal focus has always been on the division of property and custody of children, rather than spending time looking backward.”And although the law has been on the books for a year, raising awareness remains a challenge. An ongoing survey by the Asia Foundation and Beijing-based consultancy SynTao has so far found that 40 percent of H.R. managers and 68 percent of the workers surveyed were unaware of the law’s existence.As NGOs and charities continue to try to make women in China aware of their new rights, they also have to deal with a government crackdown on women’s rights activists. A month after the law was passed, the Zhongze Women’s Legal Counseling and Service Center was closed by government officials, which many warn is part of a continued clampdown on civil society, including the arrest and harassment of women’s rights activists.Campaigners say they will not be cowed. The government has sent “a signal to society that, ‘We are not going to tolerate this anymore,’” says Broussard. “Because the law has been enacted, stakeholders have to take the phenomenon more seriously.”Now separated from her husband for eight years, Lu Yanxia has turned her life around and works as a consultant in family and marriage law, helping other victims of abuse.“We need this law in China,” she says. “It will make couples think before they turn to violence. Because the pain of the victims of domestic violence is not just in their bodies, but also in their minds. And that takes a long time to recover.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub. For weekly updates, you can sign up to the Women & Girls Hub email list."

He was released with a promise to appear in court on Feb. 15.The 94-year-old Hollywood sign on Mount Lee was altered around 3 a.m. on New Year’s Day to read “Hollyweed.”At first, the identity of the person who changed the sign was a mystery, but Fernandez took credit for the prank in interviews with BuzzFeed and Vice.com.“It was something to smile and laugh out loud about,” Fernandez told BuzzFeed News. “Just lift their spirits and let them live because 2016 was a crazy year, dude.”Fernandez and collaborator Sarah Fern, his ex-wife, used about $35 worth of tarps to change the sign, a process that took about three hours of work and two months of preparation.“We literally were sewing stuff the day of,” he told BuzzFeed. “It was so fun and exhilarating.”Although Fernandez expected the sign change would get a reaction locally, he was shocked at how big the story was.“I never expected it to get as big as it did,” Fernandez told the Los Angeles Times.Although officials concede that Fernandez’s prank did not harm the sign, Los Angeles City Councilman David Ryu told the Los Angeles Times that it was important that the act be punished.“Pranks of this nature deplete the resources of our valuable public safety personnel, in both responding to the prank and in responding to the increased crowds and copycat attempts that these incidents generate,” he said.

Whether the setting is Middle Earth or Winterfell, almost everyone is white.An upcoming trilogy by author Marlon James will bring some much-needed diversity to the fantasy genre. The Dark Star Trilogy by James, winner of the 2015 Man Booker Prize for his novel A Brief History of Seven Killings, is billed as the “African ‘Game of Thrones.’” The books will follow three characters ― the Tracker, the Moon Witch and the Boy ― as they decipher what went wrong in a search for a missing child.The main characters are three of eight mercenaries who were hired by a slave trader to track down a kidnapped kid. The book takes place nine years after that fact, when five of the mercenaries as well as the missing child are dead ― and seeks to put together the missing pieces using not-quite-reliable witness testimony. Expect mer-creatures, underworld darkness, magical techniques, a mysterious dwarf race and far more unadulterated geekery.In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, James explained how his frustration with the lack of characters of color in existing fantasy books led him to create his own.“Originally it came from a fight that I had with somebody. I think it was when they announced the casting for ‘The Hobbit,’” James recalled. “I remember saying, ‘You know, if an Asian or a black hobbit came out of the Shire, nobody would have cared. We would have just moved on.’ And my friend said, ‘Well, Lord of the Rings is all this British and Celtic mythology.’ And I said, ‘Well, you know ... Lord of the Rings isn’t real.’ It just turned into one of these arguments we have about diversity and inclusion.”The writer summed up his stance in Man of the World magazine: “I realized how sick and tired I was of arguing about whether there should be a black hobbit in Lord of the Rings.”The works that helped shaped James’ trilogy are a multifarious spread, ranging from Angela Carter’s The Bloody Chamber to Marvel’s “Luke Cage,” Ursula K. Le Guin’s Earthsea to the paintings of Salvador Dalí. Yet James was particularly influenced by African epics like The Epic of Son-Jara and The Epic of Askia Mohammed, created around the same time as Beowulf.“It made me start to think about the fantastic African epic traditions — some of the stories I grew up with, like ‘Anansi the Spider,’” James told EW.“I just realized that there’s this huge pool of fantastic stories to draw from. It’s sort of like my being a scholar of African history and mythology, and my being a total sci-fi/fantasy geek who rereads things like The Mists of Avalon, they just sort of came together.”James is aiming to finish the books by the end of 2017, in time for a Fall 2018 release. At that point, 12-year-old sci-fi-heads and avid literature fans can finally join together and “geek the fuck out.”"

We live in Michigan!”In anger, he posted a now-viral photo of the ticket to his Facebook page Thursday, criticizing the police department for “wasting the taxpayer’s money.” Trupiano, who goes by Nick Taylor online, further chastised the Roseville officer responsible for writing the ticket and used profane language, which he has since said he regrets using.Roseville Police Chief James Berlin, who saw the post, came to his officer’s defense with some equally frigid words for Taylor that he shared with WDIV-TV: “Drop dead.”Berlin argued that leaving vehicles unlocked, unattended and with the motor running provokes thefts.Local ordinances across the state forbid drivers from leaving their cars unattended like this, though there are exceptions if the vehicle has a remote startup that ensures the vehicle remains locked, WXYZ reported.“I encourage our officers to write this ticket,” Berlin told CBS Detroit. “All it takes is someone to hop in this car and take off. Then there’s a chase often at a high rate of speed and all that could have been prevented.”Not everyone agrees with this kind of handling, however.WXYZ visited one Roseville neighborhood where several vehicles were running unattended in driveways. One resident, Antoinette Lewis, expressed surprise over news that she, too, could be hit with a $128 ticket for doing so.“Wow, that’s really unfortunate. It’s really cold out here and my car’s been running for like 20 minutes,” Lewis told the station.A Facebook page for Roseville’s Police Department has been plastered with comments criticizing the ticket as well as Berlin’s personal handling of the situation.Trupiano said he will fight the ticket in court later this month."

While Russian hackers gained “limited penetration of old RNC” computer systems “that were no longer in use,” the FBI found no evidence that the Trump campaign or current RNC servers were hacked, Comey said. Comey’s assertion comes after several months of confusion about whether the hackers who stole and leaked thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee also targeted its Republican counterpart and Trump, who was then the Republican presidential nominee.A declassified version of an intelligence community report released last week concluded that “Russia collected on some Republican-affiliated targets but did not conduct a comparable disclosure campaign.” It did not specifically address the RNC. According to the report, which was drafted by officials from the CIA, FBI and NSA, the goal of Moscow’s cyber operations was to help Trump and to denigrate his opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Previous media reports quoted unnamed government officials who said that Russia also hacked the RNC. RNC officials have long denied that their organization was hacked. Trump, who initially brushed off the intelligence community’s belief that Moscow is to blame for the election-related hacks, said last week that it was DNC members’ fault their emails were stolen. According to the FBI director, Russia penetrated state-level GOP groups and campaigns, as well as an RNC domain that was no longer in use ― which could indicate an effort to access current emails belonging to the committee. Comey declined to say whether hackers attempted to infiltrate the Trump campaign’s communications.It was not immediately clear whether the hack of the old RNC domain, which Comey said is no longer in use, could expose longtime RNC officials to vulnerabilities. Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer, who both have roles in the incoming Trump administration, began working at the RNC in 2011. It is also possible that cyber attacks on state-level GOP entities could have yielded emails to and from current RNC officials, who likely communicate with state-level party members. DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile said in a statement that Comey’s revelation “offers further confirmation that the Russians selectively leaked information specifically to aid Trump and hurt Democrats.” Comey testified Tuesday alongside Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, NSA chief Adm. Michael Rogers, and CIA Director John Brennan. It was the first appearance by senior intelligence and law enforcement officials before the intelligence committee since the release of the intelligence community’s report last week. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) used the opportunity to question the FBI director about reported ties between Trump staffers and Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Has the FBI investigated these reported relationships ― and if so, what are the agencies findings?” Wyden asked Comey. “I would never comment on investigations ― whether we have one or not ― in an open forum like this,” Comey responded. It is true that the FBI typically remains silent about the existence and status of ongoing investigations. But less than two weeks before the election, Comey notified lawmakers that the FBI, which had completed its investigation of Clinton’s emails months prior, was examining additional emails. The letter Comey sent to Congress quickly leaked and created a political firestorm for Clinton. Her supporters fault the FBI director for using inadequate discretion and swaying public opinion at a critical time in the campaign.  “The irony of your making that statement here, I cannot avoid ― but we’ll move on,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said to Comey, a clear reference to his handling of the Clinton case.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, ignoring calls to assemble a select committee, has tasked the intelligence committee with investigating the election-related hacking. Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said Tuesday he would lead an investigation into the still-classified intelligence underpinning the assessment the Moscow is to blame for election-related hacking. On Tuesday, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called on the intelligence committee to also investigate leaks to the media related to the hacks ― echoing a request from Trump last week. Burr responded that he and the vice chairman “are working on that right now.” Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, did not immediately respond to a question about whether he would support a committee effort to investigate leaks to reporters.This story has been updated throughout with additional information from James Comey’s testimony.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that Tom Cotton was a senator from Nebraska. He is from Arkansas."

Within that group, white evangelicals hold the greatest disregard for the outgoing president.White evangelical Christians have disliked Obama from the start. During the 2008 election season, not even their distaste for Sen. John McCain nor Obama’s persistent outreach among young evangelicals could sway their vote. Just 24 percent of them voted for Obama that year, and even fewer ― 21 percent ― voted for him in 2012. Among white evangelicals who said they attended worship services at least weekly, support for the 44th president was even lower. No other religious group in America has resisted Obama's presidency quite as much as white evangelicals have, with the possible exception of Mormons. PRRI didn’t measure Obama’s favorability among Mormons, but a 2014 Gallup survey found that the president’s approval rating was actually lower among that religious community ― at 18 percent ― than any other faith group. Muslims rated Obama the highest, at 72 percent.But Mormons’ views of Obama weren’t always as low as they were by the middle of his second term. One analysis of exit polls by Pew Research Center suggested more than 30 percent of Mormons voted for him in 2008. By the 2012 election, however, the percentage dropped to 21 percent ― the same share as white evangelicals.A minority of white Catholics and white mainline Protestants voted for Obama in both of his elections. And the president’s favorability among these groups remained low as his presidency came to an end.By the time the 2016 came around, the Democratic Party had lost ground with nearly all religious groups to some degree ― even those that went majority with Hillary Clinton. Sixty-seven percent of Hispanic Catholics voted for Clinton, compared to 75 percent who voted for Obama in 2012.Sixty-eight percent of the religiously unaffiliated voted for the Democratic ticket, compared to 70 percent in 2012 and 75 percent in 2008. Only Jewish and Mormon voters selected the Democratic nominee at slightly higher percentages than they did in 2012.Apart from Mormons, the religious groups who disliked Obama in 2012 disliked Clinton with even greater fervency in 2016. Yet when the transition of power comes to pass on January 20, one group is likely to be applauding the loudest."

It took approximately four seconds in Twitter-time for what the president-elect intended as an insult to become something of a feminist battle cry. “A nasty woman is someone who refuses to be bound by the place society defined for her, someone who blazes her own trail,” Deborah Gaston, director of education at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, explained to The Huffington Post. Although Clinton is the nasty woman that made the term go viral, ladies have been subverting restrictive gendered stereotypes and limitations for centuries. “Going back to the Renaissance,” Gaston continued, “women have been doing things they ‘shouldn’t.’ Well, they did it anyway, and they were successful.” Since it was founded in 1987, the National Museum of Women in the Arts has worked to preserve and share the legacies of such subversive heroines, specifically those engaged in creative work. The only major museum in the world dedicated to celebrating the history of women-identified artists, the NMWA works to derail the longstanding habit of overlooking, undermining and erasing the work of women from the canon.

Merian, born in 1647 in Frankfurt, Germany, grew up in a time when butterflies were presumed to have demonic qualities. Nonetheless, she fell in love with the winged creatures and devoted her life to understanding their physical composition and life cycles through intensive observation. She chronicled her findings in scientific illustrations, staggering works of art that revealed previously unknown biological processes. “She was someone who got married, had daughters, and then turned a corner at some point and pursued her passion for science and art,” Gaston expressed. “She made choices that were anathema to how women were supposed to lead their lives at the time. Maria left her marriage and, at 52, she brought her daughter to Suriname, a Dutch Colony in South America, for scientific research. As a single woman, alone without a male chaperone, a journey like that was unheard of. It was OK for women to paint flowers in their homes, but they didn’t just go into the rainforest unaccompanied.”At the time, scientists inspected the physical composition of bugs by examining preserved insect collections. Merian was the first to observe the living insects in their natural environments, discovering that bugs were not, in fact, born of the “spontaneous generation of rotting mud.” She archived her findings through delicate and scientifically accurate renderings that exist just at the nexus of art and science. Despite her immense contributions to the realms of art and science, Merian is often overlooked by mainstream scholars, perhaps because of her lack of traditional training and, likely, her XX chromosomes. “Her intrepid spirit I found really fascinating,” Gaston gushed. “She never fully got credit for her work because she was a woman.”Merian’s work is joined by a variety of feminist artists from a wide array of eras, origins, and disciplines ― from Lavinia Fontana’s 16th century “Portrait of a Noblewoman” to Faith Ringgold’s 1997 quilt, immortalizing Josephine Baker’s 1920s banana dance. Oftentimes, the nastiness on view is twofold, in that both the artists and their chosen subjects are unorthodox, brazen and groundbreaking.“If you’re going to do a one-hour tour, there are only so many works you can fit in,” Gaston said. “We want to show that there have always been women in the arts pushing these boundaries this way.” As inauguration weekend draws near, many in the art world and beyond are struggling with the appropriate way to react to and resist a Trump presidency. Many artists and critics are encouraging cultural institutions to go on strike for the day, and use the opportunity to re-imagine the roles theaters, museums, galleries and creative individuals will play in the coming years. Yet, given the threat Trump poses to women’s rights around the nation, spending the weekend paying homage to nasty artists past and present, those who defied expectations and overcame obstacles to inscribe their singular visions onto the halls of history, seems appropriate.“Now it is even more necessary to have a place like the NMWA a few blocks from the White House,” Gaston said. “We’ve always fought to champion women through the arts. The idea of potentially being part of the nation’s conversation in a real way is something we’re really excited about.” If you won’t be in Washington, D.C., for the Women’s March, don’t fret. The best part about the NMWA is that, in essence, every tour is a “Nasty Women” tour.As Gaston put it: “In a way, this tour is special, but in a way it’s what we always do. Here, it’s Women’s History Month every month. This is a perfect time for people to notice what we are doing here, but we’re doing it all the time.”The “Nasty Women” tour will take place Sunday, Jan. 22, at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, from 1–2 p.m. Museum admission will be free all weekend.

It took approximately four seconds in Twitter-time for what the president-elect intended as an insult to become something of a feminist battle cry. “A nasty woman is someone who refuses to be bound by the place society defined for her, someone who blazes her own trail,” Deborah Gaston, director of education at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, explained to The Huffington Post. Although Clinton is the nasty woman that made the term go viral, ladies have been subverting restrictive gendered stereotypes and limitations for centuries. “Going back to the Renaissance,” Gaston continued, “women have been doing things they ‘shouldn’t.’ Well, they did it anyway, and they were successful.” Since it was founded in 1987, the National Museum of Women in the Arts has worked to preserve and share the legacies of such subversive heroines, specifically those engaged in creative work. The only major museum in the world dedicated to celebrating the history of women-identified artists, the NMWA works to derail the longstanding habit of overlooking, undermining and erasing the work of women from the canon. Located just three blocks from the White House, the museum often orchestrates programming that coincides with and addresses major political events.

DeMille Award, explaining how one tiny portion about football and MMA fans really missed the mark.“It was really great except for this one tiny part, for me, where Meryl Streep, like her character in ‘Florence Foster Jenkins,’ was tone-deaf,” he began. “I understand what Meryl Streep was trying to do, and I don’t know if I could’ve done better in that moment, but here’s the thing I feel like we could all learn as people: You don’t have to make your point by shitting on someone else’s thing, because a lot of people love football and the arts.”Streep’s comments had criticized exclusionary ideology.“Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners, and if you kick us all out, you’ll have nothing to watch except for football and mixed martial arts, which are not arts,” she said at the Globes.Noah explained that he watched football with friends Sunday before turning on the Golden Globes. The two are therefore not mutually exclusive. But he concluded by commending Streep’s overall message. “The truth is, if you focus on that part of the speech, you miss the larger point,” he added. “It was a speech about respect; it was a speech about empathy; and, most importantly, it was a speech about responsibility.” "

A similar study conducted in 1994 suggested about two in five gun owners bought firearms without being vetted.The earlier study didn’t directly ask about background checks, however. Respondents only reported whether they purchased their firearms from a federally licensed dealer.“We wanted to address this head on and directly,” Miller told Reuters Health.The U.S. requires background checks for gun purchases in stores but there is less regulation on private sales between individuals, even though most Americans support universal background checks.For the new study, Miller and his colleagues surveyed 1,613 U.S. adult gun owners in 2015.Overall, the researchers report in Annals of Internal Medicine, 22 percent of gun owners said they bought guns in the last two years without undergoing background checks.That proportion grew to half of gun owners when the researchers restricted the analysis to people who made private gun purchases, such as between friends, family members, online or gun shows.In states that require background checks for private gun sales, 26 percent of people did not receive the required vetting. In states with no such regulations, 57 percent purchased guns through private sales without background checks.“I think what it indicates is when people live under these regulations, they’re likely to follow them,” said Miller. Philip Cook writes in an accompany editorial that with only about one in five recent gun purchases needing to be addressed to achieve universal background checks for firearm sales, a new federal requirement would be less disruptive and costly than people thought. “One lesson is that more research is needed on firearm markets and regulatory effect on those market; this is one consequence of the woeful lack of government funding for research on gun violence,” wrote Cook, of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.Miller said it’s not clear whether people who are denied guns as a result of background checks ultimately acquire guns from other sources.“We need more research on the effect of background checks on downstream markets,” said Miller, who also called for more research on gun violence in general.“It would be great if we could get a better understanding of the landscape,” he said.SOURCE: bit.ly/2iKFUuC and bit.ly/2iKIGQD Annals of Internal Medicine, online January 2, 2017."

It is good business and good economics to lead a technical revolution.""",2017-01-09,President Barack Obama wrote about good news in the clean energy sector from recent years in an article published in a scientific journal Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587321991700008501928e26.jpeg?cache=4DJC0itcEn&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama on Monday said the building momentum behind renewable energy is almost unstoppable, despite any plans Donald Trump may have to eviscerate his environmental legacy or to follow through on pledges to expand the production of fossil fuels.In an academic article published in the journal Science, Obama writes about the slew of good news seen in the clean energy sector in recent years: prices are falling, businesses are investing and the world, finally, is listening. All three, he says, “should put to rest the argument that combatting climate change requires accepting lower growth or a lower standard of living.”“Businesses are coming to the conclusion that reducing emissions is not just good for the environment ― it can also boost bottom lines, cut costs for consumers and deliver returns for shareholders,” he said. “This should not be a partisan issue. It is good business and good economics to lead a technical revolution and define market trends.”The journal article is one of several moves undertaken by Obama in the final months of his presidency set on solidifying his administration’s wide-ranging environmental progress. The president has protected more land and water than any of his predecessors. The United States has ratified the landmark Paris climate agreement, and measures such as the Clean Power Plan have sought to dramatically curb domestic emissions from energy production.But all of that progress could very well be undone by the incoming president. Trump has threatened to pull the U.S. out of the Paris deal, has called climate change a hoax created by the Chinese and has chosen the former CEO of Exxon Mobil to be his secretary of state. Promises to “put our miners back to work” rang throughout coal country during his campaign, despite the feasibility of such plans.Obama used the article to challenge many of those pledges, saying the withdrawal from the Paris agreement would “undermine” American interests and lose the country a seat at the table “to hold other countries to their commitments.” He also pointed to dozens of corporations that have committed to go green without government intervention ― including Walmart and General Motors ― as signs of a shift in momentum that will carry on with or without Trump on board.But while Obama conceded that “this does not mean the next administration needs to follow identical domestic policies,” he said the future presents an opportunity that could be of “great benefit for the American people.”“I remain convinced that no country is better suited to confront the climate challenge and reap the economic benefits of a low-carbon future than the United States,” he said, going on to note that “of course, one of the great advantages of our system of government is that each president is able to chart his or her own policy course. And president-elect Donald Trump will have the opportunity to do so.”"

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) on Monday, contending that President-elect Donald Trump’s choice for attorney general can’t be trusted to enforce the law when women’s rights are violated. Women’s groups have roundly criticized Sessions for saying he didn’t think Trump’s comments about grabbing women by their genitals without consent described an act of sexual assault, and for voting against the Violence Against Women Act in 2013. “We do not trust Sen. Jeff Sessions to tackle the epidemic of rape,” said Sophie, a sexual assault survivor who identified herself by her first name only. “If Jeff Sessions doesn’t know the definition of sexual assault, he should withdraw his name from nomination.” The group delivered a poster with the Department of Justice’s definition of sexual assault printed on it. UltraViolet, a national women’s advocacy group, organized the protest. More than 100,000 people have signed a petition from UltraViolet urging the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject Sessions’ appointment.The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence also opposes Sessions’ candidacy. The national coalition of organizations working to end domestic violence and sexual assault released an open letter last week, stating that the senator’s record suggests he won’t fairly enforce the law when it comes to historically marginalized groups.“The role of Attorney General requires a demonstrated commitment to providing equal protection under the law—particularly to people who face discrimination because of their race, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability or other identities,” the group wrote. “Senator Sessions’ history leads us to question whether he will vigorously seek to ensure that all victims and survivors of gender-based violence, particularly vulnerable populations and those at the margins of society, have access to vitally needed services and legal protections.”______Related stories:"

As a point of reference, consider that he had eight drops on 107 “catchable passes” during the regular season, per Pro Football Focus. The thing about being a superstar player is that the responsibility to produce ― particularly in the postseason ― is immense. And Beckham has established himself as a true superstar, earning Second-Team All-Pro honors in consecutive years. Yet, through a series of petulant antics, he has also put a bull’s-eye on his back. Of course, Beckham is hardly the first marquee player to party before a key game, and we know he won’t be the last.“It started before the game,” Beckham said of the disapproving Miami talk. “It happened early, and it did a great job of putting it in people’s minds that, ‘Okay now if the Giants lose, it’s because you went to Miami.’”“There was nothing that could connect seven days ago to today and how we came out and played and executed.

Truth be told, it’s not even about the boat. The picture and the video were not ideal, but the way it played with teammates, coaches and fans was even more important. Even if Beckham’s intentions were good, and even if he had played well, traveling to Miami six days before playing at Lambeau Field is seen as just plain wrong. That’s the type of activity that should be reserved for the offseason.This does not mean Beckham cost his team the game ― a 38-13 Packers win. An ineffective offensive line, a critical injury to starting cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and an onslaught of conservative play-calling by head coach Ben McAdoo were all contributing factors.

But last week, a growing number of Republican senators expressed concern over congressional leaders’ willingness to repeal the law without having a replacement, or at least a framework, ready to go.“We are taking to the floor and social media to denounce this plan and warn the American people that the Democrats will be fighting tooth and nail against this potentially catastrophic move,” Schumer said in a statement provided to The Huffington Post.Monday’s show of force is an effort by Democrats to capitalize, in particular, on that rift among Republicans.“We cannot allow Republicans to make America sick again by repealing the ACA without a replacement plan that will ensure millions of Americans are not kicked off of their insurance, seniors do not face cuts to their Medicare, women are not denied access to care because of their gender, and many other groups, including Medicaid recipients, rural hospitals and more, do not suffer,” Schumer said. “Right now, the GOP’s plan would put the insurance companies back in the driver’s seat and create chaos in the system instead of affordable care.”On Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that “no action is not an option” on Obamacare. Speaking on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” McConnell wouldn’t predict when his party would come up with a replacement, only that it would be done “rapidly.”But the “first step” to repealing the Affordable Care Act “will be taken in the Senate by the end of this week,” he said.Congressional Democrats have few tools at their disposal and cannot actually stop the repeal. Still, they hope to capture the public’s attention by pointing to the 30 million Americans who stand to lose health insurance if the law is gutted."

In addition to helping government officials better understand their cities, the company undoubtedly hopes the information will lead to smarter infrastructure investment decisions, thereby benefiting Uber as well.“We don’t manage streets. We don’t plan infrastructure,” Andrew Salzberg, Uber’s chief of transportation policy, told Wired. “So why have this stuff bottled up when it can provide immense value to the cities we’re working in?”Uber initially opened the service to Manila, Philippines; Sydney; and Washington, D.C., as a trial, and says it will add more cities in the coming weeks. Eventually, the company says Movement will be “freely available to the public.”While Movement’s potential benefits are great, traffic planners may want to temper their expectations. A similar program implemented by Uber in Boston in 2015 has so far failed to deliver, with The Boston Globe concluding it has “not lived up to [the] hype so far.”“While the data has been very useful in understanding the growth of [transportation network companies] and their service profile in the city,” Boston CIO Jascha Franklin-Hodge told The Boston Globe, “we’ve not had a lot of big success in putting the data to use in a more planning-oriented context.”It’s interesting timing for the announcement. Last week, Uber sparred publicly with the New York City Taxi & Limo Commission, which wants access to the company’s rider destination data, something it currently requires of taxis in the city. "

(Reuters) - The 26-year-old Iraq war veteran accused of killing five people at a busy Florida airport in the latest U.S. gun rampage appeared in a federal court on Monday on charges that could bring him the death penalty.Esteban Santiago, who had a history of erratic behavior, was escorted into the courtroom near Fort Lauderdale for the brief hearing surrounded by U.S. marshals and wearing a red jail jumpsuit and shackles.He has admitted to investigators that he planned Friday’s attack at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and bought a one-way ticket from his home in Alaska to carry it out, according to a criminal complaint.Authorities say they have not ruled out terrorism as a motive and that they are investigating whether mental illness played a role. In November, Santiago went to a Federal Bureau of Investigation office in Anchorage and told agents he believed U.S. spies were controlling his mind.Santiago spoke little during the hearing, confirming to U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia Valle that he understood the charges, and that he is a U.S. citizen. He said he did not have his own lawyer, and he was assigned a federal public defender.Asked about his employment, Santiago said that for the last couple of years he had worked in Anchorage for a company called Signal 88 Security, earning about $2,000 per month. He told the court he had only $5 to $10 in his bank account.Prosecutors called for Santiago, who is being held at the Broward County Jail in Fort Lauderdale, to be denied bail, and Valle scheduled a Jan. 17 hearing to discuss the request. Legal experts have said it is very unlikely he would be released.“They’ve then got two weeks to indict him, and then they’ve got to go through the whole death penalty review,” said former federal prosecutor David Weinstein, a partner with Miami law firm Clarke Silverglate.Santiago could face the death penalty if convicted on charges that include carrying out violence at an airport and killing with a firearm. But it may be months before prosecutors reveal whether they will seek the death penalty.Executions have been on hold in Florida since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state’s death penalty laws a year ago. The Florida Supreme Court overturned a rewritten version in October.Six people were wounded by gunshots in the attack, and three dozen suffered minor injuries in the chaos as passengers and airport workers fled.Authorities say Santiago arrived on a connecting flight from Alaska and retrieved a 9mm semi-automatic handgun from his checked luggage before loading it in a bathroom.He then returned to the baggage claim area and walked “while shooting in a methodical manner” 10 to 15 times, aiming at his victims’ heads, according to the criminal complaint.Information surfaced over the weekend that police in Alaska took a handgun from Santiago in November after he told FBI agents there his mind was being controlled by a U.S. intelligence agency. They returned it to him about a month later after a medical evaluation found he was not mentally ill.Anchorage’s police chief told reporters on Saturday that Santiago reported at the time having “terroristic thoughts” and believed he was being influenced by the Islamic State militant group.Video published by the website TMZ on Sunday showed the gunman walking calmly past the airport’s luggage carousels before pulling the handgun from his waistband and shooting at victims, who fled or dived to the floor.Santiago served from 2007 to 2016 in the Puerto Rico and Alaska national guards, including a deployment to Iraq from 2010 to 2011, according to the Pentagon. Relatives have said he acted erratically since returning from Iraq.The attack was the latest in a series of mass shootings in the United States. Some were inspired by Islamist militants, while others were carried out by loners or the mentally disturbed.(Reporting by Zachary Fagenson; Writing by Daniel Wallis; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Dan Grebler)"

They are seen here in Geneva, Switzerland, last March.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586fccb61200002d00ad6012.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This piece is part of a series on Obama’s legacy that The Huffington Post will be publishing over the next week.WASHINGTON ― The bombs kept falling after they had destroyed all the hospitals.They kept coming as international aid agencies warned about the thousands of Syrian children they could hit.They didn’t pause as temperatures fell below freezing, threatening families with no shelter, or as pro-regime fighters came close enough to civilians to start killing them execution-style, in the streets and in their homes. An “evacuation” was in the offing, the government promised. Residents knew what that meant: abandoning their homes, risking arrest and torture and being shuttled to an unfamiliar region that the regime would eventually target even more brutally.By Dec. 16, Syrian President Bashar Assad’s militiamen had detained hundreds of evacuees and thousands of people had already died. And President Barack Obama stood at his last White House press briefing and said he had made the right call in not using the world’s most powerful military to protect the tens of thousands of people in the city under attack, Aleppo and those affected by Syria’s civil war in general.“It was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap,” the president said, after arguing that only a major U.S. ground presence could have prevented the ongoing war crimes.But many of Obama’s diplomats, responsible for years of negotiations over the conflict, disagreed. In a June letter sent through an internal dissent mechanism, 51 State Department officials said there was a way to spur diplomatic efforts to prevent the massacres in Aleppo and elsewhere. And it didn’t involve the kind of ground invasion or chest-thumping show of “credibility” that Obama repeatedly said was the only alternative to his inaction. “None of us sees, or has seen, merit in a large-scale U.S. invasion of Syria,” the officials wrote. “But we do see merit in a more militarily assertive U.S. role in Syria, based on the judicious use of stand-off and air weapons, which would undergird and drive a more focused and hardnosed U.S.-led diplomatic process.”Privately, Secretary of State John Kerry frequently urged a similar step. After spending years on painful nuclear negotiations with Iran to reduce the risk of a U.S. conflict with the country, Kerry was hardly one of the warmongers who Obama associates with the idea of military action against Assad. He has also avoided the speculative talk of people who had wanted Obama to strike Assad in 2013 or spent years calling for stronger weapons to be sent to anti-regime forces that included growing numbers of extremists. All along, he believed diplomacy was key. But he felt it would never be effective without a signal that the U.S. would act if it didn’t ― that diplomacy only matters if it is linked to facts on the ground, and that those on the other side of the table, Assad and his friends in Moscow and Tehran, were creating facts rapidly while deliberately stalling diplomacy.Obama’s response to that idea reflects the principle that guided his approach to the world beyond American shores: that the U.S. should constantly think about the limits of its power.The outgoing president has stuck to that notion through diplomatic victories achieved by toning down U.S. militarism and overreaction — notably progress on American relationships with Iran, Cuba and Myanmar, and the peaceful transfer of hundreds of detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility to other countries. And he’s held to it through moments like the fall of Aleppo — reminders that his approach entails major instability for years ahead and major damage to America’s ability to speak of global human rights. As he exits the White House, there is little certainty that Obama is leaving behind a world safer for all or better for the U.S.Obama’s approach bore fruit in situations where traditional American actions were counterproductive to U.S. goals. By easing the embargo on Cuba while remaining critical of its rulers’ repression, he helped weaken skepticism of the United States’ position on the island. That meant Washington had fresh goodwill in Latin America and a new opportunity to try to engage on issues like human rights, while both the U.S. and Cuba could benefit from previously impossible trade. His landmark diplomacy with Iran was more fraught, given that it meant tacitly permitting Assad’s butchery. But it worked in a similar way: By trying financial sanctions and direct diplomacy rather than sabre-rattling, Obama secured an agreement that experts and Iran skeptics agreed was a powerful, historic check on Iran’s nuclear ambitions. He reduced the risk of a fresh war or nuclear arms race in a turbulent region and curbed nuclear proliferation in general. Along the way, he supported his team in establishing a rare channel with Tehran that enabled the release of three Americans held in Iranian jail.Because Obama’s “America-must-do-less” approach required other countries’ help to work, it allowed the U.S. to reach important compromises by acknowledging others’ goals as valid and identifying where those nations could have mutual interests with Washington. This is how he successfully wooed China to become a top backer of the Paris climate deal, for instance, and developed tacit coordination with Iran to battle the vicious Islamic State group and support the shaky but essential central government in Iraq. This has been part of his approach to Europe, where he has tried to address the specific needs of NATO partners — beefed-up border security with Russia, mostly — while prodding the European Union to do more for its own protection, like maintaining unity behind German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the face of their financial crisis and upholding painful EU sanctions on Russia to show that there are consequences for actions like its 2014 invasion of Ukraine.But this emphasis on America’s limits entails major costs — most dramatically where Obama has cited others’ power as a reason to avoid American action.Syria is the prime example. After he decided not to hit Assad in retribution for his chemical attack on more than 1,000 civilians in 2013, Obama often spoke about how he forged a deal with Moscow over the Syrian dictator’s chemical weapons stockpile and how Syrian opposition groups would never be capable of unseating the tyrant’s decades-old army. Once the rebels’ success against Assad so threatened his regime that Russia came to his aid in 2015, the president’s team began telling reporters that U.S. action was even more difficult because it might lead to World War III. Each talking point tried to mask how this was a self-fulfilling prophecy. Seeing the situation as analogous to Iraq, despite the fact that it involved homegrown Syrian dissent rather than externally imposed regime change, Obama believed the U.S. could do little to alter the situation in Syria. That shaped the United States’ response — and ensured that there was, in fact, little America could eventually do. Assad’s regime, the chief driver of the refugee crisis weakening Europe and of cynical policies that benefit groups like ISIS, will now outlast Obama’s and likely continue using chemical weapons. Meanwhile, the president must deal with the consequences of choosing not to release information about Russian hacking of the American presidential election to try and protect the pretence of U.S.-Russia negotiations over Syria.Obama’s approach worsened other crises because he wedded his perception of reined-in American power to the idea that others should take the lead on international problems. In some instances, that meant allowing U.S. partners to act in ways that ended up fueling militancy and anti-Americanism. By signaling that Saudi Arabia should act as it saw fit in Yemen and not expect Washington-made policy, Obama enabled hundreds of war crimes, the starvation of tens of thousands and the creation of a power vacuum that ISIS and Al Qaeda have exploited. In Libya, he lost the potential gains of a successful humanitarian intervention because he silently allowed the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey to establish a proxy war, leaving the tussle to develop for years before trying to step in. And in Iraq, the Obama team’s eagerness to hand off a problem and fulfil his campaign promise of bringing home U.S. troops permitted a sectarian, brutal prime minister to mistreat his population, convincing thousands of Iraqis that ISIS was their only protector. In recent years, he has been silent as Turkey has become increasingly repressive ― in part because he is desperate to maintain some kind of dialogue with the NATO ally, since he worsened U.S.-Turkish ties by avoiding tougher action on Assad and focusing his Syria policy on Kurds linked to terrorism within Turkey.The president’s response when people note his acquiescence to such excesses is that other nations will realize the error of their ways. Russia, he predicted, would feel the pain of being bogged down in Syria; Saudi Arabia and other U.S. partners would come to prioritize political reform and opportunities for their own repressed populations over fixating on Iran. With Russian President Vladimir Putin thrilled about Assad’s survival and the heavily armed Arab Gulf states even angrier with Iran, these lessons now seem more elusive than ever. Meanwhile, human misery and disillusionment with the United States’ soaring rhetoric is in growing abundance.Where he has been compelled to act in some form, Obama has stuck to the view that U.S. moves are unlikely to be decisive. That’s inspired band-aid style actions that seem designed to save face, like tough talk on Chinese expansionism without strong efforts to make America’s partners commit to international law rather than give in to Beijing. The president’s policy of slowing down the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan fits the bill. Although it’s done little to permanently protect the fragile Afghan government from an increasingly assertive Taliban insurgency, it has helped prevent a complete collapse of the country on Obama’s watch. So does his much-lauded policy of “surgical” precision in targeting militant fighters using drones and other means. It removes top-tier figures in the Islamic State and Al Qaeda ― providing flashy headlines ― without addressing the fundamental problems in the Muslim-majority world and elsewhere that have aided their rise. Obama has, meanwhile, sharply reduced U.S. government attempts to tackle those problems, through engagement with civil society and efforts at political reconciliation.“Obama is now using force to defeat ISIS while abjuring the work necessary to build something with which to replace it. That path bodes ill for the anti-ISIS project he has launched, and recreates for the next U.S. president the same dysfunctions in U.S.-Arab relations—moral hazard, security overcommitments, and the like—that Obama resents,” Tamara Cofman Wittes, a former top State Department official and current senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, wrote earlier last year. “It is a tragic irony: A president elected and reelected on a platform of ending wars in the Middle East has reproduced, at the end of his presidency, the very situation he inherited, decried, and swore to avoid: an escalating war against a vague terrorist enemy, with no geographic boundaries, no clear military or strategic objectives, and no principles or policies that might stop the slide down this slippery slope.”Although she believes the president is right to target ISIS, Wittes explained, she worries that he and his supporters will continue to feel that the terrorist group’s rise is evidence that his reluctance to engage with the Middle East was justified — rather than a sign that inaction has heavy penalties.President-elect Donald Trump has yet to lay out any kind of coherent diplomatic strategy. But in some important ways, the Obama years created an opening for what seems to be in store: An abandonment of the idea that moral priorities should guide foreign policy in favor of a deep conviction that others — other nations, other peoples — should deal with their own problems however they see fit."

Gulen denies involvement in the coup.Ankara has also been angered by U.S. support for a Kurdish militia group fighting Islamic State in Syria. Turkey sees the group as an extension of the PKK, which has waged a three-decade insurgency for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey and has been behind a spate of recent bombings.“I believe we will accelerate dialog when Mr Trump takes office,” Erdogan told a conference of Turkish ambassadors. “I believe we will reach a consensus with Mr Trump, particularly on regional issues.”Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told the envoys he believed Trump would not make what he called the same mistakes as the outgoing U.S. administration. Washington should extradite Gulen and end cooperation with the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia.CONSPIRACIESThe United States has long been cast by some nationalist and Islamist elements as the guiding hand behind plots to undermine Turkey. Conspiracy theories have reached fever pitch in recent weeks, and in some cases been fueled by elected officials.The Islamist Yeni Akit newspaper said last week that a New Year’s Day shooting which killed 39 people in an Istanbul nightclub, claimed by Islamic State, was a “joint production” by the CIA, Israel’s Mossad spy agency, and what the Turkish government calls “FETO,” the Gulenist Terror Organisation.“Daesh (Islamic State), the PKK and FETO are terror groups with strings linked to the same center. Along with many secret services, the most active user is the CIA,” Samil Tayyar, a ruling AK Party lawmaker, said on Twitter after the attack.Such comments prompted a rebuke last Thursday from U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby: “Incendiary and false accusations about the U.S. in Turkish media are offensive and could endanger our citizens. Must stop,” he wrote on Twitter.Any honeymoon with the new Trump administration is likely to be short-lived.U.S. officials have made clear the issue of Gulen’s extradition is a matter for the courts, not a question of political will, and that such a process could take years.Trump’s policy on the Kurdish YPG is unclear. He has indicated, though, that his priority in the multi-sided Syrian conflict will be fighting Islamic State - not forcing President Bashar al-Assad to leave power as Turkey has long desired."

That’s the way it is,” the pope said, according to Agence France-Presse. “You mothers, go ahead and breastfeed, without fear. Just like the Virgin Mary nursed Jesus,” he added.The Feast of the Baptism of the Lord commemorates the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River. During the ceremony on Sunday, the pope baptized 28 children in the Sistine Chapel. When several babies started crying at once, he reportedly joked, “the concert has begun” and later suggested that perhaps Jesus’ cries as a baby were the substance of his first “homily.”Pope Francis has famously invited mothers to breastfeed at this same service in the past. In 2015, he addressed worshipers with babies: “You mothers give your children milk and even now, if they cry because they are hungry, breastfeed them, don’t worry.”In a 2013 interview, he also said he believes women should feel comfortable feeding their babies whenever they’re hungry and feel no shame nursing in public. Francis knows how to be a breastfeeding ally!"

Both nations have been developing missiles of varying ranges since they conducted nuclear tests in May 1998.“Pakistan eyes this hallmark development as a step towards reinforcing the policy of credible minimum deterrence,” the military’s media wing said in a statement.A spokesman at the Indian defense ministry was not immediately available to comment on the Pakistani missile test.India successfully test-fired a nuclear-capable, submarine-launched missile in 2008 and tested a submarine-launched cruise missile in 2013.The Pakistani military said the Babur-3 missile was “capable of delivering various types of payloads and will provide Pakistan with a Credible Second Strike Capability, augmenting deterrence.”An army spokesman later confirmed the language meant the missile was equipped to carry nuclear warheads.The Babur-3 is a sea-based variant of the ground-launched Babur-2 missile, which was tested in December. The military said the missile had features such as “underwater controlled propulsion and advanced guidance and navigation.”Last year, Pakistan said it was “seriously concerned” by India’s test of anti-ballistic missiles which media reports said could intercept incoming nuclear weapons.According to media reports, on May 15 India tested a locally designed Anti-Ballistic Missile system which could in theory intercept a nuclear-carrying ballistic missile."

Jackson early in the trailer for “I Am Not Your Negro.”“It is not a pretty story.”The words are James Baldwin’s; the documentary, by Raoul Peck, is based on the author’s final, unfinished book, Remember This House. The manuscript was meant to explore the interwoven lives and shocking deaths of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. ― three Civil Rights–era leaders who were assassinated in the 1960s.Though the book did not come close to being finished prior to Baldwin’s death, Peck mined the pages of notes left behind as a jumping-off point for “I Am Not Your Negro.” The documentary, which received rave reviews after premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival, combines clips of Baldwin speaking in forceful, fiery terms on racism in America with Jackson’s solemn, rumbling delivery of lines from his famous and never-published writings alike.Few have matched the author of The Fire Next Time and Go Tell It on the Mountain for insight and searingly eloquent prose on the subject of black American oppression. Peck leans into this advantage by featuring only Baldwin’s words in the film. In the Village Voice, Odie Henderson applauded the documentary for “masterfully syncing Baldwin’s words to a series of images that bind past and present.”As this chilling trailer reveals, just a handful of Baldwin’s words and few shocking images from the civil rights struggle can speak volumes ― and, sadly, the message has never been more relevant.“I Am Not Your Negro” is finally coming to theaters on Feb. 3.

He ventured that if they can get 3 percent to 6 percent growth, “we’ll do that.”Priebus’ suggestion that higher economic growth could close the programs’ funding gaps is similar to claims Trump made as a candidate. In fact, while higher economic growth would boost the finances of Social Security in particular, there is no independent analysis that suggests it is capable of resolving the programs’ financial challenges entirely.Trump’s promises not to mess with Social Security and Medicare, unheard of for a Republican presidential candidate, were one of the most distinctive features of his campaign.He even claimed he was a more reliable defender of the programs than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, given her past support for the deficit reduction “framework” of the Bowles-Simpson plan, a bipartisan proposal that cut Social Security.“We are going to save Social Security,” Trump said at an October campaign rally. “She is going to cut your Social Security and your Medicare.”But Priebus’ remarks represent the Trump transition team’s first official comment since the election about his promises to protect the two popular social insurance programs. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation that Trump’s determination not to “meddle” with the programs is an explicit promise not to consider benefit cuts, or something more or less comprehensive.John Hishta, senior vice president of campaigns for AARP, tweeted his approval of Priebus’ remarks, warning that the giant seniors group “will fight any attempts by Congress to cut benefits or raise costs for seniors.” (The tweet also appeared to mark a change in tactics for AARP, whose election initiative, Take a Stand, insisted that candidates present their proposals for the major programs without regard to whether those plans cut benefits.)It is unclear whether congressional Republicans intent on transforming Medicare and reducing Social Security benefits will try to challenge Trump’s stance. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has said that repealing Obamacare must include major reforms to Medicare. Ryan has long proposed turning Medicare’s insurance guarantee into a voucher program by which the government would give seniors money to purchase insurance.Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, also presented a plan in December to dramatically scale back Social Security benefits.Congressional Democrats and the independents who caucus with them have been eager to pounce on the slightest indication that Trump will betray his campaign promises.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) demanded at a Wednesday press conference that Trump promise to veto any cuts to not only Social Security and Medicare but also Medicaid.“If he makes that clear to his Republican colleagues, we can save us all a whole lot of time and start getting to work doing what this country desperately needs to have done,” Sanders said.This post has bee updated with comment from AARP."

In protest of the occasion, a group of 130 artists and critics have signed a petition calling for cultural institutions around the nation to close for the entire day.The J20 Art Strike implores museums, galleries, schools, non-profits, studios, theaters and concert halls to refrain from conducting business as usual in an attempt to resist what organizers call the “normalization of Trumpism ― a toxic mix of white supremacy, misogyny, xenophobia, militarism, and oligarchic rule.” Instead, creative citizens are called upon to hit the streets, protest and recalculate the role of such cultural spaces over the next four years.“We consider Art Strike to be one tactic among others,” the petition states. “Like any tactic, it is not an end in itself, but rather an intervention that will ramify into the future. It is not a strike against art, theater, or any other cultural form. It is an invitation to motivate these activities anew, to reimagine these spaces as places where resistant forms of thinking, seeing, feeling, and acting can be produced.”Given the sweeping socioeconomic disparities in the art world, the Art Strike aims to prioritize voices that are particularly threatened by Trump’s impending presidency. It challenges art-world actors to protect the importance of diversity, individuality and free self-expression in a time when the future of such values remains in question.“However you choose to respond to this call, Art Strike is an occasion for public accountability, an opportunity to affirm and enact the values that our cultural institutions claim to embody,” the petition states. Artists including Joan Jonas, Barbara Kruger, Simone Leigh, Cindy Sherman, Trevor Paglen and Dread Scott are among the signees along with critics Hilton Als, Chris Kraus and Lucy Lippard.Some art institutions, however, have resolved to remain open during the inauguration day, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Los Angeles.Miranda Carroll, LACMA’s director of communications, explained the museum’s stance in an email to The New York Times: “Our entire program and mission, every day, is an expression of inclusion and appreciation of every culture.”The Outsider Art Fair will also take place throughout inauguration weekend in New York.While most art-world inhabitants abstaining from the protest believe in both the importance of open art institutions and J20 Art Strike’s overall mission, Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones strongly doubts the strike’s effectiveness. “Such a protest can only help the participants feel good about themselves. It is at best a way of saying ‘not in my name,’ and cannot conceivably do anything to curb Trump or ensure his electoral defeat next time around,” Jones wrote in an op-ed on Monday.He continued, “Let’s face it: art and serious culture are completely marginal to American life. Trump’s victory proves that. Closing museums is not likely to have any impact on those who support him. With all due respect, they might be affected a lot more if reality television shows went on strike.”Jones’ comments come just after Meryl Streep used her Golden Globes achievement award speech to condemn Trump’s bullying as well as his hostility toward immigrants and the press. Whether or not such acts of defiance from the creative sphere will influence the president-elect is yet to be seen, though at the very least, Streep got under his skin.As Inauguration Day draws near, cultural institutions and creative individuals can decide for themselves whether or not an art strike is the appropriate reaction to what will be, for many, a difficult day.But for those who decide to strike, you have some very gifted artists and thinkers on your side.

Her drive to privatize education is demonstrably destructive to public schools and to the educational success of all of our children,” Weingarten said in a speech at the National Press Club in which she laid out priorities for public education. The AFT endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the campaign, and Weingarten has long been a close personal ally of the former secretary of state. The union came out against DeVos, who has never worked in a public school, when Trump named her as his education secretary pick in November. Weingarten spoke specifically about the new Every Student Succeeds Act, which passed with delicate bipartisan support to replace the long-expired No Child Left Behind Act. She called DeVos “a billionaire with an agenda” who could reignite “education wars” between Democrats and Republicans.“If DeVos is confirmed — if she shatters this hard-won consensus, if she reignites the education wars — she will demonstrate that her ultimate goal is to undermine public schools, the schools that 90 percent of American children attend,” Weingarten said. Teachers unions have warned that DeVos’ favored education initiatives operate at the expense of traditional public schools. The billionaire DeVos family, which is based in Michigan, has poured money into propping up charter schools and private schools in the state. The family helped drive an initiative in 2000 that would allow for students to use taxpayer money to attend private schools in the state. After that initiative failed, DeVos pushed for similar voucher programs around the country. DeVos has worked to expand charter schools in Detroit, which are sometimes operated for profit. Critics have questioned her support of expanding these programs, as charter schools in Michigan score worse on national tests than their traditional school counterparts ― which also don’t perform very well. In particular, public schools in Detroit are consistently ranked among the worst in the nation on math and reading. “She’s devoted millions to elect her friends and punish her enemies, and, at every critical moment, she has tried to take the public out of public education,” Weingarten said. She ended her speech by challenging DeVos to spend more time in public schools.In anticipation of the speech, a spokesman for the group Friends of Betsy DeVos said that “in a nutshell, labor’s opposition to Betsy is about loss of power and turf.” “Randi Weingarten this morning will be preaching to the pro-status quo choir,” Ed Patru said in a statement for the group. “Most Americans do not support organized labor’s opposition to accountability. Betsy DeVos this week will show up for her confirmation hearing with the support of millions of parents – Republicans and Democrats alike – who are fed up with business as usual in education and are clamoring for a public policy shift that puts kids first, rather than the education establishment.”Some members of the Republican establishment have praised Trump for selecting DeVos. Her “key qualification is that she cares deeply about our children and will do everything in her power to offer them a brighter future,” Mitt Romney, the party’s presidential nominee in 2012, wrote in The Washington Post over the weekend. However, Democrats have expressed alarm over the deep-pocketed donor’s potential conflicts of interest and have said they’d like DeVos’ confirmation hearing ― which is scheduled for this Wednesday ― to be postponed until the Office of Government Ethics has finished a review of her financial holdings. ――Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

Sullivan then “slowly squeezed the life out of her,” court documents say. He allegedly told investigators that strangling the teen “was more physical and took much longer than he expected.”The hours “leading up to her murder were probably the most horrible and traumatic that any person should ever have had to experience,” Weintraub said.Following the murder, the couple packed the teen’s body in mothballs and cat litter “so that she would not rot and stink,” Weintraub said.Three days after the killing, Sara Packer filed a missing person report with local police. When investigators announced in October they were entering the teen into a national database for missing and unidentified persons, Packer and Sullivan allegedly moved Grace’s body to a bathtub, where authorities say they used a bow saw to remove her limbs.Two hunters found the girl’s discarded torso in Luzerne County on Halloween. Investigators located the teen’s arms and legs when they scoured the area for clues.After the discovery, authorities named Sara Packer a person of interest in her daughter’s death and arrested her on charges of obstructing the administration of law and endangering the welfare of a child.“Sara Packer failed to give accurate information to the police and otherwise impeded the investigation” into Grace’s disappearance, Weintraub told Scranton’s WNEP-TV after her arrest.Authorities also revealed that Packer had not reported her daughter’s disappearance to Social Security and had continued to collect $712 a month in disability benefits for the missing teen. It’s unclear what the girl’s disability was, according to The Associated Press.Packer was freed from jail after posting $10,000 bond.Authorities say Sullivan was involved in a polyamorous relationship with Packer and another woman, who has not been identified. That other woman called authorities on Dec. 30 and reported finding Sullivan unresponsive in their home, police said.Sullivan was transported to a local hospital, where he was treated for a prescription drug overdose. Authorities found a handwritten suicide note, allegedly written by Sullivan. The note, according to the affidavit, reads:“Dear babies,Later that same day, Packer was also found unresponsive. She too was taken to an area hospital, where she was treated for a drug overdose.Police say Packer told hospital staff that she and Sullivan had attempted to take their own lives as part of a suicide pact.Authorities got their first big break on Jan. 7, when hospital staff told them Sullivan had admitted he was responsible for the death of Grace Packer. He also allegedly named Sara Packer as an accomplice.Questioned by police, Sullivan allegedly said he and Packer had been plotting to kill Grace since the fall of 2015. According to Weintraub, the couple allegedly wanted to act out a “rape-murder fantasy” they shared.“They wanted to see a certain result come about to satisfy some sick, perverted fantasy of theirs,” Weintraub said Sunday. “They turned that fantasy into a horrible nightmare reality for Grace Packer.”Sullivan allegedly told police he took Viagra before raping the teen, and claimed that Sara Packer became “sexually aroused” when she watched him assault the girl.Packer, reportedly a former caseworker with Northampton County’s children and youth agency, was arrested Saturday on charges of homicide, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, possessing instruments of crime, endangering the welfare of a child, abuse of corpse, simple assault, tampering with physical evidence and conspiracy.Sullivan faces charges of homicide, rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, unlawful restraint, kidnapping, possessing instruments of crime, endangering the welfare of a child, abuse of corpse, simple assault, tampering with physical evidence and conspiracy.Both suspects were ordered held without bond at the Bucks County Correctional Facility.Weintraub, who described the crimes as “heinous,” “depraved” and “unspeakable,” said the couple could face the death penalty.“To them, she was, unfortunately, a disposable child, and that’s nowhere near acceptable,” the prosecutor said.Need help?

Air China has become the first airline from mainland China to ban shark fin cargo. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58733ec11200002d00ad6624.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In what has been hailed as a far-reaching victory for global shark conservation, Air China has become the first airline in mainland China to ban shark fin cargo on its flights.The airline, which is headquartered in Beijing, announced the ban on Friday.“We were one of the first airlines in China to raise the awareness of the unsustainability of the global shark trade,” says a message on the carrier’s website. “We understand the community’s desire to promote responsible and sustainable marine sourcing practices, and this remains important to Air China Cargo’s overall sustainable development goals.”China is one of the world’s top importers of shark fins. Alex Hofford, a Hong Kong-based activist with the conservation group WildAid, told The Washington Post this week that an estimated 73 million sharks are killed every year for their fins, most of which are “destined for China.” Air China’s decision to ban the transport of fins is thus particularly significant, Hofford said. “It’s a bold move, and... is likely to have a huge and lasting impact on shark populations and marine ecosystems worldwide,” he told the Post.At least 35 other airlines, including several Asian carriers like Singapore Airlines and Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific, have also committed to banning shark fin cargo. Seventeen global container shipping companies, including Cosco Shipping, China’s largest shipping and ­logistics company, have made similar pledges.WildAid said on its website last week that it will be putting pressure on other Chinese airlines and shipping companies to follow in the footsteps of Air China. “WildAid... will be approaching China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Beijing Capital Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Xiamen Air, Tianjin Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Shandong Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, SF Airlines and all other airlines [to] follow Air China’s leadership in protecting sharks by cutting off the supply chain of shark fin to significant markets for endangered species such as Hong Kong and Guangzhou,” the organization said.WildAid also singled out the American courier giant FedEx for its failure to take a stand for sharks. Despite several campaigns, protests and petitions urging FedEx to prohibit shark fins, and despite decisions in recent years by rivals DHL and UPS to ban transport of the items, FedEx has refused to budge on the matter. According to The Washington Post, WildAid sent a letter to the U.S. government and FedEx directors on Sunday calling on the company to reconsider its position. “China is doing the right thing. How about the United States?” the group wrote. The shark fin trade is the greatest threat to shark populations worldwide, according to conservationists. Shark fins, served in a soup still considered a delicacy in many Asian countries, are often sliced off while the animal is still alive. The shark is then left to die at sea.A movement to dampen demand for the dish has been gaining momentum in recent years. Anti-shark fin campaigns have been launched in several leading shark fin markets, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. In 2012, China made news when it announced that state banquets would no longer feature shark fin soup on the menu. Several major hotels in the region pledged to ban the dish in 2014. To the delight of conservationists, these efforts have yielded some success. Last year, the Chinese government said shark fin imports to the country had plunged by 82 percent between 2012 and 2015. Also last year, more than 80 percent of consumers in Singapore, thought to be the second largest shark fin trading nation, said they would support laws to reduce shark fin consumption, according to a World Wide Fund for Nature survey.But an uphill battle remains. A 2016 survey conducted in Hong Kong found that more than 98 percent of restaurants in the territory still served shark fin soup. “The results are shocking and are far worse [than] we’d expected,” Joan Chan, campaign director of the Hong Kong Shark Foundation, which conducted the survey, told the South China Morning Post at the time. “Hong Kong people are consuming a lot more shark fin than we think.” And though Hong Kong’s shark fin exports to mainland China have declined in recent years, other trading hubs have emerged in the region. According to a recent study conducted by the wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic, Vietnam was the largest importer of Hong Kong’s shark fins in 2010, 2013 and 2014, rather than mainland China.“Shifting trade routes in recent years means it’s no longer safe to conclude that a decrease in imports in mainland China, for example, equates to a drop in the overall global shark fin and meat trade,” Joyce Wu, the study’s author, said in November. “You need to see the bigger picture to appreciate fully what’s actually going on.”A 2009 report published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature stated that more than 30 percent of the 64 species of sharks and rays assessed by the group were found to be threatened or near-threatened with extinction. Overfishing was the primary threat facing these animals, the IUCN said."

I’m talking about the 1950s, that Edenic, Father-Knows-Best era that Donald Trump now yearns so deeply to bring back in order to “make America great again.” Compared to the apocalyptic fears of those years, present American ones would seem punk indeed, if it weren’t for the way our 24/7 media blow them out of all proportion. I’m thinking, of course, mainly about terror attacks by various “lone wolves” that tend to dominate the news. You know, the disturbed individuals who pick up a butcher knife or assault rifle and head for the nearest mall or club or college campus, or point a deadly vehicle toward a crowd with mayhem and murder in mind. In 2016, in our increasingly securitized world (and language), such individuals have even gained their own official acronym: homegrown violent extremists, or HVEs. If I think back to the nightmares of my own childhood, fears about the depredations of HVEs don’t add up to a hill of beans. As a boy, I well remember the 1950s version of such hysteria and it concerned the obliteration of the city I lived in via a Cold War nuclear confrontation (of the sort that did indeed come close to happening). Like Bert the Turtle, at school we kids all “ducked and covered” in atomic drills. With Conelrad blasting from the radio on my teacher’s desk, I can remember crouching beneath my own, hands pathetically over my head, as if I could truly protect myself from an atomic attack. Outside sirens screamed and the activities of city life came to a halt.For those of us who grew up then, just under nostalgic memories of the golden Fifties lies a vision of a world in ashes. Of course, we children had only a vague idea of what exactly had happened beneath the mushroom clouds that rose in August 1945 over two Japanese cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but we knew enough to realize that the message being delivered was not of safety but of ultimate vulnerability. In those moments (and the nuclear nightmares that, at least in my own life, went with them), the country secretly prepared the way for the Sixties, indicating that just below the surface of American triumphalism lay a vision of potentially horrifying defeat.In our recent history, however, the most dangerous moment of all may have been one of next to no fears, only of expectations for the glories of an all-American world. I’m thinking of the years Andrew Bacevich, author of America’s War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History, returns to today in “The Age of Expectations and the Great Void,” the ones after the Berlin Wall was first breeched and the Soviet Union, that “evil empire” of Cold War fame, simply vanished, leaving behind only... well, us. That was the moment when the political and intellectual elite who had fought the Cold War and the corporate elite, including the warrior corporations of the military-industrial complex who had risen to power and fortune inside it, were suddenly staggered to discover that there seemed to be no one left to oppose them, nothing to stop them from doing their damnedest.It was quite a moment, as Bacevich recalls, and it led us fearlessly (so to speak) into our present situation, which he aptly labels “the void.” Given where we’ve ended up in the age of Donald Trump, maybe all of us might have been better off tormented by a few more fears and fantasies of destruction, not construction."

Their health improved after they were both given medication used to treat high blood pressure in humans, placed on high-fiber diets and made to forage for food scattered in their enclosure.But Bebac, a favorite of zoo fans, began failing a month ago, and veterinarians were unable to save his life.Veterinarians had said earlier that little information exists on the heart health of the great apes and possible treatments, and the zoo largely relied on human medical information, according to The Plain Dealer, a Cleveland newspaper.“It’s been hard on the staff,” zoo director Chris Kuhar told The Associated Press. “It’s like losing a family member.”Mokolo, 29, has also clearly been affected by the death, according to Kuhar.“What we’re seeing is Mokolo calling to figure out where Bebac went,” Kuhar said. “We can tell he’s agitated. I think there’s an emotional response there.”The average life expectancy for zoo gorillas is 30 years, although Colo, a female gorilla at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, just turned 60.

In addition, California agreed to supply clothing and some accessories in prison consistent with an inmate’s gender identity.“For too long, institutions have ignored doctors and casually dismissed medically necessary and life-saving care for transgender people just because of who we are,” Kris Hayashi, executive director of the Transgender Law Center, which represents Quine, said in a statement. The daughter of Quine’s victim is furious.“My dad begged for his life,” said Farida Baig, who tried to block Quine’s surgery through the courts, The Associated Press reported. “It made me dizzy and sick. I’m helping pay for his [sic] surgery. I live in California. It’s kind of like a slap in the face.” Quine and an accomplice kidnapped and fatally shot 33-year-old Shahid Ali Baig, a father of three, in Los Angeles in 1980, and took $80 and his car.The state was legally required to pay for the operation, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections.“The 8th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires that prisons provide inmates with medically necessary treatment for medical and mental health conditions including inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria,” she said in a statement. Quine told a prison psychologist who recommended her for the operation that it would bring a “drastic, internal completeness,” according to the AP. She tried to cut and hang herself in prison five times in suicide attempts.Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, a transgender former inmate, won a federal court order in 2015 mandating that California pay for her gender confirmation surgery, but she was placed on parole before she could have the operation, the San Francisco Chronicle reported."

Iraqi forces already control the Tigris to Mosul’s south.They are not expected to push across the river without first recapturing the rest of the eastern districts, and in fact all the bridges have been taken out of service by air strikes.But reaching the eastern bank shows the accelerated pace of the latest Iraqi advance, which has made daily gains since restarting 10 days ago.Brett McGurk, Washington’s envoy to the U.S.-led coalition backing the Iraqi offensive, said in a tweet that Islamic State’s defenses in eastern Mosul were “showing signs of collapse.”The CTS has spearheaded advances inside Mosul as part of a 100,000-strong force backed by U.S. air power of Iraqi troops, Kurdish fighters and Shi’ite militias fighting the militants. After a period of stuttering advances in Mosul last month, Iraqi forces have gained momentum in a new push since around the start of the year.CTS forces also clashed with Islamic State fighters near a historic site in eastern Mosul, a senior commander said, in a bid to drive them out of more neighborhoods.“This morning CTS troops advanced in two directions towards the Baladiyat and Sukkar districts,” Lieutenant General Abdelwahab al-Saadi said.“During the advance, Daesh (Islamic State) tried to confront us from the historic hill,” he said, referring to an elevated area near the ruins of the ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh, east of the river and inside Mosul.Saadi said Iraqi forces and warplanes from the international coalition “dealt with” Islamic State fighters positioned on the hill, and dozens were killed.MARKET ATTACKSA series of air strikes sent plumes of smoke into the sky as rockets fired by Iraqi forces whizzed through the air. Sustained bursts of gunfire around midday eased as night approached.Hundreds of civilians fled their homes in nearby Muthana, which Iraqi forces recaptured two days ago in an unprecedented nighttime raid, crossing a tributary of the Tigris via a makeshift bridge made from dirt.Mohamed, a 35-year-old resident, said his family had locked themselves in their house for the past 10 days to avoid being forced by Islamic State to retreat deeper into the city. They walked about 3 km across the front lines on Sunday despite mortar fire from the retreating militants.“There is no bridge, the bridge is destroyed. There is a dirt thing below the bridge. We transported our belongings and our women and our families,” said Mohamed.Life in eastern districts recaptured from Islamic State in recent weeks has regained a semblance of normalcy. Traffic wound through the streets just a few kilometers from heavy clashes, and reopened grocery stores again dot block corners.Government-supplied electricity has cut off many in areas, but residents have begun using small generators. In some districts, they are cleaning the roads and rebuilding brick walls.Yet in the southeastern district of Wahda, which Iraqi forces recaptured a day earlier, there was heavy damage to a hospital complex which sustained a coalition air strike and a fierce Islamic State counter-attack a month ago.Much of the facility is burned out, some parts mined with explosives left by the militants. Blood stained the wall of one room which soldiers said Islamic State had used for executions.In Baghdad, a suicide attacker killed 13 people when he drove an explosives-rigged car into vegetable market in the mainly Shi’ite Muslim eastern Jamila district, and detonated it, police said. Islamic State claimed the attack in an online statement, saying it had targeted a “gathering of Shi’ites.”A few hours later, a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest blew himself up at a market in another mostly Shi’ite district, Baladiyat, killing seven, according to police and medical sources. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.More than 80 people have been killed in just over a week in attacks in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities.Iraq’s Kurdish regional government said in a statement on Sunday that Kurdish and coalition forces killed an Islamic State figure in a joint operation near the city of Kirkuk on Jan. 5.The operation took place in Hawija, it said. Islamic State have a smaller presence in the area."

His absence from that debate, whenever it happens, means the chances of a pragmatist emerging as the next supreme leader are reduced.His death ahead of May’s presidential elections is a blow to moderate president Hassan Rouhani who allied himself with Rafsanjani to win the 2013 election and went on to resolve Iran’s long standoff with the West on the nuclear program.“The soul of the great man of the Revolution, symbol of patience and resistance has gone to Heaven,” Rouhani tweeted.Abbas Milani, director of the Iranian Studies program at Stanford University, said his death could not have come at a worse time, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office.“With what is happening in the U.S. and the possible instability that is going to come in U.S. policy you needed a voice of reason and pragmatism that had some heft to it. He was that voice.”“Losing that voice is going to make it more likely that any mishap or miscalculation by the Trump team will beget a more unreasonable, more radical, more potentially destructive response by the Iranian regime,” he added.Trump had said during his campaign for the White House that he would scrap Iran’s pact with world powers - under which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for lifted sanctions - describing it as “the worst deal ever negotiated.”He also said he would not “rip up” the nuclear deal, but that he would “police that contract so tough they don’t have a chance.”Rafsanjani’s body was taken to Jamaran prayer hall, the famous residence of the founder of the Islamic Republic Ayatollah Rohullah Khomeini, where many politicians and religious figures gathered to pay their last respects.A crowd also gathered outside the hospital in northern Tehran where Rafsanjani was first taken.“Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani was taken to hospital after a heart attack and more than an hour long efforts by doctors to revive him were not successful,” deputy health minister Mohammad Aghajani was quoted as saying by state broadcaster IRIB.REFORMISTHis belief that reforms would help prolong Iran’s Islamic governance contrasted with those of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who fears such changes could hasten its demise.Voicing his condolences, Khamenei said that political differences never overshadowed his nearly 60 years of friendship with Rafsanjani.“Attempts by wicked people who tried to take advantage of our differences of opinion never affected his deep personal warmth towards me,” Khamenei said in a statement.Rafsanjani’s funeral will be held in Tehran on Tuesday. Iran has announced three days of mourning including a public holiday on Tuesday, for Rafsanjani, who was president from 1989 to 1997.Rafsanjani championed improved relations with Gulf Arab states, was known to have good ties with senior Saudi officials and was seen as a key figure who could have resolved rising tensions between the regional rivals in coming years.Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al-Khalifa, whose country has tense relations with Iran, voiced condolences on Twitter over Rafsanjani’s death."

Police said three of the dead were women.Police identified the truck driver as a Palestinian from Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem and said he was shot dead. His uncle, Abu Ali, named him as Fadi Ahmad Hamdan Qunbor, 28, a father of four from the Jabel Mukabar neighborhood.Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said that nine Jabel Mukabar residents, including five members of the attacker’s family, were arrested on suspicion of aiding the attacker.The Israeli military regularly takes soldiers on educational tours of Jerusalem, including the Armon Hanatziv vantage point.Netanyahu visited the scene and convened his security cabinet, a forum of senior ministers, to discuss Israel’s response. He said that security forces were controlling access in and out of the neighborhood.“We know the identity of the attacker. According to all the signs he is a supporter of Islamic State,” the prime minister said.A government source said that ministers had called for the demolition of the attacker’s home and for his body not to be returned to the family for burial. It also decided to detain without trial persons expressing sympathy for Islamic State.Roni Alsheich, the national police chief, told reporters he could not rule out that the driver had been motivated by a truck ramming attack in a Berlin Christmas market that killed 12 people last month.“It is difficult to get into the head of every individual to determine what prompted him, but there is no doubt that these things do have an effect,” Alsheich told reporters.In another attack claimed by Islamic State and involving a truck driven into a crowd, nearly 90 people were killed in the French city of Nice in July.STREET ATTACKS SLOWEDActions inspired by Islamic State in Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem have been rare and only a few dozen Arab Israelis and Palestinians are known to have declared their sympathy with the group.A wave of Palestinian street attacks, including vehicle rammings, has largely slowed but not stopped completely since it began in October 2015, with 37 Israelis and two visiting Americans having been killed in these assaults.At least 231 Palestinians have been killed in violence in Israel, the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the same period. Israel says that at least 157 of them were assailants while others died during clashes and protests, blaming the violence on incitement by the Palestinian leadership.The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, denies that allegation, and says assailants have acted out of frustration over Israeli occupation of land sought by Palestinians in peace talks that have stalled since 2014.Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip, routinely praises those who carry out street attacks, and did so on Sunday.“We bless this heroic operation resisting the Israeli occupation to force it to stop its crimes and violations against our people,” Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told Reuters.Security camera footage showed the truck racing towards the soldiers and then reversing into them.A security guard identified only as “A” told Channel 10 how he shot at the truck and its driver.“I shot at a tire but realized there was no point as he has many wheels, so I ran in front of the cabin and at an angle, I shot at him and emptied my magazine,” he said.“When I finished shooting, some of the officer cadets also took aim and also started firing.”The footage showed many of the soldiers fleeing the scene as the attack took place, their rifles slung on their shoulders.As a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem, the truck driver would carry an Israeli identity card and be able to move freely through all of the city. Israel considers all of Jerusalem its united capital, a stance not supported by the international community."
