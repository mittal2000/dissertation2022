0,HEALTHY LIVING,HHS Pick Price Made ‘Brazen’ Stock Trades While His Committee Was Under Scrutiny,"Marisa Taylor and Christina Jewett, Kaiser Health News",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hhs-pick-price-made-brazen-stock-trades-while-his-committee-was-under-scrutiny_us_589b9cc9e4b04061313b7912,Price also advocated for health care companies' interests in letters to officials and proposed laws in their favor.,2017-02-09,"U.S. Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) testifies before a Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing on his nomination to be Health and Human Services secretary on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., January 24, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589b9d78280000c63a997c3c.jpeg?cache=q4n0CgHRmV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Health and Human Services secretary nominee Tom Price showed little restraint in his personal stock trading during the three years that federal investigators were bearing down on a key House committee on which the Republican congressman served, a review of his financial disclosures shows.Price made dozens of health industry stock trades during a three-year investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission that focused on the Ways and Means Committee, according to financial disclosure records he filed with the House of Representatives. The investigation was considered the first test of a law passed to ban members of Congress and their staffs from trading stock based on insider information.Price was never a target of the federal investigation, which scrutinized a top Ways and Means staffer, and no charges were brought. But ethics experts say Price’s personal trading, even during the thick of federal pressure on his committee, shows he was unconcerned about financial investments that could create an appearance of impropriety.“He should have known better,” Richard Painter, former White House chief ethics attorney under President George W. Bush and a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School said of Price’s conduct during the SEC inquiry.As Price awaits a Senate vote on his confirmation, Senate Democrats and a number of watchdog groups have asked the SEC to investigate whether Price engaged in insider trading with some of his trades in health care companies. Price has said he abided by all ethics rules, although he acknowledged to the Senate Finance Committee that he did not consult the House Ethics Committee on trades that have now become controversial.The SEC’s inquiry began in 2013, as it battled Ways and Means for documents to develop its case.A few weeks ago, the day before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the SEC quietly dropped its pursuit of committee documents without explanation, according to federal court records. No charges were brought against the staffer, Brian Sutter, who is now a health care lobbyist. Sutter’s lawyer declined to comment.Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist with Public Citizen, described Price’s volume of stock trades during the SEC inquiry as “brazen,” given the congressman’s access to nonpublic information affecting the companies’ fortunes.“The public is seeing this and they really don’t like it,” said Holman whose watchdog group recently filed complaints about Price’s stock trading with both the SEC and the Office of Congressional Ethics.Trump administration officials and Price have dismissed questions that news reports and lawmakers have raised about stock trades coinciding with official actions to help certain companies, saying Price’s brokers chose the stocks independently and all of his conduct was transparent.After acknowledging that he asked his broker to buy stock in an Australian drug company, he told the Senate Finance Committee that he did not direct his broker to make other trades.“To the best of my knowledge, I have not undertaken such actions,” he wrote in response to finance committee questions. “I have abided by and adhered to all ethics and conflict of interest rules applicable to me.”An analysis of Price’s trades shows that he bought health stocks in 2007, the first year Congress financial disclosures are posted online. In 2011, the the first year Price sat on the health subcommittee, he traded no health-related stocks, according to his financial disclosures filed with Congress.That same year, members were facing public criticism because of a book detailing how they could use inside information and a “60 Minutes” investigation focused on how members and staff could legally use inside information to gain from their own stock trades.In 2012, President Barack Obama signed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act to rein in insider trading by members and require more disclosure. Public watchdog groups suggested at the time that the law would curb the practice.That year, after his one-year break in health care trades, Price resumed investing in health care companies.Along with investments in technology, financial services and retail stocks, he also bought and sold stock in companies that could be impacted by actions of his subcommittee, which has a role in determining rates the government pays under the Medicare program.Health care firms spend heavily to influence members of Congress, lobbying on health matters, funding political campaigns and seeking favor with Medicare officials who decide how much the program will pay for certain drugs and devices. The Food and Drug Administration holds similar power, approving or putting conditions on drug and device use.Beyond his personal investments in health care companies, Price has also advocated their interests in letters to officials and proposed laws, government records show.In 2012, disclosure records show Price sold stock in several drug firms, including more than $110,000 worth of Amgen stock. Amgen’s stock price had steadily climbed out of a recession-level slump, but Price’s sale came a few weeks before the company pleaded guilty to illegally marketing an anemia drug.By 2013, the health subcommittee was at the center of a major conflict between Medicare, which sets Medicare Advantage rates, and the insurance industry. Medicare issued a notice early that year announcing its intention to reduce Medicare Advantage rates by 2.3 percent as part of a major cost-cutting initiative.That prompted fierce lobbying by the health insurance industry. Members of Congress, including Price, wrote a letter to Marilyn Tavenner, then acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, protesting the rate cut, saying the decrease would “disadvantage vulnerable beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions.”Ultimately, Medicare decided not to cut rates but instead, to increase them. Yet an hour before Medicare announced the change, a Height Securities analyst fired off a “flash” report to 200 clients that touched off a surge of trading.The analyst’s report said a political deal was hatched on Capitol Hill to prevent the cuts as a condition for moving forward on Tavenner’s confirmation. Medicare officials increased rates by nearly 4 percent, a change that would positively impact the bottom lines of health insurance companies.The SEC began looking for the leak’s source, and within weeks, FBI agents began interviewing staffers at the Ways and Means Committee, court records show.They discovered communications between Sutter and a health care lobbyist. The HHS Inspector General also began a probe, and federal prosecutors briefly examined the matter activity as well.As the case unfolded, Price bought more health care-related stocks, according to his financial disclosures. He has testified that his broker directed all of the trades, except for his investments in Innate Immunotherapeutics, an Australian company partly owned by Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), according to Collins’ disclosures. An HHS spokesman said Monday that Price held three broker-directed accounts.Ethics experts have said that Price should have further distanced himself by placing his assets in a blind trust.On April 30, 2013, Price bought $2,093 worth of stocks in Incyte, a company that develops cancer drugs; $2,076 in Onyx Pharmaceuticals, a drugmaker that would soon merge with a larger drug firm; and $2,097 in Parexel International, a consultancy that helps drugs and devices win FDA approval, according to the financial disclosure records.The same day, Price shed shares of Express Scripts, a drug management firm, and Danaher, which makes products hospitals and doctor’s offices using for testing and diagnostics. In August of that year, he bought a $2,429 stake in Jazz Pharmaceuticals, which makes sleep and cancer drugs.On May 6, 2014, the SEC served its first subpoena for the Ways and Means Committee documents. The committee launched a vigorous fight, appealing a federal district judge’s ruling that it should comply with the SEC subpoena.Price continued his health stock trades, including $1,000 to $15,000 in drug firms Amgen, Eli Lilly and Co., Pfizer, Biogen and Bristol-Myers Squibb. He also bought stocks in Aetna, a major health insurer, and Athenahealth, which sells electronic medical record and medical billing software. In 2016, he also increased his investment in Innate Immunotherapeutics.The purchase became controversial because both he and Collins bought stock in a private placement at a discounted price.“You’re asking for trouble if you have access to nonpublic information about the health care industry and you’re buying and selling health care stocks,” Painter said."
1,POLITICS,A CEO Pay Regulation Is About To Be Quietly Scuttled,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dodd-frank-pay-ratio-rule-piwowar_us_589cc0ede4b0c1284f2b4be0,The unwinding of Dodd-Frank begins.,2017-02-09,"Michael Piwowar, then commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, speaks during a panel in Cape Town, South Africa, on Feb. 24.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589cc20125000034080b8036.jpeg?cache=4xOzfyLwWj&ops=crop_15_53_3985_1638%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Trump administration’s review of Dodd-Frank Wall Street regulations will take months to complete, but we already know the first rule to be targeted. This week, acting Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Michael Piwowar directed the agency’s staff to “reconsider” a rule on CEO pay long championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).The regulation would require corporations to disclose the discrepancy between what their CEOs earn and what their ordinary workers take home. It’s perhaps the simplest proposal in Dodd-Frank. Once a year, companies have to present the ratio of their CEOs’ pay to the median annual pay among all their employees. The executive class howled in protest, offering a litany of excuses. It was too hard to calculate. Foreign workers should be excluded. Running the numbers would be too expensive. Nobody would really make an investment decision based on this stuff. Above all, the SEC had to delay the rule so companies could figure out … something. This week’s move by the SEC is the latest in a nearly seven-year series of the agency’s capitulations to CEOs.“Issuers are now actively engaged in the implementation and testing of systems and controls designed to collect and process the information necessary for compliance,” Piwowar explained. “However, it is my understanding that some issuers have begun to encounter unanticipated compliance difficulties.” He asked for a new round of public comments on the rule, and directed staff to determine if any “additional guidance or relief may be appropriate.” In other words, the rule is dead.The pay-ratio rule wouldn’t be revolutionary for financial markets or the investment world. It wouldn’t cure economic inequality, only provide some more data points for the people who study it. But the SEC’s hostility toward the regulation reveals a lot about whom the agency’s leaders think they work for. Sure, it would be embarrassing for a lot of CEOs who don’t pay their workers well. So what? The SEC didn’t issue a proposal for the pay-ratio rule until late 2013, three years after Dodd-Frank was passed. Piwowar, then a commissioner rather than the agency’s acting chair, objected to even presenting the regulation for public comment, declaring the entire project a cheap attempt to “shame” CEOs.After offering the rule, SEC Chair Mary Jo White ― an Obama appointee ― sat on it for more than two years, only finalizing it in August 2015, after a bitter public feud with Warren and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). But corporate executives weren’t done lobbying against it, even though the ultimate product had granted them a host of loopholes that would help companies skew median employee pay upward. Firms were allowed to exclude up to 5 percent of foreign workers from the calculation, for instance, and cherry-pick the size of their workforce from any date within the final three months of its fiscal year. More importantly, since the final rule wouldn’t force companies to actually disclose anything until 2018, it bought the executive class nearly two and a half years to keep fighting. White left office a controversial figure. In addition to slow-walking the pay-ratio rule and angering Warren ― who called for then-President Barack Obama to remove her from office ― White angered Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for burying an effort requiring corporations to disclose their political spending.“You’re hurting America,” Schumer (D-N.Y.) told White at a hearing in late 2016. “Your priorities are out of line with what corporate America needs and America needs, and I hope when you go to bed late at night, you would think about that.”Obama stood by his embattled appointee at every turn, though she left office with 19 Dodd-Frank rules yet to be finalized. The first orders of business for her successor have not indicated any sense of urgency to move them forward.This is probably how financial reform will be unwound ― not through flashy executive order signing ceremonies, but through slow strangulation by the agencies trusted to write rules and enforce them. And in some cases, President Donald Trump will be building on Obama’s own work."

Lance Ingram (played by Beaty) as he struggles to re-enter society after serving a 10 year prison sentence.The independent drama mirrors Joseph’s personal journey after being released from prison, where he served nine and a half years for his involvement in New York’s much-publicized 1969 Panther 21 case. Joseph was indicted as a teen for weapons charges and harboring Black Panther fugitives.Nearly three decades since his release, the acclaimed author and Columbia University film professor tells The Huffington Post that he hopes the film will spark much-needed dialogue about prison reform.“The timing of the film coming out ― humanizing a man that represents millions of men and women in this country and showing their struggles, and showing the struggles of family ― hopefully will become apart of a larger movie conversation,” Joseph told HuffPost. “Not only what we do on an individual level, but how do we prevent this? How do we open our arms and get hearts around the idea that we don’t need more jails, we need more classrooms. That we don’t need more police, we need more jobs. We need to deal with the problem at the root.”Joseph added that he decided to become a filmmaker during his years in federal prison where he earned two college degrees and launched a multi-cultural theater company that produced five plays. After his release, he accepted a fellowship at the Sundance Institute, where he forged relationships with studios to produce a list of short films and documentaries.In 1997, Joseph launched the Impact Repertory Youth Theater of Harlem, a nonprofit youth performing arts group that provides college and career guidance to young performers. The group received a 2008 Oscar nomination for Best Original Song “Raise It Up,” which was co-written by Joseph and featured on the “August Rush” soundtrack. For Omari Hardwick, the film’s reoccurring theme of redemption persuaded him to portray the role of Lance’s childhood friend, Jomo, who was afforded the opportunity to open a local barbershop following his prison sentence. “I think it was the redemption that I had found, not only in this character, but within the story,” Hardwick told HuffPost. “When I sat down to talk to Jamal and Daniel Beaty about the project, they told me this guy had been to jail. He’s no stranger to the street life, but he’d found a way to get it all together and clean his life up and open a barbershop.”“And I liked that he was in that environment of being someone who had done wrong, but now was doing right and had an opportunity with his childhood friend being released from prison, he had an opportunity to help him redeem himself as well. Redemption is so necessary, as is forgiveness. And so the story in the movie touches on a lot of that.” With his debut feature film complete, Joseph says he wants to focus on additional films including a companion piece to “Chapter and Verse,” based on his experiences in the Black Panther Party, as well as a film highlighting female leaders of the Civil Rights era.“I’m interested in those real kinds of stories that bring the truth of what we’re doing ― whether it’s past, present or future ― to life with characters that we can remember with a story that takes us on a little bit of a journey that’s serious,” he said. “But also have moments that make you laugh and make you cry. And at the end of it, something about the film that makes you talk about the bigger issues in your life. That’s the kind of filmmaking I’m interested in.”“Chapter & Verse” is now playing in select cities. For a complete list click here."

4,GREEN,Continent's Oldest Male Asian Elephant Is Euthanized After TB Battle,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tb-elephant-euthanized_us_589c7759e4b09bd304c03a05,Packy's death comes three years after he and two other elephants were diagnosed with the disease.,2017-02-09,"Packy, a 54-year-old elephant, was euthanized at the Oregon Zoo on Thursday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589cd0e8280000c63a997f1c.jpeg?cache=dlz2djUnMU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A 54-year-old elephant named Packy, who was celebrated as the oldest male Asian elephant in North America, was euthanized on Thursday at Oregon Zoo after suffering from tuberculosis.The zoo’s decision, which followed outcry from animal activists, came three years after Packy and two other elephants at the Portland park were diagnosed with the highly infectious disease.The zoo said in a statement that its “animal-care staff determined his quality of life and the safety of the herd was compromised by his illness.” “We’d run out of options for treating him,” said Dr. Tim Storms, the zoo’s lead veterinarian.About 5 percent of Asian elephants living in captivity in North America are believed to have TB, a bacterial disease that usually affects the lungs, according to a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last year.Packy and the other two elephants, one of which was his son Rama, were diagnosed with the disease in December 2013. The CDC believe that the elephants contracted TB via human contact. During an investigation, a zoo volunteer was found to have been diagnosed with TB in 2012. Seven others working at the zoo who were later diagnosed with the disease had been within close contact of the animals.Packy was treated for TB with antibiotics and showed no sign of the disease for several years after, the zoo said. The two other elephants that were diagnosed were also successfully treated, according to the zoo’s statement.In fall 2016, however, Packy tested positive for a drug-resistant strain of TB. The zoo said it was “the first positive culture since Packy’s initial diagnosis in December 2013.”“We had been feeling increasingly optimistic about Packy’s treatment regimen, and he had been tolerating it well, so this recent result was disappointing,” Storms said at the time.Critics of the zoo’s decision to euthanize Packy suggested that as the animal didn’t show symptoms of the disease, he was put down to relieve a physical burden upon the zoo.Packy had to be separated from the other elephants, according to the zoo, and kept 100 feet away from the public for a year after starting treatment.Storms stressed that it was challenging to treat Packy effectively due to his old age. Asian elephants do not typically live beyond 50.“The remaining treatments involved side effects that would have been very hard on Packy with no guarantee of success, plus a risk of creating further resistance,” he said. “None of us felt it would be right to do that. But without treatment, his TB would have continued to get worse.”"

After earning money for doing chores around the house, she bought the Leia costume to show her admiration.Evann also adores Hermione and Ginny from Harry Potter, a book series Carter uses to teach her daughter about politics. “She’s read the first four books in the series,” Carter said. “We likened Trump’s bigotry to the way Muggle-borns are treated by some characters. The Harry Potter books have been invaluable when explaining complex issues like racism, standing up for others, etc.”Carter went on to say how proud she was of her daughter, who is known to donate her toys and hold lemonade stands to donate money to the local library’s school supply drive. She described Evann as a “pretty awesome kid.”“I asked Evann recently what the meaning of life was and she said, ‘To have fun and to make the world better,’” Carter said. “That’s Evann in a nutshell.”The HuffPost Parents newsletter offers a daily dose of personal stories, helpful advice and comedic takes on what it’s like to raise kids today.

Seeming to ignore the concerns of Native American groups and environmentalist, Trump stressed that the project would create “a lot of jobs, 28,000 jobs. Great construction jobs.” In December, federal authorities halted construction of the pipeline in response to growing protests near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota. Along with denying the final easement required for the $3.8 billion project to pass under Lake Oahe, the Obama administration ordered the Army Corps to conduct an environmental impact statement to examine the possible affects of the pipeline and explore alternative routes.As expected, the Army Corps granted the easement on Wednesday, allowing for the project to be finished, Reuters reports. In a statement late Wednesday, project developer Energy Transfer Partners LP said it planned to “proceed expeditiously.”Among the speakers at the Washington rally was Linda Black Elk, a resident of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.

She called the Army’s recent announcement “completely offensive” and a “slap in the face” to the people who have voiced their concerns.Asked how she expects the standoff to end, Winter said she fights daily with a sense of cynicism.“But I pray that there will be enough resistance to things like this, especially the pipelines, that people will be able to stand up and make some progress,” she said. “I think it will be a miracle if they don’t build it, but I’m hoping the people will speak.” The 1,172-mile pipeline is being built to carry oil from the Bakken formation in North Dakota to an existing oil terminal in Illinois. Most of it is completed, except for a short section near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. The tribe and demonstrators have raised concerns about the threat the pipeline poses to the Sioux’s water source and sacred Native American sites.Protests Wednesday were scattered around the country. A small group of demonstrators in Chicago had chained themselves together inside a Citibank office. Protesters targeted the bank because they say it’s “a major funder” of the pipeline. Dakota Access opponents rallied in Seattle, where the City Council on Tuesday voted to cut ties with Wells Fargo over the bank’s financial ties to the pipeline.

His lawyer, Marc Mukasey, argued the loss of his job and widespread media coverage were punishment enough.“I stand before you today as a disgraced husband, an outcast in my own profession, and ashamed to be in my own skin,” Polos told Gardephe in court.Polos, of West Nyack, New York, was found guilty in June along with Glen Glover, a former DEA telecommunications specialist, on conspiracy and false statement charges in connection with the club, where prosecutors said they were part-owners and worked.Jurors also convicted Polos for lying about having a relationship with any foreign nationals for not disclosing he was having an extramarital affair with a Brazilian dancer who prosecutors said entered the United States illegally.Prosecutors said that during background checks in 2011 used to spot any outside employment that could put them near criminal activity or create risks of being blackmailed, Polos and Glover failed to disclose that they were running the club.The club featured scantily clad and sometimes topless female dancers, including some who engaged in sexual acts with patrons and staff, and many who are illegal, undocumented immigrants, prosecutors have said.Mukasey said in court that Polos’ conduct was reckless but not malevolent. He told reporters that he would consider whether to appeal the conviction.Glover is scheduled for sentencing on Friday. (Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Dan Grebler)"

To defeat evil with good, the offense with forgiveness. A Christian would never say ‘you will pay for that.’ Never.“That is not a Christian gesture. An offense you overcome with forgiveness. To live in peace with everyone.”Francis has made statements like this before. After a papal trip to Mexico last year, a reporter asked Francis to comment on Trump’s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and to make Mexico pay for it.In response, Francis said, “A person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.”The pope’s comments on Wednesday coincided with the feast day of St. Josephine Bakhita, a 19th-century Sudanese woman who was kidnapped, sold into slavery, and eventually traveled to Italy. There, she entered a convent and became a nun. She is the patron saint of Sudan, one of the seven Muslim-majority countries on Trump’s travel ban. Pope Francis hasn’t directly addressed Trump’s executive order, but a senior member of the Vatican hierarchy has expressed the Holy See’s disapproval. Many U.S. Catholic bishops have also spoken out against the order.During his Wednesday address, Francis asked Catholics to pray for Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims refugees, whom human rights groups believe are being persecuted by the country’s army and police. “These are good people, peaceful people,” Francis said. “They’re not Christians, but they’re good, our brothers and sisters. And they have been suffering for years. They’ve been tortured and killed, simply because they are continuing their traditions, their Muslim faith. Let us pray for them.”"

Some feel we are therefore powerless to stop the damage the Trump agenda will do. The majority of Americans didn’t want Donald Trump to be president, but, thanks to the Electoral College—with an assist from the Russian government—he is.In the science fiction series Star Trek: The Next Generation, the most unrelenting nemesis for the crew of the starship U.S.S. Enterprise is the cybernetic hive-minded Borg. The Borg intone one threat: “Resistance is futile.” In our battles against the Trump administration, the American people are now wondering, is it?The answer from these first two weeks is unequivocally no. As bad as the situation is—and I certainly don’t underestimate it—there is also real reason for hope. Across this country, Democrats, Independents, and reasonable Republicans are speaking out, from protests to op-eds, and from town hall meetings to radio call-ins. The resistance is resisting.And that’s why we can’t stop now. This has to be just the beginning.The first glimmer of effective resistance came in the first few hours of this new Congress. In the dead of night, Republicans passed a new rule gutting the independent ethics office. The American public was rightfully outraged. Their uproar led congressional Republicans to reverse the change the very next day. The Washington Post’s Robert Costa reported that “most members [of Congress] tell me [the] blizzard of angry constituent calls were [the] most important factor in getting the House to sideline” the ethics shutdown.None of this progress means that Democrats have to reactively resist everything – Trump provides us more than enough reasons. Nor do our victories so far mean that we will win every fight. But we have shown that we will fight the fights that are worth fighting. We have shown that we can win when it matters.Our path isn’t through likely changing this president: he’s more likely to lash out at critics on Twitter than he is to internalize and adapt to dissenting opinions. Instead, the path of our most effective resistance is the path that goes through the politically minded members in the administration and, more importantly, through Congress. There are 52 Republican members of the Senate and 240 Republican members of the House of Representatives. They see this resistance mounting, and they rightfully fear for their job security. Every time the phone rings from a constituent, they feel their odds of re-election waning. When they saw 5 million people protesting on the day of the Women’s March, their brows furled at the Republican Senatorial and Congressional Committees, because their midterm prospects suddenly looked more bleak. That’s how the resistance will make a difference—by convincing Republicans to change their minds or defeating them at the ballot box next time around. That’s our charge, and it’s already showing results.The Enterprise crew always seemed to be facing a threat, but they always managed to defeat the Borg. In the same way, for the majority of the American people who oppose the Trump administration and its agenda, these first two weeks have proven one thing: our resistance is not futile."

Working with banal material, Trujillo generates scenes that attempt walk a fine line between the ordinary and extraordinary. Carefully modulated and cannily observant, Trujillo’s canvases show us that the places we barely notice can be recast as scenes of unexpected grandeur. John Seed Interviews Marc TrujilloMarc, where did you grow up and how did your childhood shape you? I'm from Albuquerque, New Mexico, it's big sky country like Montana and the land keeps you aware that you're a small figure in a vast landscape which makes sense to me as a worldview and manifests itself in the paintings in the way I tend to scale the figures, they're important but are held in check by scale. As a child, I only wanted to draw and read books, so my parents put me in gymnastics which gave me a good sense of discipline and I also realized that painting was something I could do my whole life, as opposed to gymnastics which has a short shelf-life.How did your studies at Yale, and your interactions with Andrew Forge help you mature as an artist? Graduate school is where you go to have the philosophical core you operate from thoroughly cross-examined. Andrew Forge would parse out distinctions that were fine enough to nudge and refine the way you thought. He defined 'Artiness' as 'when the aesthetic effect is a consequence of things known beforehand', for example. William Bailey was also important to me as a model of making sure what you were doing was really painting. There are different forms and why something should be a painting as opposed to a song or novel or photograph should be a part of your intention or area of investigation from the outset. While a painting may show a place, for Bailey 'the painting is the place.’ A painting has an autonomous reality as a painting and Bailey's teaching and paintings both bear this out. You are known for painting subject matter that others might consider banal: when did you realize that ordinariness held a special attraction for you? The chill of the void is alluring to me. These places that are nowhere and everywhere, big stretches of concrete and linoleum give me a chill that makes me want to paint them. Also, when a painting goes too low or too high in terms of subject matter it plays to easily into people's fantasy lives, and showing something that the viewer fantasizes about is narrative poison to me. Joyce defined pornography that way: when you show the viewer something that they want to possess. I think he got this from Kant who said that the greatest experience you can have in front of a work of art is the ""God-like moment', which is disinterested pleasure; the pleasure you get from the paintings is not because you want what they are showing you. The low temperature of my subject matter also helps keep the painting the thing, to go back to the point about 'the painting is the place.’ If I paint something like Mount Everest or the Grand Canyon then the painting reminds you of this greater experience outside of itself, like a postcard. On the other hand if I'm painting a gas station or Costco, then the painting has a chance at being more of an experience than you had when you were there. Tell me how the works of Jan Vermeer have informed and influenced you. First of all by being part of what made me want to paint in the first place; my reaction to them came before my reflection about why they're so good. Then you go back and look at them as a painter instead of as a fan so that you can bring something back to you own work, Vermeer's paintings are superbly composed and balanced, the light in them is as important a character as anything in the painting, and his sense of scale is very refined. View of Delft is a pretty perfect painting, when you're standing in front of it, it's large enough to have some physical scale to it, but intimate enough that you don't notice the size of the painting before you see what Vermeer is showing you. View of Delft is about 38 inches high, so if I'm not sure how large to make a painting, then I'll make it 38 inches high by whatever width I need for the composition. I've made quite a few 38 inch high paintings.Tell me about one of the paintings you have on view in Bakersfield. How did it come about, and what kind of impact do you want it to have on viewers? I think the show as a whole helps show how the work is made and am grateful to the curator, Rachel Magnus, since it was important to us to show how synthetic the paintings are- I make them like one frame movies, building the set (The vanishing point is the first thing on the painting), lighting it, and casting it. Making as thinking is vital to me. since I need to do a lot of drawing to more fully imaginatively own my subject as well as to distill my visual motive for making a painting of it, the muted narratives in the painting are all kept that way so that the viewer is the most important figure in the painting. My area of investigation has come out of the work, rather than starting with a narrative and painting it, there are also cases filled with sketchbooks which I work in steadily, plein air paintings and studies from life: all of this is part of the food chain with the studio paintings at the top. It helps since some viewers might misunderstand the paintings as being 'photorealist'. Since scale is important, I hope people experience the work in person, to continue from the last question; the actual painting is the result and the test of everything that goes into it. So, to answer your question by singling out a painting, 517 East 117th Street is 25 x 44 inches. My motive for painting this was the red carpet of meat that you get when you stand in this spot in Costco. This painting is shown along with the composition drawing for it and there's an iPad on the wall as well with various stages of the painting in progress. This preparatory work also determines the scale and we've grown too accustomed to the fluid scale that things we see digitally has: are you looking at it on your phone or is it being projected on a wall? People mostly look at things on screens, so both scale and tactility suffer, as well as the sense of light that I take a lot of pains to calibrate out of what photography gives you, which the fixed iris of the camera rolls back. Is it fair to say that you are -- in your heart -- a very traditional painter who sees yourself as part of a long unbroken lineage? Bringing the long, slow, patient way of looking and making to bear on the places we've made for ourselves that are hardly meant to be looked at at all is an important counterpoint of tradition and our contemporary world. In 'Tradition and the Individual Talent', T.S. Eliot couches a healthy relationship to tradition and that it needs to include the historical sense: 'This historical sense, which is a sense of the timeless as well as of the temporal and of the timeless and of the temporal together, is what makes a writer traditional.’And it is at the same time what makes a writer most acutely conscious of his place in time, of his own contemporaneity.' Eliot also points up that tradition has to be earned and is not automatically inherited and opposes it to what people sometimes think of as tradition ' following the ways of the immediate generation before us in a blind or timid adherence to its successes.' So, yes would have been the short answer but the word tradition is mostly used in the sense of following and the criticality of it gets lost sometimes. What are you interested in outside of painting? The sister arts, literature, sculpture, music (I play guitar some and am the first name on the music credits for 'El Mariachi', Robert Rodriguez' first movie). Linda and I like to go hiking together and have a Rottweiler Ursa, who is a rescue dog.Exhibitions: Marc Trujillo: Urban UbiquityThe Bakersfield Museum of ArtJanuary 26, 2017 - May 7, 2017Marc Trujillo ‘Urban Ubiquity’ Winfield Gallery, Carmel, CAFebruary 1 - 28, 2017"

Those executives had tried to stop it from doing so, and now it’s clear why: They make a bundle.The committee decided it was in the public interest to reveal that last year Ahmed Fahour, managing director of Australia Post, raked in A$5.6 million (US$4.3 million), receiving a A$1.2 million bonus and A$4.4 million in annual salary. By contrast, the nation’s prime minister makes just over A$500,000 per year.The documents did not reveal names, but they showed that five other senior executives at Australia Post also out-earned the prime minister, with each taking in between A$1.3 million and A$1.8 million per year. (One also claimed a retirement benefit of A$380,000.)In fighting to keep the salary information private, an Australia Post spokesman argued: “Australia Post and/or those individuals may become targets for unwarranted media attention. This may lead to brand damage for Australia Post which when operating in a competitive market, may be significantly detrimental to our business and future profitability.”In 2015 Australia Post slashed 1,900 jobs in response to decreasing demand for its traditional letter delivery service. It reported at the time that losses were approaching A$500 million for the financial year, and that over the past five years they had exceeded A$1.5 billion.Fahour warned in June of that year:“We have reached the tipping point that we have been warning about where, without reform, the business becomes unsustainable. We welcomed the Federal Government’s decision to support reform so we can manage the mail service losses, meet the changing needs of our customers and continue to invest in growing parts of our business such as parcels and trusted services.”A spokeswoman said this week that Australia Post has an annual turnover of more than A$6 billion, and that 73% of its revenue comes from the non-regulated side of the business, where the company faces powerful competitors like FedEx and DHL.But today Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said he will call on the postal service to reconsider Fahour’s pay package.

The international arrivals terminal at O’Hare International Airport was filled with family and sponsors who had been waiting ― at times on knife’s edge ― for Baraa Hajj Khalaf, her husband and their 16-month-old daughter to make it to the U.S. The sponsors, a group of 36 Chicago women who banded together to raise money, prepared an apartment and pledged social, language and job support, held gifts, flowers and American flags to welcome the family. Baby Sham, who has known life only in a refugee camp, was quickly draped in a small scarf and handed a plush toy bunny as her uncles hugged her. “This is what I expected of the American people,” Baraa said through a translator. “We are just overjoyed.”As the family cried and embraced, cell phones pinged with updates on the legal battle over the executive order that was unfolding in a federal appeals court in San Francisco.The outcome will determine if other Syrian refugees, like Baraa’s in-laws, will be able to come to the U.S. or if they’ll be among the last ones for an unknown amount of time. The Hajj Khalafs fate was thrown into uncertainty on Jan. 27 when Trump signed an executive order that indefinitely banned Syrian refugees from entering the United States. It also banned all other refugees for 90 days and barred even valid visa holders from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S.The family fled Aleppo in 2013 amid the Syrian civil war. Baraa, a literature major, and her husband, Abdulmajeed, an accountant, lived and worked in a Turkish refugee camp and later embarked on the resettlement process. Baraa’s parents, her two brothers and her sister had successfully resettled in suburban Skokie, Illinois, last September, but she, her husband and their daughter were unable to join the family when a paperwork error emerged during the strict vetting process. Like many refugees preparing for their life, the Hajj Khalafs sold everything they had and had given up their spot in the refugee camp when the State Department finally notified them their resettlement date had arrived. The family took a nearly 18-hour bus ride to Istanbul to wait for their flight. With Trump’s executive order expected, the Hajj Khalafs travel date was bumped up several days to Jan. 27.Baraa’s parents were waiting at O’Hare that Friday when they learned their hopes of a family reunion were dashed.

After word of the executive order spread, the sponsors said they were determined not to give up on the family. The sponsors, who are volunteers under the Chicago-based resettlement agency RefugeeOne, maintained as much contact with the family as they could as updates to the order came in almost daily. When a federal judge in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order last Friday, halting the ban nationwide, the tide seemed to turn in the family’s favor. When an appeals court denied the government’s request to reinstate the ban Sunday, the Hajj Khalafs’ U.S. sponsors reinvigorated their welcoming effort. “We were hanging curtains, buying food for the pantry ... bringing the lawyers and the family [in the U.S.] food,” said Rachel Zahorsky, another sponsor. “We were living last week hour-by-hour,” Zahorsky added. “We’re overwhelmed with joy and relief.”The day the executive order was signed, sponsor Alisa Wartick posted a photo of the empty crib the women had prepared for Sham.

22,POLITICS,Inspector General: Customs Officials May Have Violated Court Order While Enforcing Trump's Travel Ban,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cbp-officials-court-order_us_589b86bce4b09bd304bfc901,DHS's John Roth is also looking into the botched rollout of the president's executive order.,2017-02-08,"Department of Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. on June 9, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589b87412900002200f25367.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Customs officials violated a federal court order if they intentionally blocked lawyers from reaching detainees while enforcing President Donald Trump’s temporary travel ban last month, the top watchdog for the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday.If U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers knowingly violated a court order, that “would be, in my view, misconduct,” said DHS Inspector General John Roth, a former federal prosecutor who assumed his post under the Obama administration.On Jan. 28, a federal judge in Virginia ordered CBP officers at Washington Dulles International Airport to allow legal permanent residents they were holding under Trump’s order to access attorneys. But border protection officials did not admit the lawyers who showed up. Detainees reportedly received contact information for other attorneys, but it’s unclear whether they could reach them. And when members of Congress showed up to enforce the court order, they couldn’t speak with CBP officials. This decision risked triggering a constitutional crisis. Government officials are supposed to obey lawful court orders from judges, even if they don’t agree with them. Roth was responding to a description of events provided by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who went to Dulles airport after the court issued the order. CBP officials turned members of Congress away, The Daily Beast and The Huffington Post confirmed. DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. At the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation hearing on Wednesday, Booker said that he arrived with the judge’s order in hand, and showed it to CBP officials. Booker asked Roth if he agreed that if CBP officials were aware of a court order and failed to comply, the order “factually was violated.” Roth said he agreed. “That’s my understanding as a lawyer. Obviously, it would have to be intentional,” he said. “That is, knowing in fact that a court order existed and then choosing not to follow that court order. I think that’s correct.” Virginia has asked a judge to force the Trump administration to prove why officials should not be held in contempt of court for disobeying the order at Dulles. Key parts of Trump’s executive order are currently suspended nationwide while the ban is being challenged in court. Roth’s office has opened an inquiry into the Trump administration’s rollout of the travel ban, which suspends refugee resettlement for 120 days, bans Syrian refugees indefinitely and temporarily bars individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries. The probe will look at systemic issues — “who knew what when,” Roth explained on Wednesday — as well as potential misconduct. Roth noted that while inspectors general don’t impose disciplinary measures, they may turn their findings over to CBP or to the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Justice Department “if there’s a clear violation of law.” How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Video posted on social media showed black plumes of smoke rising from a building. No injuries were reported.Since the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, Samsung has worked to assure the public that its products are safe.Last month, the company released the results of a lengthy investigation that revealed design flaws in two different sets of its batteries. Those flaws caused the products to heat up to dangerous levels, they said.“Today, more than ever, we are committed to earning the trust of our customers through innovation that redefines what is possible in safety, and as a gateway to unlimited possibilities and incredible new experiences,” Dongjin Koh, Samsung’s president of mobile, said at the time."

Opinion polls published on Wednesday show the National Front’s Le Pen and Macron garnering the most support. A win by either would be the first French president from a non-establishment party.Just weeks ago, France’s election outcome seemed far more certain. Conservative candidate Fillon had won the Republican party leadership race in late November, and appeared set to handily defeat Le Pen in a second-round runoff. But Fillon’s campaign has been severely hobbled by a corruption scandal, with newspapers reporting that he funneled more than $1 million in public funds to his wife and children for alleged fake jobs.Fillon on Monday apologized for hiring his wife, but insisted she actually did work for her salary. He pressed his case again on Wednesday, writing in a newspaper column that he had “nothing to hide.”Many French voters have taken the nepotism scandal as further reason to turn away from the country’s establishment politicians. Capitalizing on Fillon’s woes is 39-year-old independent candidate Emanuel Macron, who has seen a rapid rise in popularity since entering the race in November. On Monday, two polls showed Macron on track to make it to the second round of voting and go on to easily beat Le Pen.But Macron’s front-runner status also makes him a prime target for attacks, including from Russian state-run media outlets. On Tuesday, he was forced to deny rumors that he was having a gay extramarital affair after conservative Member of Parliament Nicolas Dhuicq alleged that a “very wealthy gay lobby” backed Macron. Macron, a former economy minister, has fashioned himself as an outsider candidate attempting to draw people from across the political spectrum. His centrist campaign promotes a revitalization of France’s economy, while claiming an anti-establishment stance that plays to the emotions of France’s disgruntled electorate. While Macron has utilized some populist rhetoric in his campaign, Marine Le Pen has made it central to her political identity. Her slogan, “au nom de peuple,” (in the name of the people), is characteristic of a campaign that has echoes of Trump while pressing her longstanding anti-European Union, anti-immigration views. Polls show Le Pen winning the first round of France’s election, but losing soundly once fractured liberal and moderate conservative voters rally around a single candidate. Le Pen has tried to be defiant against these predictions, however, citing botched polls predicting losses by Trump and Brexit as evidence that she can win.Le Pen’s campaign hits many of the same notes as Trump’s, including restoring lost manufacturing jobs and tightening national borders. Last week, she praised Trump’s ban on immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries and called opposition to it “in bad faith.” On Sunday, Le Pen launched her campaign with an hour-long speech against globalization, Islamists and other familiar targets. Lagging behind in polls is the ruling Socialist party candidate Benoit Hamon, who was selected to run after deeply unpopular President Francois Hollande opted not to seek a second term ― the first French leader to do so since the nation’s fifth republic was created in 1958. Hamon has so far been a minor figure in the campaign, promoting experimental policies that include universal basic income, and taxes on industrial robots that may take jobs. Much of the momentum is behind Macron. The past few weeks have shown how things can drastically change, however, and with the elections first round scheduled for late April, there is still ample time for more scandals and volatility."

On Tuesday, he was forced to deny rumors that he was having a gay extramarital affair after conservative Member of Parliament Nicolas Dhuicq alleged that a “very wealthy gay lobby” backed Macron. Macron, a former economy minister, has fashioned himself as an outsider candidate attempting to draw people from across the political spectrum. His centrist campaign promotes a revitalization of France’s economy, while claiming an anti-establishment stance that plays to the emotions of France’s disgruntled electorate. While Macron has utilized some populist rhetoric in his campaign, Marine Le Pen has made it central to her political identity. Her slogan, “au nom de peuple,” (in the name of the people), is characteristic of a campaign that has echoes of Trump while pressing her longstanding anti-European Union, anti-immigration views. Polls show Le Pen winning the first round of France’s election, but losing soundly once fractured liberal and moderate conservative voters rally around a single candidate. Le Pen has tried to be defiant against these predictions, however, citing botched polls predicting losses by Trump and Brexit as evidence that she can win.Le Pen’s campaign hits many of the same notes as Trump’s, including restoring lost manufacturing jobs and tightening national borders. Last week, she praised Trump’s ban on immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries and called opposition to it “in bad faith.” On Sunday, Le Pen launched her campaign with an hour-long speech against globalization, Islamists and other familiar targets. Lagging behind in polls is the ruling Socialist party candidate Benoit Hamon, who was selected to run after deeply unpopular President Francois Hollande opted not to seek a second term ― the first French leader to do so since the nation’s fifth republic was created in 1958. Hamon has so far been a minor figure in the campaign, promoting experimental policies that include universal basic income, and taxes on industrial robots that may take jobs. Much of the momentum is behind Macron. The past few weeks have shown how things can drastically change, however, and with the elections first round scheduled for late April, there is still ample time for more scandals and volatility."
26,STYLE,Ashley Graham Nabs Her Second Vogue Cover In 3 Months,Jamie Feldman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ashley-graham-vogue_us_589b4f46e4b09bd304bf32b7,"You might recognize some of her co-stars, too.",2017-02-08,"L to R: Liu Wen, Ashley Graham, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Imaan Hammam, Adwoa Aboah, Vittoria Ceretti",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589b508b2800001f00997a63.jpeg?cache=5Z4A2iTyCv&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ashley Graham saw her December British Vogue cover and raised it one new cover of American Vogue. But this time, she’s joined by a few special guests.Graham posed alongside Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Adwoa Aboah, Liu Wen, Vittoria Ceretti and Imaan Hammam for the glossy’s March 2017 cover. They are, according to Vogue, the models who are “democratizing fashion.”How are they doing that, you might ask?We can cite their connection with legions of followers on social media as well as Graham’s ability to shatter stereotypes and speak to women about body positivity. Vogue also writes that “each of these cover girls proudly inhabits her own particular gorgeousness in her own particular way. Together they represent a seismic social shift: The new beauty norm is no norm. And fashion, the industry that – yes – has historically done much to enforce beauty codes, is joining the movement, ¡Viva La Revolucion! All are welcome. Anything goes.”If you find it a bit of a reach that Vogue is helping drive the democratization of fashion, you’re not alone. The magazine is not exactly known for relatable content, and revolutions are not made by putting some of the world’s most beautiful women ― all of whom are a similar age and all but one of whom are of similar size ― on a single cover.But there is diversity there. And it comes on a day when Graham also released her latest collection and ad with Swimsuitsforall, featuring “a beautiful group of women – non-models and some local ladies from San Juan,” according to a press release. The company said the ad was made to encourage “women of all shapes, ages and background to come together and celebrate their unique womanhood.”Two moves to a more diverse fashion world in one day? We’ll take it. Head to Vogue, which hits newsstands Feb. 21, to read the entire story. "
27,POLITICS,How The Muslim Ban Is Ripping This Young Couple Apart,"Christopher Mathias, Rowaida Abdelaziz, and Sharaf Mowjood",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/muslim-ban-ripping-couple-apart-fiance-visa-sudan_us_5898bb61e4b09bd304bca1e0,They were supposed to get married in Virginia and start a life together. Then Donald Trump signed an executive order.,2017-02-08,Abdelrahim's visa was provisionally revoked by Trump's executive order.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589b4a5a25000032080b7bc6.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was supposed to be their wedding day in Fairfax, Virginia. A simple ceremony at the courthouse to make things official, then a celebration with friends and family. They were supposed to move into their new apartment, too, where they were excited to begin their lives together. He had just signed the lease. But instead Faisal Radwan, 27, and Duaa Abdelrahim, 26, were trapped in a small room at King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, wondering whether the world would ever let them be together.“I’m really upset over this situation,” said Abdelrahim, who described her heartbreaking predicament in a series of WhatsApp voice messages sent to The Huffington Post. “Please help us,” she continued, choking back tears. “Please help me enter the U.S. I have so much hope in you guys, after God.” It was Monday, Jan. 30. On Friday, Jan. 27, President Donald Trump issued an executive order temporarily banning individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries ― Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Libya and Sudan ― from entering the U.S. Trump said the order would keep America safe, even though there have been no fatal terror attacks on American soil by immigrants from those seven countries. The order partially fulfilled the president’s Islamophobic campaign promise to ban all Muslims from entering the country.Hours after the order was issued, stories surfaced of immigrants and visitors being detained, deported or both. Others were turned away at airports overseas. “’You’re not allowed to enter the U.S. because of your Sudanese passport,’” Abdelrahim said airport officials in Jeddah told her the morning of Sunday, Jan. 29, as she and her fiancé were preparing to leave Saudi Arabia. She had a U.S.-issued fiancée visa to move to the U.S. and marry Radwan, an American citizen. She’d waited so long ― over a year ― for that little piece of paper. She’d filled out all the right forms. Paid all the expensive dues and fees. She was immigrating to the U.S. legally. Abdelrahim’s visa was among some 60,000 visas provisionally revoked by Trump’s executive order ― 60,000 people suddenly either unable to leave the U.S. for fear of not being let back in, or unable to come to the U.S. to see their families, attend college, escape war or marry and live with the person they love. Abdelrahim was also no longer allowed to enter Saudi Arabia, the country where she was born and raised.Abdelrahim’s parents are Sudanese immigrants to Saudi Arabia. There, citizenship is based on your father’s citizenship, and residency is granted to immigrants’ children through their fathers’ visas.In the process of preparing to come to the U.S., Abdelrahim’s father had canceled her Saudi residency. So she and Radwan were stuck in this limbo ― a drab room designated for passengers catching connecting international flights ― contemplating a deeply uncertain future.If only their flight to America had been 48 hours earlier.“I’ve been in this airport for days,” she said. “There’s no comfort. We can’t rest, we can’t sleep ... I can’t go pray.” “They won’t let me leave this room and it’s a really small room ... there’s just a few chairs,” she added. “When I try to leave the room, they search me.”Abdelrahim provided HuffPost with photos of her U.S. fiancée visa, her exit visa from Saudi Arabia, and her plane tickets. A U.S. State Department official said that “visa records are confidential under U.S. law; we’re not able to discuss the specifics of any visa case.” Neither Customs and Border Protection nor the Department of Homeland Security immediately responded to a request for comment on this story. On Tuesday, Jan. 31, after spending over three sleepless days at the Jeddah airport, Abdelrahim sent a WhatsApp text message: “The plane is moving now. I have faith in God ...”She and Radwan were told they were no longer welcome in Saudi Arabia, and were put on a flight across the Red Sea to Sudan, the country where the couple had met four years prior at a wedding. While Abdelrahim is legally allowed to stay and live in Sudan, Radwan is not, she said. He has a temporary visa to be in that country, and will have to leave soon. Plus, he has to get back to his job at his dad’s gas station in Virginia to earn money. On Monday, Feb. 6, the couple said they went to the U.S. embassy in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, to see if they could get an extension on Abdelrahim’s fiancée visa. It expired on Feb. 4, mere hours after a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked Trump’s travel ban, allowing immigrants and visitors with valid paperwork to once again enter the U.S.If only the ruling had come a day or two earlier.Abdelrahim said the embassy denied their request for an extension on her fiancée visa. Embassy officials saw henna on her and Faisal’s hands. This was a sign that they were already married, the officials told them, which means Abdelrahim is no longer eligible for a fiancée visa. The couple received the henna, a custom at many Muslim weddings, during a small ceremony in Saudi Arabia they held for family and friends unable to come to the U.S. for their wedding.They tried explaining that their real, official wedding was in the U.S., but the embassy officials weren’t moved, saying they’d have to start the visa process all over again, this time applying for a spousal visa.More paperwork. More expensive dues and fees. More time ― maybe another year ― until they’ll be able to start their life together. And that’s assuming that within a year, Trump will no longer have an immigration ban in place. “God doesn’t want me to enter this country,” Abdelrahim said. Now she faces a new life in Sudan, a country she has never lived in, without Radwan. She says she’s lucky to have family there ― her grandmother, her brother, and some aunts and uncles. Asked if she thinks she’ll ever make it to the U.S., she said, “I have hope in God that nothing is impossible.” “But I personally don’t have any hope,” she added. “I am so exhausted by this situation.”Radwan plans on going back to the U.S. soon without Abdelrahim. Though he is an American citizen, he’ll undoubtedly face a lengthy interrogation by U.S. border officials about his time in Sudan. He might have to cancel the lease on their new apartment. For now, he’ll return there alone. "

Civil asset forfeiture allows law enforcement to seize cash and property from people who haven’t been convicted of a crime.“Who is the state senator?” Trump asked Sheriff Harold Eavenson of Rockwall County, Texas, on Tuesday. “Do you want to give his name? We’ll destroy his career.” State senator Daylin Leach (D-Montgomery) encouraged the president to come after his career instead.“Hey! I oppose civil forfeiture too,” Leach posted on Facebook Tuesday. He added: “Why don’t you come after me you fascist, loofa-faced shit-gibbon!!”He also posted the message on Twitter.Leach co-sponsored a bill that would require a criminal conviction before assets are seized. That bill is currently in committee, according to Philly Voice. It wasn’t the first time Trump has been called a shit-gibbon on the internet.A White House spokeswoman said Tuesday afternoon that Trump was “joking,” but that’s probably little comfort to Leach.In a statement given to Philly Voice, Leach’s spokesperson said the senator is “mad as hell.”“President Trump blithely talked about destroying the career of a man who disagreed with Trump on a policy issue,” spokesman Steve Hoenstine told the publication. “Then Trump laughed about it, which is just what you’d expect from someone who gets his kicks firing people on national television. Trump just continues to undermine democratic norms, America’s system of checks and balances, and the general principle of human decency.”His spokesman also tweeted about the incident. It doesn’t appear there will be apologies any time soon. "

Earl Pomeroy (D-N.D.) was sitting in a restaurant in his home state of North Dakota, eating breakfast, when a waitress came to his table and handed him a bag of tea.This was peculiar, since Pomeroy hadn’t asked for tea. Nor, for that matter, had the waitress brought him a cup in which to drink it ― just the bag.Pomeroy quickly surmised that this was about politics, and not some ploy to enhance her tip. That summer, tea party protests had erupted at town hall meetings where he and his colleagues met with constituents. Those had been bad, forcing him to nix the in-person meetings in favor of less troublesome dial-in phone calls.Now, however, he was being targeted while eating his eggs ― a sure sign that even voters, even those with North Dakota nice dispositions, were agitating for change.“In retrospect, that was the beginning of the end,” Pomeroy said of the encounter. “You didn’t have to be a genius to know something was up.”After 18 years in Congress, Pomeroy was ousted in the Democratic bloodbath of 2010. But he remains in Washington, D.C. ― emerging in the greener pastures of the firm Alston & Bird LLP.And as Pomeroy looks over at his old stomping grounds on the Hill, he’s starting to see signs of the kind of discord that led his waitress to turn a tea bag into a symbol of protest eight years ago.“There is no question there is currently a widespread level of engagement that I’ve not seen in many, many years,” he said of his Democratic brethren. As for the Republicans, he offered advice: “Listen respectfully to what is being said and agree when you can find areas with agreement. Because over the years, the Democratic Party did not do a good enough job of that itself.”Only three weeks into Donald Trump’s presidency, Democrats are dreaming of an inverse of the tea party wave of 2010. People who were previously indifferent or foreign to the political process are taking to the streets in millions to march against Trump’s inauguration, or going to airports to rally against his ban on refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. They’re hitting the phones, overwhelming House and Senate offices with displeasure over Trump’s Cabinet choices. Their anger over the potential repeal of former President Barack Obama’s health care law has forced several members to literally flee town hall meetings.For Pomeroy and others, it’s provided a dash of optimism just when the party is hitting its modern-day nadir. For Republicans, it hasn’t yet caused panic. But it’s forced them to begin contemplating the need for inoculation.“I think there’s no question that the Democrats are synchronized, coordinated and animated. And the use of misinformation ... leading to false conclusions has empowered their side and brought the public almost to a frenzy,” said Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.). “There is a lathering effect that’s happened on the left that will have possible powerful implications going forward,” he added. “It will be our responsibility to defuse it with truth and good information.”On Tuesday, the House GOP held a strategy session to discuss how demonstrators have disrupted their town hall events. Republican leaders told members to be gracious and not create a scene, according to aides. But some lawmakers at the session had quirkier remedies. Along with basics like developing a safety plan and keeping an open line of communication with local law enforcement, former sheriff Rep. Dave Reichert (R-Wash.) said he tries to offer protesters donuts.“I have 33 years of law enforcement experience, so House leadership asked me to share some security recommendations for other members of the conference to consider implementing in their district offices,” Reichert told The Huffington Post. Republicans didn’t expect they’d be in this position so soon after Trump’s election. But their need to quickly shift gears from celebrating an election triumph to addressing heated protests is not without precedent.The Obama White House was first besieged by questions over the Tea Party protests in mid-February 2009. And its initial response, like the Trump administration’s after it, was to dismiss them. Then-Press Secretary Robert Gibbs famously mocked CNBC’s Rick Santelli as over-caffeinated and inauthentic. Later, he called the tea party movement “astroturf.” “It was probably the biggest mistake we made as a White House: not taking seriously that we had to engage that fight,” a former Obama administration official conceded. “On the inside, it wasn’t clear that this was the spark for a fundamental shift in politics.”The next few months will show whether the current protests represent a fundamental shift or something less tectonic. But their intensity is unmistakable (the town hall eruptions in 2009 didn’t really start until the summer) and they’ve left Republicans struggling to anticipate the fallout.  “Any time that you have a group that is willing to get out and spend their Saturday for a cause, [it] shouldn’t be ignored,” House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said of recent protests.“You have to take any grassroots movement serious,” he added. And for some Republicans, including those intimately involved in the 2010 wave, faint echoes are apparent. “Oh my gosh, yes, there are a lot of parallels [between 2010 and now],” said Michael Steele, the Republican National Committee chairman during the 2010 elections. “Put it this way: The parallels are potentially there. The question is, will the Democrats, in some respects, try to force it? Because that just won’t work.”But not everyone is convinced that 2018 will be a 2010 redux. Liberal populist movements have sprouted up before, only to dissipate over time. Some observers, including members of the Trump administration, argue that the current discord has the distinct flavor of orchestrated chicanery. “They’re trying to put huge political pressure on us,” said Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), indicating that he and other Republicans believe demonstrators are being funded by Democratic interest groups. “They’re busting into our offices. Our staffs across the nation are having to call security agencies,” he said.Brat called Democratic backers’ efforts to organize people “the biggest news story probably in the country right now,” but one that “no one’s reporting on it because it comes from the left.”For now, the GOP is pressing ahead with its agenda, hoping that protests simply dissipate. Repealing Obamacare remains a priority. And rarely, if ever, do members publicly rebuke Trump ― at least, not in harsh terms. House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions, whose Texas district went for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Trump 48.5 to 46.6, is now in the crosshairs of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. He suggested that the best way to respond to the new pressure is to deliver results. “We all have pressure on us to deliver an agenda that gets more people back to work, that is fairer for people ― literally to make America great again,” he said.Mike McAuliff contributed reporting."

His alleged accomplice, 37-year-old Mary Craig Rice, was taken into custody, the Troup County Sheriff’s Office said. She was charged with capital murder. The violent ending at a West Point motel capped a multi-state crime spree that began with the discovery of two women’s bodies in a Milton, Florida, motel room on Jan. 31. Alicia Greer, 30, and Jacqueline Moore, 39, both were fatally shot, authorities said. Greer’s parents told WALA she had dated Boyette for several months before she was killed. Three days later, 52-year-old Peggy Broz was found fatally shot in her Lillian, Alabama, home. Authorities say they believe Boyette and Rice targeted Broz at random and took off in her stolen car. On Monday, a 28-year-old woman identified by her mother as Kayla Crocker was shot and wounded in her Pensacola, Florida, home, WEAR-TV reported.Crocker’s 2-year-old son was home with her at the time, but was unharmed.

Three days later, 52-year-old Peggy Broz was found fatally shot in her Lillian, Alabama, home. Authorities say they believe Boyette and Rice targeted Broz at random and took off in her stolen car.

34,POLITICS,These Republicans Have A Plan For Tackling Climate Change,Chris D'Angelo and Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-plan-carbon-tax-climate-change_us_589b18a3e4b09bd304bef21b,It's time to pitch it to President Donald Trump and other skeptics in the party.,2017-02-08,Former Secretary of State James A. Baker III is among a group of veteran Republicans proposing a carbon tax plan to combat global climate change. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589b36e1280000c63a9979d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — A group of Republican statesmen led by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Tuesday introduced a carbon tax plan intended to strengthen the economy, promote national security and “protect our natural heritage.” Many people in the party have “looked the other way” on the issue for too long, the group wrote in its proposal published by the Climate Leadership Council. And with control of the White House and Congress, the GOP now has an opportunity to “set the terms of a lasting market-based climate solution.”In addition to Baker, who served under presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, the group includes former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and former Secretary of State George Shultz.“Mounting evidence of climate change is growing too strong to ignore,” the proposal reads. “While the extent to which climate change is due to man-made causes can be questioned, the risks associated with future warming are too big and should be hedged. At least we need an insurance policy.”The plan calls for phasing out a large portion of the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon emissions and a full repeal of the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan. In its place, the group suggests instituting a tax on carbon dioxide emissions that might start at $40 per ton and increase over time. Money raised from the tax would be kicked back to the American people in the form of a “carbon dividend” of approximately $2,000 per year for a family of four, according to the document. Ted Halstead, the founder, president and CEO of the newly established Climate Leadership Council, said Wednesday morning at a press conference that the “historic” announcement represents the first time Republican leaders have put forth a clear climate solution. “For so long this issue has been mired in partisan politics,” he said. “The simplistic view is that Democrats want to solve climate change and Republicans don’t. Well, as today’s statement, our statement, proves, that is not true.” Halstead, Baker and other members of the group are also scheduled to meet Wednesday with White House officials to discuss specifics, CNN reports.But it’s anyone’s guess how President Donald Trump, one of many Republican climate skeptics, will receive the plan. Trump has dismissed climate change as “bullshit” and a hoax “created by and for the Chinese,” and has vowed to withdraw from global actions to combat it. When CNN’s John King asked Baker on Tuesday how one goes about convincing a skeptical president that it’s time to face the realities of climate change, the former secretary of state said he’s not sure it can happen.“But this is a good plan, both from a policy standpoint and from a political standpoint,” Baker said. “[Climate change] is a problem, right now at least. And Republicans have not been at the table, because we are basically skeptics or deniers.”One potential supporter of a carbon tax is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who previously served for 10 years as the chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp. During his time at the oil giant’s helm, Tillerson publicly backed a national carbon tax as his preferred solution to curbing carbon emissions.His support came in 2009, when there was hot debate in Congress over a bill that would establish a cap-and-trade system, which would put a limit on emissions and allow companies to buy and sell the rights to pollute. A carbon tax, by contrast, levies a blanket fee on carbon emissions, and is widely considered by economists to be the most effective way of curbing emissions. Some environmentalists accused the company of trying to kneecap the legislation by causing “a distraction” with its historic carbon tax announcement. Exxon Mobil also lobbied against two bills in Massachusetts that would have created carbon taxes there. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, was among the first to voice support for the Republicans’ plan, calling it “thought-provoking.” Unsurprisingly, not everyone sees a carbon tax in such a positive light. Michael A. Needham, CEO of Heritage Action for America, called the plan “a destructive taxation regime” that would neither make American companies more competitive nor bring back jobs.“Beyond the policy implications, the Climate Leadership Council’s carbon tax proposal is just the latest example of policy solutions crafted by and made for cultural elites,” Needham said in a statement. “There is no room in the Republican Party for a carbon tax. These so-called Party elders might want to meet with former Secretary [Hillary] Clinton to discuss this idea.”Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said she’s in favor of putting a price on carbon but that it shouldn’t come at the expense of current laws limiting pollution. “We have a moral obligation to protect future generations from the growing dangers of climate change,” she said. “Effective action means building on the progress we’re already making, not sacrificing those gains by weakening the laws Congress has already passed.” Read the full plan, titled “The Conservative Case For Carbon Dividends,” here.

It also prevents Cooper from appointing anyone to the University of North Carolina Board of Trustees or the state Board of Education.“We need to put these partisan confirmation games behind us and get on with repealing HB2, raising teacher pay and getting better jobs for North Carolinians,” Cooper said in a statement Wednesday. “The court is absolutely correct in their decision and should not be intimidated by threats from legislative leaders.” The bill had followed a contentious election where McCrory refused to concede the race to Cooper.Cooper said in December that he was willing to sue Republicans over those bills.“They will see me in court,” he said during a press conference. “And they don’t have a very good track record there.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589b9c342900002200f25410.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A coalition of environmental, labor and consumer advocates sued the White House on Wednesday to block an executive order President Donald Trump signed last month requiring federal agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every proposed new rule.The lawsuit ― filed in a federal district court in Washington, D.C. ― alleges that the order will undo rules that protect health, safety and the environment. The environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council cosigned the suit with the progressive consumer watchdog Public Citizen and the Communications Workers of America, the country’s largest union for media and telecoms workers.“President Trump’s order would deny Americans the basic protections they rightly expect,” Rhea Suh, president of the NRDC, said in a statement. “New efforts to stop pollution don’t automatically make old ones unnecessary. When you make policy by tweet, it yields irrational rules. This order imposes a false choice between clean air, clean water, safe food and other environmental safeguards.”The White House did not respond to a request for comment.It’s yet another Trump executive order that critics have panned as dangerous and poorly thought-out. Federal judges in New York and Seattle blocked the implementation of his de facto travel ban on refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries, which seemed to lay the foundation for the Muslim ban Trump promised during his campaign. The ban immediately sparked demonstrations around the world and prompted protesters to storm U.S. airports, where people were being barred entry.Trump called the judges’ rulings “disgraceful” in a speech on Wednesday, saying the “courts seem to be so political.”The lawsuit filed on Wednesday appears to be the first major legal challenge to Trump’s two-for-one executive order, which he signed on Jan. 30 to fulfill another of controversial campaign promise. By partnering on the suit, the NRDC and CWA are bridging a divide between environmental and labor advocates just as the White House appears to be pitting them against each other. While the newly emboldened Republican Congress attempts to shred collective bargaining rules, Trump has cozied up to the leaders of top construction unions to court their support for his planned wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.The relationship between conservationists and labor unions has, of course, been fraught for decades as business leaders pitched environmentally destructive projects by presenting them as a source of jobs. Trump vowed to boost the U.S. economy by slashing regulations, essentially an attempt to create jobs at the expense of the environment. That pledge seemed to target down-and-out coal workers, whose job opportunities dried up as natural gas became electrical utilities’ fossil fuel of choice. Republicans, including Trump, characterize former President Barack Obama’s policies to curb greenhouse gas emissions as a “war on coal,” and the new president has promised to revitalize the industry.But things ended disastrously the last time a Republican president axed environmental and safety regulations accused of choking the coal industry. Under George W. Bush, the Department of Labor eased the enforcement of mine safety rules. The liberal Center for American Politics argued that this led to 2006 Sago mine catastrophe that left 12 miners in West Virginia dead. A decade later, Trump has nominated the former owner of that mine ― billionaire private equity mogul Wilbur Ross ― as his commerce secretary.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Thompson said that questionnaire should be received by Thursday.The announcement came on the same day that Senate Democrats sent a letter to Puzder demanding that he detail his relationship with the private-equity firm that owns his fast-food company. Puzder is the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. burger chains.In her letter, Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said she’s concerned about any ties Puzder may have to Roark Capital, which bought a majority stake in CKE Restaurants in 2013. Roark specializes in acquiring restaurant companies based on the franchise model, and its investments include Jimmy John’s, Arby’s and Cinnabon.The Labor Department is responsible for enforcing workplace standards inside franchised restaurants, and the fast-food industry is known for its frequent violations of the law. The agency under President Barack Obama even implemented a targeted enforcement program aimed at holding fast-food operators accountable.According to Murray, any “past or present financial interest in Roark” that Puzder may have “raises questions regarding your ability to faithfully carry out the Department of Labor’s mandate.” “I firmly believe any Secretary of Labor must be willing and able to effectively enforce these crucial worker protection laws,” Murray wrote. “If you are confirmed, you could be required to recuse yourself from decisions involving a significant sector of businesses, raising serious questions about your ability to fulfill your duties.”A representative for Puzder told The Associated Press last week that the holdup to his confirmation hearing was due to the time it was taking Puzder to divest, though other outlets have reported that he has had second thoughts about the job.Democrats and worker groups have assailed Puzder’s nomination from a number of different fronts.His restaurant chains have racked up a long list of workplace violations over the years, and as labor secretary, Puzder would be responsible for enforcing those very laws. As The Huffington Post reported Monday, Puzder also personally employed an undocumented worker on his property. And his ex-wife leveled abuse allegations against him years ago. Although she later retracted the claims, she went on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” in disguise to talk about domestic violence.If the entire Democratic minority voted against Puzder, they would still need three Republicans to break ranks and join them in order to sink his nomination.This post has been updated throughout to reflect that the HELP Committee received Puzder’s OGE certificate Wednesday and to include comments from Puzder’s spokesman.This post has been updated throughout to reflect that the HELP Committee received Puzder’s OGE certificate Wednesday and to include comments from Puzder’s spokesman.Have a tip to share about Andy Puzder or CKE?

Supporters of secession are currently collecting signatures in hopes of getting the so-called “Calexit” initiative on the 2018 statewide ballot. The idea has been discussed for years due to California’s size, economic strength and tendency to move faster on progressive issues than other states, and picked up steam after Trump’s election. (Trump lost to Hillary Clinton by more than 4 million votes in California.) But in an interview with the Los Angeles Times published Wednesday, Becerra batted down the idea.“I’m not interested in watching California break up or break away,” he said. “I just want to make sure that when we’re doing something that’s worked, that someone doesn’t get in the way simply because they think they’ve got a better idea. We have our warts and we continue to perfect some of the things that we’ve done that haven’t been right, but I will tell you this ― the sun does shine in California.” Most Californians appear to agree with Becerra: A recent Reuters poll showed 1 in 3 people surveyed support Calexit. Becerra, who was confirmed as attorney general last month, has pledged to fight Trump policies he feels are antithetical to California’s values, including the president’s executive actions targeting sanctuary cities and undocumented immigrants. Earlier this week, he joined 15 other attorneys general from across the country in filing an amicus brief opposing the president’s ban on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. “We’re trying to keep the federal government away from depriving people of their rights,” Becerra told the Los Angeles Times. “We will stand up and defend the people of the state of California from any intrusion that is unconstitutional by the federal government.”He argued that California is well within its rights to push back on such policies.“We’re not required to abide by an edict by a president simply because the president says he wants us to do something,” he said. Becerra also criticized Trump’s threat to cut off funding for the University of California at Berkeley after protesters shut down a scheduled lecture by Twitter troll Milo Yiannopoulos. “While I think all of us would agree that never in the exercise of free speech should you engage in violence to express that speech, Donald Trump should read the Constitution and start with the 1st Amendment of the Bill of Rights, so he will understand why what he said is so offensive to those who believe in free speech,” Becerra said. Read the full LA Times interview here.Becerra is one of many California Democrats leading the resistance against Trump. Most of the state’s high-profile leaders, including Gov. Jerry Brown, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Kamala Harris, state Senate president pro tempore Kevin de León and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon have spent the bulk of the new year speaking out against the president and his policies. The state legislature has taken up multiple bills aimed at combatting Trump’s influence in the state, including a resolution condemning the president’s Muslim ban and several bills to help protect undocumented immigrants from deportation.In response, Trump has called the state “out of control” and threatened to cut it off from federal spending.Becerra challenged that threat earlier this week, pointing out that California, which is the world’s sixth largest economy, contributes huge amounts to federal coffers via taxes. “We will fight anyone who wants to take away dollars that we have earned and qualified for simply because we are unwilling to violate the Constitution under these defective executive orders,” he said.

39,POLITICS,Senators From Both Parties Move To Prevent Trump From Lifting Russia Sanctions,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-russia-sanctions-bill_us_589b5f85e4b04061313ae824,A new bill would require congressional oversight for changes.,2017-02-08,Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has been critical of President Donald Trump's non-confrontational approach to Russia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589b60a32800001f00997aab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Six senators from both parties introduced a bill on Wednesday that would prevent President Donald Trump from easing sanctions on Russia without congressional approval. The Russia Sanctions Review Act of 2017 would require the Trump administration to describe in detail for Congress any proposed sanctions relief. The administration would then have to demonstrate that the Russian government had stopped supporting “significant acts intended to undermine the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine” and ended all “cyberattacks” against the U.S. government or individual Americans.Both houses of Congress would then have 120 days to reject the proposed sanctions relief, or otherwise “take action” on them, before the reductions in sanctions came into effect.Republican Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.) joined Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Claire McCaskill (Mo.) and Ben Cardin (Md.) in co-sponsoring the bill.“To provide relief at this time would send the wrong signal to Russia and our allies who face Russian oppression,” Graham said in a statement. “Sanctions relief must be earned, not given.”The United States levied sanctions against Russia in 2014 for its intervention in Ukraine, when it annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and subsequently provided support to pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. The Obama administration levied additional sanctions against the country in December for its alleged interference in the American election. Among congressional Republicans, McCain, Rubio and Graham have perhaps been the most openly critical of Trump’s suggestions that he is open to warmer relations with Moscow.Trump has shocked many observers with his relative unwillingness to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin, including Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine. The president’s conciliatory approach to Russia has also raised questions about his possible conflicts of interest, since U.S. intelligence agencies believe Putin’s government hacked Democratic emails in an effort to bolster Trump’s presidential candidacy. It is not clear, however, if the Trump administration plans to ease either set of sanctions against Russia.U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley indicated on Thursday that sanctions would remain in place until Russia withdrew from Crimea.“Crimea is a part of Ukraine,” Haley said in her first official speech at the UN. “Our Crimea-related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns control over the peninsula to Ukraine.”Asked Friday to confirm that the administration would keep current sanctions in place, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer merely referred reporters to Haley’s remarks.“Ambassador Haley made it very clear of our concern with Russia’s occupation of Crimea,” Spicer said. “I think she spoke very forcefully and clearly on that.”"

Jeff Sessions after barring Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) from doing so the night before.Warren, who was one of the many Democrats taking the floor late into Tuesday in opposition to the Alabama Republican’s nomination to be attorney general, was blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) when she tried to read a letter that King wrote against Sessions in 1986 when Sessions was up for a federal judgeship.McConnell objected on the grounds that she was violating the rarely invoked Senate Rule XIX, which bars senators from “impugning” their colleagues.Democrats who challenged the shutdown of Warren were twice voted down by all the Republicans present. Warren was barred from the debate, and King’s words were excluded, although Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) managed to read some into the record anyway.Social media erupted over the blockade, guaranteeing that Warren’s and King’s words got vastly more attention than they might have, and the objections vanished Wednesday morning when Sens. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) tried the same move as Warren.Udall went first, arguing that King’s words “must be included” because the Senate was not weighing Sessions as a colleague, but as a nominee, and because her words have direct bearing on his previous service as a prosecutor.“It was the judgment of Coretta Scott King, widow of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King, that [Sessions] used the office of the United States attorney for Alabama to, quote, these are Coretta Scott King’s words, ‘chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens.’ End quote,” Udall said. “That was her opinion at the time.”He went on to read her full letter, as well as the testimony she prepared to oppose Sessions’ 1986 nomination for a federal judgeship.No one objected, nor did anyone object as Brown followed suit.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also read King’s words, and demanded that McConnell apologize to Warren.“I am going to vote against Jeff Sessions to become our next attorney general, but I am even more alarmed about the decision of the majority leader here in the Senate to deny one of our leading senators the right to voice her opinion, the right to put into the congressional record what I have just said,” Sanders said.“And if Mr. McConnell, or anybody else, wants to deny me the right to debate Jeff Sessions’ qualifications, go for it,” he added. “But I’m here, I will participate in debate, I will oppose Jeff Sessions, and I think Sen. Warren is owed an apology.”Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell, said no one objected to Udall or Brown because a point of order under Rule XIX can’t be done retroactively, and neither had preceded their reading of the letter with a long, disparaging speech as McConnell said Warren had.“Last night, Sen. Warren had been warned by the chair and continued to violate the rule anyway,” Stewart said."

No one in America should be punished because of the city where he or she is born,” Trump said during a speech at a law enforcement conference in Washington, D.C. “Every child in America should be able to play outside without fear, walk home without danger and attend a school without being worried about drugs or gangs or violence.”“So many lives and so many people have been cut short, their potential, their life has been cut short,” he added. “So much potential has been sidelined, and so many dreams have been shattered and broken, totally broken.”Trump, however, is undercutting that dream for children around the world with his refugee and travel ban. By blocking children from fleeing dangerous and desperate conditions ― that they had no hand in creating ― in search of a better life in America, he is helping to ensure that they are essentially “punished because of the city” where they are born.One such person affected by Trump’s ban was Fatemah Reshad, a 4-month-old baby from Iran in need of a life-saving heart operation. Her family previously had an appointment to get a visa to travel to the United States for the procedure, but it was canceled after Trump’s executive order. With the help of immigration attorneys and politicians, the family was eventually able to get a waiver to fly to Portland, Oregon, just as a judge ordered a temporary halt to Trump’s order.Another child affected by Trump’s policy was a 2-year-old Iraqi boy named Dilbireen Muhsin, who was badly burned after a heater exploded in the refugee camp where he was staying.Before the election, he and his father traveled to the United States for surgery. Dilbreen continued to stay with a family in Michigan, while his father went back to Iraq to be with his wife, who was having their second child. As of Sunday, according to CNN, the family has not been able to secure visas to travel to the United States, and they are concerned they may be separated from their son or that Dilbreen may have to return to Iraq without the additional surgeries he needs.Trump’s ban is currently not in effect after a district judge in Seattle temporarily put it on hold. On Tuesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments on whether the ban is constitutional. A ruling is expected this week.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

By blocking children from fleeing dangerous and desperate conditions ― that they had no hand in creating ― in search of a better life in America, he is helping to ensure that they are essentially “punished because of the city” where they are born.One such person affected by Trump’s ban was Fatemah Reshad, a 4-month-old baby from Iran in need of a life-saving heart operation. Her family previously had an appointment to get a visa to travel to the United States for the procedure, but it was canceled after Trump’s executive order. With the help of immigration attorneys and politicians, the family was eventually able to get a waiver to fly to Portland, Oregon, just as a judge ordered a temporary halt to Trump’s order.Another child affected by Trump’s policy was a 2-year-old Iraqi boy named Dilbireen Muhsin, who was badly burned after a heater exploded in the refugee camp where he was staying.Before the election, he and his father traveled to the United States for surgery. Dilbreen continued to stay with a family in Michigan, while his father went back to Iraq to be with his wife, who was having their second child. As of Sunday, according to CNN, the family has not been able to secure visas to travel to the United States, and they are concerned they may be separated from their son or that Dilbreen may have to return to Iraq without the additional surgeries he needs.Trump’s ban is currently not in effect after a district judge in Seattle temporarily put it on hold. On Tuesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments on whether the ban is constitutional. A ruling is expected this week.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

The media watchdog group Center for Media and Democracy, with legal representation from the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit against Pruitt in an Oklahoma court on Tuesday seeking to force Pruitt to respond to nine open records requests. The requests were filed as far back as January 2015. The suit is also seeking the release of communications between Pruitt’s office and the energy industry, including corporations like Koch Industries, Peabody Energy and the National Coal Council. CMD said in a statement that Pruitt had “yet to turn over a single document,” despite acknowledging last year that his office had “3,000 emails and other documents” relevant to the requests.“We are doing this because these emails should be released so that people can properly vet his record before the Senate votes to confirm him,” Nick Surgey, the center’s director of research, told Reuters news agency.The lawsuit accuses Pruitt of violating Oklahoma’s Open Records Act in failing to publicly release the documents.

The Oklahoma Attorney General’s office has agreed to a judge’s order requiring it to retain all relevant documents while the case is pending, the group said. Pruitt’s ties to the oil industry have come under heavy scrutiny in recent weeks. He has received more than $300,000 in contributions from the fossil fuel industry since 2002. As attorney general, he’s been accused of prioritizing industry interests over the health of the environment and his constituents. In 2014, The New York Times reported that Pruitt, together with other Republican attorneys general, had formed an “unprecedented, secretive alliance” with major oil and gas companies to undermine environmental regulations. One of the firms, Oklahoma’s Devon Energy, drafted a letter for Pruitt to send to the EPA in 2011. Pruitt printed the document on state letterhead and sent it off, almost verbatim, to Washington, D.C.Pruitt also joined industry players in filing lawsuits to stop regulations, including Oklahoma Gas and Electric and the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, an industry-backed nonprofit group.Pruitt’s nomination to lead the EPA, an agency whose mission is to protect human health and the environment, has met fierce resistance. In addition to his close relationship with the fossil fuel industry, opponents have pointed to his hostility to the EPA as evidence of his unfitness for the job: Pruitt sued the EPA 13 times as attorney general.

What Happens When It’s Taken Away?,"Hava Kagle, ContributorUX Designer, Mother",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/death-by-12-fighting-for-life-with-obamacare_us_589b9ce5e4b02bbb1816c2ce,Doing away with the ACA punishes people like my son.,2017-02-08,"<p>My son at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, Stanford</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589b9cfb2800009835997c30.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My son is 12. He has large inquisitive eyes, rosy red cheeks, a smattering of freckles across the bridge of his nose, and a contagious, hysterical laugh. He spends his free time making video games, browsing through funny YouTube videos, and consuming large jars of peanut butter. Half-way between boy and man, he still enjoys a good swing on the playset in our backyard and, when he feels well, scaling the sofa in our living room. He’s a great kid.Three and a half years ago, just after he turned 9, he showed signs of what would become a diagnosis of severe drug-resistant Crohn’s disease. Crohn’s had caused painful bleeding ulcers throughout the lining of his digestive system. For months, we watched him suffer through different treatments only to watch them fail. Our house looked like a pharmacy with pills and injections, rubber gloves, and our very own medical waste disposal unit. Our lives revolved around his pain 24 hours a day.One warm summer day, I drove my sweet boy, weak from blood loss, heart racing, with a fever hovering around 105, to be admitted into Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital. He whispered from the backseat of the car “Mom, do I need a will?” He had just turned 11.After five weeks in the hospital, we finally discovered a series of unconventional treatments that helped ease his symptoms. Luckily, our incredible team at Stanford and the treatments that saved him were covered by insurance through my employer. And, although I’m thankful for that insurance, I also know I would have had to fight for these same treatments had this not been an emergency. You see, I’ve learned a few things about the insurance industry and a lot about health care over these past few years. Here is my conclusion: it is absolutely insane that we allow for-profit insurance companies to manage access to our health care.Good health care can be costly and insurance is a for-profit business responsible only to shareholders. My son and people like him dramatically reduce company profits. Without a legal requirement, there is no incentive for a company to insure him or give him access to the expensive treatments he needs. Did you know that insurance companies have their own doctors and nurses on staff to fight your medical team and deny expensive treatments and hospitalizations? I didn’t. So not only must your doctor be caring, a good listener, and versed on the latest research in her field, she also needs to be a fighter, willing to spend the time arguing for the necessity of what she has prescribed.Compounding the problem is that pharmaceutical companies overcharge insurance companies when they know insurance will pay. After all, pharmaceutical companies also need to turn a profit. My son currently receives Entyvio intravenously every 4-7 weeks. Each dose is billed at $35,000. That’s $420,000 a year for nothing but a single medication. Suspiciously, Entyvio, Remicade, and other expensive drugs known as “biologics” offer steep discounts for customers who don’t have adequate insurance.The Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) isn’t perfect. It relies on insurance and pharmaceutical companies being magnanimous and keeping costs low ― against their best interests. But doing away with the ACA punishes people like my son who need continuous access to health care. He needs to be able to stay on my insurance until he is 26 and, once he is out of college and in his first job, he needs to have access to insurance regardless of his pre-existing condition. Without it being a requirement, no one will insure him. Without good health care he will die.In the past couple of months my boy has grown taller than me. His voice is scratchy and low. He isn’t in constant pain and continues life within reach of what is “normal” for a pre-teen boy. He knows about the Affordable Care Act but I haven’t brought to his attention just how much is at stake with its removal. I’m giving it some time, hoping that Americans will do the right thing for this kid, my kid, and all those like him."

His orders included: the construction of a wall between Mexico and the United States, a stripping of federal funds from cities that do not cooperate with federal authorities to arrest or detain undocumented immigrants and a ban on refugee immigrants from seven Muslim countries. He justified these orders by arguing that it would ensure safe communities and save “thousands of lives, millions of jobs and billions and billion of dollars.” Additionally, Donald Trump announced that his administration will publish a weekly list of “criminal actions” committed by immigrants. His order does not specify that only crimes committed by undocumented immigrants would be published and this makes it possible for offenses committed by any immigrant to be included. President Trump’s attack on immigrants could not be more misguided. Deporting immigrants would not reduce violent crime or save money. President Trump disregards the fact that an overwhelming majority of immigrants contribute to our society with their labor and that this has helped make the United States a prosperous nation. According to the Pew Research Center, as of 2014 there were approximately 11.1 million undocumented immigrants in the country. Collectively they contribute 12 billion dollars in taxes a year. Most importantly, as the American Immigration Council states, innumerable studies show that “immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars” than native U.S. citizens. This is true for both undocumented and documented immigrants. In 2010 for example, the American Community Survey found that roughly 1.6 % of immigrant males age 18-39 are incarcerated compared to 3.3 % of native-born citizens. More specifically, less educated native born men age 18-39 had an incarceration rate of 10.7% which was triple the 2.8% rate among foreign born Mexican men, and five times greater than the 1.7% rate among foreign born men from Guatemala and Salvador. As such, an overwhelming majority of immigrants are not “criminals” based on the common definition of the term. Therefore, harsh immigration policies will not be effective in fighting crime because the rate of crime in immigrant communities is already lower than the crime committed by native-born citizens. Accordingly, it is time that we stop stereotyping immigrants, especially those who lack legal status in our country, as criminals who do not contribute to society. Such stereotypes are not only inaccurate but they serve to dehumanize and scapegoat a community that, despite not being able to exercise its full political voice and therefore benefit from the protections of our country, still contributes greatly to our society.Additionally, President Trump’s plan to build a wall between Mexico and the United States is not the answer to unregulated migration from the south. Such a plan is financially unfeasible because it will cost upwards of 15 billion dollars in tax payer money. Mexico’s president Peña Nieto has continuously stated that Mexico will not pay for it. President Trump has suggested that Mexico’s products will be taxed at a higher rate to cover the cost of the wall. If that happens, it will be consumers in the United States who will bear the burden of covering the price of the wall. The higher tax on Mexican products will affect everyone, especially when 69% of the imported fresh veggies come from Mexico. More importantly however, building a wall will not stop unregulated migration because such a method ignores the root causes of the problem. Trump’s anti-immigrant sentiment does not take into account how U.S. interventions in South America led millions to migrate into this country. Most Latin American people immigrate from the South due to poverty, political instability and recurring financial crisis. Many of these problems were created or exacerbated by the United States government. Throughout history, the United States has repeatedly made the life of Latin American countries difficult by overthrowing democratically elected governments, and pushing for economic policies that undermined Latin American economies. For example, just as recently as 1973, the United States government helped overthrow Salvador Allende, a democratically elected president in Chile, facilitating the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, who killed and tortured thousands of Chileans. Further, the United States invaded and occupied Nicaragua from 1912-1930, and in 1979 the U.S. government funded a rightwing group known as the “Contras” to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. The “Contras” were known, among other atrocities, for using terrorist tactics and for smuggling drugs into the United States. In 1976, the United States backed a military dictatorship in Argentina which killed 30,000 people. Further, U.S. trade policies such as NAFTA prompted millions of low wage workers to abandon Mexico and migrate to America.It is time for this country to envision a progressive immigration agenda, one that does not dehumanize immigrants and blame them for the problems of our society. From its inception this nation was founded by immigrants. How hypocritical is it then that the current administration rejects the recent wave of immigrants despite their contributions to our country? Moreover, how is it that this administration is willing to put the lives of refugee immigrants on the line by banning their entry from war-torn nations like Syria and Yemen where civilians are being bombed and children are being starved? How is it that this administration is willing to leave behind the many men and women in Iraq who helped the U.S. government in their operations there by working as translators and contractors and now, because of this, they face persecution and their lives are at risk? It is time that we demand more humane immigration policies. We have to show the current government that the lives of immigrant communities matter. That we will not stand for their criminalization or their ban. As Martin Niemoller reflected in post war Germany, “first they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a Socialist...Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me.” Therefore, let us not be silent and normalize the persecution of immigrant communities. We have to protect the rights of immigrants because united we stand strong while being silent legitimizes the side of the oppressor. Let’s raise our voices loud and clear to say that immigrant rights ought to be respected and that refugees are welcome here. Lets seek to build bridges that unite us and not walls that separate us.

Jan. 15.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5899f0851900003400e0a8b3.jpeg?cache=YxABswKl2D&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald’s Trump’s rise is proving to be a boon for China. His first presidential actions and undiplomatic style have opened a void in global leadership. This comes just as China, after years of strong economic growth and with a powerful new leader in charge, seems ready for prime time.At this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Chinese President Xi Jinping seized this golden opportunity, strode into the spotlight and presented his country as ready and able to fill the many gaps in the international order that Trump’s “America First” approach is creating. But becoming a world leader is not just simply a matter of wielding economic, diplomatic and military clout: there is a moral dimension as well. China has the first three other characteristics, but does it have the fourth?This question is important in part because of how far Trump has gone in undermining American global moral authority. He has jettisoned some of the core values that made many across the world find America attractive. Gone are the White House goals of striving to safeguard civil rights at home and abroad, protecting an independent press and helping democracy flourish overseas. And then there is Trump’s moral style, which replaces Obama’s audacity of hope with his own mendacity of despair.This has opened a void. But is China the country to step up?Maybe what Beijing has to offer as a moral global leader is political ― a meritocratic mode of efficient governance, as some China boosters would have it. Post-Mao China has been one of the few authoritarian countries in the world that successfully survived the global wave of democratization. After Mao, Chinese leaders developed a collective form of leadership, with rules and institutions that have allowed peaceful and predictable leadership transitions, both at the national and local levels. Some observers claim that China stands as a well-functioning meritocracy that appeals to those living in democracies who have been hurt by massive electoral rifts and populist, post-fact politicians. We are not persuaded by this idea and find it particularly hard to square with how Xi is governing.Xi’s ascent came amid a power struggle with a rival faction in the Communist Party. Right before his term started, Xi was incommunicado for two weeks. After he took power, he immediately launched a still ongoing anti-corruption campaign that has targeted his opponents. He has effectively ended collective leadership and expanded the authority he directly controls beyond that of any of his post-Mao predecessors, much more powerful at least than any leader since Deng Xiaoping. He has even enjoyed a budding cult of personality. The emphasis on his personality in the press, the way he is referred to as Xi Dada (Big Daddy Xi) and the fact that books by and about him fill bookstores all seem like throwbacks to Mao’s time in power (1949-1976). Meritocracy may be attractive, but personalized power cults are not a foundation for moral leadership.But Beijing really does offer an anti-Western moral vision for the world. This is not new, of course. Mao sharply rejected both Western capitalism and even Soviet-style socialism. Since Mao, China has adopted many Western ideas, from the market economy to cultural goods to even individual rights and some notion of governance based on law. It has always done so in a very careful way, while stressing Chinese and socialist characteristics.In the last decade or so, we have seen a clear turn against Western influences. Under Xi’s leadership, this transformation is evident in an influential internal communiqué called “Document 9.” This edict forbade any discussion of several things ― the “seven unspeakables” as they became known ― deemed to be Western notions, including the rule of law, judicial independence and civil society. Many of these had become quite normal in China, and there were many higher education centers and book series dedicated exactly to these concepts. Ironically, even the party’s Constitution and the national Constitution talk about rule of law and human rights.But Beijing’s anti-Western stance has only continued. A set of new security laws has tightened the space for civil society and largely excluded foreign non-governmental organizations from operating in China. And last month, China’s highest judge came out with an unusually sharp warning against Western legal influence: “We should resolutely resist erroneous influence from the West: ‘constitutional democracy,’ ‘separation of powers’ and ‘independence of the judiciary.’ We must make clear our stand and dare to show the sword.”When Mao rejected Western influence, he tried to offer his own revolutionary vision. But what alternative to the West can current Chinese leaders offer the world? The obvious answer, though ultimately a problematic one, is a reboot of traditional “Confucian” principles.Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, promoted the Confucian-sounding pursuit of a “Harmonious Society,” where growth was no longer sufficient and harmony would serve as the basis for a balanced society and reduce internal conflict. Hu also introduced a list of 16 do’s and don’ts, the so-called “Eight Honors and Eight Shames,” which included stressing the values of nationalism and the Confucian virtues of duty, hard work and plain living.Beijing’s rediscovery of Confucian values, however, has not been successful enough to serve as a basis for moral global leadership. Stressing Confucian values is less about showing how strongly these values are embedded in Chinese society and more a desperate attempt to rebalance the excesses that have emerged with China’s massive growth and urbanization, which created immense inequality, out-of-control materialism and a further frying of the fabric of community.To bring this into sharper focus, we only need to look at two recent laws. One law mandates that children must regularly visit elderly parents. The other stipulates that parents must educate their children so they don’t spend too much time online playing video games. Both laws show a society in which basic Confucian values ― like filial piety (xiào, in Chinese) ― are clearly weakened. It is especially ironic that Chinese leaders have turned to law to correct for this moral gap. A true Confucian leader rules by example, not by rules. As a famous Confucian scholar wrote more than two millennia ago: “I have heard it said that a state which is about to perish is sure to have many governmental regulations.”Trump’s first weeks in office have upset many of America’s closest allies and foes and upset global priorities like combatting climate change, helping refugees, ending armed conflict and terrorism and ensuring equitable global trade. The world needs a new global leader, one that can reinvigorate morals and values that can guide the world toward addressing these immense challenges.Given its internal political and moral crises, China does not seem ready. To rise to the occasion and become a global moral leader, Beijing will need to do more than present an authoritarianism-that-works blueprint, double down on tired forms of anti-Western rhetoric and offer traditional values that do not even convince Chinese people.Chinese leaders may instead turn back to the pragmatism and diligence through which the country rebuilt itself following the disasters of the late Mao years and find inspiration for a moral vision to China’s own problems and global challenges. It’s a tall order, though, for a country whose leaders are prone to both bravado and insecurity and who view China’s rich history and experiences more as cards to play than as sources of genuine inspiration.

49,TASTE,Cooking Off The Cuff: Italian Rice And Sausage (Let’s Not Call It Risotto),"Edward Schneider, ContributorTravel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-italian-rice-and-sausage-lets_us_589a0627e4b02bbb1816c034,Years ago I was casting about for a hearty risotto: something with meat in it and not necessarily subtle or delicate. In,2017-02-08,<p>Vialone nano rice and vegetable stock in the unwashed pan from the sausage mixture</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589a0c4528000027009976c6.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Years ago I was casting about for a hearty risotto: something with meat in it and not necessarily subtle or delicate. In one of my regional Italian cookbooks, I found just what I was looking for: A dish in which the rice was simply boiled and a pre-cooked sausage mixture folded in afterward. It sounded great, but somehow I never got around to making it. And having accomplished that research mission, I promptly forgot the name of the dish and the region of which it was a specialty. Last week, though, two Italian-style sausages left over from a previous dinner got me to thinking about it again, and I put the Web to work, with searches like “riso AND salsiccia AND NOT risotto”. After a while, I found it: Riso (or sometimes risotto) alla pilota, eaten in Mantua. And there it was in my Lombardy cookbook, not to mention splattered all over the internet, in text, images and videos. Because it is so simple – plain cooked rice (not stirred with gradual additions of liquid) mixed with sautéed sausage (or pork pounded with seasonings) and sometimes onion – it depends entirely on the ingredients, and that means it won’t taste authentic without the particular sausage Mantuan cooks use, most typically the garlic-scented salamella mantovana. This is liberating, because it means the rest of us can appropriate the idea of the dish and make something quite different but, with any luck, no less delicious.Here’s where I took the idea with my two already-cooked fennel-seed-seasoned sausages (enough for two main-course portions). I chopped a medium onion and minced a tiny bit of garlic, and sweated them in olive oil with salt, pepper and a few spikes of rosemary, chopped. When the onions were soft, I raised the heat to medium and added the sausages, which I’d chopped fairly fine (you could – and probably should – use raw sausages, removed from their skins and broken up by hand before sautéing and then broken up further as they cook). These took two or three minutes to heat through and become tender again, and I then added about 1/3 cup (80 ml) vegetable stock (other stock would be fine, or white wine) and reduced it for a couple of minutes before spooning in 1/2 cup (120 ml) tomato sauce. Canned tomatoes, crushed, or fresh ones in season (peeled and chopped) would be fine. After five minutes of simmering over low heat, I tasted the mixture for seasoning and transferred it to a bowl to cool.I did not wash the saucepan, but did scrape it fairly clean with a rubber spatula: Because this is not the authentic Mantuan dish, I wanted the rice to gain some flavor from the film of tomato-sausage juice remaining in the pan. So, in the same pan, I cooked 3/4 cup (160 g) risotto rice (vialone nano in this case, but use what you have) in 1-1/4 cup (300 ml) light vegetable stock – water would be fine too, though I might not want to use chicken or other meat-based stock – brought it to the boil, gave it a stir, lowered the heat to minimal, covered the pan and simmered very slowly until done: slightly chewy but neither crunchy nor mushy. This took about 13 minutes; start checking after 11 minutes and don’t be surprised if it takes 15 or 16. I let it stand, covered, for five minutes (a good practice in almost all rice cooking), then, over medium-low heat, folded in the sausage mixture and all its liquid. When it was warmed through and seasoning and moisture levels checked, I stirred in a couple of tablespoons of grated parmesan (yes, pecorino would be fine) and served with more cheese on the side.Whether or not this tasted much like Mantuan riso alla pilota, it was indeed delicious and hearty. Yet it did not lack subtlety of flavor and texture: The taste of the rice was not masked, although the sausage mixture was savory, and there was a nice, softly chewy consistency from both the rice and the fragments of sausage.There’s a lot of scope for variations here, but at least for now I’ve found – and remembered – my hearty alternative to risotto.Etymology note: Riso alla pilota has nothing to do with either aviation or navigation. Traditionally, whole rice was milled in a mortar-like implement called a pila; this was operated by a pilota."

Through a series of Falcon’s penalties and Patriots playmaking, New England hijacked the Lombardi Trophy in the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history.Although the Falcons were up against arguably the greatest quarterback in NFL history backed by a formidable team, when you’re up by 20 points and lose, somethings amiss. Not even the magic of Matt Ryan and Julio Jones was enough to save them. So instead of returning to Atlanta as Super Bowl champions, the Falcons are forced to settle for second best.The Falcons have a rallying cry: “Rise Up.” This season every football fan in Atlanta has been proudly chanting it as the “Birds” made mincemeat out of almost every visitor to the Georgia Dome. But now the fans have left the building and the excitement is gone. The dream of being crowned Super Bowl Champions in 2017 has been relegated to the dustbin of history. No one will remember the team that took second, only that Brady and his Boston bandits never quit and were crowned.What’s unknown in this story is how the Falcons will respond. Coach Dan Quinn did a magnificent job of leading his team to Houston, but he will undoubtedly be scrutinized for his team’s inability to close out a game that his gridiron warriors clearly dominated.In the long run, only one thing really matters: Will the Falcons “Rise Up” after being publically humiliated in front of a billion people? Or is this battle cry just a marketing slogan created at the Falcon’s complex in Flowery Branch by guys in pin stripe suits and granny glasses? Is Matt Ryan, the 2017 NFL MVP, intelligent enough to learn from Professor Brady’s class on mental toughness and roar back to the top in 2018? Or will he and the Falcons quietly return to Atlanta with their tails between their legs and shrink back into NFL mediocrity?Time will tell, but here’s the beauty of the scenario: Millions of kids that worship the black and red uniform and chant its battle cry are about to find out what “Rise Up” really means. The Falcons may have allowed the Super Bowl to slip from their hands, but that’s not nearly as important as what they do now as their impressionable young fans watch them mourn. It’s easy to be a role model when you’re basking in the glow of victory, but when you’ve been embarrassed in front of 1/7 of the world’s population, grace doesn’t flow so naturally.Yes, Atlanta is about to find out what its Falcons are really made of, and what’s revealed will set the stage for the future of Arthur Blank’s franchise. My hope is that Coach Quinn and his maestro, Matt Ryan, will lead this team to truly “Rise Up” from the ashes of defeat and show their city that it isn’t just a slogan, but a way of life. Football may only be a game, but it’s also a great metaphor for living. It’s not about how many diving catches Julio can make or how many completions “Matty Ice” can throw; it’s about how much defeat, disappointment and despair they can suffer and still keep “Rising Up” with their heads held high and their hearts in tact. If the 2017 Falcons can pass that lesson on to their adoring young fans, it will serve them in a far greater way than any championship t-shirt they may have worn around school.Note to Falcons: The big game is over. You’re beat up, emotionally exhausted, and disappointed to the point of despair. Just remember that there are millions of us who look up to you as heroes, as Gods of the gridiron, and your extraordinary feats of magician-like athleticism not only entertain us, but also give us hope in a world that sometimes seems hopeless.We will all be watching, and you have the opportunity to teach us how to bounce back in your moment of despair. So “Rise Up”, Falcons, and show us what you’re made of."

It didn't work.,2017-02-08,Patrick J. Kearney - Veteran teacher and an advocate for public education.  Opinions expressed are my own.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5840aead1a00002000ccace1.jpg?ops=100_100,"I have spent my career as a teacher. I think in lesson plans, data and outcomes. Yesterday, the United States Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos as Secretary of the Department of Education, and I’m trying to figure out what lesson has been learned. Money wins. It really is that simple.Ms. DeVos has no real experience in the field of education, unless spending millions of dollars to advocate for unregulated for-profit charter schools counts as experience in education. It is also worth noting that the DeVos family has given over $950,000 to the senators who confirmed her today and that the DeVos family gave over $8.3 million to various conservation Super PACs over the last two election cycles. Those of us who don’t find Ms. DeVos qualified had just our voices. It is estimated that our senators were receiving as many of 1.5 million calls each day regarding Ms. DeVos’s nomination. Our senators received a massive amount of emails and tweets sharing our legitimate concerns about the answers she gave in her confirmation hearings, her conflicts of interest, her agenda to divert resources from public schools to private interests, and her lack of experience with public education.We have been told that our legislators appreciate hearing from their constituents. Never before has the public gone to such lengths to share legitimate concerns about a cabinet nominee. So, again I ask, what is the lesson that we have learned? Money wins.I have been shocked at how many of the senators who voted in favor of Ms. DeVos today went to great lengths to point out the limited scope of the Secretary of Education’s responsibilities, as if to say that it doesn’t really matter who we put in charge. Rather than trumpeting her qualifications, many of them bent over backwards to say that she is committed to enforcing federal law, as though that somehow makes her exceptional.I try to be a glass half full guy, so here’s what I’ve got; education made the front page for a few days. Public educators (who despite our reputation for being in lockstep, often agree on very little… ever been to a faculty meeting?) have come together united in our concerns about this choice to lead the Department of Education. People who would never have considered calling a legislator’s office have made repeated calls in order for their voices to be heard.I wrote a letter to Ms. DeVos a month ago in which I told her that those of us in public education are a little freaked out by her nomination. We’re still a little freaked out, but it would be silly to wish her anything but the best. It is important to recognize that all of us are here to serve ALL of the young people who show up every day needing a safe place to be challenged, nurtured, and supported. Our legislators didn’t listen to our voices today, but let’s hope that Ms. DeVos does."

Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Senior fellow",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5832f6f91a00002000cc8fd6.jpg?ops=100_100,"By James M. DorseyChina, at the behest of Pakistan, has prevented the United Nations from listing a prominent Pakistani militant as a globally designated terrorist. China’s protection of Masood Azhar, who is believed to have close ties to Pakistani intelligence and the military, raises questions about the sincerity of a Pakistani crackdown on militants as well as China’s willingness to use its influence to persuade Pakistan to put an end to the use of militants as proxies.The United States, Britain, France and India have long wanted the United Nations Security Council Sanctions Committee to designate Mr. Azhar on the grounds that his organization, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has already been proscribed by Pakistan as well as the international body.Mr. Azhar, a fighter in the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan and an Islamic scholar who graduated from a Deobandi madrassah, Darul Uloom Islamia Binori Town in Karachi, the alma mater of numerous Pakistani militants, is believed to have been responsible for an attack last year on India’s Pathankot Air Force Station. The militants, dressed in Indian military uniforms fought a 14-hour battle against Indian security forces that only ended when the last attacker was killed. Mr. Azhar was briefly detained after the attack and has since gone underground.Mr. Azhar, who was freed from Indian prison in 1999 in exchange for the release of passengers of a hijacked Indian Airlines flight, is also believed to be responsible for an attack in 2001 on the Indian parliament in New Delhi that brought Pakistan and India to the brink of war.JeM despite being banned continues to publicly raise funds and recruit fighters in mosques. Indian journalist Praveen Swami quoted Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar, Mr. Azhar’s elder brother, as telling worshippers gathered in a mosque in Punjab in late January to commemorate a militant who had been killed in India: “Islam is a world power and cannot be destroyed. Whoever tries to destroy it will be destroyed himself. Jihad is the most important obligation of our faith.”Pakistani indulgence of JeM and Chinese connivance in preventing Mr. Azhar, a portly bespectacled son of a Bahawalpur religious studies teacher and author of a four-volume treatise on jihad as well as books with titles like Forty Diseases of the Jews, from being designated has raised eyebrows in both Pakistani and Chinese policy circles.Opening a window on apparent differences between civilian and military branches of government, Pakistani Foreign Minister Aizaz Chaudhry last year reportedly warned a gathering of political, military and intelligence leaders that Pakistan risked international isolation if it failed to crack down on militant groups. Mr. Chaudhry noted that Pakistan’s closest ally, China with its massive $46 billion investment in Pakistani infrastructure as part of its One Belt, One Road initiative, was increasingly questioning the wisdom of protecting Mr. Azhar at Pakistan’s behest.Chinese vice foreign minister Li Baodong last year defended his country’s repeated shielding of Mr. Azhar by suggesting that attempts to designate the JeM amounted to using counter-terrorism for political goals. “China is opposed to all forms of terrorism. There should be no double standards on counter-terrorism. Nor should one pursue own political gains in the name of counter-terrorism,” Mr. Li said.Chinese policy analysts with close government ties squirm when asked about China’s repeated veto of efforts to designate Mr. Azhar. The analysts suggest that the Pakistani military and intelligence’s use of proxies like Mr. Azhar in their dispute with India over Kashmir has sparked debate about the wisdom of sinking $46 billion into Pakistan.China’s hopes that the investment in infrastructure would persuade the Pakistani military and intelligence to seriously back away from using militant proxies have so far remain unfulfilled.The investment is part of China’s larger effort to link Eurasia to China through infrastructure. It expects that the linkage will spur economic development both in Pakistan and China’s troubled north-western province of Xinjiang where China’s harsh measure‎s against the cultural practices of the Uighurs have sought to pre-empt Islamist violence.Responding to the civilian government’s effort to crackdown on Jaish-e-Mohammad, including last year’s freezing of its accounts by the State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Azhar defended the group’s contribution to Pakistan’s defence of Kashmir as well as the jihadist movement at large.“When we entered the tent of the jihadist movement. it had no branch in Kashmir, nor was there lightning in Iraq or Syria. There were just two fronts, in Afghanistan and Palestine, one of them active and one of them shut. We have watched as the jihad we befriended grew from a glowing ember into the sun; from a small spring into a river, and now, as it is about to become a great ocean,” Mr. Azhar wrote in the group’s magazine.A BBC investigative documentary last year traced jihadist thinking in Britain to a month-long visit to Britain in 1993 by Mr. Azhar, who at the time headed Pakistani militant group Harakat ul Mujahideen.Mr. Azhar gave 40 lectures during his fund-raising and recruitment tour and was feted by Islamic scholars from Britain’s largest mosque network. More and more scholars joined his entourage as he toured the country before moving on to Saudi Arabia. A passionate and emotive speaker, women reportedly took off their jewellery and handed it to Azhar after listening to his speeches.“It was Azhar, a Pakistani cleric, who was the first to spread the seeds of modern jihadist militancy in Britain – and it was through South Asian mosques belonging to the Deobandi movement that he did it,” says BBC reporter Innes Bowen. Indian analysts believe that shielding Mr. Azhar serves China’s purpose of keeping India preoccupied with the threat of political violence. China’s is moreover grateful for successful Pakistani efforts to stop the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (IOC) that groups 57 Muslim nations from criticizing Chinese policy in Xinjiang. Finally, the analysts say, shielding Mr. Azhar constitutes retaliation for India’s hosting of the Dalai Lama.In defending Mr. Azhar with one eye on India, China is walking a fine line that threatens to undermine its massively funded policy objectives in Pakistan, a country that for years has been reeling from militancy that has fuelled sectarianism at home and created militant groups that at times have turned on their Pakistani masters.By doing so, China risks allowing militancy to further fester in a country where militancy is not confined to small groups but has been woven into the fabric of significant segments of society. Attempting to heal what is an open wound requires not only economic development but also a Pakistani and Chinese counter-terrorism strategy that refrains from making politically opportunistic compromises.Dr. James M.

Swept up in the Nazi extermination nightmare, Ben endured two ghettoes, nine concentration camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau and Buchenwald, and, near the end of the war, two death marches before being liberated, a few months shy of his 24th birthday, by the American army in the spring of 1945. He weighed only 78 pounds. Near Normal Man is his story, a half-hour documentary film produced and directed by his daughter Charlene. The film premieres on Feb. 13, at the San Diego Jewish Film Festival.When I agreed to watch this film before its release, I thought that I had seen many such films, and doubted that I would find anything new or noteworthy in this one. I was wrong. I found this film especially moving, largely because of Ben Stern’s extraordinary articulation, from beginning to end, with a conclusion that for me was both surprising and inspiring, and distinguished this story from so many others.The part of the story that was similar to others was the portrayal of the tsunami of the Nazis descending upon ordinary people leading ordinary lives, and the brutalities that followed: the herding of people into crowded outdoor prisons called ghettoes, their transportation like cattle to places where death was the only release, the separation from everyone Ben knew and loved, and whom he would never see again, and the struggle against immense odds to survive. Those parts of the film, especially as narrated by Mr. Stern with sensitive, painful, articulate recall, were agonizing to watch, and can never be watched too often to remind us of what can happen when human brutality is unrestrained. It happened to Jews in Europe during WWII; it happened to Native Americans in the United States; and it happened to Africans kidnapped from their homes and taken to, in effect, another planet of unimaginable evil. And it has happened to others, is happening still, when hatred based on religion, ethnicity or other tribal impulses overcome the bounds of humanity and let loose the beasts of genocide and persecution.Sometimes those beasts descend all at once, as they did with the enslavement of Africans, and the brutality and inhumanity is unmistakeable from the start. But sometimes those beasts don’t descend all at once; sometimes they sneak up on us, in small increments that can disguise the terrible endgames, and allow ordinarily good people to become accomplices. When Hitler moved against the Jews, he did not do so in the beginning with candid policies of murder: first, he wanted Jews to leave and launched persecutions to encourage them to leave; when not enough did, there was confinement to ghettoes; and when that didn’t work, there was the “final solution”—extermination. People who might not have been able to stomach the systematic mass murder of their neighbors were prepared to accept it by learning to accept lesser brutalities, so that what was once unthinkable became normalized. Evil triumphed and gained acceptance in small degrees.Meanwhile in America, while we were at war with the Nazis and Japan, we were fearful enough to conduct our own ethnic pogroms against American citizens of Japanese descent. We also started incrementally: first with curfews, then with forced sales at bargain prices of businesses and homes owned by people of Japanese descent and then, by herding them into camps, remotely located far from where they once had lived. It never reached the stage of extermination, but the acceptance of what we did to our neighbors out of fear projected onto people of different skin color and ethnic ancestry was nonetheless inhuman and prejudicial. Later, nearly a half-century later, too late for the people victimized by our fear and our prejudice, what we did was characterized by then-President Ronald Reagan, no bleeding-heart liberal he, as “an act of racism and war hysteria.” And so it was: although the program was sold as a way of keeping us safe, not a single charge of traitorous behavior was ever made much less proved against anyone incarcerated for the duration of the war in those camps. Yet it was widely supported and upheld at the time by most Americans and by the United States Supreme Court. And as we face our own demons today, our own unleashed beasts of fear and prejudice, that is why Ben Stern’s story is profoundly relevant, why it is not merely historical but contemporary.Ben Stern’s story becomes unusual after he survives the Nazis and marries a concentration camp survivor he meets in a displaced-persons camp while still in Europe, and in 1946 they come to America, where they raise a family and where they thrive. Then the story gets complicated. In 1959 they move to Skokie, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, with a population that, after WWII, was about 60 percent Jewish. Eighteen years later, in 1977, a small but virulent neo-Nazi group located in Chicago, and infamous for its repeated clashes in Chicago with civil rights advocates and for its opposition to school integration, decides to take its campaign to the suburbs and writes to about a dozen Chicago suburbs for permits to parade and demonstrate in their streets. One of those suburbs was Skokie.Most of those suburbs just ignored the letter, or responded lethargically. Skokie responded like a bull to a red flag, and understandably so. Populated by a large number of concentration camp survivors, the idea that black-shirted would-be Nazis sporting swastikas would be marching in their streets, past their homes, was a reprise too much to bear. Many hid from the prospect, but Ben Stern did not. He stood up to organize an effort to prevent them from coming: not again was he about to tolerate what for him was a life-shattering experience. And that is where I came in.The effort to resist the neo-Nazi group, constituting at most two dozen people and with sick irony headed by a man named Frank Collin, born Frank Cohn, himself Jewish and the son of a Holocaust survivor, initially focused on laws designed to bar them from coming to Skokie. The details of that ought not to burden this review, so I will omit them. Suffice to say, the laws passed by the town of Skokie were essentially the same as the laws passed in many towns, including Southern towns and including Chicago, to ban speech they hated, often including civil rights demonstrations for racial equality in schools, voting, etc. And the American Civil Liberties Union often represented many groups banned by such laws from parading. In Chicago, the ACLU of Illinois had often represented the NAACP and other civil rights groups, as well as Frank Collin and his neo-Nazis, in challenging such laws. Almost always, those laws were struck down as violations of the First Amendment, and it was those kinds of cases that freed Martin Luther King, Jr. and his colleagues to conduct their demonstrations for equal voting rights in hostile Southern towns, and that allowed people protesting the war in Vietnam to march. So when Skokie reacted to Collin’s application for a permit to march by passing precisely those same kinds of laws, and Collin came to the ACLU as he and civil rights groups had previously in Chicago, seeking to challenge those laws, the ACLU took the case, as it normally took all such cases. And the ACLU won the case, as it had for many other clients of varying views, striking down the laws Skokie had passed to ban the neo-Nazis from marching down their streets. The reason, legally, was straightforward: if Skokie could pass laws to ban speech it hated, then so could towns in Mississippi and Alabama and Georgia pass the same laws to ban speech they hated, namely, blacks and whites marching together for an end to Jim Crow laws. If the First Amendment prevented one, it prevented the other. And if it didn’t, then any government, local, state or federal, could ban any speech it disliked, or felt threatened by. Imagine that power in the hands of, say, Joe McCarthy or Richard Nixon or, just to stay current, Donald Trump. The First Amendment works like an insurance policy: it protects us from the abuse of power, when people who hate our views are in power, but in return we have to tolerate speech we hate. Legal restrictions on speech are like poison gas: they seem like a useful weapon when we control it, and have a nefarious target in sight, but when the political wind shifts the poison gas can blow back upon us. To the extent the First Amendment prevents that, it does so by denying to all governments the power to ban speech it hates. And today, that includes Donald Trump.And where do I come in to this dispute? I was a high official of the ACLU during the tempestuous Skokie case four decades ago. I strongly defended what the ACLU did then, and still do, for the reasons stated in the previous paragraph. I fear living in a country where the government gets to decide which speech to permit and which to ban. And I fear living in a country where the majority gets to decide that, because I remember when if it had been put to a vote back in the ‘50s and early ‘60s, many, perhaps most, of the demonstrations organized and conducted by Martin Luther King, Jr., would have been banned. Rights, including the right to speech, cannot depend on the outcome of elections; they must be protected against such outcomes. If that isn’t obvious today, it never will be.As you might imagine, I frequently defended the ACLU’s decision to take the Skokie case. But early on in that dispute, despite being a leading defender of the ACLU’s decision to take the case, I resolved never to lecture those who had endured, and still endured, incalculable pain and anguish, on why the First Amendment compelled the result it did, or why the absence of enforceable constitutional norms helped make what happened in Germany possible, and why Jews were better protected here because of enforceable constitutional norms, even though such norms can under certain conditions be swept away. Or why a court decision contrary to the one we sought, and obtained, would have been harmful to the rights of Jews and other vulnerable minorities. I would explain all this to others, did so endlessly, but I would not presume to lecture those who, like Ben Stern, had suffered, and suffer still, in ways I could only dimly imagine. Nor would I lecture blacks in the South who had witnessed and suffered savageries I could only understand from afar about why it was necessary and even protective to permit a defanged Klan from parading in the streets with their sheets and pillowcases, rubbing salt into psychological wounds that were not mine. And so I hesitated to review this film, not wishing to dilute the majesty of Ben Stern’s life with lectures about the First Amendment. But as I watched the conclusion of this remarkable film, Ben Stern surprised me again.Ben Stern’s efforts to legally bar the neo-Nazis from coming to Skokie in 1977 were unsuccessful. But that didn’t stop him. Just because the neo-Nazis could speak didn’t mean people couldn’t respond. Ben Stern remembered 1939, and he would not submit quietly or silently to the spectre of swastikas in the streets where he lived again. Haunted by ghosts I could not possibly imagine, he even bought a gun, though he was firmly against guns. But he did more than that. He persuaded people living in Skokie not to hide in silence behind closed doors, as some had counseled. Instead, he organized a massive counterdemonstration to confront the neo-Nazis if they came. It was a brilliant response and a perfect remedy for a country with strong First Amendment rights, and the courage to use those rights. It was precisely the response contemplated by the First Amendment—to respond to hateful speech not by granting government the power to ban speech but by organizing more speech. Stern had the citizens of Skokie and their supporters ready to greet the neo-Nazis with a huge counterdemonstration. And in the end, the neo-Nazis never came. Afterwards, Stern took the gun he had purchased, a gun he was ready to use if the neo-Nazis turned violent, and shattered it with a hammer, scattering its remnants.Stern’s organized resistance has many inspiring predicates. In 1857, in the only case the Supreme Court ever ruled on the constitutionality of slavery, it upheld it in a decision that is disgusting to read even today, 160 years later. I cannot imagine how it hit slaves and free blacks in non-slave states. In a brutal, inhuman decision, Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that blacks were “subordinate and inferior beings” and “had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.” Those who advocated the abolition of slavery, both black and white, had every reason to feel crushed. But Frederick Douglass, the most famous black abolitionist of that time, responded this way:The Supreme Court is not the only power in this world. We, the abolitionists and colored people, should meet this decision, unlooked for and monstrous as it appears, in a cheerful spirit. The very attempt to blot out forever the hopes of an enslaved people may be one necessary link in the chain of events preparatory to the complete overthrow of the whole slave system.In other words, Frederick Douglass did not give up, would not give in, and it was he, not Chief Justice Taney, who would in time prevail. Vince Lombardi. the famous football coach, once said “I never lost a game, sometimes time ran out.” But in the fight for liberty and social justice, time never runs out. When you get thrown for a loss, you get back up and keep playing. Frederick Douglass kept playing, and his cause prevailed. Ben Stern kept playing too, and he’s still playing. Progress is never a straight line. The moral arc of the universe may bend towards justice, but along the way it gets bent back, too. Resilience and persistence prevails. Frederick Douglass was an inspiration of resistance, and a triumph of humanity. So is Ben Stern. He not only survived, he remained human. His life, his perseverance, his integrity of human values during a time of beasts, inspires us all. Ben Stern rocks. See this film!"

Swept up in the Nazi extermination nightmare, Ben endured two ghettoes, nine concentration camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau and Buchenwald, and, near the end of the war, two death marches before being liberated, a few months shy of his 24th birthday, by the American army in the spring of 1945. He weighed only 78 pounds. Near Normal Man is his story, a half-hour documentary film produced and directed by his daughter Charlene. The film premieres on Feb. 13, at the San Diego Jewish Film Festival.When I agreed to watch this film before its release, I thought that I had seen many such films, and doubted that I would find anything new or noteworthy in this one. I was wrong. I found this film especially moving, largely because of Ben Stern’s extraordinary articulation, from beginning to end, with a conclusion that for me was both surprising and inspiring, and distinguished this story from so many others.The part of the story that was similar to others was the portrayal of the tsunami of the Nazis descending upon ordinary people leading ordinary lives, and the brutalities that followed: the herding of people into crowded outdoor prisons called ghettoes, their transportation like cattle to places where death was the only release, the separation from everyone Ben knew and loved, and whom he would never see again, and the struggle against immense odds to survive. Those parts of the film, especially as narrated by Mr. Stern with sensitive, painful, articulate recall, were agonizing to watch, and can never be watched too often to remind us of what can happen when human brutality is unrestrained. It happened to Jews in Europe during WWII; it happened to Native Americans in the United States; and it happened to Africans kidnapped from their homes and taken to, in effect, another planet of unimaginable evil. And it has happened to others, is happening still, when hatred based on religion, ethnicity or other tribal impulses overcome the bounds of humanity and let loose the beasts of genocide and persecution.Sometimes those beasts descend all at once, as they did with the enslavement of Africans, and the brutality and inhumanity is unmistakeable from the start. But sometimes those beasts don’t descend all at once; sometimes they sneak up on us, in small increments that can disguise the terrible endgames, and allow ordinarily good people to become accomplices. When Hitler moved against the Jews, he did not do so in the beginning with candid policies of murder: first, he wanted Jews to leave and launched persecutions to encourage them to leave; when not enough did, there was confinement to ghettoes; and when that didn’t work, there was the “final solution”—extermination. People who might not have been able to stomach the systematic mass murder of their neighbors were prepared to accept it by learning to accept lesser brutalities, so that what was once unthinkable became normalized. Evil triumphed and gained acceptance in small degrees.Meanwhile in America, while we were at war with the Nazis and Japan, we were fearful enough to conduct our own ethnic pogroms against American citizens of Japanese descent. We also started incrementally: first with curfews, then with forced sales at bargain prices of businesses and homes owned by people of Japanese descent and then, by herding them into camps, remotely located far from where they once had lived. It never reached the stage of extermination, but the acceptance of what we did to our neighbors out of fear projected onto people of different skin color and ethnic ancestry was nonetheless inhuman and prejudicial. Later, nearly a half-century later, too late for the people victimized by our fear and our prejudice, what we did was characterized by then-President Ronald Reagan, no bleeding-heart liberal he, as “an act of racism and war hysteria.” And so it was: although the program was sold as a way of keeping us safe, not a single charge of traitorous behavior was ever made much less proved against anyone incarcerated for the duration of the war in those camps. Yet it was widely supported and upheld at the time by most Americans and by the United States Supreme Court. And as we face our own demons today, our own unleashed beasts of fear and prejudice, that is why Ben Stern’s story is profoundly relevant, why it is not merely historical but contemporary.Ben Stern’s story becomes unusual after he survives the Nazis and marries a concentration camp survivor he meets in a displaced-persons camp while still in Europe, and in 1946 they come to America, where they raise a family and where they thrive. Then the story gets complicated. In 1959 they move to Skokie, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, with a population that, after WWII, was about 60 percent Jewish. Eighteen years later, in 1977, a small but virulent neo-Nazi group located in Chicago, and infamous for its repeated clashes in Chicago with civil rights advocates and for its opposition to school integration, decides to take its campaign to the suburbs and writes to about a dozen Chicago suburbs for permits to parade and demonstrate in their streets. One of those suburbs was Skokie.Most of those suburbs just ignored the letter, or responded lethargically. Skokie responded like a bull to a red flag, and understandably so. Populated by a large number of concentration camp survivors, the idea that black-shirted would-be Nazis sporting swastikas would be marching in their streets, past their homes, was a reprise too much to bear. Many hid from the prospect, but Ben Stern did not. He stood up to organize an effort to prevent them from coming: not again was he about to tolerate what for him was a life-shattering experience. And that is where I came in.The effort to resist the neo-Nazi group, constituting at most two dozen people and with sick irony headed by a man named Frank Collin, born Frank Cohn, himself Jewish and the son of a Holocaust survivor, initially focused on laws designed to bar them from coming to Skokie. The details of that ought not to burden this review, so I will omit them. Suffice to say, the laws passed by the town of Skokie were essentially the same as the laws passed in many towns, including Southern towns and including Chicago, to ban speech they hated, often including civil rights demonstrations for racial equality in schools, voting, etc. And the American Civil Liberties Union often represented many groups banned by such laws from parading. In Chicago, the ACLU of Illinois had often represented the NAACP and other civil rights groups, as well as Frank Collin and his neo-Nazis, in challenging such laws. Almost always, those laws were struck down as violations of the First Amendment, and it was those kinds of cases that freed Martin Luther King, Jr. and his colleagues to conduct their demonstrations for equal voting rights in hostile Southern towns, and that allowed people protesting the war in Vietnam to march. So when Skokie reacted to Collin’s application for a permit to march by passing precisely those same kinds of laws, and Collin came to the ACLU as he and civil rights groups had previously in Chicago, seeking to challenge those laws, the ACLU took the case, as it normally took all such cases. And the ACLU won the case, as it had for many other clients of varying views, striking down the laws Skokie had passed to ban the neo-Nazis from marching down their streets. The reason, legally, was straightforward: if Skokie could pass laws to ban speech it hated, then so could towns in Mississippi and Alabama and Georgia pass the same laws to ban speech they hated, namely, blacks and whites marching together for an end to Jim Crow laws. If the First Amendment prevented one, it prevented the other. And if it didn’t, then any government, local, state or federal, could ban any speech it disliked, or felt threatened by. Imagine that power in the hands of, say, Joe McCarthy or Richard Nixon or, just to stay current, Donald Trump. The First Amendment works like an insurance policy: it protects us from the abuse of power, when people who hate our views are in power, but in return we have to tolerate speech we hate. Legal restrictions on speech are like poison gas: they seem like a useful weapon when we control it, and have a nefarious target in sight, but when the political wind shifts the poison gas can blow back upon us. To the extent the First Amendment prevents that, it does so by denying to all governments the power to ban speech it hates. And today, that includes Donald Trump.And where do I come in to this dispute? I was a high official of the ACLU during the tempestuous Skokie case four decades ago. I strongly defended what the ACLU did then, and still do, for the reasons stated in the previous paragraph. I fear living in a country where the government gets to decide which speech to permit and which to ban. And I fear living in a country where the majority gets to decide that, because I remember when if it had been put to a vote back in the ‘50s and early ‘60s, many, perhaps most, of the demonstrations organized and conducted by Martin Luther King, Jr., would have been banned. Rights, including the right to speech, cannot depend on the outcome of elections; they must be protected against such outcomes. If that isn’t obvious today, it never will be.As you might imagine, I frequently defended the ACLU’s decision to take the Skokie case. But early on in that dispute, despite being a leading defender of the ACLU’s decision to take the case, I resolved never to lecture those who had endured, and still endured, incalculable pain and anguish, on why the First Amendment compelled the result it did, or why the absence of enforceable constitutional norms helped make what happened in Germany possible, and why Jews were better protected here because of enforceable constitutional norms, even though such norms can under certain conditions be swept away. Or why a court decision contrary to the one we sought, and obtained, would have been harmful to the rights of Jews and other vulnerable minorities. I would explain all this to others, did so endlessly, but I would not presume to lecture those who, like Ben Stern, had suffered, and suffer still, in ways I could only dimly imagine. Nor would I lecture blacks in the South who had witnessed and suffered savageries I could only understand from afar about why it was necessary and even protective to permit a defanged Klan from parading in the streets with their sheets and pillowcases, rubbing salt into psychological wounds that were not mine. And so I hesitated to review this film, not wishing to dilute the majesty of Ben Stern’s life with lectures about the First Amendment. But as I watched the conclusion of this remarkable film, Ben Stern surprised me again.Ben Stern’s efforts to legally bar the neo-Nazis from coming to Skokie in 1977 were unsuccessful. But that didn’t stop him. Just because the neo-Nazis could speak didn’t mean people couldn’t respond. Ben Stern remembered 1939, and he would not submit quietly or silently to the spectre of swastikas in the streets where he lived again. Haunted by ghosts I could not possibly imagine, he even bought a gun, though he was firmly against guns. But he did more than that. He persuaded people living in Skokie not to hide in silence behind closed doors, as some had counseled. Instead, he organized a massive counterdemonstration to confront the neo-Nazis if they came. It was a brilliant response and a perfect remedy for a country with strong First Amendment rights, and the courage to use those rights. It was precisely the response contemplated by the First Amendment—to respond to hateful speech not by granting government the power to ban speech but by organizing more speech. Stern had the citizens of Skokie and their supporters ready to greet the neo-Nazis with a huge counterdemonstration. And in the end, the neo-Nazis never came. Afterwards, Stern took the gun he had purchased, a gun he was ready to use if the neo-Nazis turned violent, and shattered it with a hammer, scattering its remnants.Stern’s organized resistance has many inspiring predicates. In 1857, in the only case the Supreme Court ever ruled on the constitutionality of slavery, it upheld it in a decision that is disgusting to read even today, 160 years later. I cannot imagine how it hit slaves and free blacks in non-slave states. In a brutal, inhuman decision, Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that blacks were “subordinate and inferior beings” and “had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.” Those who advocated the abolition of slavery, both black and white, had every reason to feel crushed. But Frederick Douglass, the most famous black abolitionist of that time, responded this way:The Supreme Court is not the only power in this world. We, the abolitionists and colored people, should meet this decision, unlooked for and monstrous as it appears, in a cheerful spirit. The very attempt to blot out forever the hopes of an enslaved people may be one necessary link in the chain of events preparatory to the complete overthrow of the whole slave system.In other words, Frederick Douglass did not give up, would not give in, and it was he, not Chief Justice Taney, who would in time prevail. Vince Lombardi. the famous football coach, once said “I never lost a game, sometimes time ran out.” But in the fight for liberty and social justice, time never runs out. When you get thrown for a loss, you get back up and keep playing. Frederick Douglass kept playing, and his cause prevailed. Ben Stern kept playing too, and he’s still playing. Progress is never a straight line. The moral arc of the universe may bend towards justice, but along the way it gets bent back, too. Resilience and persistence prevails. Frederick Douglass was an inspiration of resistance, and a triumph of humanity. So is Ben Stern. He not only survived, he remained human. His life, his perseverance, his integrity of human values during a time of beasts, inspires us all. Ben Stern rocks. See this film!"

Blake became frustrated and said there were a lot of toys to pick up. “I then explained to him that those toys were blessings,” she recalled. “I told him that a lot of kids don’t have near that many and some kids had none.”This realization really affected Blake, who felt “extremely hurt” for those children. But he quickly developed an idea. “He told me that he would set up a ‘lemonade stand’ and give away his own toys to the kids who didn’t have any,” the mom explained.Melissa said this was not surprising behavior from her son. “Blake is a humanitarian,” she said. “He is the kindest person I have ever known in my life. He is the first to give and the last to take. He just wants to make everyone smile. He hurts when people hurt, and rejoices when people rejoice.”On Jan. 16, Blake set up his free toy stand in front of their house. After a couple of hours with no visitors, Melissa posted an ad for the stand on some local garage sale websites.His first visitor was a contractor working on a house across the street. “He saw what Blake was doing and was touched,” the mom recalled. The contractor said he had a grandson in Belize who would love Blake’s robot toy.The little boy joyfully gave it to him, and he insisted on paying him $5 for it, which Blake eventually accepted “after a little arm twisting.” Melissa said Blake immediately started talking about donating the $5 to a good cause.Next, a family with two children visited the toy stand. The kids brought two new toys to thank Blake for what he was doing, and he gave them his favorite indoor soccer ball.“The next family explained to me that they didn’t have much. They just simply wanted the books for their 18-month-old son,” Melissa recalled. When she told Blake they wanted books, he ran inside to get more for him.“He grabbed his favorite books ― didn’t think twice,” the mom said. “The family was so grateful. It was so sweet.”Lastly, Blake’s kindergarten teacher stopped by to show her support and tell him how proud she was. He ended up donating the rest of the toys to his school so that kids could earn them with good behavior. “He even tried taking off his favorite hat that he was wearing and wanted to donate that too,” Melissa said. “He would’ve given away our house, his baby sister and our car if he could have. That day was amazing.”Blake spent six hours outside with his toy stand. He even took his nap right next to it so that he wouldn’t miss anything. “His selflessness is inspiring, even to his mama,” said Melissa. “It makes us so proud to know that he is catching what we are trying to teach, that kindness to even one person, can change the world.” Melissa wants Blake’s story to inspire others. “I hope that his kindness will be contagious, that they will see that there is still good in this world,” she said.“I had no idea that our son, with his little 6-year-old heart, would reach this far,” she added. “It just goes to show you that kindness can go such a long way.”Keep reaching, Blake!"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58988f00280000f314997122.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Francois Becker knows his frog calls ― and he knows them well. But in early December, while conducting research near the summit of a remote mountain in eastern Zimbabwe, the ecologist heard a call he could not quite place.“When I first heard [it], I thought it might be an insect,” Becker, a graduate student at the University of Cape Town, told The Huffington Post over email on Monday. “It was a soft, high-pitched whistle repeated several times.” But as he got closer to the sound, Becker determined that it wasn’t an insect at all. “The ‘texture’ of the call, for lack of a better word, confirmed that it was probably a frog,” he said. Specifically, a kind of Arthroleptis frog. Arthroleptis is a genus of frogs endemic to tropical sub-Saharan Africa. They’re known for their high-pitched whistling calls and tiny stature (the largest species of the genus, Arthroleptis tanneri, grows to just two inches long). They are also direct breeders, meaning they ― unlike most other frogs — are born as fully formed froglets and not as tadpoles.“Francois had done a great deal of work on [Arthroleptis frogs] in South Africa, and had paid particular attention to their calls,” Becker’s research colleague, Robert Hopkins, told The Zimbabwean in an interview last month. “He heard a call which he recognized as that of an Arthroleptis, but did not or could not identify it, so he tracked that call and ultimately found the first specimen.”The source of the unusual whistle turned out to be an unimaginable treasure: a rare cave-dwelling frog that had not been seen in over 50 years. This is Arthroleptis troglodytes, also known as a “cave squeaker.” Becker took the first photos of the species ever.The cave squeaker was last spotted in the rocky Chimanimani mountains of eastern Zimbabwe in 1962, the year it was first discovered. The minuscule animal measures no more than an inch long, and scientists assumed it was extinct after several unsuccessful searches, including a 2010 expedition.Hopkins, a 75-year-old researcher with Zimbabwe’s Natural History Museum, had been searching for the frog since 1998, to no avail.In a last-ditch attempt to find the elusive animal, he applied for a grant from the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund last year to conduct another search. He roped in Becker and a Zimbabwean entomologist named Scott Herbst. In December, the group headed to the mountains of Chimanimani, the only place the frog was known to exist.  Hopkins, who has cancer, was not able to participate in the search effort due to his age and illness, he explained in a research report. So he was in Chimanimani village on Dec. 2 when he received a phone call from a “very excited” Becker. “[H]e had located an Arthroleptis troglodytes,” wrote Hopkins in the report. “It was great surprise and release after all these years.”Remarkably, Becker didn’t just find one lonesome cave squeaker that day, but several. He said it had taken him about 45 minutes to track down the first frog after hearing its call. “I was so excited when I saw it that my hands were shaking, and I let it slip away,” he recalled. “It hopped into a deep crevice and I could no longer see it. However, by this time I had recorded the call and was playing it back to them, to prompt other nearby males to start calling. It took me about another 40 minutes to find the next one.”Becker and his team, which also included two local guides, collected three males and one female that day. Hopkins said they gathered a “great deal of data,” including DNA samples that have been sent for analysis. Hopkins said the cave squeakers appear to be “breeding well” in the Chimanimani mountains. “There seems to be a very viable population,” he wrote in the report. The exact number of frogs, however, remains unknown.Scientists are now considering conservation strategies for the frog species. Hopkins told The Zimbabwean that he, together with the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, are mulling over the possibility of breeding cave squeakers in his laboratory and releasing them back into the wild.Hopkins worries that the recent discovery will prompt people to illegally capture and export cave squeakers from Chimanimani. A Parks Authority spokeswoman told The Associated Press this week that experts are devising a management plan to protect the animal. “We are expecting an influx of scientists looking for it,” said Caroline Washaya-Moyo. “We will do everything in our power to protect and conserve the frog.”Amphibians, including frogs, are one of the most threatened groups of animals on the planet. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, about 1 in 3 amphibians face the threat of extinction. Climate change, habitat destruction and disease are some of the greatest threats facing frogs and other amphibians. A 2011 study found that amphibians may not be evolving fast enough to deal with the “enormous” human-induced changes to the environment over the past 100 years. “With a permeable skin and exposure to both aquatic and terrestrial problems, amphibians face a double whammy,” zoologist Andrew Blaustein, co-author of the study, told LiveScience at the time. “Because of this, mammals, fish and birds have not [yet] experienced population impacts as severely as amphibians.” ______Dominique Mosbergen is a reporter at The Huffington Post covering climate change, extreme weather and extinction.

It took me about another 40 minutes to find the next one.”Becker and his team, which also included two local guides, collected three males and one female that day. Hopkins said they gathered a “great deal of data,” including DNA samples that have been sent for analysis. Hopkins said the cave squeakers appear to be “breeding well” in the Chimanimani mountains. “There seems to be a very viable population,” he wrote in the report. The exact number of frogs, however, remains unknown.Scientists are now considering conservation strategies for the frog species. Hopkins told The Zimbabwean that he, together with the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, are mulling over the possibility of breeding cave squeakers in his laboratory and releasing them back into the wild.Hopkins worries that the recent discovery will prompt people to illegally capture and export cave squeakers from Chimanimani. A Parks Authority spokeswoman told The Associated Press this week that experts are devising a management plan to protect the animal. “We are expecting an influx of scientists looking for it,” said Caroline Washaya-Moyo. “We will do everything in our power to protect and conserve the frog.”Amphibians, including frogs, are one of the most threatened groups of animals on the planet. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, about 1 in 3 amphibians face the threat of extinction. Climate change, habitat destruction and disease are some of the greatest threats facing frogs and other amphibians. A 2011 study found that amphibians may not be evolving fast enough to deal with the “enormous” human-induced changes to the environment over the past 100 years. “With a permeable skin and exposure to both aquatic and terrestrial problems, amphibians face a double whammy,” zoologist Andrew Blaustein, co-author of the study, told LiveScience at the time. “Because of this, mammals, fish and birds have not [yet] experienced population impacts as severely as amphibians.” ______Dominique Mosbergen is a reporter at The Huffington Post covering climate change, extreme weather and extinction.

Reuters could not reach representatives for Madonna for comment.“Madonna has demonstrated over the years that she has passion for Malawi and her children and therefore the court was satisfied and could not stop the adoption of the twins,” Titus Mvalo, a lawyer for Madonna in Malawi, told Reuters.Mvula said that one of the conditions of the adoption was that Madonna should provide a report showing that the home in which they lived was suitable.He could not provide details on the children she will be adopting, saying it was against the law to divulge such particulars at this stage.Madonna, 58, adopted Malawian children David Banda and Mercy James in 2006 and 2009. She has two other children, Lourdes and Rocco, from previous relationships.Madonna denied reports that she wanted to adopt again after she visited Malawi last month, at the time saying her trip was for her charity work.She established the non-profit Raising Malawi in 2006 to provide health and education programs, particularly for girls. The organization is currently building a children’s unit at a hospital in Blantyre, Malawi’s second-largest city, and has built 10 schools, according to its website."

The report details how authorities at Sednaya prison executed between 5,000 and 13,000 people over a period spanning four years from 2011 to 2015. Interviews with former detainees, prison guards and doctors, as well as other staff, chronicle what Amnesty describes as a “human slaughterhouse.”The accounts of killings and abuses committed in the prison, which include rape and torture, amount to crimes against humanity, according to Amnesty. The rights group is calling for a United Nations investigation into the allegations and for the body to make sure there is clear evidence the Syrian government has stopped such practices at Sednaya. Amnesty’s report also brings renewed attention to Syrian President Bashar Assad, at a time when President Donald Trump may shift U.S. priorities in Syria to increasingly focus on fighting militants of the so-called Islamic State and move away from pressuring Assad’s regime. On Tuesday, Assad praised Trump’s rhetoric on terrorism as “promising,” and in November said the new U.S. president could be a “natural ally” against terrorists. Assad has previously denied the disappearances of prisoners and said that the government doesn’t detain political prisoners, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary that shows the systematic murder and abuse of Syrian citizens. Amnesty’s new report adds to the long list of human rights accusations against the Syrian government, and also provides a further in-depth look at the already infamous Sednaya facility.Prisoners were taken in the night from their cells in groups of 20 to 50, and ferried to the basement of one of the jail’s two main buildings. The detainees, mostly political prisoners, were then hanged en masse. The bodies of the victims were brought to a hospital for registration, before being dumped into mass graves on military land. The killings often took place twice a week, usually on Mondays and Wednesdays, according to the report.Interviewees described to Amnesty that prisoners at Sednaya were subject to phony trials, lasting just one to three minutes, before being executed. The blindfolded prisoners only find out about their death sentences minutes before being killed, having initially been told they were being transferred to a civilian prison. The executions are kept secret from most in the prison and only guards directly involved in the killings, as well as high-up Syrian officials, know about the practice. In addition to the mass hangings, the report includes horrific accounts of torture and abuse suffered in the prison. It details detainees being deprived of food and water, as well as being subjected to routine beatings and humiliation. Multiple interviewees also told Amnesty that prison officials sexually abused detainees, and forced them to rape each other.“The guard would ask everyone to take off all their clothes and go to the bathroom one by one. As we walked to the bathroom, they would select one of the boys, someone petite or young or fair. They would ask him to stand with his face to the door and close his eyes. They would then ask a bigger prisoner to rape him,” a former detainee named Omar said in the report. Failure to comply resulted in beatings and torture.Although the report documents a four-year period up until December 2015, Amnesty says that there is no reason to believe the extrajudicial killings and other abuses have stopped. The group says it’s likely thousands more detainees have been killed in the last year."

If it is upheld, Park will have to leave office and a presidential election will be called.Lee Kyu-chul, spokesman for the special prosecutor’s office investigating the scandal, told a briefing on Tuesday former culture minister Cho Yoon-sun, and a former presidential chief of staff, Kim Ki-choon, had been indicted.“The special prosecutor’s office has indicted Kim Ki-choon, Cho Yoon-sun ... for abusing power and coercion by making artists and entertainers and organizations with different opinions from the government excluded from support,” Lee said.Both Cho, who last month became the first sitting member of Park’s administration to be arrested in connection with the scandal, and Kim denied the existence of a blacklist, or playing a role in drawing one up, though Cho later said she had heard of such a list.The presidential Blue House has also denied that a blacklist existed.Park has been accused of allowing a friend, Choi Soon-sil, to exert inappropriate influence over state affairs.Choi is accused of colluding with Park to pressure big businesses to contribute to non-profit foundations backing the president’s initiatives.Both have denied wrongdoing.The special prosecutor’s office said the government and state entities used the blacklist as a “guideline” to penalize artists and censor content.The culture ministry said last month artists deemed critical of Park had been put on a list and excluded from government support. It apologized for what it said had been a systematic effort to sideline Park’s critics.Lee said the special prosecutor’s team sought to question Park, perhaps on Friday, but was discussing details with the president’s side.Prosecution officials hoping to search offices in the presidential Blue House as part of their investigation were blocked from entering the compound last week."

Seattle Symphony expressed their allegiance through a free concert titled “Music Beyond Borders: Voices from the Seven.”As a statement from the symphony explained: “At the Seattle Symphony, we are inspired to add our voice, with the hope that we can bring together our community to celebrate the freedom of expression and open exchange of ideas which the arts have always stood for, especially in times of division and conflict.” Within hours of announcing the concert, all of the available tickets were claimed. The symphony is catering to the massive interest in the event by streaming it live on Facebook. Interested parties can tune in to the topical performance on Wednesday, Feb. 8, at 7:30 p.m. PST. The San Diego Youth Symphony is also demonstrating its devotion to diversity in music by featuring two young Syrian refugees — and impassioned musicians — in an upcoming performance. Carla and Christine Chehadeh, sisters aged 17 and 12, respectively, took cello and violin lessons while living in Damascus before immigrating to San Diego in 2014. They will perform alongside the Youth Symphony for a Winter Inspiration Showcase & Afternoon Concert on March 12. Musical establishments are not the only cultural platforms sharing their perspectives on the chaotic political climate. The Museum of Modern Art replaced artworks on its fifth floor gallery with works by artists from predominantly Muslim nations, highlighting artists like painter Ibrahim el-Salahi, painter Tala Madani and architect Zaha Hadid. Countless more have used both virtual and physical channels to express the profound impact the affected nations have had on culture. Poet Kaveh Akbar rounded up poets with roots in the affected countries and shared them on Twitter. And the British publisher Comma pledged to forgo American titles in favor of Arabic writers, writers of Muslim heritage and refugees.President Trump has made it clear he wants to impede the entry of immigrants from Muslim nations into the U.S., despite opposition. Seattle Symphony will stand up to intolerance and bigotry through the universal power of music, and hopefully inspire other cultural institutions to follow suit. "

Mack is serving a 10-year sentence as an accessory to the murder in Bali. She and beau Tommy Schaefer, now 23, were traveling there in 2014 when the body of Shelia von Wiese-Mack, 62, was discovered in a suitcase in a taxi outside the luxury hotel where they were staying.Now Mack says she alone killed her mother and that she placed incriminating messages on Schaefer’s phone. The two have a daughter together, Stella, who is being raised by Mack in Bali’s infamous Kerobokon prison until she turns 2 in March. She was pregnant during the murder.“Since I was a kid, I’ve heard the truth sets you free. I never understood,” Mack says in one of the videos. “But I’m Heather Mack, and I want to be set free. I don’t want to live in a lie anymore.” Mack, wearing a sky-blue shirt and makeup, is startlingly poised on camera, almost as if she’s acting in a movie. “I’m sorry, Tommy Schaefer. I love you, I really love you,” she says at one point. “If I could go back, I would do it myself. I’m sorry that everyone that ever knew you thinks you’re a murderer .… I’m sorry everybody thinks you’re some crazy killer.” It’s not known when the videos were made. They were posted to YouTube on Thursday. Mack’s attorney told Reuters he suspects that Schaefer somehow pressured her into making the video, but he offered no details.The videos could end up tacking time onto Mack’s sentence. “If Mack is indeed the mastermind of the murder, the video can be used as evidence in the case, and the sentence should be heavier than it is now,” a spokesman for the Bali prosecutor’s office told Reuters. But CBS News reports that investigators have evidence that implicates Schaefer as well as a cousin, Robert Ryan Justin Bibbs, who pleaded guilty in a Chicago court to helping plot the murder. He’ll be sentenced in May.According to a text obtained by investigators, Schaefer told Bibbs around the time of the murder: “Now I’m a millionaire … In about a year or so I’ll have all that money … A couple mil prob.”Mack’s tape could also be part of a defense strategy to help establish an emotional distress or insanity appeal. For the first time on the videos she claims her mother killed her father in an Athens hotel room when Mack was 10 years old. She said she discovered the crime shortly before she killed her mother. Her dad, jazz composer James Mack, died of a pulmonary embolism during a family vacation in Greece in 2006, according to his obituary. Mack’s younger sister, Debbi Curran, told The Chicago Tribune that Mack’s version of their father’s death is “completely false.”“I got this whole new savage idea in my head that I wanted to kill her in a hotel room, because she had killed my father in a hotel room. We were going to Bali, so I began to plot,” Mack explains on one of the videos.“I don’t regret killing my mother. And as evil as that may sound, that’s my reality.” Mack says she does regret “trapping an innocent person” — Schaefer— into this. “It was my mother, it was my father. It was my battle,” says Mack.Mack says Schaefer confessed to the murder under pressure from her, claiming it was self-defense, because he would likely have faced the death penalty had he not. She involved him, she said, in part because she wanted to keep money she had coming to her in a $1.56 million trust fund. The trust fund is currently the focus of a family battle in a Chicago court, the Tribune reports."
69,WOMEN,Melinda Gates Wrote A Powerful Essay On How Birth Control Empowers Women,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melinda-gates-wrote-a-powerful-essay-on-how-birth-control-empowers-women_us_5899d4cbe4b040613139084c,She hopes to provide contraceptives to 120 million women by 2020.,2017-02-07,Gates speaks onstage at the Fast Company Innovation Festival in November 2016. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5899e0371900003400e0a832.jpeg?cache=f9gnS7jTgP&ops=crop_8_315_1668_986%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"“Like most women I know, I have used contraceptives for many years.”That’s how business woman and philanthropist Melinda Gates began her recent essay on the importance of birth control. Published in National Geographic, Gates described witnessing the impact that accessible contraceptives can have to women across the globe. “In the decade and a half since Bill and I started our foundation, I’ve heard from women all over the world about how important contraceptives are to their ability to take charge of their futures,” Gates wrote. “When women are able to plan their pregnancies around their goals for themselves and their families, they are also better able to finish their education, earn an income, and fully participate in their communities.”In 2012, Gates created a global summit called Family Planning 2020, which aimed to expand access to affordable contraception to women in need around the world. The summit pledged to give 120 million more women access to birth control by 2020, but currently the global partnership is falling short of that goal: As of July 2016, Family Planning 2020 has provided 24 million women with family planning services. While this is still very successful, it’s not even half of the summit’s 120 million goal. “It was an ambitious but achievable goal ― and an important promise to women in the world’s poorest places that they will not be forgotten,” Gates explained in her essay. “... Unless we begin making up for lost time, we will miss this chance to make this a turning point for women around the world.”Gates wrote that when she thinks of what’s at stake over the next three years she remembers two women ― Anita and Sushila ― whom she met last year in an Indian village called Kamrawa. Anita, a 40-year-old mother of five, told Gates she lived a “life of deprivation, hard work and endless worrying” because she never had access to family planning services. Sushila, a 28-year-old teacher and mother of two, had a very different experience because she had access to contraception. “Sushila and her husband are committed to limiting the size of their family so that they’re able to give each of their children the lives they deserve,” Gates wrote. It’s clear now, Gates explained, that contraception makes a huge difference in women’s lives. “When you think about the difference between Anita’s life and Sushila’s life, it’s clear that progress is possible,” she wrote. “The question is whether we will commit the resources and mobilize the will to ensure that this progress extends to more women in more places.”Head over to National Geographic to read Gates’ full essay.

70,BUSINESS,Facebook Recognizes Everyone Needs Paid Time Off. Not Just Parents.,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-family-leave-benefit_us_589a3a1de4b04061313a05ec,"All employees will now get 6-weeks paid family leave, on top of 4 months off available to moms and dads.",2017-02-07,Sandberg speaking at the Makers conference on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589a5eb72800001f00997873.jpeg?cache=f89Xb8Xie2&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an announcement Tuesday afternoon that deftly weaved together the personal, the corporate and the political, Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said the company would be giving all of its employees six weeks of family leave to care for ailing family members.She also announced two other generous leave benefits: three days of additional time off for employees caring for a family member with a short-term illness, like a child with the flu, and 20 days of bereavement leave, twice as much as before.“This is personal for me,” Sandberg told a packed crowd Tuesday at the Makers conference, a women’s leadership event sponsored by AOL held in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. “I lost my husband very suddenly. Facebook provided leave and flexibility, and now we’re doing more.” Sandberg was back to work 10 days after her husband, Dave Goldberg, died in 2015.The expanded benefits are a step up in Silicon Valley’s ongoing benefits war, which so far has mainly been confined to offering leave time to new parents.Sandberg, who is widely known for leading the conversation about feminism and women in Corporate America, also seemed to be indirectly responding to critics who noted her absence from the women’s marches that took place immediately after President Donald Trump’s inauguration. She’s been asked repeatedly to take a stronger stance against Trump, even as she’s publicly opposed several of his policies.“It is a challenging time, but anytime there’s a real challenge is not a time to retreat,” she said at the conference. “We know what the policy agenda is for women,” she added, calling for equal pay, paid parental and family leave, and better education. The U.S. is one of only a handful of countries in the world that offers no paid maternity leave. It is the only developed economy that doesn’t mandate employers offer paid sick leave. The federal Family and Medical Leave Act offers unpaid time off to certain workers to care for children or family members.The amount of bereavement leave Facebook will now offer is generous even for tech companies, which typically give just a few days off to workers who are dealing with a death in the family.But the paid family leave Sandberg announced is perhaps even more groundbreaking. It can be taken every 12 months.Over the past few years, tech companies have been in an arms race to offer workers increasing amounts of paid maternity and paternity leave. Facebook itself in 2016 increased the amount of parental leave it offers to four months for both men and women who welcome a new child into their family.The new paid family leave benefit ― available to all workers, not just parents ― is a clear acknowledgement that welcoming a new child is hardly the only personal life event that workers need to handle.“Recognizing the range of needs people have in their lives outside of work is really a positive step,” Ellen Bravo, the director of Family Values @ Work, a nonprofit coalition of groups pushing for paid parental and sick leave in the U.S., told The Huffington Post. “We’ve been pleased to see so many companies expand parental leave, but we know there are many other loved ones in workers’ lives who may need care; and there are also times when we need to pause and care for ourselves and grieve.”Sandberg on Tuesday challenged other companies to step up and offer similar benefits to their workers. She also called for public policies that would do the same, implicitly recognizing that not all businesses can afford to be as generous as a multibillion-dollar tech company. It’s a topic she brought up at a widely criticized meeting between tech leaders and Trump last month, according to a source close to Sandberg. “People should be able both to work and be there for their families. No one should face this trade-off,” Sandberg writes in a Facebook post that also announced the new benefits. “We need public policies that make it easier for people to care for their children and aging parents and for families to mourn and heal after loss.”Also on Tuesday, in a sign of how wide the gulf between white-collar Silicon Valley workers and the rest of the country has grown, two Democratic congresswomen reintroduced legislation that would give U.S. workers paid parental leave.The legislators are pinning their hopes on public statements made by the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, HuffPost’s Marina Fang writes.Sandberg, who launched a conversation about women in the workplace when she published her corporate feminist manifesto Lean In in 2013, has been remarkably candid about her grieving process since her husband died.Dealing with her own loss has moved Sandberg to acknowledge, among other things, that the version of feminism she wrote about in her best-selling book was incomplete.“Some people felt that I did not spend enough time writing about the difficulties women face when they have an unsupportive partner, or no partner at all,” Sandberg wrote in a Mother’s Day post last year. “They were right.”Sandberg recently said she “feels bad” that she didn’t attend the women’s march.However, over the past couple of weeks Sandberg has spoken up: first to protest the Trump administration’s reinstatement of the anti-abortion global gag rule, which cuts off funding to organizations offering health care services around the world. (She recently announced a $1 million donation to Planned Parenthood.) Then Sandberg joined Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ― and most of her other peers in the tech industry ― in condemning Trump’s executive order on immigration. This story has been updated to note Sandberg’s remarks at a tech leaders meeting with Trump."

But that doesn’t mean they aren’t willing to use their lips for science. Prompted by a reader’s question, the duo sets out to determine which long-lasting lipstick is actually “kiss proof.” The segment, aptly titled “Let’s Find The Lip-Stickage With The Least Lip-Slippage,” pits Maybelline’s Super Stay 24 Hour lipcolor ($8.99) against Stila’s Stay All Day liquid lipstick ($24). Their commitment to the cause knows no bounds as they simulate “date” conditions that include eating ribs, dunking their heads into the “ocean” during a romantic walk on the beach and awkwardly making out with two mannequin heads.In the end, only one lipstick is accurately described as surviving the test “like vinyl siding.” Check out the entire LOL-worthy test above.

DeVos and her wealthy family had previously helped fund the campaigns and super PACs that make it possible for GOP senators to win elections. Betsy DeVos has personally donated $115,000 to the current crop of Republican senators since 1980. Those lawmakers received more than $950,000 from the full DeVos family over the same period. The family has further donated $8.3 million to Republican Party super PACs in the past two election cycles.And those numbers only scratch the surface.During her confirmation hearing, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) asked DeVos whether it is true that her family had donated $200 million to support the Republican Party going back over the years.“That’s possible,” she answered.Here are the totals for 23 sitting senators who have received campaign contributions from the DeVos family since 1980:Only one of them didn’t vote to confirm DeVos.It is rare for a donor of this magnitude to receive a Cabinet appointment.The closest comparison is Penny Pritzker, an heiress to the Hyatt hotel fortune and President Barack Obama’s last commerce secretary. Pritzker was a bundler for Obama’s campaigns, and her family was one of the biggest donors to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party in 2016.The DeVos family, however, is not just one of the largest contributors to the Republican Party today, but also one of the founding donors to the modern conservative movement beginning in the 1970s.In the 2016 election, the DeVos family contributed heavily to a handful of Republican super PACs that helped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) maintain his majority. The clan donated $2 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, McConnell’s personal super PAC, which spent its money exclusively on efforts to keep the GOP in control of the Senate. They also gave $200,000 to American Crossroads, which in turn sent most of its money to the Senate Leadership Fund. The Freedom Partners Action Fund, a super PAC run by the billionaire Koch brothers, received $1.5 million from the DeVos family.Campaign finance reform proponents called on senators who received contributions from Betsy DeVos and her relatives to recuse themselves from voting on her nomination. None did.“People are fed up with a government that rewards wealthy donors, and that anger will not recede,” David Donnelly, president and CEO of the reform group Every Voice, said in a statement Tuesday.Two Republican senators did vote against the nominee: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Murkowski had received $43,200 from the DeVos family. Collins had received no contributions.Both senators said their vote against DeVos reflected the outpouring of opposition from their constituents, including teachers. Collins also based her no vote on DeVos’ “lack of familiarity” with the laws that provide adequate funding and quality education for children with special education needs.This story has been updated with more detail on Sen. Collins’ reasons for voting no.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you? Sign up for our weekly newsletter and get breaking updates on Trump’s presidency by messaging us here."

Now, she’s reflecting on how her assault has affected her ability to be sexual and fantasize freely. In Tuesday morning’s Lenny Letter, Dunham wrote a poignant essay titled “One Of A Kind,” which recounts her sexual healing after her assault so many years ago. “A therapist once told me that a hallmark of trauma is losing the ability to fantasize,” Dunham began her essay. “The space where possibility was is now filled to the brim with disruptive and painful reality.” Dunham wrote that after her assault she struggled with feeling authentically sexual. “After my assault, all I could imagine when I thought about sex was not being injured or, when I really didn’t like myself, being very injured,” she wrote. “That’s all there was room for.”In her essay, the 30-year-old described how for years after her assault she often felt as though she was feigning her sexuality; performing with her back arched and adding just the right amount of “meaningless sounds” to convince her partner she was having a good time. “In the past few years I’ve started to ask myself what I really want out of sex,” Dunham wrote. “Like an amnesia patient trying to piece my old life back together, I look back on the fantasies that propelled my solitary teenage lust and I wonder what I’d want now, at age 30, if I were unloosed upon the dating world and presenting a completely new me to someone who had zero relationship to my trauma.”Dunham tied in these feelings of anxiety and lack of control to our new president, a man who has been accused of sexually assaulting over a dozen women. “It’s hard to know how best to protect yourself right now as an American woman,” she wrote. “So much is unclear. So much feels out of our control, like strategy being played out in a remote locked room. So much is up to men who have never seen us and will never see us, who don’t even want to see us.” But, what about taking a small step towards self care on your own? Dunham asked. She continued: What about something that tells a story words can’t? What if every time you fuck for the next four years, you say exactly what it is that you want? You move the hands on your body to the place you need them to be so that you can get off? What if you take control of systems that were put in place a very long time ago to keep you from getting off? What if you never have sex again where you’re just lying there wishing you were somewhere or someone else (and if you’ve never had that kind of sex, genuine and worshipful congratulations!)?

Investigators in the Tesla crash found that neither the driver nor Tesla's auto-steer function could make out the white sides of the tractor-trailer against the bright sky.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589a0cd11900003400e0a966.jpeg?ops=crop_0_194_6000_2823%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Just who is to blame for a highly publicized fatal car crash involving a self-driving Tesla Model S and a tractor-trailer in May 2016?The driver, certainly, as a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration review made clear late last month. And ― according to a report Tuesday by NBC’s “Today” show ― perhaps foot-dragging politicians are at fault, too.Investigative reporter Ronan Farrow dug into the category of accidents known as “underride collisions,” where cars collide with semitrailers and plow underneath them with devastating results.Turns out there’s a relatively simple fix, one that has been mandatory on most trucks in Europe since 1989: installing side guards that close off access to the dangerous trailer undercarriage. The U.S. Department of Transportation has considered requiring side guards since 1969, Farrow found. The National Transportation Safety Board recently weighed in as well, recommending that the guards be installed on trucks.But transportation lobbyists who represent the trucking industry say they’re not convinced. They’ve argued against side guards as costly and potentially dangerous.What’s interesting is that in the last six years, Farrow found, members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (which oversees the issue) received over $9 million from the transportation industry, with a million of that directly attributed to the trucking industry.Farrow said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who chairs the committee, declined “Today’s” interview requests for “three months straight,” forcing Farrow to “stake him out” for comment. A representative for Thune disputed that timeline, contending it was slightly less than two months.“Regardless of who was at fault in the Tesla crash, the driver might have lived if the truck had been required to have side guards that would have prevented the electric sports sedan from wedging underneath the trailer,” side guard advocate Marianne Karth wrote in a blog for Trucks.com in August.In 2013, a truck bumped Karth’s car from behind, sending her Ford Crown Victoria spinning under a tractor-trailer. The accident killed her two youngest daughters, who were riding in the back seat.CORRECTION: This article cited NBC’s report that the transportation industry had given $9 million to senators on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in 2016. That figure is a six-year aggregate and includes money from a range of transportation groups. HuffPost has updated its article to reflect NBC’s correction."

Couric, 60, got a much different reception in 2014 when she attempted to tackle similar issues in an interview with transgender stars Carmen Carrera and Laverne Cox. At one point in that interview, Couric asked Carrera about the state of her “private parts,” unleashing a wave of criticism about media’s perceived fixation on trans individuals’ genitalia.It was, without question, a careless move on Couric’s part. Although “Gender Revolution” suggests that the Yahoo! News anchor is ready to move on, she didn’t shy away from the debacle in an interview with The Wrap, telling journalist Itay Hod that she “learned a lot” from the experience. While she said she had the opportunity to edit the “private parts” question out of the final broadcast, she ultimately decided to leave it in.“I was willing to embarrass myself to help other people understand and make a point,” she said. Calling the question “insensitive” and “clumsily asked,” she believes that leaving the segment intact ultimately had a bigger impact: “It’s an extremely sensitive topic. I tried to use my lack of knowledge as a learning device.” Couric, of course, began working on “Gender Revolution” well before Election Day. But with transgender rights facing an uncertain future under President Donald Trump, the documentary couldn’t feel more relevant, she said. “The timing wasn’t pegged to the election or the Trump administration, but I can’t think of a better time to educate people or familiarize them,” she said. “I can’t think of a better time for people to get to know Americans in this community who are part of this seismic shift and the way we perceive gender.”For the latest in LGBTQ entertainment, don’t miss the Queer Voices newsletter.

The solar industry, by all accounts, is booming, according to the new National Solar Jobs Census, an annual report released by the nonpartisan Solar Foundation. Solar energy companies employed 260,077 workers in 2016, an increase of more than 51,000 jobs. That’s slightly more than the natural gas industry, and more than double the coal business. The industry grew 17 times faster than the overall U.S. economy, with hiring spurts in 44 of 50 states. Payrolls doubled in 21 of those states. California created by far most new solar jobs, totaling more than 100,000 followed by Massachusetts with nearly 15,000.The industry is banking on continued support from those states if Trump makes good on pledges to eliminate subsidies to solar and wind energy firms provided as federal credits through tax-equity financing. Tax-equity investments in clean energy were on pace to set a record of $14.8 billion last year, the data firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimated. “There’s a lot of action taking place at state level,” Andrea Luecke, president and executive director of the Solar Foundation, told The Huffington Post by phone on Monday. “If the feds do roll back the investment tax credit, there will be a big opportunity for state and localities to play a role in continuing to cut red tape and bring solar power to communities.” Solar power shouldn’t be a hard sell to even the most skeptical allies of Trump, who has given preference to fossil fuels and repeatedly called climate change “a hoax.” Two-thirds of Americans support the development of zero-emissions energy sources, though Republicans still prioritize expanding fossil fuels, according to a Pew Research Center poll released last month. Still, employment in the solar industry grew in every state that voted for Trump, with the exception of Tennessee. The manufacturing sector, which Trump vowed to revive, employed 38,121 full-time solar workers last year, an increase of 26 percent since November 2015. (The vast majority of new solar jobs, however, are in installation).“Solar jobs pay well, they’re very helpful to making American great again, and providing relief to struggling families and communities,” Luecke said.Another figure that provides an easy selling point to Republicans: Veterans made up 9 percent of solar workers last year, compared to 7 percent in the overall U.S. workforce. And unions hold little sway. In 2015, union labor made up about 5.5 percent of the overall solar workforce. In 2016, 3.5 percent of workers in the photovoltaic sector ― the portion of the industry that generates electricity from solar panels ― were unionized, as were 4 percent employed in concentrated solar power, which produces thermal power from heat created by sunlight reflected off mirrors. The Solar Foundation, which received a big funding boost from the Department of Energy last year, changed the methodology in its latest report, making it difficult to compare annual differences. But union labor appears to be declining in the industry, falling from 6.2 percent in 2014 to 3.8 percent last year, the combined estimate for both subsets of the solar industry.“Solar companies are very dynamic, move very quickly and not that organized, which is in part a reflection of a need to keep costs down,” Luecke said. “I assume that, ultimately, it will move toward organization, as most maturing industries do. It’s still pretty nascent.”Elon Musk, the billionaire chieftain of electric car and solar energy giant Tesla who serves as the industry’s poster boy, could urge Trump to spare solar incentives. The South Africa native refused last week to bow to growing pressure to quit Trump’s advisory board. The New York Times described his relationship with the embattled new president as a “budding bromance.” Perhaps less important to a president who scoffed at political correctness, the industry saw gains in diversity overall. The percentage of women increased to 28 percent from 24 percent a year earlier. For black workers, that number rose to 7 percent from 5 percent. Latino employment in the industry surged to 17 percent from 11 percent a year earlier. The Energy Department gave the Solar Foundation $15 million last year to build out its operations, giving the Washington, D.C.,-based nonprofit funding to grow research and development work without soliciting mone from the industry it supports. Trump’s Energy Secretary pick Rick Perry vowed during his Senate confirmation hearing last month to defend against cuts the department he once said he would abolish completely. But the White House plans “major reductions in funding” for the department, The Hill reported. The solar investment tax credit, despite winning a six-year extension in 2015 “could very well be on the chopping block,” according to a report from research firm Roth Capital Partners, cited by the solar trade publication PV Tech.“You can’t just take an axe to it,” Luecke said, noting that her home state of Wisconsin, which helped secure Trump’s victory in November, saw a fivefold increase in solar jobs last year. “The solar industry is an American success story. If the new administration believes in promoting technologies that make America more competitive and economies stronger, solar does just that.”"

The solar industry, by all accounts, is booming, according to the new National Solar Jobs Census, an annual report released by the nonpartisan Solar Foundation. Solar energy companies employed 260,077 workers in 2016, an increase of more than 51,000 jobs. That’s slightly more than the natural gas industry, and more than double the coal business.

Last week, a federal judge in Seattle blocked the order’s implementation nationwide, leading the Department of Justice to immediately appeal.At its most basic, the hourlong hearing at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, based in San Francisco, centered on whether the judge who temporarily put the brakes on the travel ban used the proper legal standard when he decided to bar the federal government from enforcing the restrictions.But even to decide that largely technical issue ― the legality of the executive order will be weighed at a later stage ― the three judges who heard from the Justice Department and the states that sued the administration, Washington and Minnesota, had to probe some deeper questions: Whether the president has “unreviewable” authority given to him by Congress to implement the travel ban, and whether the two states are constitutionally allowed to contest his immigration determinations in court.“This is a traditional national security balance that’s assigned to the political branches and the president,” said August Flentje, a longtime DOJ lawyer who at times hesitated when pressed by the judges to explain if the president’s power over immigration is as unfettered as the administration makes it out to be.Flentje insisted that U.S. District Judge James Robart, in blocking the travel ban last month, “disturbed” the balance with the other branches of government ― a disruption that caused “irreparable harm” to the Trump administration’s ability to protect the country.But U.S. Circuit Judge Michelle Friedland seemed skeptical that courts should simply stay out of these kinds of disputes, no matter how sensitive they might seem at first blush.“Are you arguing that the president’s decision in that regard is unreviewable?” the judge asked Flentje, who later conceded that “there are obviously constitutional limitations” to what the president may do with his authority.Trump and his administration have repeatedly come under scrutiny over whether his executive order amounts to a so-called Muslim ban, and statements he and his associates have made during the campaign or since loomed large over the hearing.At one point, Friedland wondered whether the court should consider those statements as proof that the travel ban was instituted with “bad faith,” while U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Clifton suggested that comments made by the likes of Rudy Giuliani about how the order came to be could serve as evidence of discriminatory motive.“Do you deny that those statements were made?” Clifton asked of the DOJ lawyer, who elsewhere in the proceedings said the court should simply look to the “four corners” of Trump’s executive order ― and not to things beyond what it says. Washington Solicitor General Noah Purcell’s burden was different than that of the DOJ: to show that Trump’s order causes his state and Minnesota “irreparable harm” ― and that reinstating the ban would simply bring more disruption to state universities, businesses and residents who depend on the states for essential services.But on the broader point about the order’s legality, Purcell said the weight of the states’ allegations, even at this early stage in the case, indicated that the travel ban is likely unconstitutional. “Here we’ve alleged very plausibly and with great detail that this was done to favor one religious group over another,” Purcell said. Among other violations, the states have asserted that Trump’s travel restrictions violate the Constitution’s guarantees of religious freedom and equal protection of the laws.The 9th Circuit, which is expected to rule later this week, probably won’t touch the merits of those claims. Instead, the court is likely to issue a procedural ruling indicating whether the lower court’s temporary order should be lifted or upheld ― which would be followed by more evidence-gathering, more hearings, and a more substantive ruling by Robart, the district judge.However that plays out, the controversy over the travel ban is likely to land before the Supreme Court, which remains one member short. Maybe by then, Trump’s nominee to the high court, Neil Gorsuch, will be seated to consider the case.Because of the high-profile nature of the dispute, the 9th Circuit made audio of the hearing available live on YouTube, and it was separately carried by CNN. By the time it ended, the YouTube feed had more than 135,000 listeners."

Nina Dobrev is also having a hard time saying goodbye.The 28-year-old actress filmed her last scene in the series Monday. Though Dobrev first left the show in 2015, she recently returned to reprise her role as Elena Gilbert for the finale. And if you thought her first farewell was rough, you better buckle up for the second. The actress wrote a beautiful letter on Instagram to bid the show adieu.“It feels like it was just yesterday that I was saying goodbye,” Dobrev wrote in her caption. “And yet two years have passed and here we are again. This is my true final goodbye, as today I shot my last scene of the Vampire Diaries forever.””Coming back for the series finale has been a whirlwind of emotion, nostalgia, love, tears of joy and bittersweet endings,” she continued. “It feels like the beautiful closure we all needed, myself included, and I couldn’t have been happier to come home to be with my TVD set family and friends.”We’re not crying. You’re crying.The actress also had plenty of love to send her fans, who she believes will be happy with the finale.“From the bottom of my heart, I send you my biggest thanks for the countless years of implicit dedication, passion, support, and undying love from all the fans that have stuck with us,” Dobrev wrote.She concluded her note by thanking “The Vampire Diaries” cast and crew, saying that she “grew up” on the set. “We are all pieces of a big puzzle and without every truly amazing cast and crew member, this magical puzzle would not be complete.”If we’re this emotional after reading a letter ― which you can read in full on Instagram ― we can’t imagine how we’ll feel watching the finale!

Miranda says he’d love to see more Latinos represented in Hollywood but said it doesn’t take away from the Latino talent that already exists in the industry, particularly the directors who’ve been recognized by the Academy in recent years.“Would I like to see more Latino representation? Would I like to see Hollywood reflect what our country looks like more? Absolutely,” Miranda told HuffPost. “But again, we have amazing Latino directors who win tons of Oscars. We have Guillermo del Toro, we have [Alejandro G.] Iñarritu, we have [Alfonso] Cuarón. There’s no shortage of Latino talent, both in front of and behind the camera.”As far as the star is concerned, there’s not a lot that comes out of scrutinizing the list of Oscar nominees each year. “I just think to make every year a bellwether.. I don’t know. I don’t know what that does,” he added. Still, Miranda thinks the industry should continue “to try to make more work and make more opportunities available.” The Puerto Rican actor, playwright and composer is currently nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category for “How Far I’ll Go” in Disney’s Moana. If he wins, Miranda will be one of the very few artist’s in the industry to have won an Emmy, a Grammy, a Tony and an Oscar ― not to mention he’s also a Pulitzer Prize winner and a MacArthur fellow. While Miranda feels diversity in the Oscars changes depending on the year, Latino actors have proved to be repeatedly left out of the list of nominees. For example, a Latina has never won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and the last time one was even nominated in the category was in 2004. "

He replaces Kyle Shanahan, who on Monday was hired as the new head coach of the San Fransisco 49ers.The Falcons’ move represents a stroke of genius. Sarkisian achieved tremendous success at USC, under Pete Carroll’s regime, and then as the head coach for the University of Washington. He also was quarterbacks coach of the Oakland Raiders in 2004.The 42-year-old Sarkisian isn’t dissimilar from Shanahan. Both are young, swashbuckling play-callers well liked by quarterbacks for their ability to adjust to personnel and willingness to trust signal-callers. One thing that helped Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan earn MVP honors this year while amassing the fifth-best single-season quarterback rating in NFL history was his movement outside the pocket ― something he rarely did before his two seasons with Shanahan. We can expect Sarkisian ― who will be Ryan’s fourth OC in 10 years ― to deploy similar concepts, but with his own twist.After assuming a winless Washington Huskies program in 2009, Sarkisian led UW to five wins during his first season. Then, in his second year, he became bowl eligible with seven wins. In his fourth year, he won nine games, the school’s best record in 14 seasons.When USC hired then him as head coach, Sarkisian assembled one of the nation’s elite recruiting classes. Shortly thereafter, however, in October 2015, then-Trojans athletic director Pat Haden fired him after Sarkisian appeared intoxicated during a pep rally speech. Eventually, Sarkisian checked into rehab and sued the school for firing him. The case was settled privately in arbitration.Positivity, culture and brotherhood reign supreme for the Falcons franchise ― traits that Sarkisian embraces. He’s a brilliant offensive mind ― one who appreciates the art of zone-blocking and creativity as a play-caller ― and a coach who endeared himself to former players despite his issues. Falcons Pro Bowl cornerback Desmond Trufant played for him at UW, and has nothing but good things to say.“That’s my guy,” Trufant, 26, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. “I went through a lot with Sark during my college days. I was in his first recruiting class.“He came to my house and recruited. He’s a dope guy. A very strong guy. A leader. Very passionate about the game. He definitely could get the job done.”Sarkisian inherits one of the most dominating offenses in NFL history with a quarterback dead-smack in his prime.

Democrats couldn't disagree more.,2017-02-07,"Ariel Edwards-Levy - Senior Reporter and Polling Editor, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d532dc22200001a00f53c4b.jpg?ops=100_100,"Approval ratings for Donald Trump are split down partisan lines. Support for his travel ban seems to depend on the survey. And the president’s Supreme Court nominee gets positive ratings, even though Americans are split on whether the pick should have been his. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, February 7, 2017.VIEWS OF DONALD TRUMP’S PRESIDENCY ARE DEEPLY POLARIZED - HuffPost Pollster’s aggregate gives President Trump a 43 percent approval rating, with about 50 percent disapproving. With the exception of Rasmussen, surveys conducted to date this month all show his ratings underwater. Views, however, are deeply polarized -- on average, 86 percent of Republicans approve, compared to just 9 percent of Democrats about 41 percent of independents. (For comparison, Barack Obama’s early approval ratings were also polarized, but not yet to the same extent ― in February 2009, he stood at around 89 percent among Democrats, 30 percent with Republicans, and independents just below 60 percent.) [Trump approval chart]Republicans are overwhelmingly happy with Trump’s actions as president - Emily Guskin: “While surveys show Trump’s policies draw mixed reviews from the public overall, almost every one wins majority support from Republicans. What Trump may be reacting to then is that everyone he talks ― aka loyal supporters ― seem to love his proposals even though polling shows them with middling support….Take Trump’s controversial ban on immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. Polls show support for Trump’s proposal ranging from small majority support to small majority opposition, suggesting the public is roughly divided on the policy. But even in the poll showing the most negative appraisal, Republicans are overwhelmingly supportive….Broadly speaking, Trump’s slew of executive orders doesn’t seem to have had a major impact on his overall job approval ratings, though this is little comfort given that he entered office with historically low marks and heavy partisan polarization. Gallup found an average of 43 percent of adults approving of Trump in interviews ending Sunday. Just 8 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of independents approve of the 45th president, but among Republicans 86 percent say he is doing a good job.” [WashPost]Are surveys accurately gauging Trump’s popularity? - Steven Shepard: “Traditional phone polls that use live interviewers — including some of the most trusted polls in politics and media — report limited support for Trump and the controversial executive orders he’s signed. But automated phone and Internet-based surveys tell a different story...It’s reigniting the campaign debate over whether pollsters are accurately measuring Trump’s popularity — or the breadth of support for his policies. The White House is already seizing on the issue, and forcefully pushing back against the early narrative that the president is suffering from historically bad polling numbers….the president’s first two weeks in the White House raise questions about whether Trump is better viewed than traditional measures indicate — and whether the hard edge of some of his provocative stances and statements will make it difficult to accurately gauge his support right up until his likely reelection bid in 2020.” [Politico] Trump’s sensitivity about his ratings makes polling a potential pressure point - Natalie Jackson: “In an interview with RealClearPolitics, White House press secretary Sean Spicer revealed that Trump consumes polling information with gusto, sometimes telling his advisers about the data before they see it themselves. That means Americans have a direct avenue to getting their voices heard by the president. Answering a phone call or an email to respond to poll questions is more important now than ever ― it might be the quickest way to have your opinion heard in the Oval Office.” [HuffPost]HERE’S WHAT THE LATEST POLLS SAY ABOUT THE TRAVEL BAN - Eight surveys on Donald Trump’s recent immigration-related executive order show differing levels of public support, but most find a plurality of Americans in opposition. Strikingly, all five of the surveys showing the most support were conducted online or using automated phone calls, while the three finding the least support all used live phone interviewers.Last Friday’s HuffPollster talked about some of the factors that can lead to variability in issue polling, including question wording ― such as whether a survey mentions Trump’s name, or uses the word “ban” ― and mode effects ― such as social desirability bias, the idea that Americans may be more likely to express an unpopular position anonymously than they are to a live interviewer. But there are also other, more prosaic, possible differences that have more to do with the construction of the surveys themselves. These factors that don’t necessarily lend themselves to a particular outcome, but can certainly have an effect. One poll, for instance, may ask whether someone favors or opposes a proposal, while another asks whether they agree or disagree. One poll may give the option for respondents to say they agree strongly or other somewhat, while another won’t ask about intensity. And there’s another difference that could help to explain the noticeable gap between modes. While some pollsters, especially those using online or automated surveys, explicitly give respondents the option to say they’re not sure about a question, others, especially those using live interviewers, will accept that response only when it’s volunteered.In the case of the travel ban, if the variance between live and online/automated polls were caused by respondents’ unwillingness to express support non-anonymously, we’d expect higher approval for the ban in polls conducted using the latter method. But with more surveys in, that doesn’t necessarily seem to be the case. With two outlier polls ― Rasmussen and Gallup ― excepted, each survey puts approval between 45 percent and 48 percent. Instead, the bigger difference is in the percentage who disapprove, which tends to be lowest among survey that offer respondents an explicit option to say they’re uncertain. That raises another possibility for the variance: respondents who are inclined to say they aren’t sure, but who, if pushed, come down against the idea.TRUMP’S SCOTUS PICK DRAWS POSITIVE RATINGS - HuffPollster: “Americans have a generally positive first impression of Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump’s nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds. But they’re split on whether the choice should have been Trump’s to begin with. Forty percent of Americans approve of the choice of Gorsuch and 28 percent disapprove, with the remaining 32 percent unsure. Among those who approve, 58 percent say it’s mostly because they think Gorsuch would be a good Supreme Court justice, and one-third say it’s because they trust Trump to nominate someone who’d do a good job. Sixty-six percent of those who disapprove say it’s because they don’t trust Trump to make a good decision, while 28 percent say their disapproval is specifically about Gorsuch himself….Americans are about evenly split on which president should have had the opportunity to choose the next Supreme Court justice, the HuffPost/YouGov survey found, with 41 percent saying Obama should have had the chance to replace Scalia, and 40 percent saying the choice should be Trump’s.” [HuffPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

90,POLITICS,Republicans Happy To Have Trump Distract The Press As They Move Their Agenda,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-trump-distractions_us_589216e5e4b0522c7d3e7342,GOP lawmakers will take any help they can get.,2017-02-07,Donald Trump's frenetic activity has drawn eyes away from Congress' fumbling on Obamacare.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589a0c0a280000c63a9976c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s first two whirlwind weeks in office have left congressional Republicans gasping over questions of crowd size, “alternative facts,” even baseless claims about massive voter fraud ― and that was really just the initial few days. But Trump’s antics have also handed members a gift: distraction.The often-unhinged tweets, aggressive executive orders and erratic behavior have all provided Republicans some cover as they attempt to repeal a health care law that is becoming more popular.“There is some merit to the argument that would suggest that much of the focus is on what President Trump is doing and not as much on what Congress is doing,” House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told The Huffington Post. “So it allows for votes to be taken in the House that receive little attention while everybody’s focused on the bigger agenda items.”Traditional media score-keeping looks at whether politicians are staying on message. But Trump ripped up that scorecard a year and a half ago. Now, as backlash against the GOP agenda grows, Republicans in Congress are learning how useful it can be to have a lightning rod as president.“He’s eased it somewhat, yeah. I mean, he’s taking the bulk of it,” said Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), who had just been complaining about Democratic protesters flooding lawmakers’ offices.Republicans know they aren’t going to repeal the Affordable Care Act without criticism.“No matter what we do on Obamacare, it’s going to be a lot of battling because Democrats love the federal government more than anything else,” said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).Republicans do think, however, that all the different Trump flash points prevent Democrats from targeting just a single item.“It’d be easier for detractors to focus on one issue if there weren’t 20 issues happening simultaneously,” Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) said.“But I don’t think he sits up at night, ‘Now they’re working on that, and I want to, you know, help them shield the blow from the fact that they haven’t decided on and coalesced around one of the three, four, half-a-dozen [Obamacare replacement] plans, so I’m going to do this,’” Perry said of Trump. “I think he’s just doing what he’s doing.” While Perry didn’t buy the idea that Trump was creating all the controversy intentionally, other Republicans weren’t totally sure that the president wasn’t playing some game of 11-dimensional chess.“That’s the question,” Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) said. “I think the jury’s still out.”Labrador laid out the theory that Trump was purposely diverting attention away from Congress. “So then you can do the things that need to be done because he’s distracting on those things,” the congressman said.Ultimately, however, he considered Trump’s unpredictable conduct “a wash.”“Because at some point he’s taking away from his own effectiveness,” Labrador said, specifically bringing up Trump’s decision to attack a “so-called” federal judge rather than make “a cogent argument against the judge’s decision.”Labrador reported that two Democrats had asked him if Trump’s bizarre behavior was intentional. “Because they think their leadership is falling for it,” he said.Trump certainly has set Democrats ― and the media ― a challenge in responding to his every outrage. Before Democrats can meet to discuss their talking points and hold a press conference to decry the latest abuse, Trump is on to the next one. “The president is moving so fast that it’s hard for you guys to keep up sometimes, frankly,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) told reporters during a recent GOP retreat.A common sentiment from armchair analysts on Twitter is that everyone is missing the real story when they focus on things like Trump’s travel ban. (Don’t you get it? Steve Bannon is now on the National Security Council!)But an entirely more plausible explanation is that Trump is most often not trying to distract from his distractions, that there is no master plan behind most of the president’s actions and that he is governing from public relations crisis to public relations crisis ― with a devoted band of followers who think everything he says and does is making America great again.It’s just that, for Republicans in Congress, the distractions aren’t all good.“Sometimes helpful, sometimes hurtful,” was how Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) summed them up.“Some of his tweets are an asset, and some, you know, I recommend he not do,” Grothman continued.Trump’s frenetic White House is generating plenty of headlines that the administration can’t be pleased with. (Did Kellyanne Conway really try to flub the “Bowling Green massacre” or set off the “alternative facts” narrative?)But Trump also understands that creating news can be helpful at times. The White House’s decision to move up the announcement of its Supreme Court pick seemed motivated by a desire to end coverage on the travel ban.The question is still whether the president has been carrying water for Congress.There’s no real evidence that Trump was doing that ― or, at least, that he was trying to do that. In fact, some Republicans seemed to desire a better messaging relationship with the White House.“I just hope in the days ahead we can coordinate a little more closely,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) told HuffPost.It’s the lack of coordination ― the possibility that Trump could say or do anything ― that has some Republicans worried.“I’m a little concerned about it,” Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) told reporters recently.For Dent, the unpredictable tweets and outbursts really are distracting. “I’d rather not be revisiting and rehashing who won the election,” he said.When Dent was asked about the prospect of learning administration policy via a Twitter alert, he said some days those Twitter clarifications can be helpful and some days they’re not.“I’ll tell you where it was helpful,” he said. “A few weeks ago we were talking repeal and delay on Obamacare and then replacing later ― or hoping to replace later ― and then the president tweeted out that there should be a repeal and replace simultaneously. That was helpful.”But Dent would like to see Trump end the erratic behavior. “We have to get onto the serious business of governing,” he said. “These other issues are just distractions ― the crowd size and whatever the other issues are, you know, the voter fraud.”Or maybe not.Laura Barron-Lopez contributed reporting."
91,POLITICS,John Kelly Defends Trump Travel Ban: We Won't Know If It Works 'Until The Boom' Happens,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kelly-travel-ban-boom_us_5899f7ebe4b0c1284f2861f9,The homeland security secretary also expressed regret over its rollout.,2017-02-07,Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly argued Tuesday that a delay of the president's travel ban could put America at risk.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589a0c402800001f009976c5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on Tuesday used the specter of a terrorist attack to defend President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban, which was put on hold by a federal judge over the weekend.In testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee, Kelly turned to an argument the executive branch has used often to defend its policies: national security. The administration, Kelly asserted, would not have proof that terrorists are exploiting the temporary pause in the travel ban ― as he and Trump himself claimed ― “until the boom” occurs in the U.S. sometime in the future.”Let’s just say, for instance, a person who is trying to get to the United States to do some harm, some terrorist attack, is coming in during this period that the courts put a stay on our enforcement, we don’t know that until an individual who’s a bad person, until they do something bad,” Kelly said during the hearing. “But it’s entirely possible that someone that’s coming in, whether it’s during this stay court action or previous to this, they intend to do us harm.”Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the ranking member on the committee, pressed Kelly on whether the administration had proof that those targeted by Trump’s order ― including refugees ― intended to harm the U.S.”Not until the boom,” Kelly responded. “Not until they blow something up and go into a mall and kill people. Not until then.”Kelly’s argument ― that a delay of the executive order places Americans at risk ― is at odds with his expression of regret over its chaotic implementation. Earlier in the hearing, the secretary conceded he “should have delayed it just a bit so I could have talked to members of Congress.”Kelly said he did not believe the vetting process for travelers from the seven Muslim-majority nations affected by the ban was adequate to protect the nation.But there is also a risk it could backfire and unite the Muslim world against the United States. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), for example, have warned it “may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.” Jihadi groups initially celebrated the order. And on Monday, Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took a dig at Trump, sarcastically tweeting he appreciated the president because “he largely did the job for us in revealing true face of America.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

94,ENTERTAINMENT,Turns Out 84 Lumber's Super Bowl Ad Was Not A Commentary On Trump's Wall,Cavan Sieczkowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/84-lumber-super-bowl-ad-immigration_us_5899e728e4b040613139236e,The company's CEO is a supporter of President Trump.,2017-02-07,"Cavan Sieczkowski - Deputy Director of News & Analytics, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bfc27e180000670080beb4.jpg?ops=100_100,"A handful of companies made headlines during the Super Bowl on Sunday for seemingly taking swipes at President Donald Trump with commercials critical of his executive orders limiting immigrant and refugee entry. But it turns out 84 Lumber was not one of those companies. The Pennsylvania-based building materials company was behind a “controversial” ad about a Spanish-speaking woman and her child who appear to be traveling from Mexico to the United States. The end of the ad, which shows the pair discovering a door in a giant wall, was allegedly prohibited from airing on TV because of its commentary on Trump’s plan for a border wall to keep out Mexican immigrants. But on Monday, 84 Lumber CEO Maggie Hardy Magerko said the ad is not pro-immigration and that she is a supporter of the president and his agenda. “We need to keep America safe,” the 51-year-old executive told People magazine. “America needs to be safe so you and I can have the liberty to talk ... The wall, I think it represents, to me, security. I like security.”While she helped develop the Super Bowl spot, her personal beliefs are not necessarily reflected in it. “My intent was to show, through the mother and daughter, that through struggles we will do anything we possibly can to make [the world] a better place for our children. If I thought the wall was negative, I wouldn’t have had the wall.”Ad agency Brunner told People that the ad was meant to tell a “patriotic story” of the land of opportunity. A press release from 84 Lumber shared Sunday explains that the door is a symbol of the company’s open and inclusive policy for their employees.“Even President Trump has said there should be a ‘big beautiful door in the wall so that people can come into this country legally,’” she is quoted as saying in the press release. “It’s not about the wall. It’s about the door in the wall. If people are willing to work hard and make this country better, that door should be open to them.”Magerko, who took over her family’s $2.86 billion company in 1992, says she voted for Trump. She says she welcomes those working towards a better life. “I am all about those people who are willing to fight and go that extra yard to make a difference and then if they have to, you know, climb higher, go under, do whatever it takes to become a citizen,” she told the New York Times last week. “I am all for that 110 percent. But do I want cartels? Hell, no.”Watch the full ad below. "
