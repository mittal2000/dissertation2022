0,SCIENCE,NASA May Turn To Ice To House Astronauts On Mars,Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nasa-ice-mars_us_5869fd48e4b0de3a08f8f984,The space agency wants to make use of a resource the planet already has in abundance.,2017-01-02,An artist's rendering of the Mars Ice Home concept.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5869fdb31500002300916b83.jpeg?cache=HQgKVbuaWz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NASA has released a daring new concept for a building that could someday house astronauts on Mars, as the space agency continues push toward its goal of sending humans to the red planet by the 2030s.Dubbed the “Mars Ice Home,” the structure would rely on a protective coating of ice drawn from the surface of the planet. According to NASA, the low-tech building would both protect astronauts from Mars’ harmful cosmic radiation and be almost infinitely scalable.Researchers recently said that Mars holds massive reserves of ice frozen beneath its surface, almost as much as in Lake Superior. That’s why scientists turned to the material when envisioning a future home for Mars residents.“After a day dedicated to identifying needs, goals and constraints we rapidly assessed many crazy, out of the box ideas and finally converged on the current Ice Home design, which provides a sound engineering solution,” Kevin Vipavetz, the facilitator of a design session at NASA’s Langley Research Center that produced the idea in partnership with Space Exploration Architecture and Clouds Architecture Office, said in a press release.The design is just one in a series of potential concepts for structures on Mars, but the idea has several major boons. The building’s structure would be lightweight, able to be deployed using robots and filled with water before any humans arrive, NASA said. The water stored in the building could also be used to craft rocket fuel.NASA is actively working toward a manned mission to Mars. It plans to send another rover to the planet in 2020 to follow up on the work by the Curiosity, and aims to start a series of missions in 2018 near the moon to test human capacity for life off Earth.While the ice home is a novel idea, there are no guarantees what design the space agency will ultimately use on the planet. The dome already has some major drawbacks, namely that it’d take more than a year to fill with ice.But that timeline doesn’t seem to worry the principal investigator on the project, Kevin Kempton of the Langley Research Center, who said the dome’s design would make it feel “like you’re in a home and not a cave.”“After months of travel in space, when you first arrive at Mars and your new home is ready for you to move in, it will be a great day,” he said in a press release."

Your love and support means the world to me.”Lourd’s post marks the first time the actress has publicly addressed the deaths of Fisher and Reynolds since releasing a statement through her family’s spokesman, Simon Halls, last week. Fisher died on Dec. 27 at the age of 60, just a few days after suffering a heart attack while on a flight from London to Los Angeles.“She was loved by the world and she will be missed profoundly. Our entire family thanks you for your thoughts and prayers,” the statement released by Halls read. One day later, Fisher’s mother Reynolds died after reportedly suffering a stroke. She was 84. Todd Fisher, Reynolds’ son, confirmed the news to Variety, saying his mother “wanted to be with Carrie.” "

In 2004, Essenhigh suggested that an uncontrollable fire may have prompted the crew to pick up speed ― even in the midst of an ice field.“If there was a reason for the speed, it had to be something important – like a fire in the coal bunker that needed to be kept under control and then put out as soon as the ship reached port,” Science Daily reported on Essenhigh’s theory in November 2004.Molony came upon the trove of images at a 2012 auction in England, CNN reports. “This isn’t a simple story of colliding with an iceberg and sinking,” Molony told British outlet The Times. “It’s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire, ice and criminal negligence.”But not every Titanic expert is convinced that fire can be cited as the biggest factor in the ship’s sinking, as Molony theorizes.“There certainly was a fire,” David Hill, former secretary of the British Titanic Society, told The Times. “Was it a life-changer?

Ham, who believes the Earth is about 6,000 years old, fired off several additional tweets directed at the Post over the story. Indeed, the Ark Encounter doesn’t claim all dinos died out during the flood. Rather, it features dinosaurs living in cages like the other animals. His organization has said most dinosaurs died in the flood, which it claims took place 4,300 years ago. “Those descended from the ones which got off the Ark eventually succumbed to the same sorts of pressures which cause extinction in animal populations today,” a 2011 blogpost said. Scientists agree almost universally that dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago, although researchers continue to study the specific causes. The American Museum of Natural History in New York notes that a comet or asteroid strike along with “massive volcanic eruptions and changing sea levels” all may have played a role. (H/T Raw Story)"
7,HEALTHY LIVING,Mysterious Marijuana-Related Illness Popping Up In Emergency Rooms,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mysterious-marijuana-flu-emergency-rooms_us_5869d6bee4b0eb586489f7e6,The vomiting illness is increasing in states with legal pot.,2017-01-02,Doctors are stumped by the science behind cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5869dfb91900002a000e2765.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A mysterious marijuana-related illness is popping up with increasing frequency in hospital emergency rooms, particularly in states where cannabis is now legal.The symptoms are severe abdominal pain and violent vomiting — and most doctors are initially stumped when they encounter patients with the problem.The illness is cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, which is linked to heavy, long-term use of marijuana, according to experts. For some reason, the nausea and vomiting of CHS can be relieved with hot showers or baths, which can serve as an important hint for physicians trying to diagnose a patient.The condition is especially puzzling considering cannabis’ accepted reputation as an anti-nausea agent; two cannabinoid-based medications are FDA-approved for alleviating nausea in people undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, while nausea is a common reason for doctors to prescribe cannabis in states that have legalized medical marijuana. Since 2009, when the federal government relaxed its stance on medical marijuana, emergency room diagnoses for CHS in two of Colorado’s hospitals nearly doubled, according to a study co-authored by Dr. Kennon Heard, a physician at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora. Now that cannabis is also legal for recreational use in the state, “we are seeing it quite frequently,” Heard told CBS News. “My colleagues are seeing this on a daily to weekly basis.”Emergency rooms in other areas where cannabis is legal are also reporting more cases of CHS. Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., and Harborview Medical Center and the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle are among hospitals reporting an uptick.CHS was first described in 2004 by scientists in Australia who published a small study about a group of 19 patients complaining of nausea, vomiting and chills. These participants were heavy long-term marijuana users (the study described the behavior as “chronic cannabis abuse”) who had developed a cyclical vomiting illness after several years of cannabis use. The study lost 10 patients to lack of consent or confounding factors, but the scientists found that seven of the patients who stopped using cannabis were able to stop the vomiting, three did not abstain and continued to have vomiting episodes, and three abstained for a short period and began vomiting again when they resumed using cannabis.The researchers also noticed that nine of the patients were compulsive bathers who took an abnormal amount of hot showers or baths, even waking up in the night to do it. Their compulsion was not due to psychosis, the researchers wrote, but because the patients had discovered on their own that their nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain would subside just a few minutes after submersion in the hot water. Since that study was published, scientists have not been able to pinpoint the exact cause of the syndrome, and only know that abstaining from cannabis generally helps people stop vomiting. “The science behind it is not clear,” Heard told the Denver Channel. “The most likely cause is that people using marijuana frequently and in high doses have changes in the receptors in their body, and those receptors become dysregulated in some way, and it starts causing pain.”Dr. David Steinbruner, an emergency room physician at Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs, believes it’s likely triggered with a significant amount of marijuana. “The corollary would be alcohol. So small amounts may be fine for people, but over a long time it will cause all kinds of problems,” Steinbruner told KDRO-TV.In its most severe form, the illness can lead to kidney failure — but symptoms stop within days of ending marijuana use. However, there is no research on how common CHS is among people who use cannabis, what the risk factors are for developing it and how often marijuana for medical use leads to excessive cannabis use. Heard, who published the 2015 study showing the number of CHS cases rise after Colorado legalized marijuana, noted in his report that despite the high use of pot in the state, the absolute number of cases still remains very low, “underscoring that CHS is a relatively uncommon condition.” “Patients are given IV fluids and medication to resolve the vomiting and help with the pain,” explained Heard. “But the treatment is really to stop using marijuana, or at least to cut back severely, and that’s really the only way to make it better.” This story has been updated with additional information on CHS and the research around it."
8,PARENTS,How I Survived the Saddest Day of My Life,"Vivian Glyck, ContributorFounder, Just Like My Child Foundation™",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-i-survived-the-saddes_b_13915406.html,,2017-01-02,2016-12-31-1483215151-8177381-ScreenShot20161231at04.40.47.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-31-1483215151-8177381-ScreenShot20161231at04.40.47-thumb.png,"It was a hot July day, 12 ½ years ago, right before the Fourth of July. I was eager to spend the weekend with my little boy and husband.But at that moment, I was in a doctor's office, laying in a dark room with a giant screen on the wall as the doctor maneuvered an ultrasound machine to scan my abdomen. On the screen, the doctor and I both saw what was evident at the same time. She looked at me and shook her head and said, ""I'm so sorry, but there is no heartbeat.""I took a deep breath and said, ""Yes, I can see that.""It was the second time in 12 months that we had tried to have another child, and once again, there was going to be no baby. I'll never forget leaving that office, and stumbling out into the blinding sunshine, not really sure what to do with my grief and confusion. It was one of the saddest moments of my life, not because of the loss of the pregnancy, because clearly it wasn't viable, and I've always been practical that way. It was because I felt so lost and confused. I didn't know what to do with all of the love and excitement that had been alive just a few moments before.It was at that moment as I sat in my hot car, unable to even start the ignition, that I turned to God and asked, ""what should I do?""The answer didn't come right then. It took weeks for it to come fully into focus. But the response I received to that question has shaped the last decade of my life, and the lives of so many people who have joined me, in an effort to become activists for the most vulnerable children in the world.The answer that I got was, ""Have 10,000 children. The world needs you to use your fierce love to be a voice for the innocent and unprotected.""Heeding this call certainly wasn't easy, but I got to work. With the efforts of a small but mighty army, we began our work in Uganda, East Africa to address the needs of some of the most vulnerable children and families in the world. This year, Just Like My Child Foundation celebrated its 10th anniversary and the most painful day of my life has given birth to the most satisfying and gratifying life path that I never dared to dream of.Since 2006, the stories of good news from the ground in Uganda have been extraordinary. For the past 10 years, Just Like My Child Foundation has developed deep partnerships with rural communities in Africa to deliver programs which address health care, education, micro-enterprise, social justice, and girls' empowerment -- a holistic approach to ending the cycle of poverty.With support from thousands of donors -- including the individuals honored as Children's Champions at our 10th Anniversary Gala for their extraordinary investments over the past 10 years -- we have been able to empower tens of thousands of women, children and families to lift themselves out of poverty. Today they face a future with hope, health, education, justice, and a means of dignity through income generation.Our flagship program (the one we are focusing on in 2017 and beyond) is the Girl Power Project®: it was created to empower adolescent girls and designed to reduce the barriers that prevent them from completing secondary school. The Girl Power Project addresses the complex needs of vulnerable adolescent girls' aged 10-15 by establishing a network of support in their community that supports them to live healthy lives. Girls are equipped to avoid forced child marriage, HIV transmission, early pregnancy, rape and disease.The pain that I felt 12 ½ years ago was a pathway to my greatest transformation: learning the value of one human life. It has helped me, and so many others, to live a bigger story. Nothing is more rewarding than giving a child the wings and the voice to live her greatest potential.We have a shortlist of 10 brilliant girls who will be forced to drop out of school in January because their families can't afford their school fees. ""If you save just one life, you've saved the world"" the Talmud says. You can make a PROFOUND difference before the end of the year.We're raising funds to sponsor the school fees of the girl in this photo next year, along with 9 other extraordinary girls participating in our Girl Power Project. Just $25 will help her stay in school, safe from forced child marriage, and on the path to living her fullest potential. Contribute to our Fundraiser on Facebook and pass it on!Many blessings to you during this season of togetherness, and for all you do to make a difference.Vivian Glyck, Founder JustLikeMyChild.org"

Immediately the future of climate action became unclear, thrown into question by the possibility of President-elect Trump carrying out many of his campaign promises. Though PE Trump has softened his stance on many of his more extreme tweets, environmental protection still faces a great deal of uncertainty from a national perspective. The day after the election at COP22. Photo credit: T. da Silva.Soon after the news settled in, I remembered two key facts that makes me hopeful for the next four years: the clean energy revolution has already begun (and in many ways is just getting started) and subnational and private sector action will prevail in the face of a halting or regressive national climate policy. Most of this can be backed by powerful public and bipartisan support.One of the key passages of the Paris Agreement was inclusive of non-state actors. During COP22, I attended a side event on the enhanced role of non-state action with the high-level climate champions and other esteemed speakers, who asserted that 80% of future climate action will come from non-state actors. I strongly believe that local/state actions, sustainable businesses, and clean energy investments will carry us forward to our future green economy.In fact, as I was leaving Marrakech, 365 corporations announced support for the Paris Agreement, in a public statement directed to PE Trump, ""we want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,"" and, ""failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.""More than 80 of the world's leading companies have made a commitment to go 100% renewable. Facebook, Microsoft, and IKEA are among a coalition dedicated to transitioning to 100% renewable energy called RE100, aim to eliminate any reliance on energy produced from fossil fuels. Recently, Google announced it will to switch to 100% renewable energy in 2017, and intends to run all of its operations on wind and solar energy. Google's energy consumption is nearly as much as the city of San Francisco, and is by far the leading corporate renewable energy purchaser in the world. Top businesses are not the only supporters of the Paris Agreement and the U.S. transitioning to a clean energy future. Americans all across the political spectrum understand that switching from fossil fuels and our dependence on foreign oil, to a clean energy sources at home strengthens our economy, reduces our emissions, and increases our ability to adapt to future risks.According to this chart, large majorities of Americans favor expanding renewable sources to provide energy, and the public is far less supportive of increasing the production of fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, and nuclear energy. Lucky for us the clean energy revolution shows no sign of stopping - global renewable energy investment totaled $268 billion just in the last year (only 25% of the goal set forth by the Paris Agreement).This past year, not only has solar became the world's cheapest form of energy, but the solar industry has surpassed the fossil fuel industry in job creation as well.U.S. states are leading the way with increased renewable portfolio standards and new climate legislation, including in states with a governor and legislature on opposite sides of the aisle. For example, California passed the nation's most ambitious climate change law, Illinois passed the one of most comprehensive state energy bills ever crafted, New York is aims to source 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, and Maryland signed a landmark climate legislation, setting a model of bipartisanship nationwide. Last month, I attended the Clean Energy Savings for All Summit in Baltimore, MD, and learned how powerful community-driven action can be. In spite of a two year freeze in Ohio on their renewable portfolio standard (RPS), Cuyahoga County has set an example as a leader in clean energy innovation. Local efforts include building the first solar farm in a landfill that will help power 17 county buildings, working with a local utility to help low to moderate income customers gain energy efficiency upgrades, and utilizing smart data to make future decisions about clean energy development. All of this community-driven action on clean energy is blooming in spite of the state-wide freeze, which was recently struck down by its governor, citing the need for the state to move towards job creation.At home in Washington, DC, this past month I was asked to to judge a climate innovation competition I won last year, that serves to foster local solutions to our climate challenges in cities worldwide called Climathon. All of the finalist teams were passionate about the solutions that they had developed, and the issues they were solving were grounded in real city challenges; not just in DC, but all over the world in 59 cities across 6 continents. These types of city public-private partnership solutions are key to the future of climate action, especially when multiplied and brought to scale. This efforts will become increasing important in the face of the next administration.Local action to meet global goals will carry out the imperative to mitigate dangerous carbon emissions and adapt to the ever pressing reality of our changing ecosystem."

For example, California passed the nation's most ambitious climate change law, Illinois passed the one of most comprehensive state energy bills ever crafted, New York is aims to source 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, and Maryland signed a landmark climate legislation, setting a model of bipartisanship nationwide. Last month, I attended the Clean Energy Savings for All Summit in Baltimore, MD, and learned how powerful community-driven action can be. In spite of a two year freeze in Ohio on their renewable portfolio standard (RPS), Cuyahoga County has set an example as a leader in clean energy innovation. Local efforts include building the first solar farm in a landfill that will help power 17 county buildings, working with a local utility to help low to moderate income customers gain energy efficiency upgrades, and utilizing smart data to make future decisions about clean energy development. All of this community-driven action on clean energy is blooming in spite of the state-wide freeze, which was recently struck down by its governor, citing the need for the state to move towards job creation.At home in Washington, DC, this past month I was asked to to judge a climate innovation competition I won last year, that serves to foster local solutions to our climate challenges in cities worldwide called Climathon. All of the finalist teams were passionate about the solutions that they had developed, and the issues they were solving were grounded in real city challenges; not just in DC, but all over the world in 59 cities across 6 continents. These types of city public-private partnership solutions are key to the future of climate action, especially when multiplied and brought to scale. This efforts will become increasing important in the face of the next administration.Local action to meet global goals will carry out the imperative to mitigate dangerous carbon emissions and adapt to the ever pressing reality of our changing ecosystem."

Kimron Corion, ContributorOne Young World Ambassador, Entrepreneur, Social Media and Dig...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-tamarind-balls-white-_b_13917738.html,,2017-01-02,2017-01-01-1483230755-5324473-onceuponatime719174_1920.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2017-01-01-1483230755-5324473-onceuponatime719174_1920-thumb.jpg,"My life's ultimate goal is to become a very successful storytelling entrepreneur, which I am currently preparing myself for. In my small digital marketing hustle, I assist small businesses, start-ups, and entrepreneurs with innovative digital strategies that lure and satisfy potential and returning clients. In addition, I am currently working on honing my storytelling skills, and by December 2017, at the end of my Master of Digital Media Programme, I will create a storytelling journal. The journal will include the different structures for telling stories in a digital world and demonstrate how to engineer those stories for spreadability.From my interaction with many successful entrepreneurs, many of them share common stories about hustling and starting businesses as children such running lemonade stands and servicing paper routes. Consequently, I decided to look at my past to see if I was entrepreneurial back in the day. I started thinking about my days in Grenada when I attended St. Andrew's Anglican Primary School. Did I do anything that was entrepreneurial there? I certainly didn't have a lemonade stand; however, I remember my tamarind ball hustle. When I was young, I remember seeing vendors in the town of Grenville selling tamarind balls to passersby and thought to myself, what if I took the same concept but sold tamarind balls in my school? I already had access to the main ingredient because there was a huge tamarind tree next to my house, but the startup capital came in the form of a dollar I borrowed from my mom to buy the sugar for my business venture. Once everything was in place, I started making and selling tamarind balls to my schoolmates. I remember the first day I sold out. I couldn't believe it; the feeling was indescribable. Admittedly, while writing this piece, the nostalgia reignited that said feeling, and I started smiling ridiculously.Soon, tamarind went out of season; however, because of my initial experience, I somehow caught the entrepreneurial bug and moved on to another venture, an envelope hustle. Put simply; I sold white envelopes to my classmates. Up to this day, I can't remember where I got the envelopes from, nor do I know why my classmates were buying them in the first place since they had no need for them. As a matter of fact, upon reflection, I now feel bad about this, but the envelope hustle didn't last long. Firstly, before going further, however, I must admit that my next venture was the epitome of plagiarism. However, in my defense, I had no idea about that concept back then. Secondly, I must apologize to my friend Amwell for using his brother's art for financial gains since my next business involved selling copied work. Sometimes when Amwell brought his brother's art at school, which was generally drawings of popular cartoon characters and superheroes, I traced over his drawings then sold the duplicates to my schoolmates for 25 cents. Therefore, Amwell if you ever read this, forgive me for my ignorance. Since my conscience is now clear, I can now elaborate on the other legal businesses I later ran.As time went on, the symptoms of the entrepreneurial bug were still evident. When I attended secondary school, I joined the Junior Achievers programme. I was the president of my company which was called ""Noix de Coco Ltd"". The company was made up of students from St Andrew's Anglican Secondary School, Grenville Secondary School, and St Joseph Convent Grenville. Our company made and sold local coconut products to the general public. The little company gave me a true sense of what entrepreneurship was all about since I experienced all of the facets of running a business such as marketing, production, book keeping, management, etc. firsthand.Admittedly, there was a period when I believe the drive to enter business went away for a while, but fortunately, I got it back in my last year of university while living in Mexico. Consequently, to further assist me in my entrepreneurial journey, I am currently pursuing a Master of Digital Media degree at Ryerson University. My Major Research Project is all about storytelling and getting stories to spread from a business perspective. I want to help businesses tell their stories because I think it's one of the most underrated skills in entrepreneurship. I am currently storytelling for small clients and the #IamGrenadian project, and so far, the result has been great. I aim to document and blog my progress as I become a master storytelling entrepreneur, and I am glad to have you along for the journey."
12,FIFTY,"Boomers Were Time's ""Man of the Year"" Fifty Years Ago","Candy Leonard, ContributorSociologist, author of Beatleness, qualitative research consul...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/boomers-were-times-man-of_b_13917734.html,,2017-01-02,2016-12-31-1483228628-4047062-antiwar_vietnam_war_protest_rally.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-31-1483228628-4047062-antiwar_vietnam_war_protest_rally-thumb.jpg," When Time magazine named Trump ""Person of the Year"" for 2016, many pointed out that the honor had been bestowed on Hitler in 1938. But in 1966, fifty years ago, the magazine named people under age twenty-five--baby boomers--""Man of Year"" and offered a lengthy cover story in their January 6, 1967 issue called ""The Inheritors."" Explaining their choice, the editors said, ""No single earthly figure bestrode the year as did the restless, questing young,"" a group that ""dominates current history."" Comparing boomers to the prior, ""Silent Generation,"" the editors write, ""Today the young are anything but silent,"" make ""many statements, and appear more deeply committed to the fundamental Western ethos--decency, tolerance, brotherhood--than almost any generation since the age of chivalry.""   The editors felt the youth of the day were ""most accurately viewed through the campus window."" In other words, the elite was ignoring the poor and working class of all colors back then, too. The ""Inheritor"" they focused on was a white, male, middle-class boomer who would go to college and graduate into a decent job, putting him on the first rung of the ladder to bigger, better, and more. The economy was strong, corporations and the wealthy paid their fair share of taxes, and the government had both the will and the money to invest in the health and wellbeing of its most vulnerable citizens, creating Medicare, Medicaid, and Head Start. Describing the lived experience of the under 25s, Time said, ""Cushioned by unprecedented affluence and the welfare state, he has a sense of economic security unmatched in history."" Strong unions and good paying manufacturing jobs meant that the under 25s who didn't go to college could also enjoy the American Dream. But it didn't quite turn out that way. Reaganomics, globalization, and technological changes set the stage for the under 25s without college to be left behind and left out of the new economy. These are the boomers, fifty years later, who made Donald Trump president. As post-election analytics show, education is the big divide between the red state and blue state mindsets. Education was preparing boomers for a career and setting their expectations for a standard of living above that of their parents. But more importantly, learning about the history of civilizations, studying arts and sciences, and developing critical thinking skills is personally empowering; it replaces ignorance and leaves less room for fear and hate. The young people profiled by Time magazine likely grew up to be Clinton supporters--boomers who are horrified and saddened that much of the progress our generation fought for in the sixties, bringing about a more inclusive and just society, is now in jeopardy. As I discuss in my book Beatleness, the media's obsession with teenagers, students, protestors, and hippies from 1964-1970, combined with corporate America's cultivation of boomers as a lucrative market with its own pop culture, contributed to boomers' strong sense of generational identity. This first post-war generation was deemed special and had great expectations. Sadly, with great expectations come great disappointments. Voters in de-industrialized states expected their lives would be better than the lives they're now living. And adding insult to injury, they felt looked down upon by coastal, blue state culture. Bernie, and later Hillary, pointed the finger of blame for their economic plight in the right direction. But Trump's media savvy manner and hateful message, identifying people of color, immigrants, Muslims, and other minorities as the reason these white boomers' great expectations haven't been met, resonated more. Boomers came of age in a singular moment of American history; white male boomers, even in the working class, had idyllic childhoods in a newly child-centered, optimistic culture. Everything was great. So yes, of course, let's make America great again. Time's Man of Year issue in January 1967 also ran a letter written by young people questioning the ""wide disparity between American statements about Viet Nam and American actions there."" Time called the growing ""credibility gap"" ""as urgent a problem as any that confronts the nation today."" The editors, along with the rest of the establishment, vastly underestimated the power and commitment of young people who opposed US involvement in Vietnam. Thirteen months later, when American journalist Walter Cronkite, the most trusted man in America, came out against the war, public opinion started to shift. Nineteen-sixty-eight would bring protests on campuses nationwide. Protests against the selection of the insufficiently dovish Hubert Humphrey at the Democratic Convention--a choice widely perceived, by the young especially, as going against the wishes of the primary voters--turned violent as the whole world watched. It was later determined that one in six demonstrators was actually a government agent of some kind, inciting what an in-depth study concluded was a police riot. Soon, the credibility gap was further exacerbated by Watergate. By the eighties, the credibility gap had morphed into a general distrust of government and, thanks to Reagan's brilliant messaging, a desire within the electorate to see government's role limited. Trump's boomer supporters, from childhood, to adolescence, to adulthood, were raised to be cynical of the political process and distrustful of government. Given their disappointment and unchanging circumstances, they had nothing to lose by embracing someone who would ""shake things up.""Because boomers--of all social classes and irrespective of education--were television natives, they learned about the world differently and saw the world differently than previous generations. Weaned on television, they learned to read emotions and various points of view up close. This is what Time is referring to when they say ""The 'Now Generation' had a ""keen ability to sense meaning on many levels at the same time,"" and that they possessed a ""built-in bunk detector for sniffing out dishonesty and double standards."" But it seems that boomer's built-in bunk detectors have grown defective or obsolete over fifty years and were, sadly, no match for the razzle-dazzle of Donald Trump--himself a boomer with a lifelong TV obsession-- who appeared to ""tell it like it is,"" a trait, as Time noted fifty years ago, highly admired by boomers."

And so I want them to be sure,” Trump said, referring to the faulty argument pushed by proponents of the 2003 Iraq invasion that dictator Saddam Hussein possessed banned weapons. “I think it’s unfair if they don’t know. And I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don’t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.”Trump then stated his belief that extremely sensitive information should not be communicated via computers at all, citing the expertise of his pre-teen son.“It’s very important, if you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way because I’ll tell you what, no computer is safe. I don’t care what they say, no computer is safe,” Trump said. “I have a boy who’s 10 years old. He can do anything with a computer. You want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier.”When asked what, specifically, he knew about alleged Russian hacking that others did not, Trump said he would reveal his insights into the controversy in due time. “You’ll find out Tuesday or Wednesday,” he said.The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI this week released a 13-page document outlining how Russian-based hackers stole emails of Democratic officials, which were then released online and to the outlet WikiLeaks in the closing months of the campaign.Following the release of that report, Trump announced that during the coming days he would meet with U.S. intelligence leaders to discuss Russia’s interference in the election, even though he thought it was better for the country to move on from the election.Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton herself raised the issue of Russia’s involvement during one of the presidential debates. But Trump said it was impossible to know who actually had done the hacking, suggesting it might have been a 400-pound hacker sitting in his bed and, later, that it was someone in New Jersey."

The president-elect said in November that once he takes office, he will be “very restrained, if I use [Twitter] at all.”He hasn’t been all that restrained during the transition period. Along with the standard jabs at the media ― one of them a day after his promise to be restrained ― Trump has used Twitter to comment on foreign affairs ― often in a way that contradicts the official U.S. stance as stated by the current president. ABC’s Jonathan Karl asked Spicer on Sunday whether there will be “major policy done via Twitter.” The answer was yes ― with an acknowledgment that Twitter is a good way to avoid going through reporters. “I think it freaks the mainstream media out that he has this following of over 45 plus million people that follow him on social media, that he can have a direct conversation,” Spicer said. “He doesn’t have to have it funneled through the media. This is the, this is going to be ― business as usual is over, as I’ve said before. There’s a new sheriff in town, and he’s going to do things first and foremost for the American people.”Spicer said there will still be engagement with the media, including press conferences, although “no decisions have been made” about whether they would continue to take the current form of daily televised briefings.The Trump administration will soon take over the @POTUS Twitter account, which means it could go from tweets like this: To this:"

What it shows is that by all measures the Democratic National Committee had a very lax IT support,” Spicer said. “Now hacking is wrong by any standards. No one supports anyone hacking into any other entity, legal, domestically, or foreign, or anyone interfering with anything, but the fact of the matter is, what this report really does show is that there’s a need for them to go back in and look at their, what they’re doing IT wise to protect their system.”Karl pressed him further: “Does he accept that Russia was behind this?”“Well I think, like I said, he has to have the briefing first from the intelligence community next week,” Spicer said.Trump has previously dismissed reports that Russia was behind the hack, stating that it could have been a 400-pound man or maybe “some guy in his home in New Jersey.” He also said it’s very difficult to determine who is behind cyberattacks “unless you catch ‘hackers’ in the act.” Security analysts say that’s not true. Trump again disputed the intelligence analysis on the hack on Saturday, saying, “It could be somebody else.” He added: “And I also know things that other people don’t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.”"

He also said many of those detained had been aggressive.“This was clearly about preventing similar incidents to last year,” he told a news conference. “A large part of this group that was checked was such that criminal acts were to be expected. That is why we took this clear approach.”Police arrested 92 people - including 16 Germans and 10 Syrians - during Saturday night’s celebrations in Cologne. Police also installed new video surveillance cameras to monitor the station square.Many of the suspects in the attacks a year ago were of North African and Arab appearance, the police have said.Those attacks helped fuel the rise of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which hurt Merkel’s conservatives in a series of regional polls last year and threaten to erode her support in this year’s national election.In her New Year’s address to the nation, Merkel said Islamist terrorism was the biggest test facing Germany, and she vowed to improve security after an Islamic State attack in Berlin before Christmas that killed 12 people.Although the migrant flow into Germany has slowed sharply, Merkel is under pressure from the AfD and her party’s conservative Bavarian allies to take tougher action after more than one million asylum seekers arrived here in 2015 and 2016."

It said 10 members of its security forces were seriously wounded.“From now on those making such attempts will be presented before the competent judicial authorities who will decree their expulsion from the kingdom (of Morocco) or heavier penalties, according the gravity of the act,” the ministry said in a statement.Spain’s two enclaves in Morocco, Ceuta and Melilla, are often used as entry points into Europe for African migrants, who either climb over their border fences or try to swim along the coast.Spain has drawn criticism from human rights groups for allowing some migrants to be immediately turned back to Morocco in such incidents. They argue that skipping the lengthier deportation procedures deprives people of the opportunity to claim asylum.In early December more than 400 sub-Saharan African migrants managed to force their way over the Ceuta border fence.However, Libya has become a more common departure point for African migrants, most of whom come from sub-Saharan countries and attempt the crossing to Italy by boat.2016 was the deadliest year ever for migrants in the Mediterranean, with almost 5,000 deaths, according to the International Organization for Migration.Separately on Sunday, Spanish police said a Moroccan woman was arrested in Ceuta last week for trying to smuggle a 19-year-old migrant from Gabon across the border with Spain curled up inside a suitcase."

It implies a deliberate intent to mislead.”He said reporters should state the facts, but leave classifying them to readers, citing the example of Trump’s claim that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey were celebrating on 9/11 (which is false).“I think it’s then up to the reader to make up their own mind to say, ‘This is what Donald Trump says. This is what a reliable, trustworthy news organization reports. And you know what? I don’t think that’s true.’”The New York Times editorial board has used “lie” to describe Trump’s rampant abuse of facts. And Washington Post conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin has taken the media to task for not using the word. Other outlets ― including MSNBC, New York Magazine and HuffPost ― will use the word when it’s merited.But Baker said that in doing so, “you run the risk that you look like you are, you’re not being, objective.”Baker also suggested that Trump is being treated differently than other politicians. “This is happening all the time now, people are looking at what Donald Trump’s saying and saying, ‘This is false, it’s a false claim.’ I think people are saying, ‘You know what, Hillary Clinton said a lot things that were false.’ I don’t remember the press being quite so concerned about saying she lied in headlines and stories like that.”"

The woman is Spingler’s mother-in-law from a previous marriage. She suffers from dementia and needs 24-hour care, according to a criminal complaint obtained by The Smoking Gun.A nursing home employee told police she saw Spingler on Dec. 15 touching the woman’s right breast and moving his hand “around her chest area in a manner that could not be misconstrued with anything else but inappropriate touching.”Spingler reportedly returned to the nursing home two days later and groped the woman again, according to a nursing home worker.When Spingler realized he was being watched, “his face turned red and he immediately left the facility,” the criminal complaint says, according to The Smoking Gun.He returned Dec. 23, and allegedly touched his victim once again, according to police. An employee who observed the visit claimed that the woman looked uncomfortable and tried to pull away, according to WTXF-TV. That employee reported that he told Spingler to stop and said he replied, “What?” before leaving.Spingler was arraigned on the indecent assault counts Friday evening and was released after posting $10,000 in bail.His next court date is scheduled for Jan. 5, and the judge ordered him not to have any contact with the 103-year-old woman, according to Main Line Surburban Life.Spingler had no comment when Philly.com contacted him about the charges.Spingler, a real estate agent, has been involved in politics since 1968, when he was elected to the Radnor Township Board of Commissioners in 1968 as a Democrat, according to the Delco Times.He also served as a county commissioner from 1972 to 1980 before an unsuccessful run for Congress in 1986. He then served as a Radnor commissioner from 1991 until 2015 and was board president when he retired."

Bush. “We have just elected a man who started a hot war with a female anchor instead of attending a debate she moderated. We are in a new place. And I don’t think it’s good. And I don’t think it has any parallels to the past.”The “Meet The Press” roundtable discussed Trump’s predilection for using Twitter to reach people and his frequent disparagement of journalists and journalism. “I don’t think Trump needs the press, but I think he wants them like an addict craves their drugs,” Wallace continued.Joe Lockhart, who served as press secretary for President Bill Clinton, said that already within the transition period, Trump has diverged from past presidents. “We’re on opposite sides of the parties,” he said, referring to the other press secretaries in the roundtable, “but I think our transitions were really similar, because we shared a couple of things. We shared the idea that the press-president relationship was mutually beneficial. The reason people sit down in the briefing room every day is because both sides get something out of it.“Traditionally for the last 50 years, we’ve operated on the same basic fact sets,” he continued. “We’re really in a place where ― we haven’t seen this, I think, since the ‘60s with Nixon ― where they create their own facts. You redefine the past, which means you can define the present and future. That’s going to be very difficult for both sides to come to grips with.”“It’s a double-barreled hostility,” said Ari Fleischer, another George W. Bush press secretary. “His press corps can’t stand Donald Trump, and Donald Trump is happy to return the favor.”But Fleischer blamed the press, at least in part. Trump is able to use the public’s animosity toward the press to his advantage, because “confidence in the press to report the news fairly has never been lower ― they have lost the trust of the readers and the viewers.”"

Their phones were turned off or went dead soon after.“She’s never without her phone,” Guzman told KEYT-TV. “The most she’s not contacted me is one or two hours sometimes, but not to totally turn off her phone and totally disregard anyone’s calls or messages, so this is definitely out of the ordinary for her.”She said she had never met her sister’s boyfriend, but had heard from friends their relationship was “rocky” and was “concerned” that they were going on a road trip together, she told the Los Angeles Daily News.Their last known location was a general store in the area where one of their credit cards was used, according to police.The Monterey County Sheriff’s Office is conducting a search and has passed out photos of the couple. The stretch of Highway 1 along the Big Sur coast can be treacherous and cars have plunged off hairpin turns. Heavy rains in the area have also caused large boulders to loosen from the rocks above and fall to the highway, officials told CBS News.Guzman said she is holding out hope that the couple just “wanted to be out and off the map a little bit and enjoy the scenery and come home” but admitted she is seriously “worried about my sister.”Anyone with information regarding Gonzalez and Fernandez should call the LAPD’s Missing Persons Unit at 213-996-1800 or can submit tips anonymously through LA Regional Crime Stoppers at 800-222-8477 or lacrimestoppers.org."
25,POLITICS,Want To Be A Judge Under Trump? Chief Justice Lays Out What The Job Is Like,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-chief-justice-john-roberts-2016-report_us_58682b0ce4b0eb586489bcf2,"John Roberts' year-end report praises ""the skill, hard work, and dedication"" of lower-court judges.",2017-01-01,Chief Justice John Roberts issued his traditional year-end report on the federal judiciary on Dec. 31.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58682ba91500002f00e9dde6.jpeg?cache=25HTSXwDri&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump is nowhere mentioned in Chief Justice John Roberts’ latest year-end report on the federal judiciary. But if you read between the lines, the reality that the next president will soon be filling a bevy of court vacancies across the country could very well have been weighing on the chief’s mind.“While the Supreme Court is often the focus of public attention,” Roberts wrote in the report published Saturday, which said nothing about the empty seat on his own court, “our system of justice depends fundamentally on the skill, hard work, and dedication of those outside the limelight.”There are no fireworks in the traditional New Year’s Eve report — Roberts’ 12th since he was appointed to lead the Supreme Court and the nation’s federal courts. No word on Merrick Garland, either — the judge President Barack Obama nominated to fill the vacant seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February.Instead, Roberts limits his report to praising the hundreds of lower court judges already serving ― with no acknowledgment that there are 84 vacancies for these judgeships nationwide, 44 of them with pending Obama nominees. Many of those names even made it out of committee in the Senate but never got a vote, in large part due to the same tactics Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) deployed to halt the Garland nomination.None of this made the chief’s report, which was otherwise filled with historical tidbits about George Washington’s nomination of the first 13 federal judges and a detailed look at the everyday workload of those keeping the wheels of justice turning today.“Because they work alone, district judges do not have the benefit of collegial decision-making or the comfort of shared consensus,” Roberts wrote. “And because of the press of their dockets, they face far more severe time and resource constraints than their appellate brethren.”One advocacy organization, Fix the Court, said Roberts should’ve gotten a little more real about how the political process has hamstrung the courts.“With the Senate now famous for its inaction in filling federal court vacancies, Roberts should use the power of his office to find creative ways to solve the impasse, as writing a report with only the most oblique references to such problems does not fix anything,” said Gabe Roth, the group’s executive director.In previous years, Roberts’ reports had more of a political edge. In his second report, Roberts warned of a “constitutional crisis” in the courts if Congress didn’t get its act together and do something to increase judicial salaries, which had remained stagnant for years.“Congress has a constitutional responsibility to do so,” he wrote in his 2006 report, which also predicted that failure to act by lawmakers “will inevitably result in a decline in the quality of persons willing to accept a lifetime appointment as a federal judge.”In 2012, just as Obama was getting ready to start his second term, Roberts directly called on him and Congress “to act diligently in nominating and confirming highly qualified candidates to fill” judicial vacancies.With Trump’s swearing-in — by Roberts no less — now 20 days away, the president-elect is poised to inherit all of the judicial seats Obama couldn’t fill. And with the Senate firmly in Republican hands, it looks like Roberts won’t need to do a lot of imploring in future reports.In that sense, maybe the chief’s 2016 year-end message could be read not as an airing of grievances but as an invitation for those who might be pondering getting a Trump nod in the next four years.“You might be asking at this point why any lawyer would want a job that requires long hours, exacting skill, and intense devotion — while promising high stress, solitary confinement, and guaranteed criticism,” Roberts wrote. “There are many easier and more lucrative ways for a good lawyer to earn a living.”Which he followed with this kicker of sorts: “The answer lies in the rewards of public service. District judges make a difference every day, and leave a lasting legacy, by making our society more fair and just.”"
26,BLACK VOICES,Will History Be Kind To Barack Obama's Legacy As The First Black President?,"Gregg L.

I agree with British historian Arnold Toynbee, who warned historians against trying to understand the present, let alone imagining what historians would say about current events in the future.There are those who say President Obama did not do enough to elevate or even fight for the rights of African-American people, they would suggest the antagonism of Obama’s own blackness was not provoked; still others, may suggest that which his racial self-consciousness constrained him, not as to openly advocate in an effort to avoid showing any resemblance of outright favoritism toward his own race. In an article for New York magazine when 53 historians weighed in on the presidency of Barack Obama, it was suggested that we will care a great deal less about his race generations from now — just as John F. Kennedy’s Catholicism hardly matters to current students of history.If the “Legacy,” of Obama as president is to be challenged, then should we consider questions about Barack Obama’s sojourn in Kenya, the land of his father. In Kenya, where President Obama is saluted as an absolute “Hero,” ―coming after un-numbered African generations suffer the agonies of enforced servitude and historical exile, a favored native son, blood of the land, who returns in triumph to claim the mantle of “world leader and heroic figure.” Without a doubt, White House spin doctors would love to have this story told. Yet notwithstanding the tired cynicism of the political age and the familiarity of Obama’s much-told personal journey, this remarkable reversal of fortunes, briefly glimpsed and savored, remains genuinely uplifting.In post-2012 America, So great has been the increase in political power that the black voter turnout rate surpassed that of whites with the 2012 presidential race, and the number of black elected officials has risen sevenfold. But while school segregation and workplace discrimination have declined, too many African-Americans go home to segregated, often impoverished neighborhoods. How much can we attribute the overwhelming number of political seats as to being inspired by this president?According to recent polls, the black poverty rate has dropped from more than 40 percent in the 1960s to about 27 percent today; child poverty similarly has dipped from 67 percent to about 40 percent. Those numbers still are glaring, however. And the gap in overall wealth is more than 5-to-1 between whites and blacks: The average white household had nearly $800,000 in assets in 2011, compared with $154,000 for blacks.Many feel that President Obama could have been significantly instrumental in making progress on civil rights an area which has surprisingly has been much slower. Yes, it is true that today-America has many post-civil rights issues to openly deal, examples being the flurry of Police Brutality issues: Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Andrew Joseph, Freddie Gray, Mike Brown and the list goes on. We may never understand the dynamics that have been at the heart of America’s seemingly non-existent policies with Civil Rights, and why Present Obama did not do more?In closing, if history is to be kind President Obama, we must consider the fact that a person of color who became the president of the United States of America which has inspired, many children and others around the world who never really believed that they could achieve this feat, and they are now saying, “one day I’ll be president of the United States of America.” That alone has challenged the hearts of the detractors who say, “President Obama did not do enough for African-Americans.” In addition, we must agree with another great President, John F. Kennedy, who knew the challenge wasn’t just passing laws, but changing hearts and minds. “Law alone cannot make men see right,” he said. “We are confronted primarily with a moral issue.” We have to inspire people so change is in their hearts (a hard pressed task), I believe president Obama has accomplished this task so in this respect ― history will show President Barack Obama favor.Gregg L.

I say it was a bad year for politicians in politics.True: Hillary Clinton lost her bid to become the first female President of the United States. And the first female presidents of South Korea and Brazil were impeached. But one woman does not embody the strengths and weaknesses of all her female compatriots. Indeed, no more so than one male politician is representative of all male politicians.Has anyone asked David Cameron whether he thought 2016 was a good year for men in politics? Or François Hollande? Or Bernie Sanders or Jeb Bush? Each of these men experienced high profile failures this past year. Yet their defeats were considered to be personal. Virtually no one is saying, ""Wow, look at all the male politicians who failed.""But because there remain so few examples of woman in positions of high political power, when one fails, her deficiencies are widely ascribed to women in politics generally. That is exactly the kind of thinking we need to get past. Several individual women's setbacks -- no matter how visible -- do not make it a bad year for women in politics. Instead, to assess the state of gender equality, we need to look not at individual performance but at collective progress.By that measure, in fact, 2016 continued a long-running positive trend for women in national elected office. At 23%, the percentage of Parliamentarians globally who are women was higher than prior year, just as it has been every December since the Inter-Parliamentary Union started keeping records at the end of the 20th century, when it stood at 13%. The past year's progress was nearly universal, as modest increases of 0.2% to 0.8% were achieved in every region of the world, save Arab countries, which remained unchanged at 19.1%. Progress was achieved at both ends of the spectrum. Iceland elected 30 women to its chamber of 63 and now boasts of the ""most gender-balanced parliament in the world"". At the bottom of the rankings, Tonga elected one woman to Parliament, leaving only Haiti, Micronesia, Qatar and Vanuatu without female legislators.Add to this collective progress a raft of individual achievements and a strong argument can be made that 2016 was, in fact, another year of historic breakthroughs for women in politics. Hillary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major American party and the first woman to win the popular vote. Seven women were nominated to become the first female Secretary General of the United Nations. Theresa May became the United Kingdom's second female prime minister. Estonia, Taiwan and the Marshall Islands elected their first female presidents. Tokyo, Rome and Bucharest elected their first female mayors.This all begs the question: How will 2017 shape up?There is reason to believe the long-term trend of rising percentages of women in parliaments will continue in the year ahead. The Netherlands and Norway, countries leading on women's empowerment, may push the percentage of women in their chambers above 40% when they have parliamentary elections on March 15 and September 11, respectively.Laggard nations will also have opportunities to start catching up. Iran, ranked 175th for female political representation, will be one to watch when it has local council elections (and its presidential election) on May 19.Among high-profile female leaders, two second-term presidents face term limits at the end of the year. Voters in Liberia and Chile -- countries where men overwhelmingly dominate politics -- will choose successors to Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Michelle Bachelet on October 10 and November 19, respectively.But nowhere will women political leaders attract more attention this year than in France and Germany. In France's presidential election on April 23, Marine Le Pen will attempt to topple the two major party candidates to become the country's first female president. About five months later, Germans will vote in a general election where not only is the country's most powerful leader a woman, but so too are leaders of small parties on the extreme right (Alternative für Deutschland) and left (Die Linke).For advocates of women in politics, France and Germany will be the stories of the year. But not merely because Angela Merkel is the most powerful woman in the world, and Le Pen aspires to challenge the German Chancellor's vision of a unified Europe. The fact that these two individuals will loom large over their national elections, is not, as described above, why these elections are so important for the collective progress of women in politics. These two general elections will be pivotal because Germany and France already have among the most female Parliamentarians of any countries in the world, each with well over 200. Together, their female legislators represent nearly five percent of the women in Parliaments globally. Whether these numbers continue to climb following the elections of 2017 will largely influence whether the global march towards gender parity in Parliaments continues for another year."

A mile a day seemed possible — yet daunting.I had done a handful of 5K races, a few 5-milers, and a couple of 10Ks since my friend Sarah got me into running back in May 2010. But I was never consistent. I’d train (haphazardly) for a race and then drop even lacing up the running shoes for months at a time.But on March 8, the fates decided that 2016 was indeed going to become my Year of Running when I won a lottery spot in the TCS New York City Marathon.By that date, I had literally only run 4.1 miles TOTAL for the year. Pathetic. I had entered the lottery thinking I’d run it my 40th year in 2017 — and heard several friends win the lottery on their third tries. I entered it once before, so I figured I might as well get that second try in, never expecting to get drawn this year!So I started running again. Small distances at first — as little as a mile at a time. By March 27, I decided it was time for a longer run and while in Washington D.C. went for a 6-mile jog, delightfully distracted by the beauty of the cherry blossoms and monuments. But the last mile, something didn’t feel right. And by the time I stopped, my right knee was in excruciating pain. Later that day, I suffered several sharp pains that made me cry out loud. How the heck was I going to run through the five boroughs of New York City in seven months?And that’s when my path to 26.2 (@PathTo262) miles really began. Here are the lessons I learned along the way…1. It’s Okay To Ask For HelpI was a little nervous to walk into Fleet Feet in Hoboken, NJ, to buy a proper pair of running shoes. Even though I had been in and out of there a few times before during 5K and 10K prep, I had marveled at the “serious” runners who knew what gear they needed and asked all the right questions.But the staff couldn’t have been more helpful, guiding this amateur through the process and even welcoming my silly questions. After trying on numerous pairs (over and over again!), they even analyzed my gait, and we worked together to find the perfect match.With that kind of welcoming start, it helped me realize there’s no question too dumb to ask ― whether it was about proper hydration, bloody chafing cuts, or even what running outfit looked the cutest on! And that extends to any subject in life.2. Success Is A Team SportEven though I chose to train alone because of my crazy schedule — and because I can’t hold a conversation while running (maybe I’ll get over that in 2017!) — I realized I was never truly alone. My friend Tam helped me pick the right training plan (and boy does Hal Higdon’s Novice I work), Meghan educated me on the proper fueling (and I loved her recommendation of Clif Bloks), Mimi checked in with me weekly (and kept better track of my injured toenails than I did!) and the night before the run, Sarah got on the phone and talked me through the run — providing just the kind of motivating pep talk I needed.And all throughout the way, I received doses of encouragement and advice from coworkers in the office to faraway friends around the world via social media. Before you know it, you’ve culled together your perfect team of players around you to help you achieve any goal.3. Random Acts Of Kindness Go A Long WayThroughout my 94 training runs, I always started feeling slow and sluggish — but I was reminded in chance encounters that the way you feel isn’t always the way it appears on the outside.Once it was a neighbor who told me I was “looking strong” when we crossed paths on the waterfront. Another time it was a stranger on the bus who saw me post-long run wearing my fuel belt and said I looked better prepared than she was. And oftentimes, it was just a sweet smile from a little old lady sitting on the sidelines.Those little bites that were delivered without any judgement were so pure that they gave a huge push. Since then, I’ve tried to pay it forward to strangers I come across — whether it was sharing macaroons with ferry workers or paying compliments to hard-working cashiers.4. Talk Out Your IssuesGoing into training, I was completely clueless. But that “fake it until you make it” mentality only goes so far. I knew nothing about what to wear, what to eat, what kind of pains I would face, or how my body would react to the whole process.Initially, I’d be embarrassed to admit how light-headed and sick I felt from a long run. But when I learned to start talking about the problems to other people, that’s when I realized none of my issues were just me… they were all typical runners’ dilemmas! (Turns out I wasn’t re-hydrating with electrolytes!)There wasn’t any problem that there wasn’t a solution to as long as you keep an open mind to solutions. And the more people you talk to about the dramas in your life — no matter what they’re about — the more perspective you gain.5. Digital Detox Is EssentialIn this age of must-reply-to-every-text and must-check-all-my-social-media-feeds, perhaps the best lesson I learned was how freeing it was to step away from it all. As the long training runs built up to four or five hours toward the end, that was quite a chunk of time during daylight “online hours” to be otherwise engaged.Whether I was running through the familiar path I ran every day or through the woods of New Jersey I had never been on, it was such a gift to have that much “think time” to process the “how did I get here” and “where do I go from here” questions in life.Thanks to being able to step away from it all for such quality time each week, I’ve been able to re-prioritize values and re-center my focus in every aspect of my life. And I’ve learned to simply put the phone down and live life. 6. Practice Does Make PerfectWhen my training plan started, the runs were about three to five miles, which seemed doable. I couldn’t even imagine a 10-mile run. But as I learned to trust the plan, I got used to a 10-mile run being not a big deal at all. In fact, I remember thinking at one point — today’s run is “only” 14 miles!If you put the time in and stick to it, training for something that’s out of your realm is completely possible. I was never built to be a runner… I managed to finish the marathon and still be able to walk around New York City the next day. Early on, I wasn’t even able to take a step after a single-digit mile run!Commitment is key. My stubborn determination led me to not miss a single run. And that goes for anything — if you put in the time, you can get to the finish.7. It’s Okay For It To Be About Me Nothing makes me more uncomfortable about having all eyes on me. But as I worked through the plan week by week, I realized I had to be comfortable talking about myself. One night, I was hanging out with four friends and I kept apologizing that we had been talking about me running the marathon… the more I apologized, the more we talked about it. And the more they made me realize it is a big deal and something that’s okay to be celebrated.The weeks before the race, everyone kept telling me I had to put my name on my shirt — which I just hated the idea of! I already wanted to be anonymous running, but I kept being told I wouldn’t regret it.And once I started running and heard the first stranger call out my name, I knew what they meant. That feeling of being called out of the crowd was beyond empowerment — and no matter how selfish or guilty it made me feel — it was okay to turn the spotlight on myself for life’s big moments.8. Learn To Let Go — LiterallyWhen my knee pain started, I thought about quitting. But then thought, what are the chances I’ll get drawn in the lottery again? This might be the only time ever — so I decided to do it right by going to physical therapy.My amazing PT Alicia at Finish Line Physical Therapy initially focused on my quads and how I clenched them, causing the knee pain I complained about (so bad I couldn’t even take a single step off a curb in Manhattan!). But as the weeks went by and I got to know my PT better and be more honest about everything I felt, we landed on the fact that I hold my breath. Like all the time.So we shifted our focus on and I basically learned to breathe again. It turns out much of my issues — all over! — was from never exhaling. We started doing drills with balloons that made it so clear how I couldn’t even hold an exhale.It was the epiphany of a lifetime! I was holding so much in — both literally and figuratively. Once I learned to let go, my runs got so much easier… and so did my life!9. Filter Out The NegativityThere’s always going to be people in your life who can’t help but hold you back. And if you can’t cut them out of your life, it’s about letting their negative energy roll off your back.For me, the comments started seemingly jokingly about not being in shape enough to run the last six miles. But then even after crossing the finish line, it was about my “poor form.”It didn’t matter if I limped, waddled or crawled across the finish. It was the feat of getting there. (And for the record, I clocked in my best pace that final quarter mile ― and am freakin’ proud of the form that makes me who I am!).And as simple as that lesson is, to translate it to work, family or friends is just as essential — the negativity that’s launched your way is no reflection of who you are, but how you handle it is.10. Nothing Beats Paying It ForwardThe day after the marathon, a friend of my texted and said he was so inspired that he had signed up for a race — and I immediately had tears streaming down my face. For so many years, that was me on the other side… watching these inspiring runners from all walks of life join together in the New York City marathon. And now I was part of that group, inspiring the next! A few weeks later, another friend told me she had started training for a 10-mile race — it continues!By sharing my path to the finish, I realized it made it feel real and something anyone could do… which is exactly true because I am that unlikely marathon runner (still feels so weird to call myself that!).Since then, the way I shared other aspects of my life must have shifted too. A few weeks after the marathon, I took a trip to Portugal and two people emailed me and said they were so taken with my social media posts that they booked trips too!And that’s what makes this journey of life so very worth it — inspiring one another, rooting for one another, and embracing the magic of it with one another.11. Challenges Are Short Term, But The Effects Are Long-TermWhen I first started training, I thought the more I ran, the stronger I would feel. Instead, it often felt the opposite — I couldn’t believe how weak I was and how much everything hurt! There were actually times I thought — I’m never going to walk pain-free again! At times, I felt like I was the weakest I had been in my life... glued to a couch and depending on Ubers and Vias to get around town to avoid stairs!I joked to my friends that I couldn’t walk, but I could run. It made no sense, but it was true. And I powered through those pains and stuck to every run on the training plan — and of course, the science behind it helped me survive the 26.2 miles with a smile on my face.Eventually that feeling of being strong did come — recently! Now that I’ve recovered and migrated back to my normal fitness routine of yoga, Broadway Bodies dance, and occasional spin classes, I’m often shocked how much I can do without having to worry about adjustments. And mentally having gone from seeing the marathon as an impossible task to checking it off the to-do list has added to that sense of invincibility.I set out on this journey to run 365 miles — and ended up running 535 miles. Despite my instinct against it, I now can proudly say that I am, indeed, a runner. And that my Year of Running truly turned me into a stronger person — both physically and mentally.For more on my Path to 26.2, check out my Instagram Blog: @PathTo262"
29,HEALTHY LIVING,11 Life Lessons I Learned From My Year Of Running,"Rachel Chang, ContributorFueled by wanderlust. Fulfilled by adventure. Travelzoo publis...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ten-life-lessons-i-learned-from-my-year-of-running_us_5867bf62e4b014e7c72ee1a6,A mile a day seemed possible — yet daunting.,2017-01-01,<p>Celebrating finishing the 26.2 miles of the New York City Marathon on Marathon Monday at Tavern on the Green.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586c729f150000150091712a.jpg?ops=crop_0_0_400_500%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"I don’t consider myself a runner.Yet when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared that his challenge for 2016 was A Year of Running on Jan. 4, I was intrigued and joined the group. A mile a day seemed possible — yet daunting.I had done a handful of 5K races, a few 5-milers, and a couple of 10Ks since my friend Sarah got me into running back in May 2010. But I was never consistent. I’d train (haphazardly) for a race and then drop even lacing up the running shoes for months at a time.But on March 8, the fates decided that 2016 was indeed going to become my Year of Running when I won a lottery spot in the TCS New York City Marathon.By that date, I had literally only run 4.1 miles TOTAL for the year. Pathetic. I had entered the lottery thinking I’d run it my 40th year in 2017 — and heard several friends win the lottery on their third tries. I entered it once before, so I figured I might as well get that second try in, never expecting to get drawn this year!So I started running again. Small distances at first — as little as a mile at a time. By March 27, I decided it was time for a longer run and while in Washington D.C. went for a 6-mile jog, delightfully distracted by the beauty of the cherry blossoms and monuments. But the last mile, something didn’t feel right. And by the time I stopped, my right knee was in excruciating pain. Later that day, I suffered several sharp pains that made me cry out loud. How the heck was I going to run through the five boroughs of New York City in seven months?And that’s when my path to 26.2 (@PathTo262) miles really began. Here are the lessons I learned along the way…1. It’s Okay To Ask For HelpI was a little nervous to walk into Fleet Feet in Hoboken, NJ, to buy a proper pair of running shoes. Even though I had been in and out of there a few times before during 5K and 10K prep, I had marveled at the “serious” runners who knew what gear they needed and asked all the right questions.But the staff couldn’t have been more helpful, guiding this amateur through the process and even welcoming my silly questions. After trying on numerous pairs (over and over again!), they even analyzed my gait, and we worked together to find the perfect match.With that kind of welcoming start, it helped me realize there’s no question too dumb to ask ― whether it was about proper hydration, bloody chafing cuts, or even what running outfit looked the cutest on! And that extends to any subject in life.2. Success Is A Team SportEven though I chose to train alone because of my crazy schedule — and because I can’t hold a conversation while running (maybe I’ll get over that in 2017!) — I realized I was never truly alone. My friend Tam helped me pick the right training plan (and boy does Hal Higdon’s Novice I work), Meghan educated me on the proper fueling (and I loved her recommendation of Clif Bloks), Mimi checked in with me weekly (and kept better track of my injured toenails than I did!) and the night before the run, Sarah got on the phone and talked me through the run — providing just the kind of motivating pep talk I needed.And all throughout the way, I received doses of encouragement and advice from coworkers in the office to faraway friends around the world via social media. Before you know it, you’ve culled together your perfect team of players around you to help you achieve any goal.3. Random Acts Of Kindness Go A Long WayThroughout my 94 training runs, I always started feeling slow and sluggish — but I was reminded in chance encounters that the way you feel isn’t always the way it appears on the outside.Once it was a neighbor who told me I was “looking strong” when we crossed paths on the waterfront. Another time it was a stranger on the bus who saw me post-long run wearing my fuel belt and said I looked better prepared than she was. And oftentimes, it was just a sweet smile from a little old lady sitting on the sidelines.Those little bites that were delivered without any judgement were so pure that they gave a huge push. Since then, I’ve tried to pay it forward to strangers I come across — whether it was sharing macaroons with ferry workers or paying compliments to hard-working cashiers.4. Talk Out Your IssuesGoing into training, I was completely clueless. But that “fake it until you make it” mentality only goes so far. I knew nothing about what to wear, what to eat, what kind of pains I would face, or how my body would react to the whole process.Initially, I’d be embarrassed to admit how light-headed and sick I felt from a long run. But when I learned to start talking about the problems to other people, that’s when I realized none of my issues were just me… they were all typical runners’ dilemmas! (Turns out I wasn’t re-hydrating with electrolytes!)There wasn’t any problem that there wasn’t a solution to as long as you keep an open mind to solutions. And the more people you talk to about the dramas in your life — no matter what they’re about — the more perspective you gain.5. Digital Detox Is EssentialIn this age of must-reply-to-every-text and must-check-all-my-social-media-feeds, perhaps the best lesson I learned was how freeing it was to step away from it all.

Pained, I express my closeness to the Turkish people. I pray for the many victims and for the wounded and for the entire nation in mourning,” he said.“I ask the Lord to sustain all men of good will to courageously roll up their sleeves to confront the plague of terrorism and this stain of blood that is covering the world with a shadow of fear and a sense of loss,” he said.He said 2017 will be what people make of it.“The year will be good in the measure that each one of us, with the help of God, seeks to do good day after day,” he told the crowd on a cold morning.Speaking on the day the 1.2 billion-member Roman Catholic Church marks its World Day of Peace, he said peace was constructed by saying ‘no’ to hate and violence and ‘yes’ to brotherhood and reconciliation.Francis earlier said Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica, where in a homily he said the lack of physical contact among people brought on by modern means of virtual communication “is cauterizing our hearts and making us lose the capacity for tenderness and wonder, for pity and compassion.”(Reporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by Stephen Powell)"

During the scuffle, Harris reportedly stabbed the dog in the head and neck with a knife.Responding animal control officers with Hillsborough County used a tranquilizer gun on the dog. When the dog escaped and ran into the house where children were, officials used a beanbag gun and a stun gun to finally capture the dog with a catchpole.“Officers responding said the dog was pretty aggressive,” Eddy Durkin with Tampa Police told WFTS. “When they tased the dog, the dog was still pulling away and was able to release the prongs from the Taser.”Brenda and Ismael Guerrero were both treated for injuries. Brenda Guerrero’s were considered serious but non-life-threatening, WTSP reported.Neighbors told WFTS that the family got the dog about a month ago. It’s not clear what will happen to him.Though sweaters may be cute accessories for dogs, it’s important to pay close attention to an animal’s body signals.“Just gauge the animal’s reaction because you’ll be able to tell,” Sherry Silk, the CEO Humane Society of Tampa Bay, told The Huffington Post Monday.“It’s just darn common sense and you have to be able to observe your dog and see,” she said. “If you see your animal shivering, seems cold, it’s OK to put a sweater on him.”Dog whisperer Cesar Millan offers some advice on his website on how to better read a pet’s emotions by its physical gestures.“Dogs can’t tell us in words what they’re thinking and feeling because they don’t have to. They’re expressing themselves constantly through body language,” he advises.“The important parts to watch are the head, ears, tail, and back. The higher these are, the more dominant a dog is feeling, and the lower they are, the more submissive or uncertain her feelings. Look also for tension in the dog’s body, particularly in the back and legs. The more tense a dog is, the higher its energy level,” he states.This story has been updated to include Sherry Silk’s interview."

He said the typecasting never bothered him.“Actors always expect that their job will end and then they are out of work,” he told PennLive in 2009. “It’s a lot more fun to be working than to be out of work.”Although it was a comedy set during the Korean War, “M.A.S.H.” was often viewed as a commentary on the Vietnam War and other serious topics during the tumultuous 1970s.“M.A.S.H. in its development of course began to deal with social issues,” Christopher said in 1983. “We all felt that the things we were able to touch on were meaningful in the way of social issues.”Christopher also took on a visible role in a social issue off the air, becoming an advocate for autistic children at a time when the condition received little public attention. He and his wife, Barbara, wrote about raising their autistic son, Ned, in the 1989 book Mixed Blessings. Christopher is survived by his wife and two sons, Ned and John.Fans remembered the actor on Twitter: "

When a commenter asked him, “Aren’t you an atheist?” he responded: “No. I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important.”He didn’t provide details about his faith. The title of his holiday greeting on Facebook was “celebrating Christmas.” He and wife Priscilla Chan met with Pope Francis at the Vatican last summer and discussed how to bring communication technology to the world’s poor. Zuckerberg said at the time that he was impressed with the pope’s compassion.“We told him how much we admire his message of mercy and tenderness, and how he’s found new ways to communicate with people of every faith around the world,” Zuckerberg posted. “It was a meeting we’ll never forget.

Three cameras offer different angles to bird lovers without disturbing the nest.The first hatchling, dubbed E9, finally emerged Saturday morning after exhausting hours breaking through its eggshell. No movement yet on the second egg. Eagle eggs typically hatch at different times. They were laid Nov. 22 and Nov. 25.Hours of relative inaction have suddenly been spiced up with the appearance of the first fuzzy, chirping eaglet, and 62,000 watchers were glued to the site midday Saturday. The camera was first set up in 2012 and tracked eagles Ozzie and Harriet as Harriet laid two eggs and they raised both hatchlings to fledge — fly for the first time — in 2013. The following year one of two hatchlings died of unknown causes; the same thing happened in 2015. Ozzie was found injured in the wild before the surviving hatchling fledged in May. He was rehabilitated and released back into the wild but died later of further injuries.After checking out other suitable mates, Harriet in October chose M-15, short for Male 2015, and both of their eggs hatched and fledged by spring 2016, though one, E8, had to be nursed back to health by humans after becoming entangled in fishing line. The same eaglet was discovered nearby with a broken leg after the nest was attacked by an owl. Again, E8 was nursed back to health and released into the wild.Bald eagles are usually ready to fledge by 9 to 10 weeks of age, when they’re close to being full grown. They strike out fully on their own by about 6 months.The mortality rate for an eaglet’s first year is greater than 50 percent, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They can be killed in the nest by other eagles fighting for territory, and owls prey on chicks. They can also be felled by environmental toxins, including lead they may ingest eating meat contaminated by bullets. Cars and electrical lines are other hazards, according to the National Eagle Center.“Eagles are wild birds and anything can happen in the wild,” warns the online camera site, run by a local real estate company. “The Southwest Florida Eagle Camera does not interfere or intervene and allows nature to take its course. You will see life and you might see death, but this is nature at her finest.”"

Eight years of Obama foreign policy has proven to be incoherent and disjointed and has left the region in disarray, with Russian power and influence ascendant. That point was driven home when Russia, Iran and Turkey met in Moscow on December 20, to settle the latest attempt at a Syrian ceasefire. The fact that such a meeting occurred without the participation of the United States underscored the growing irrelevance of Washington in resolving the Syrian civil war. This is the third attempt in the last 12 months at implementing a ceasefire between Damascus and the various Syrian rebel groups. It will likely prove to be as short lived as its predecessors. There is no shortage of issues destabilizing the Middle East, but addressing seven macro issues will form the core of any new U.S. policy in the region. These seven issues are: the Iranian/Shia challenge, economic instability from low oil prices, the political stability of Egypt and its role in the larger Middle East, especially in North Africa, Russia's current role in the region, the emergence of Turkey as a rogue actor, the civil/proxy wars in Syria, Libya and Yemen and, finally, the ongoing battle against jihadism in general and the Islamic State (IS) in particular.Iran has emerged as a regional power in the Middle East. It has used its location on the Persian Gulf and the Strait to Hormuz to leverage its position by demonstrating its ability to disrupt oil tanker traffic moving through the Gulf. Such actions would bring it into conflict with U.S. naval forces in the area. While Tehran does not have comparable naval power, it has tried to show that the use of large numbers of lightly armed small craft, some of which would be maritime IEDs, in swarm tactics, could disable larger ships. In addition, Iran has positioned itself as the defender of Shia minorities throughout the Middle East, especially in the Gulf, and has tried to mobilize those minorities as a means of expanding its influence in the region. That policy has led Tehran to get much further involved in the Syrian, Iraqi and Yemenite civil wars and to project its military power elsewhere in the Middle East. The challenge for the United States is to find a way of containing Iranian ambitions. The partial dismantling of the sanctions against Iran has enhanced Tehran's ability to project its power and influence in the region and to gain access to essential technology to upgrade its industry, especially its petroleum sector. The much-vaunted opening to Iran by the Obama administration has so far proven to be an illusion. Tehran has shown little interest in engaging with Washington. While the incoming Trump administration may opt to impose new sanctions on Tehran or tighten the existing ones, there is little prospect that the rest of the world will follow suit. The ""Iranian nuclear agreement"" is now part of the new reality in the Middle East and is not reversible. At best, President Obama's policy toward Iran may have deferred Tehran's ability to field nuclear weapons. Even that accomplishment is suspect, however, and assumes that Iran was relatively close to developing a nuclear capability. There is considerable evidence that Tehran was nowhere close to having such a potential. In which case, the Obama led P5+1 agreement to regulate Iran's attempt to develop nuclear weapons means that Tehran gave up something it didn't have in return for the lifting of the sanctions and access to Western markets and technology. What Washington wants is a regional, secular, Sunni coalition that can counterbalance Tehran's Shia arc of influence that currently stretches across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Gaza. To date, however, no such alliance has emerged and there is little prospect of one. The previous player to fill this roll, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, disappeared when U.S. forces overthrew Hussein and Iraq's Shia majority took control of the country. The U.S. has supplied advanced weaponry to Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies, but those countries lack the population and armed forces to present a sufficient counter to Iranian power. The two countries that do have the military strength to present a sufficient counter to Tehran have very different agendas. Cairo is reluctant to get involved in the Gulf. Foreign deployments of its military have proven disasterous in the past and are highly unpopular with Egyptians. Turkey, under its president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has broader ambitions to expand Turkish influence and to lead the Sunnis in the region. But many Sunni Arabs are reluctant to follow Turkish leadership. A third long shot is Pakistan. The Saudi's have tried to get Pakistan to play a broader role in the Gulf. Islamabad has enough problems on its hands, however, without being drawn into a broader Sunni-Shia rivalry. The danger from the U.S. standpoint is that the Saudis and their allies resort to organizing and funding various jihadist groups to counter Tehran's ambitions in much the same way that Pakistan has resorted to such groups in Kashmir in its struggle with India, and as happened in Syria during the civil war. While this strategy may be successful in countering Iranian ambitions in the short-term, it does so at the risk of expanding jihadist influence in the region and risks spilling over into anti-Western violence in Europe and North America.Iranian missile testThe price of oil has become a major source of financial instability in the Sunni led petro-states along the Gulf. At current prices, all the major oil producers are unable to balance their governmental budgets and have been forced to dip into their reserves. In Saudi Arabia's case, the government's current deficit amounts to 16 percent of GNP, and Riyadh is moving aggressively to cut expenses and intends to reduce the deficit to 11 percent of GNP in 2017. A recent agreement which, for the first time, also included production cutbacks from non-OPEC members, has given oil prices a bounce. This agreement is unlikely to produce a sustained price increase however. Rising production in Libya, which was exempt from the agreement, will already offset a quarter or more of the announced cut. Moreover, improvements in fracking technology in the U.S. have brought the breakeven price for frackers down to the low $30s. The U.S. rig count has been rising steadily over the last few months. The expected opening of federal lands to fracking and the easing of federal regulations will likely lead to an increase in U.S. production over the next several years. Long-term, a 1.2 million barrel a day production cutback is not going to move prices in a meaningful way.The risk is that these governments will drastically scale back the financial largess that has ensured domestic peace and stability. Short-term, three to five years, these countries have the financial resources to weather the storm. Long-term, however, they will need oil prices, at a minimum, to be $100 per barrel to cover their deficits and stabilize their economies. Low oil prices will become a major source of instability in the Sunni petro-states, one that Tehran will be quick to exploit. Egypt could play a critical role in the Middle East, should it chose to do so. Short-term, Cairo needs to stabilize the Egyptian economy. Tourism, Egypt's third largest economic sector, is down by around 40 percent. The slowdown in the Gulf has also impacted remittances from Egyptians working there while also decreasing demand in a key Egyptian export market. The strained relations between Cairo and Washington have not gone unnoticed by either Tehran or Moscow, and both have been quick to try to exploit it. Moreover, the Muslim Brotherhood has also tried to exploit Egypt's current economic weakness to restore its political influence there.Egypt has a key role in stabilizing North Africa, especially Libya, and countering the spread of jihadist influence there. Washington needs to move quickly to repair its relationship with Cairo, help Egypt stabilize its economy, and to support Cairo's role in counter-jihadist activity, both domestically and across north and central Africa. The Kremlin has taken advantage of the incoherence and indecision of Obama's Mideast policy to expand its role and influence there. To be clear, despite its pretentions Russia is not a superpower and never again will be, its nuclear arsenal notwithstanding. It is, however, a super problem for Washington in the Middle East. Its success in expanding its Middle East role is more illusion than substance. Its ability to project power across the Middle East is limited, nor is it able to challenge the United States militarily in the region. It can, however, complicate the conduct of U.S. policy in the Mideast and play the role of a spoiler.By concentrating its efforts on ensuring the survival of the Assad regime, however, and leveraging Iranian power and influence toward the same goal, the Kremlin has made it clear that it will stand by its Mideast clients. Recently, Moscow has been moving aggressively to back Libyan Field Marshall Khalifa Hiftar in an obvious attempt to restore its influence in Libya, another former Soviet client state. That position is in sharp contrast to the ambivalence the Obama White House has shown in standing by America's Mideast allies. US Secretary of State John Kerry meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Russia is now a player in the Middle East. While it's not as influential as it claims, its interests in the region cannot be ignored. Moreover, it will continue to exploit U.S. mistakes to expand its influence and possibly flip or at least ""Finlandize"" long-standing American allies like Egypt and possibly even Turkey. The best way to counter Russian influence in the Mideast is to have a clear and consistent U.S. policy that makes our continued support of our allies there clear, is precise about when we will or will not intervene militarily and insures that any such intervention has precise goals and is executed effectively. Russia will succeed in stabilizing the Assad regime, will probably expand its influence in Libya and it can engage to a limited extent with Saudi Arabia and its allies to try to stabilize and raise oil prices. Beyond that, a skillful American policy will likely preempt any future expansion of Russian influence. The Kremlin can leverage Tehran's power and influence for its own ends, like supporting Assad in Syria, but long-term a powerful Iran is not in Russia's strategic interest. On at least this point there is possible common ground between Washington and Moscow.Turkey, a long-standing American ally, has under its president Recep Tayyip Erdogan increasingly behaved as a rogue actor in the region. Erdogan is attempting to build a broad Sunni coalition to counter Iran, but is couching it in the context of a restoration of Turkish influence in the lands of the former Ottoman Empire. Moreover, he is defining that coalition in Islamist and anti-Western terms. Erdogan's assertion that Turkey has a ""responsibility to its brothers in the former Ottoman empire"" is popular among his constituents, but has gotten little traction among Arabs in the region. Moreover, Ankara's willingness to support radical jihadist groups including, for a brief time the Islamic State, and turning a blind eye to the role of Turkish companies in facilitating the smuggling and sale of contraband oil and stolen antiquities from IS, puts it at sharp odds with U.S. policy in the region and has led to a sharp deterioration in Ankara's relations with Washington and the European Union. This is particularly true of Erdogan's attempts to use the Syrian refugees to leverage more favorable terms from the EU for Turkey and its citizens.Erdogan's arrest or dismissal of individuals that he claims were supporters of the failed coup now exceeds 110,000 Turkish citizens. He has used the coup attempt to purge the government, courts and military of any potential opposition and to close media outlets that criticized him. If Erdogan continues along his current track, his actions will amount to a counterrevolution of the Ataturk led revolution that established the modern secular Turkish state. Turkey has two significant vulnerabilities, however. First the Turkish economy is dependent on access to European markets and capital. Secondly, its flirtations with Moscow, notwithstanding, long-term Russian and Turkish interests are divergent. Russia is still the principal security threat to Turkey and, despite the Turkish military; Ankara will need allies if it finds itself confronting Russia. Erdogan's foreign policy is largely failing and is doing so at a time when Turkey's economic weakness makes it dangerous to alienate the EU or the United States.The civil wars in Syria and Yemen have become Shia-Sunni proxy wars, ones in which the success of neither side is in Washington's interest. In Yemen, the U.S. is providing intelligence and logistical support to the largely Saudi led effort, while Iran is supplying the Shia related Houthis. The U.S. has wisely avoided a deeper entanglement in Yemen. Houthi elements have attacked, no doubt under Iranian instruction, U.S. warships in the region to either force a U.S. withdrawal or an escalated U.S. involvement, either one of which would be in Tehran's interest. Washington does not want to see a pro-Iranian regime in the southwest corner of the Arabian Peninsula on the flank of the Red Sea, but it has little to gain from an expanded American role there.American involvement in the Syrian civil war was initially prompted to contain the expansion of the Islamic State and then, in a typical example of mission creep, grew into a half-hearted effort to support the Syrian rebels and overthrow the Assad regime. The premise was that the U.S. would arm and train ""moderate"" elements within the anti-Assad opposition while supporting their campaign with airpower. Islamic State jihadist fighters in Mosul, June 2014 The idea that there were ""moderate elements"" within the Syrian opposition or that these could be identified and organized into a coherent group proved to be illusory. Likewise, the role of U.S. air power was so constrained by restrictive rules of engagement that only a quarter of the missions delivered their payloads. Notwithstanding a haphazard policy, the U.S. and its allies have succeeded in rolling back the Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq. In Syria, the largely Kurdish led and staffed Syrian Democratic Forces has emerged as an American proxy ground force. Supported by U.S. airpower and Special Forces, the SDF has succeeded in expelling IS from large areas of Syria. Turkish opposition to the role of Syrian Kurds in the SDF and to a separate Syrian-Kurdish state, the so called Rojava, however, has led the U.S. to forego supplying heavy weapons to the SDF and to constrain the areas where the SDF operates. In Iraq, U.S. supported Iraqi Army units and Peshmerga forces, in collaboration with regional Sunni militias and the Iranian sponsored Shia militias, have also successively rolled back the Islamic State and are now invading Mosul - IS's last major urban center there. The battle for Mosul will be bitterly fought street-by-street. Mosul is a city roughly the size of Houston, Texas. Its prewar population was approximately two million people. Its current population is unclear and has been estimated at anywhere from 400,000 to one million inhabitants. The Battle for Mosul will be the biggest urban battle since Stalingrad, a city that was only one-fifth of Mosul's size.While the United States has made notable progress against the Islamic State, it is losing the war against jihadism. Both al-Qaeda and Islamic State have successfully expanded their franchises to some 50 countries around the world. The al-Qaeda sponsored Jabhat al-Sham (Conquest of Syria Front), the former al-Nusra Front, is well positioned to inherit IS's jihadist mantle. Moreover, despite U.S. success in rolling back Islamic State, that campaign will likely still take an additional one to two years of effort. Even stripped of its territorial domain, however, Islamic State will continue. Its foreign franchises will survive, and in Syria and Iraq it will simply revert to its earlier role as a jihadist insurgency. The problem with combatting jihadism is that it has become a seductive, emotionally charged, powerful idea and it's impossible to defeat an idea with military force. You can only defeat an idea with a ""better idea,"" an effort that Washington has failed to pursue. You cannot separate jihadism from its Islamic roots, even if most Muslims reject the jihadist interpretation of Islam. A ""better idea"" also must have Islamic foundations, a concept that the Obama administration has been unwilling to address on the premise that linking jihadists and Islam is inherently racist. Ultimately jihadism must be defeated both intellectually and physically. It needs to be defeated in cyberspace and social media just as surely as it needs to be defeated on the battlefield. Two decades of Mideast policy have amply demonstrated that the US cannot reshape the region's politics and governments to its liking. It still has a role to play there, however, has considerable influence and retains the ability to intervene militarily to contain the spread of violence that is destabilizing the region. The latter is an important role, but one that it should use very selectively and with the utmost prudence. These seven topics are only some of the issues that currently divide the Middle East. They are, however, the most important and must form the core of any new strategy. They need to be addressed in a systematic and comprehensive fashion if we want a coherent policy in the Middle East."

Likewise, the role of U.S. air power was so constrained by restrictive rules of engagement that only a quarter of the missions delivered their payloads. Notwithstanding a haphazard policy, the U.S. and its allies have succeeded in rolling back the Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq. In Syria, the largely Kurdish led and staffed Syrian Democratic Forces has emerged as an American proxy ground force. Supported by U.S. airpower and Special Forces, the SDF has succeeded in expelling IS from large areas of Syria. Turkish opposition to the role of Syrian Kurds in the SDF and to a separate Syrian-Kurdish state, the so called Rojava, however, has led the U.S. to forego supplying heavy weapons to the SDF and to constrain the areas where the SDF operates. In Iraq, U.S. supported Iraqi Army units and Peshmerga forces, in collaboration with regional Sunni militias and the Iranian sponsored Shia militias, have also successively rolled back the Islamic State and are now invading Mosul - IS's last major urban center there. The battle for Mosul will be bitterly fought street-by-street. Mosul is a city roughly the size of Houston, Texas. Its prewar population was approximately two million people. Its current population is unclear and has been estimated at anywhere from 400,000 to one million inhabitants. The Battle for Mosul will be the biggest urban battle since Stalingrad, a city that was only one-fifth of Mosul's size.While the United States has made notable progress against the Islamic State, it is losing the war against jihadism. Both al-Qaeda and Islamic State have successfully expanded their franchises to some 50 countries around the world. The al-Qaeda sponsored Jabhat al-Sham (Conquest of Syria Front), the former al-Nusra Front, is well positioned to inherit IS's jihadist mantle. Moreover, despite U.S. success in rolling back Islamic State, that campaign will likely still take an additional one to two years of effort. Even stripped of its territorial domain, however, Islamic State will continue. Its foreign franchises will survive, and in Syria and Iraq it will simply revert to its earlier role as a jihadist insurgency. The problem with combatting jihadism is that it has become a seductive, emotionally charged, powerful idea and it's impossible to defeat an idea with military force. You can only defeat an idea with a ""better idea,"" an effort that Washington has failed to pursue. You cannot separate jihadism from its Islamic roots, even if most Muslims reject the jihadist interpretation of Islam. A ""better idea"" also must have Islamic foundations, a concept that the Obama administration has been unwilling to address on the premise that linking jihadists and Islam is inherently racist. Ultimately jihadism must be defeated both intellectually and physically. It needs to be defeated in cyberspace and social media just as surely as it needs to be defeated on the battlefield. Two decades of Mideast policy have amply demonstrated that the US cannot reshape the region's politics and governments to its liking. It still has a role to play there, however, has considerable influence and retains the ability to intervene militarily to contain the spread of violence that is destabilizing the region. The latter is an important role, but one that it should use very selectively and with the utmost prudence. These seven topics are only some of the issues that currently divide the Middle East. They are, however, the most important and must form the core of any new strategy. They need to be addressed in a systematic and comprehensive fashion if we want a coherent policy in the Middle East."

Photographed by Danielle RuedaSteve Jobs and Leo Tolstoy shared a surprising creative belief. The simplest things are the hardest to master. ""You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make something simple,"" said Jobs. This fall, in the heart of San Francisco, a Menswear Styling class has been working on a project unlike any other in the industry: reinventing the classic white button-down. Except this isn't an ordinary school project but a collaboration between the iconic US retailer GANT and the Academy of Art University School of Fashion. This unique engagement marked the first time the brand has partnered with an educational institution. The one-of- a-kind incentive is having their work showcased at the GANT flagship store in San Francisco. What a great experience! GANT ""Oxford Fitted Shirt"" styled by Teresa Tran, modeled by Red Thompson, makeup by Sean Stahl. Photographed by Vince AungEleven senior styling students were given a GANT shirt and the liberty to reinterpret it for a lookbook. The only direction was to focus on the versatility of the garment without having it resemble another line. Every step of the process was in the hands of the students. In an interview with Fashion School Daily, the Assistant Director of Styling in the School of Fashion, Flore Morton stated that she ""wanted students to build full stories, investigate brands, and think like designers."" The students turned for inspiration to the brand's stylish present and captivating heritage. GANT ""Oxford Fitted Shirt"" styled by Nhu Dao, modeled by Red Thomspon, makeup by Thu Conteras, Hair by Stuart Wong. Photographed by Gyuho ParkGANT was founded in 1949 in New Haven, Connecticut. It has since expanded globally beyond menswear into other market segments creating a name for itself as a premier lifestyle brand with aims to increase its reach by 2020 under the new direction of global CEO Patrik Nilsson. GANT has originally been associated with effortless Ivy League style and quality tailored shirts. In addition to the classic sportswear heritage GANT line they've also launched GANT Diamond G and GANT Rugger, contemporary lines reflecting diverse aesthetics.

Tolstoy argued that ""the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him."" Students had to start from a clean slate. Fangdi Li opted to use the GANT Rugger Indigo denim shirt for her nocturnal vision: draping of the shirt on the body in a linear way over a black hoodie for a restructured silhouette. Teresa Tran kept the focus on layering possibilities. She infused vintage pieces with the GANT shirt that was accented with accessories influenced by the subcultures of the film ""This is England"". Sophia Charles drew inspiration from the GANT Instagram account and the French film ""La Haine"" for her minimalist yet bold version accessorized with electric red tape. Overall, the results showcased GANT adaptability and immense talent of the Academy students.

It seems like a natural fit for the school and the brand, both of whom focus on quality, innovation and laying a foundation for a more fashionable future. This pioneering collaboration also benefited Fashion Journalism students who were assigned to follow the process closely and report on it via various outlets. Stephan Rabimov, director of Social Media Center and Fashion Journalism, commented: ""Opportunities like this benefit all involved. Our students loved working with GANT.

Both railed at the Obama administration's abstention on a UN Security Council resolution condemning Jewish settlements on the Arab West Bank. Neither leader is and was a friend of President Obama.The United States action allowed the resolution to be adopted by a 14-0 vote.Trump has been vicious towards Obama, starting with the lie that he was born in Kenya and did not deserve to be president. Netanyahu ruined his credit by addressing Congress on the Iran deal without consulting Obama and siding with Obama's opponents in at least one election. And Trump...well, he put forth an ambassador, David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer who favors the settlements and is against two states. So much for solving the impasse. But is there such a thing as a two-state solution? Even with land swaps, there are over half a million settlers living in the West Bank and in the mainly Arab section of East Jerusalem. Some settlers envision Egypt taking back the Gaza Strip and then annexing the West Bank. The settlers' goal is clear, according to Secretary of State John Kerry, which is to place settlements in places that would make ""two states impossible"" and allow Israel to dominate the entire West Bank. As for Netanyahu, the prime minister has given lip service to two states but seems to be apprehensive of losing support from the far right. For one, Israel vowed to expand its settlements, starting with the Arab section of East Jerusalem, with at least 5,600 homes. It is considering controversial legislation, known as the Regulation Bill, that would retroactively legalize settler outposts and homes built on privately owned Palestinian land, forcing the owners to accept compensation. This contradicts an earlier Supreme Court ruling and may be overturned. Conspiracy? Among other actions threatened was that Netanyahu would tell Trump how the Obama administration had conspired with the Palestinians on the resolution, which had been drawn up by Egypt for weeks. Trump had contacted Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Sisi, who delayed the vote.But New Zealand, Senegal, Malaysia and Venezuela then sponsored the resolution. Netanyahu threatened New Zealand and cut aid to Senegal. New Zealand's respected ambassador, Gerard Van Bohemen, has denied that the United States had orchestrated the resolution. Then on Christmas Day Netanyahu summoned 12 ambassadors, including Britain, who voted for the resolution, according to the Haaretz newspaper. He also spoke to the U.S. ambassador. (Israel does not have formal relations with Malaysia and Venezuela.)Science fiction? Promises by U.S. legislators to ""rescind"" or ""appeal"" the resolution fail to understand that measures in the 15-nation Security Council are extremely difficult to retract, if at all. The other four permanent members with veto power -- Russia, China, Britain and France would object. In fact no country in the world would agree with an appeal. In short, such a measure is science fiction.Palestinians of course have missed their chance for a resolution of the conflict. The government is stuck with Hamas in Gaza, which brooks no compromise. In past decades, the leadership failed to negotiate several times before Netanyahu came to power and now has preconditions, including a freeze on settlements.Within Israel, there is a lively debate on the issue from the center and the center left. For example, Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, said Netanyahu was engaging in ""hysterical behaviour"" and warned of a ""dangerous deterioration"" in Israel's foreign relations, including with the ""largest world powers and some of our best friends.""Tzipi Livni, a former Israeli foreign minister and a leader of the center-left Zionist Union, wrote on Facebook, ""The Security Council decision is bad for Israel and it is the result of Netanyahu's surrender to the extreme right.""Schlomo Avineri, a political science professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem agreed, saying: ""He (Netanyahu) has to choose between the international community and (Naftali) Bennett,"" of the rightwing Jewish Home Party, which favors outright annexation.  ""Is Israel going to alienate itself from the whole world for the sake of settlement activity? And it is the whole world. Is this what Zionisim is about?"" he said.What did the resolution do? It was adopted under Chapter 6 of the U.N. Charter which calls for the peaceful resolution of disputes and has no enforcement mechanism compared to Chapter 7 which is mandatory and can impose punishment. But for Israel it is embarrassing and the Palestinians are bound to use it in other UN forums. It is expected to serve as a judgment of international law and have legal validity. (See text)U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power's speech is worth reading in full. She said many U.S. administrations had opposed the settlements as an obstacle to peace. Power said the United States chose not to veto the resolution, as it had done to a similar measure under Mr. Obama in 2011, because settlement building had accelerated so much that it had put the two-state solution in jeopardy, and because the peace process had gone nowhere.""Today the Security Council reaffirmed its established consensus that settlements have no legal validity,"" she said. Power said the resolution was consistent with longstanding bipartisan American policy. She voiced opposition to irresponsible and damaging actions, including Palestinian incitement. Anti-Israel resolutions But she said she could not vote in favor of the text because she disagreed with some of its provisions and that the United Nations was biased against Israel. Despite wars in Syria, South Sudan and elsewhere there were 18 anti-Israeli (non-binding) resolutions adopted in the General Assembly and 12 in the Human Rights Council in 2016.Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon, holding a bible, harked back to biblical times. Facing fellow ambassadors, he asked: Would you have dared to question the right to build in Paris? In Beijing? In London? In Washington? Jerusalem was Israel's eternal capitol. Should Trump move away from the two-state concept, supporters of the settlements, such as Bennett, would consider it a green light for expanding the communities. So far that seems to be happening.

As former MySpace CEO Mike Jones said, it's hard to define the millennials. Whether you love them or not, you can't ignore them. As things are little tougher for millennials than their Baby Boomer parents, they are often described as lazy and self-centered generation that desires reward with minimal effort, and has unrealistic expectation of working life. However, they have experienced more innovative and evolving technology than ever before, giving them unique and distinctive characteristics.And they create a new economy, media, and lifestyle. 'Lazy narcissists.' Millennials are the creators of this age. ▲ New media economy- Social networking service and power bloggersSocial media-based services such as Facebook and Instagram have become megatrends in the millennial generation. A social networking service (SNS), where you can share your lifestyle with others and communicate with each other in real time, is a must-have personal item in the 21st century.A recent study conducted by Kantar TNS surveying the online behaviors of 70,000 people across 57 countries revealed that the use of Instagram and Snapchat rose to 42% and 23% respectively, up from 24% and 12% in 2014. The Asia-Pacific region is led by Naver's LINE with global usage jumping to 91% in Taiwan, 92% in Thailand, and 31% in Japan.  [Snapchat and Instagram penetration in Asia Pacific / Source: Kantar TNS]  [Snapchat and Instagram penetration in Asia Pacific from 2014 to 2016/ Source: Kantar TNS]Along with LINE, KakaoTalk and WeChat focused on expanding to Asian countries, creating a rival tension with WhatsApp and Facebook messengers. They lead the market in a variety of ways that connect with consumers through a platform strategy that delivers content and services beyond mere functions. The social networks that millennials use have higher growth rate than conventional industry-based companies. They expand business and receive investment based on an enormous number of users across the continent. Their user data is the most important growth engine for them.As a result, power bloggers, who run their own blog or social media accounts, have emerged and their role has expanded. China's ""Wang Hong"" marketing is now widely used in many other countries. Wang Hong refers to online power users who have a lot of fans, and they have recently become stars of China's e-commerce industry as the products used and recommended by Wang Hong create a strong advertising effect, leading greater sales. Not only they promote and sell products, but also get involved in launching a new product.

However, there have been 185 IPOs in the technology sector, leading to unprecedented growth. In particular, Asia-Pacific region continued their busy activity with 638 IPOs, which accounts for 60% of total global IPOs by volume.

[The logo of Snapchat displayed above Times Square in New York./ Source: Wikimedia]Snapchat, one of the most popular mobile video messaging and social media apps on the market, is inching closer to an initial public offering. If Snapchat goes public, it would be valued between about $20 billion and $30 billion, making it the biggest US tech IPO since Facebook's public debut in 2012.Naver's LINE, which boasts 218 million global monthly users, made a successful IPO debut on July 15 in New York and Tokyo. On the first day in Tokyo, LINE closed at 4,345 yen, 32% above the initial public offering price. The market capitalization reached 921.4 billion yen. The IPO raised 1.5 trillion won, making it the year's biggest tech IPO. LINE's users are mainly in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. China's popular selfie app Meitu chose the Hong Kong stock market. The IPO raised $629 million, the biggest by a technology company in Hong Kong since Alibaba. The company now has a valuation of $4.6 billion.- A new renaissance for startupsThe ever-evolving information technology (IT) becomes the driving force of all the economies that millennials create. ""Asian startups are going through a renaissance,"" said Vishal Harnal, 500 Startup partner. China and India are one of the biggest tech start-up hotspots in the world. The number of new startups coming out of China's Silicon Valley rose to 2.61 million in the first half of 2016, a 28.6% jump from 2015. India has more than 4,200 start-ups. The number of start-ups in India is expected to triple to 12,000 by 2020. Startup funding totaled about $6.5 billion in 2015, tripling from $2.2 billion in the previous year.Southeast Asia is a new frontier in the digital economy. Its digital economy is expected to reach $200 by 2023, making it a popular investment spot for foreign venture capitalists. 500 Startup expanded its Southeast Asia start-up investment by launching the '500 Durian II' fund in 2015. The Middle East is keeping up as well. Saudi Arabia showed its Silicon Desert ambition as it prepares itself for the end of oil. Back in October, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund announced its plans to team up with Japanese IT and telecommunications giant SoftBank to launch a new tech fund, dubbed the SoftBank Vision Fund, that will manage as much as $100 billion. ▲ New money economy- Intangible currencyMillennials, who are poorer than their parents, are building a new money economy by taking advantage of social commerce benefited by technology. Mobile payments are growing fast as they provide cheaper price than offline market, fast delivery and spread of smartphones, gearing towards a cashless society. Millennials don't have to deal with notes and coins thanks to mobile cards. They also get payment points that provide special benefits. The function of real cash has virtually disappeared. As a result, Southeast Asia rather than East Asia, which underwent traditional web-based e-commerce economy, is emerging as an attractive market as it is introducing social commerce economy.  [Retail e-commerce sales in select countries in Southeast Asia, 2016 (unit: billions dollar). Source: eMarketer (left) / Bitcoin. Source: Pixabay (right)] According to market researcher eMarketer, social commerce in Southeast Asia accounts for 30% of total digital sales. In particular, total social commerce sales for six markets in the region - Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines - reached $14 billion last year. It is expected to show double-digit growth over the next four years. - Virtual currency BitcoinVirtual currency Bitcoin is a major achievement of the new money economy. With the trading being reached around $11.7 billion in value, Bitcoin is in the center of the new money economy.According to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the November trading volume reached 174.1 million bitcoins, the highest level ever, surpassing the 148.6 million bitcoins of the March trading volume. The transaction value was about 15 trillion yen. China is a major bitcoin trading country, with the major three bitcoin exchanges representing some 90% of the global trading volume. Bitcoins with new technologies are coming out one after another. South Korea will see its first virtual currency based on blockchain system by February. The new digital currency called BOScoin, which, it claims, is an improved version of existing virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. ▲ Sharing economyThe birth of 'sharing economy' eventually began with poverty. The term, which refers to short-term labor in the digital market, emerged globally due to its advantage of earning income in a short period of time for millennials who suffer from lack of full-time jobs, creating a new concept. The fruition came from start-ups. The success of Uber and Airbnb sparked new markets such as office-sharing, store-sharing, and house-sharing markets emerged. Now the sharing economy has generated heated controversy as it can lead to more precarious jobs and induce unfair competition. However, it is in the growth phase. China's Didi Chuxing that defeated Uber in China, and the birth of second Uber such as Grab, Ola, and Go-Jek is still ongoing. And they evolve and adapt to local conditions.The Philippines, which is made up of thousands of archipelagos, has a local player named Xend that relies on motorcycles and boats. Indonesia has Go-Jek that rearranged the logistics industry. India's Grab provides customized service with cash payments.  [Uber and Airbnb/ Source: Wikipedia] - Trusting strangersAnd there is trust. The key of the sharing economy is putting your trust in complete strangers. The intangible trust built on digital platform has become a brand itself and new economy. In the end, they've been communicating with us through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other types of social media. You buy things through e-commerce websites, and communicate on Facebook. You use Uber to take a ride and book a place on Airbnb. The digital platform is a commerce society that creates intangible money to share with others. Trust in strangers itself has become a value chain."

As former MySpace CEO Mike Jones said, it's hard to define the millennials. Whether you love them or not, you can't ignore them. As things are little tougher for millennials than their Baby Boomer parents, they are often described as lazy and self-centered generation that desires reward with minimal effort, and has unrealistic expectation of working life. However, they have experienced more innovative and evolving technology than ever before, giving them unique and distinctive characteristics.And they create a new economy, media, and lifestyle. 'Lazy narcissists.' Millennials are the creators of this age. ▲ New media economy- Social networking service and power bloggersSocial media-based services such as Facebook and Instagram have become megatrends in the millennial generation. A social networking service (SNS), where you can share your lifestyle with others and communicate with each other in real time, is a must-have personal item in the 21st century.A recent study conducted by Kantar TNS surveying the online behaviors of 70,000 people across 57 countries revealed that the use of Instagram and Snapchat rose to 42% and 23% respectively, up from 24% and 12% in 2014. The Asia-Pacific region is led by Naver's LINE with global usage jumping to 91% in Taiwan, 92% in Thailand, and 31% in Japan.  [Snapchat and Instagram penetration in Asia Pacific / Source: Kantar TNS]  [Snapchat and Instagram penetration in Asia Pacific from 2014 to 2016/ Source: Kantar TNS]Along with LINE, KakaoTalk and WeChat focused on expanding to Asian countries, creating a rival tension with WhatsApp and Facebook messengers. They lead the market in a variety of ways that connect with consumers through a platform strategy that delivers content and services beyond mere functions. The social networks that millennials use have higher growth rate than conventional industry-based companies. They expand business and receive investment based on an enormous number of users across the continent. Their user data is the most important growth engine for them.As a result, power bloggers, who run their own blog or social media accounts, have emerged and their role has expanded. China's ""Wang Hong"" marketing is now widely used in many other countries. Wang Hong refers to online power users who have a lot of fans, and they have recently become stars of China's e-commerce industry as the products used and recommended by Wang Hong create a strong advertising effect, leading greater sales. Not only they promote and sell products, but also get involved in launching a new product.

We have briefed state officials and will support the investigation fully.”The Department of Homeland Security alerted utilities on Thursday night about a malware code used in Grizzly Steppe, the Burlington Electric Department said.“We acted quickly to scan all computers in our system for the malware signature. We detected the malware in a single Burlington Electric Department laptop not connected to our organization’s grid systems,” it said.The matched malware code on the laptop may have resulted from a relatively benign episode, such as visiting a questionable website, a source familiar with the matter said, suggesting Russian hackers may not have been directly involved.It was not clear when the incident occurred.On Thursday, President Barack Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian suspected spies and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies over their involvement in hacking U.S. political groups in the 2016 presidential election.The statement came after a Washington Post report that Russian hackers penetrated a Vermont utility. Government and utility industry officials regularly monitor the nation’s electrical grid because it is highly computerized and any disruptions can have disastrous implications for the functioning of medical and emergency services, the Post said.A senior Obama administration official said the administration had sought in its sanctions announcement on Thursday to alert “all network defenders” in the United States so they could “defend against Russian malicious cyber activity.”The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“This intrusion by itself was a minor incident that caused no damage,” a U.S. intelligence official familiar with the incident and critical of Russian actions said on Friday night.“However, we are taking it seriously because it has been tracked to familiar entities involved in a much broader and government-directed campaign in cyberspace and because the electric grid is a vulnerable and interconnected part of the nation’s critical infrastructure,” the official said.Russia is widely considered responsible by U.S. officials and private-sector security experts for a December 2015 hack of Ukraine’s power grid that knocked out the lights for about 250,000 people. That hack prompted National Security Agency chief Mike Rogers to say at a conference in March that it was a “matter of when, not if” a cyber adversary carried out a similar attack against the United States.(Reporting by Eric Beech, Jeff Mason, Dustin Volz and John Walcott; Editing by Michael Perry)"

That tradition, though, was broken during the campaign by Trump, who largely refused to allow members of the press to travel on his personal jetliner, forcing the use of a second plane.The resulting logistical complications sometimes meant pool reporters ― who often paid thousands of dollars per day for air travel ― were unable to arrive at his campaign events until after he had taken the stage. Trump also refused to take reporters to fundraiser locations. Candidate in both parties had made a practice of this, including releasing information about the hosts, the number of attendees and the amount collected.Not long after the election, Trump went to a New York City restaurant ― with a full Secret Service motorcade ― without notifying his press pool. Reporters on call that evening learned of his visit because of a restaurant patron’s tweet that he was there, and then the reporters scrambled to get there too.Trump was scheduled to attend a New Year’s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night, which, according to a Politico report, has sold 800 tickets at more than $500 each. Unlike political fundraisers for political parties, the profits from the New Year’s Eve party were expected to flow directly to Trump, who owns the hotel.Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told Politico that he was not concerned that ticket buyers might be trying to purchase access to the soon-to-be-president. “This is an annual celebratory event at the private club, like others that have continued to occur since the election. Additionally, the president cannot and does not have a conflict,” Hicks told Politico."

On Friday, the two will be buried at Forest Lawn.PREVIOUSLY: Mother-daughter duo Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher will be buried in a joint funeral service together at the Forest Lawn cemetery in Hollywood Hills, The Huffington Post has confirmed.No date has been set for the private service, but a large public memorial is also being considered. The pair will rest nearby a number of other actors and celebrities, including Bette Davis and Liberace. After experiencing a heart attack onboard a plane, Fisher died last Tuesday at age 60. Just one day later, after helping arrange plans for her daughter’s funeral with son Todd Fisher, Reynolds was rushed to the hospital and died of a stroke at age 84. “She wanted to be with Carrie,” Todd told Variety. A star of old Hollywood, Reynolds’ most notable film appearance is in 1952’s “Singin’ in the Rain,” although she remained in the tabloids for years thanks to continued screen appearances and famous friendships. Her marriage to singer Eddie Fisher produced two children, who both followed in their parents’ showbiz footsteps.But the mother and daughter seemed to have a particular connection.A photo by Lawrence Schiller showing a 6-year-old Fisher watching her mother perform seemed to perfectly depict the pair, and was shared widely following news of their deaths.Their relationship was not always so easy, though ― mother and daughter were often estranged for long periods of time.Raised with all the glitz, glamour, cameras and spotlights of her famous parents, Fisher began experimenting with drugs in her teenage years, and pursuing an acting career only pulled her further into the Hollywood scene. Later, a bipolar diagnosis would provide another hurdle for Fisher.Fisher’s big break came with the first “Star Wars” installment in 1977, released when she was 20. At age 28, she went to rehab for drug abuse; around that time she was also diagnosed with her mental health condition. Fisher translated her memories of this tumultuous time into the loosely biographical Postcards from the Edge, which she later adapted into a movie starring Meryl Streep.Fisher was a staunch and candid advocate for mental healthcare, along with her mother. But Reynolds has admitted that her daughter’s disorder, and struggle with drugs, took a hefty toll. At one point, they didn’t speak for about a decade.After decades of turmoil, however, the two seemed to become closer than ever in their final years. “I would say that Carrie and I have finally found happiness. I admire her strength in survival,” Reynolds told Oprah Winfrey in a 2011 interview largely about her relationship with her daughter.“I’ve had to walk through a lot of my tears, but she was worth it,” Reynolds said.“There’s very few women from her generation who worked like that, who just kept a career going all her life, and raised children, and had horrible relationships, and lost all her money, and got it back again,” Fisher told NPR’s Terry Gross in November. (Reynolds’ three marriages ended contentiously; she declared bankruptcy in 1997 after a casino investment failed.)“I mean, she’s had an amazing life, and she’s someone to admire.”"

Officials spoke of a single attacker but some reports, including on social media, suggested there may have been more.The attack shook NATO member Turkey as it tries to recover from a failed July coup and a series of deadly bombings in cities including Istanbul and the capital Ankara, some blamed on Islamic State and others claimed by Kurdish militants.Security services had been on alert across Europe for new year celebrations following an attack on a Christmas market in Berlin that killed 12 people. Only days ago, an online message from a pro-Islamic State group called for attacks by “lone wolves” on “celebrations, gatherings and clubs.”The Hurriyet newspaper cited witnesses as saying the attackers shouted in Arabic as they opened fire at Reina.“We were having fun. All of a sudden people started to run. My husband said don’t be afraid, and he jumped on me. People ran over me. My husband was hit in three places,” one club-goer, Sinem Uyanik, told the newspaper.“I managed to push through and get out, it was terrible,” she said, describing seeing people soaked in blood.The incident bore echoes of an attack by militant Islamists on Paris’s Bataclan music hall in November 2015 that, along with assaults on bars and restaurants, killed 130 people.Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said 15 or 16 of those killed at Reina were foreigners but only 21 bodies had so far been identified. He told reporters 69 people were in hospital, four of them in critical condition.“A manhunt for the terrorist is underway,” he said.Nationals of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Lebanon, Libya, Israel and Belgium were among those killed, officials said. France said three of its citizens were wounded.Turkey is part of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State and launched an incursion into Syria in August to drive the radical Sunni militants from its borders. It also helped broker a fragile ceasefire in Syria with Russia.“As a nation, we will fight to the end against not just the armed attacks of terror groups, but also against their economic, political and social attacks,” President Tayyip Erdogan said in a written statement.“They are trying to create chaos, demoralize our people, and destabilize our country ... We will retain our cool-headedness as a nation, standing more closely together, and we will never give ground to such dirty games,” he said.There has been no claim of responsibility, but Erdogan linked the attacks to developments in the region where Turkey faces conflict across its frontier in Syria and Iraq. Some three million Syrian refugees currently live on Turkish soil.The Reina club is one of Istanbul’s best known nightspots, popular with locals and foreigners. Some 600 people were thought to have been inside when the gunman shot dead a policeman and civilian at the door, forced his way in and then opened fire.Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin said the attacker used a “long-range weapon” to “brutally and savagely” fire on people, apparently referring to some form of assault rifle.U.S. President Barack Obama, on vacation in Hawaii, expressed condolences and directed his team to offer help to the Turkish authorities, the White House said.“POLICE MOVED IN QUICKLY”Dozens of ambulances and police vehicles were dispatched to the club in Ortakoy, a neighborhood on the city’s European side nestled under one of three bridges crossing the Bosphorus and home to nightclubs, restaurants and art galleries.“I didn’t see who was shooting but heard the gun shots and people fled. Police moved in quickly,” Sefa Boydas, a Turkish soccer player, wrote on Twitter.“My girlfriend was wearing high heels. I lifted her and carried her out on my back,” he said.Hurriyet quoted Reina’s owner, Mehmet Kocarslan, as saying security measures had been taken over the past 10 days after U.S. intelligence reports suggested a possible attack.Turkey faces multiple threats including spillover from the war in Syria. Beside its cross-border campaign against Islamic State, it is fighting Kurdish militants in its southeast.The New Year’s Day attack came five months after a failed military coup, in which more than 240 people were killed, many of them in Istanbul, as rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets in a bid to seize power.More than 100,000 people, including soldiers and police officers, have been sacked or suspended in a subsequent crackdown ordered by Erdogan, raising concern both about civic rights and the effectiveness of Turkey’s security apparatus.On Dec. 28, the Nashir Media Foundation, which backs Islamic State, urged sympathizers to carry out attacks in Europe during the holiday period and to “replace their fireworks with explosive belts and devices, and turn their singing and clapping into weeping and wailing.”A month ago, a spokesman for Islamic State urged supporters to target “the secular, apostate Turkish government.”Turkey has seen repeated attacks in recent weeks. On Dec. 10, two bombs claimed by Kurdish militants exploded outside a soccer stadium in Istanbul, killing 44 people.A car bomb killed at least 13 soldiers and wounded 56 when it ripped through a bus carrying off-duty military personnel in the central city of Kayseri a week later, an attack Erdogan also blamed on Kurdish militants.The Russian ambassador to Turkey was shot dead as he gave a speech in Ankara on Dec. 19 by an off-duty police officer who shouted “Don’t forget Aleppo” and “Allahu Akbar.”In June, around 45 people were killed and hundreds wounded as three suspected Islamic State militants carried out a gun and bomb attack on Istanbul’s main Ataturk airport."

A pro-Islamic State news agency said the target was Shi’ite Muslims, whom the militants regard as apostates.A third blast later in the day killed four people in the eastern New Baghdad district, where a minibus packed with explosives blew up in a busy commercial street, police and medics said. Islamic State has continued to launch attacks in the heavily fortified capital, even after losing most of the northern and western territory it seized in 2014.The recapture of Mosul would probably spell the end for Islamic State’s self-styled caliphate, but the militants would still be capable of fighting a guerrilla-style insurgency in Iraq, and plotting or inspiring attacks on the West.The second phase of a U.S.-backed offensive launched on Thursday following weeks of deadlock has encountered fierce resistance. Conventional U.S. forces deploying more extensively in this phase are now visible very close to the front lines.The third day of the renewed push saw heavy clashes on the southeastern and northern fronts.An army officer deployed in the southeast said there was fierce fighting on the edge of Intisar district on Saturday and advances were slowed by heavy machine gun fire, snipers and rockets attacks by militants entrenched in houses.The officer said Islamic State fighters were firing from houses with white flags raised over the roofs, falsely indicating they are civilians to avoid being targeted by Iraqi forces and coalition airstrikes.“The more we advance the tougher it becomes. The job of differentiating between fake and real houses with civilians inside is becoming more painful to our troops,” he told Reuters by phone.BATTLE FOR MOSULAn elite Interior Ministry unit continued to push on Saturday through the Intisar district, where a U.S.-trained army unit had struggled to advance far after entering the southeast district last month.Heavy gunfire was audible and attack helicopters fired overhead as hundreds of civilians fled their homes, a Reuters cameraman said.In the north, a separate army unit pressed towards the border of Mosul proper after recapturing several outlying villages in the past two days.“There is a battle in Argoob area, which is considered the gateway to Hadba,” Lieutenant Colonel Abbas al-Azawi said by phone, referring to a strategic northern neighborhood.Since the offensive began on Oct. 17, elite forces have retaken a quarter of Mosul in the biggest ground operation there since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said the group would be driven out of Iraq by April.Although the militants are vastly outnumbered, they have embedded themselves among Mosul residents, hindering Iraqi forces who are trying to avoid civilian casualties. Despite food and water shortages, most civilians have stayed in their homes rather than fleeing as had been expected.One resident reached by phone late on Friday said a rocket had landed on a house in the eastern Mithaq district, killing six members of one family.“We have not seen Daesh since the Iraqi forces restarted their offensive,” he told Reuters. “We hear the sounds of large car bombs. Today I heard no fewer than 10 huge explosions.”(Reporting by Kareem Raheem and Ahmed Rasheed; Writing by Stephen Kalin; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Stephen Powell)"

The texts, the messages, the emails — they colonize the life of the individual to the point where he or she eventually breaks down.”It’s unclear how the law will be enforced. Agence France-Presse notes the law doesn’t specify particular sanctions for companies that fail to uphold it.Unsurprisingly, one survey found that around 60 percent of French workers support measures clarifying their rights, with AFP reporting more than a third of them work online outside of business hours on a daily basis.

54,POLITICS,New Poll Underscores Frailty Of U.S. Relationship With Saudi Arabia,Akbar Shahid Ahmed and Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-us-perception-saudi-arabia_us_5866f84ae4b0d9a5945b7d36,President-elect Donald Trump has encouraged rising anti-Saudi sentiment as part of his general message that Muslims should not be trusted.,2016-12-31,Protests calling for tougher moves against Saudi Arabia over Yemen and in support of the Saudi 9/11 bill were a common sight in Washington in 2016.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5867e9511500002e00e9dd91.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Forty-seven percent of Americans think Saudi Arabia, a U.S. partner since the 1940s, is unfriendly or an enemy, according to a new survey conducted by The Huffington Post and YouGov.Voters who supported President-elect Donald Trump are especially wary. While Hillary Clinton voters are split about Saudi Arabia ― 36 percent consider it friendly or an ally, and 38 percent say it’s unfriendly or an enemy ― 59 percent of Trump voters say the nation is unfriendly at best. Americans younger than 30 are the least likely of the age groups surveyed to see it as friendly.The numbers emerge after a year when traditional U.S.-Saudi alignment has looked surprisingly shaky.The kingdom’s U.S.-backed campaign to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemen has become increasingly controversial as awareness spreads about the hundreds of civilians killed by Saudi airstrikes and the way terrorist groups have benefited from the war. Lawmakers, particularly Democrats unhappy with President Barack Obama’s facilitation of the Saudi effort, have sought ways to punish Saudi Arabia, including by signaling growing opposition to arms transfers. (While the Obama administration has halted some weapon shipments, it continues to provide the Saudis and their partners with intelligence and with aerial refueling that enables them to take longer bombing runs.) Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a leader of the movement, has said he wants to speak about more than Yemen ― that he seeks to fully reevaluate the U.S.-Saudi relationship. The majority of senators have yet to publicly adopt that view, but voices that will publicly praise the partnership are rare.A different congressional fight has already resulted in precisely the outcome Saudi Arabia was dreading. In September, Democrats and Republicans united to pass a bill that would allow victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to sue Saudi Arabia ― and then jointly overrode a veto by Obama, who was concerned it could open up the U.S. to litigation abroad.The fight over the legislation, known as the Saudi 9/11 bill, reopened the question of whether Saudi Arabia facilitated the tragedy. Though the Saudis have battled al Qaeda for years and had their reputation cleared by U.S. government investigations (including those 28 pages), congressional leaders chose to score an easy political win that encouraged conspiracy theorists.Prospects for valuable U.S.-Saudi engagement ― including on terrorism, women’s rights and Islamist radicalization ― have since plummeted. Saudi leaders were already frustrated with the U.S. because of Barack Obama’s interest in diplomacy with their rival Iran and his perceived under-appreciation of their support for U.S. strategy abroad. After the slight from Capitol Hill, they faced growing public pressure at home to stand up to the Americans. Now they are debating pulling back from the relationship, including by moving billions of dollars of investment away from the U.S. economy.The poll numbers suggest Saudi leaders might be correct in reevaluating the relationship ― and wise to think about new ways to shore it up, given the clearly limited influence of their scores of high-paid American lobbyists.At a different political moment, there could be less cause for worry. Greg Gause, an expert on Saudi politics at Texas A&M University, told HuffPost the Saudi-U.S. partnership has never relied heavily on public or congressional approval. “I’ve never gotten the sense that people on Capitol Hill like Saudi Arabia. I think they’ve always been distrustful of Saudi Arabia on a number of counts,” Gause said. “They’re good liberals who don’t like Saudi policies on women, or they’re conservatives who, now that we don’t have the Cold War to keep us together, worry about Islam and some new enemy.“There just isn’t a domestic constituency for Saudi Arabia in the United States… this idea that the Saudis have a lot of control in Washington ― I think it’s ludicrous, it’s part of our general propensity for conspiracy theory thought.”As a result, Riyadh has always relied on the executive branch to recognize the national security value of U.S.-Saudi ties and keep relations warm, Gause said.While Obama has openly criticized the kingdom, he has not tried to sever its ties to the U.S. Instead he has offered the country record arms sales and done little to prevent or punish moves that threaten Saudi stability and the U.S.’s reputation as its close friend, such as the execution earlier this year of a dissident Shiite cleric or the 2015 launch of the war in Yemen. In the telling of Bruce Reidel, a former CIA agent now at the Brookings Institution, the president was willing to violate an important rule: Friends don’t let friends drive drunk.The incoming administration could be very different.Trump supported the Saudi 9/11 bill, and he used anti-Saudi sentiment as a wedge issue against Hillary Clinton. One of Trump’s favorite talking points, that Clinton should return Clinton Foundation donations from Saudi Arabia and other Muslim-majority countries because they throw LGBT citizens off roofs, is a lie that has already been linked to an Islamophobic murderer. By conflating countries like Saudi Arabia with the vicious Islamic State group (which does engage in that atrocity), Trump was encouraging a line of thought that had already become popular. The Saudis ― with their reputation for excess, moral hypocrisy and repressive quasi-Islamic justice ― have become a favorite target for Islamophobes and other racists seeking ways to slam the Muslim-majority world.The Saudis and other Muslim-majority U.S. partners are eager to write all that off as campaign trail babble, speak of the business understandings they could reach with someone of Trump’s background and note the president-elect’s selection of Iran critics for top jobs. They could be encouraged by the fact that the HuffPost/YouGov poll shows Americans still very wary of Iran (74 percent see it as unfriendly or an enemy). And they know it would be complicated and costly for the U.S. to fully extract itself from its embrace.But the president-elect’s toughness on Iran may well have been more of a campaign stunt than a policy conviction. And he has repeatedly proved eager, even after the election, to echo controversial aides and speak of U.S. relations with the Muslim-majority world as a clash of civilizations. “Trump has vowed to be daringly different, as he likes to boast,” Robin Wright wrote in The New Yorker this month. “But his narrow-minded ideas and bombastic rhetoric risk remaking the world order — and potentially spawning a full-scale holy war.”With Americans wary of Saudi Arabia and another top Muslim partner (NATO member Turkey, which 34 percent see as unfriendly at best, compared with 33 percent who see it as friendly), the president-elect could claim a mandate for foreign policy maneuvers that Muslim friends of the U.S. might never have imagined. He has already proved willing to fudge numbers. What’s clearer now is how limited the opposition to such actions could be.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 13-14 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Another was a series of economic measures to cripple Taiwan.It was not clear whether any decisions had been taken, but the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Taiwan issue had become a hot topic within the upper echelons of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in recent weeks.Trump, due to take office on Jan 20, angered Beijing this month by speaking to Taiwan’s president by telephone, breaking decades of precedent and casting doubt on his incoming administration’s commitment to Beijing’s “one China” policy. Beijing fears this could embolden supporters of independence in Taiwan.“If Trump challenges ‘one China’ after becoming president, this would cross our red line,” said another source, who has ties to China’s leadership.China’s defense ministry declined to comment. An official at the ministry’s news department said China’s position was clearly laid out in the 2005 Anti-Secession Law, which authorizes the use of force against Taiwan in the event China judges it to have seceded.Asked about any possible aggressive moves from China, Taiwan defense ministry spokesman Chen Chung-shi said: “We are fully prepared, and plan for the worst while preparing for the best.”China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its sacred and inviolable territory and is deeply suspicious of President Tsai Ing-wen, whose ruling Democratic Progressive Party espouses the island’s independence. Tsai, who took power this year, says she wants to maintain peace with China, but China is unconvinced.Tsai said on Saturday that Taiwan will be “calm” when facing issues to do with China, but uncertainties next year will test the self-ruled island and its national security team.Beijing has also been angered by a trip planned by Tsai in January to Latin America in which she will transit through Houston and San Francisco. China has urged the United States to block the stopovers.Chinese officials have blamed Taiwan for creating trouble rather than Trump, and many of them believe he will be more accommodating to China once in office.“We’re ready. If Taiwan wants to make trouble so can we. Let’s hit them hard,” said an official in Beijing who meets regularly with China’s most senior military officers, including those who work directly with President Xi Jinping.“We can hold exercises close to Taiwan, and show them the damage we could cause. Taiwan will have to give in then,” the official added, citing a recent conversation with one of the military officers. ONE CHINA POLICYThe United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, but it’s unclear if the United States would send troops in the event of war between China and Taiwan.Washington also acknowledges Beijing’s position that there is only one China and Taiwan is its territory.A retired senior officer who maintains contacts with the PLA told Reuters that China probably wouldn’t need to fire any missiles to bring Taiwan to its knees. China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner, and Taiwan runs a huge trade surplus with China, worth $27 billion in 2015.“We can just cut them off economically. No more direct flights, no more trade. Nothing. Taiwan would not last long,” the officer said. “There would be no need for war.”In addition, any Western economic blockade of China put in place in the event of war with Taiwan would also be damaging to China, already dealing with a slowing economy.A U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Chinese actions had been more provocative in the past month, since Trump won the U.S. election and made comments about Taiwan.This month, a Chinese naval flotilla headed by its sole aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, took part in drills that took it around Taiwan.Chinese air force jets have performed similar drills in recent weeks, flying close to the island, though China has officially called the air force and naval exercises routine.China also scored a diplomatic victory when tiny Sao Tome and Principe switched recognition to Beijing from Taiwan.(Additional reporting by J.R.

The film, “Bright Lights: Starring Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher,” was predominately shot in 2014 and 2015. But following the deaths of the daughter and mother on Dec. 27 and Dec. 28, respectively, the cable channel has pushed up the airdate to Jan. 7 at 8 p.m. A trailer from May for “Bright Lights: Starring Debbie Reynolds & Carrie Fisher”“The story of a family’s complicated love, this documentary is an intimate portrait of Hollywood royalty in all its eccentricity,” HBO said in a release. “Carrie Fisher and her mother, Debbie Reynolds, live in the same Beverly Hills compound. The 83-year-old grand dame still has a Las Vegas act, but performing is taking its toll. Carrie’s response is both hilarious and heart-rending.”“Bright Lights” tracks Fisher and Reynolds’ relationship as the daughter prepares for “Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens” and the mother prepares to receive a lifetime achievement award at the 2015 SAG Awards, which she wasn’t able to accept in person because of health issues. In November, Fisher told the Los Angeles Times that Reynolds’ “work ethic” helped her stay alive during that period. “That’s how she didn’t die,” Fisher said. “She will power through anything. There is no obstacle my mother won’t acknowledge. She broke her leg once while onstage and went back on and sang ‘Tammy.’ She’s this amazing creature, y’know?”The film has already been shown multiple times, including at the Cannes Film Festival in May and the New York Film Festival in October. In reviews published before Fisher’s and Reynolds’ deaths, The Hollywood Reporter called the film a “tender tribute” and the Los Angeles Times called it “refreshingly honest.”In a joint statement to Variety following the celebrities’ deaths, the film’s directors, Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens, tried to describe the kinetic energy that appeared when Reynolds and Fisher were in a room at the same time. “When either one entered a room, the energy changed. Quite simply, we were iron filings to their magnets. And never more so than when they were together. These women were more than mother and daughter: They were an expression of exquisite humanity in all its travail and triumph. They lived their days boldly. They sung every song worth singing (often together). Carrie and Debbie loved each other profoundly,” they wrote. “We are devastated they’re gone. And so very fortunate to have known them at all.”HBO will also rerun Fisher’s one-woman show “Wishful Drinking” on Sunday at 9 p.m."

In 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed him to his current post on the 7th Circuit, the federal appeals court in Illinois. A graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law, Judge Posner is one of the most influential judges to ever sit on the bench, and the most cited living judge. Posner, unafraid of confronting controversial topics, including inadequacies within the legal profession, agreed to talk about a variety of topics related to legal writing, legal thinking, and law school. What type of legal writing should law students embrace? I like to say that law is made by simple people, for simple people. So, the endeavor should be to make a judicial opinion as simple as possible, as nontechnical, and accessible to laypeople. The benefits are not just to the laity, because very few people who aren’t lawyers read judicial opinions. But the lawyers themselves and the judges, they tend to get tangled in technicalities, and repetition. It is very unhealthy and confuses everybody. Are you a judge who happens to be an academic or an academic who happens to be a judge? I was a full time academic for 12 years until I was appointed to the judgeship. And since then I teach, a little bit, at the University of Chicago Law School. But I do not consider myself an academic. One of the things I teach is judicial opinion writing. A lot of the students at the University of Chicago become law clerks. Most judges delegate at least the first draft of judicial opinion writing to the law clerks. I like to encourage them that writing a judicial opinion can be a nontechnical kind of activity, and everyone benefits from that. What advice do you have for law students who want to become better writers, but are not being offered that opportunity in classrooms? The way people learn to write well is by reading well-written things like George Orwell, for example. He’s a modern writer. He’s very clear, very impressive, articulate, fresh, humorous, and nontechnical. That is what people should be doing to improve their writing. They should be reading literature. My mother was an English teacher in the New York public schools. She force-fed me literature since I was three years old. I majored in English in college. If I were teaching first-year students in their mandatory writing course I would show them examples of good judicial writers such as Holmes, Learned Hand, and Robert Jackson. I would want them to read their work, and then try to write an opinion that would have the clarity and specificity of these famous judges. I do not know what more can be done. Do you encounter misuses of terms of art, or legalese where it is not necessary?I think legalese is very rarely necessary. For example, suppose you are convicted of a crime and sentenced. Now you want to bring a Habeas Corpus action saying there were serious mistakes made in your trial and you want a new one. Often the attorneys filing the Habeas action appeal to the notion of actual innocence, they say, ‘my client is actually innocent.’ Now actual innocence is a very bad term because it implies that there is a kind of innocence that is not actual. You are either innocent or guilty. You cannot be innocent, but not actually innocent. Nevertheless, ‘actual innocence’ is a very standard, very common, piece of legal jargon. And the lawyers cannot get away from that. The Supreme Court uses the term. It’s quite nonsensical. It started with an article by Henry Friendly many, many years ago, in which he said that in deciding whether there had been procedural irregularities that would justify Habeas Corpus, you ought to really consider the issue of innocence. If a person is innocent you don’t have to fuss so much about procedure. So anyway, the Supreme Court picked that up but in a curious way. And the first way, they said, we think a person should be entitled to Habeas Corpus if the he can prove factual innocence. And a few years later they dropped the “f,” and started talking about actual innocence. I don’t think there was any mental activity in deciding to use actual innocence. That happens, and once you have a piece of jargon that has been used frequently, it then has a life of its own. That is just a very serious problem. Does the way we are taught the law, looking backwards, affect the quality of legal writing that students put out? The students come into law school and most of them have no idea about law, the legal profession, or anything like that. And they just absorb whatever they are given by the professors. Now, why are the professors so wedded to a very old fashioned way of teaching, and with very heavy emphasis on the past? I remember the first case when I was a law student. It was a 14th or 15th century English case about assault. It was an interesting case. There had never been a concept of assault before, just battery. So that’s where we started, with the 14th or 15th century. It sort of set the tone that everything we studied would be backward oriented. And so the students imbibe that and learn a lot of rules that are very old, and that becomes their culture. How much does the Bluebook Manual of Citations, and formalistic citations, matter in the real world? Do you think they serve a practical purpose?No, I think it’s zero. I tell my law clerks not to look at the Bluebook, ever. I have a little handbook for my law clerks. So the Bluebook is 580 something pages. I have five pages on formatting. You know how you cite the case, how you write a case down. That’s perfectly adequate. The important thing about citations is that it enables the reader to find the case or the article or whatever is cited; that’s the important thing. Not whether it conforms to some elaborate ritual of citation practice. So I regard the Bluebook really as a monstrosity. It’s also quite expensive. Another thing I’d like to do is abolish the casebook. My proposition is forget the casebook and give the students a list that you want them to read. I’m not sure but in the law schools I know, the student has free access to these cases and can read them online. One of the benefits of reading them online is that it's unedited full text, and Westlaw allows you to click on the briefs. One of the things I’d give them is a list of questions. I think some of these casebooks are fine but these massive casebooks that have enormous volumes of stuff must be very laborious for the students. I don’t really understand that mentality. I just don’t know why they would want to impose that on the students or the law clerk.It's so striking about the legal profession, it goes back at least to the Roman Empire, but the Greeks didn’t have lawyers but they did have trials. So, it goes back thousands of years and it's not like science that keeps changing and once something gets established, even something as stupid as not using an italicized period in legal writing, everyone flocks like lemmings. Scientists are always looking ahead, and want to improve science and discover new things. But lawyers, including law professors and judges, they are always looking backwards. Does creative writing have a place in legal briefs?I think most judges would like that, actually, because I don’t think the judges like reading long, conventional, dull briefs. I think they could use a little entertainment. We like pictures and brevity but the judicial system does impose a word limit on briefs. I think it’s like 14,000 words, but the lawyers can always ask for more space but generally they adhere to that limit. So, the judges appreciate limitations. I had a case recently where the table of cases was so long that I counted them; it turned out there were 72 cases cited. That was just preposterous. How could the lawyer think the judges were going to read 72 cases? I think Judges would value simplicity. The Supreme Court and Congress have created complicated sub rules for constitutional law and statutory law. The Supreme Court never seems to consider the difficulties that they are throwing in the path of the lawyers and the lower court judges through their technicalities.For law students who want to become a part of the judicial process, how do you suggest they become involved? Clinical programs are very valuable. They handle real cases, pro bono, and that is very good training for someone who wants to actually be in litigation. What do you assume that other judges look for in hiring?I think they are just looking for very good law school performance, and enthusiastic but also credible recommendations from faculty whom they trust. One thing to note is that all the courts have what are called staff attorneys. The head of the staff attorneys, an employee of the court, a lawyer, hires these. Some of the staff attorneys do very well and get very good jobs in law firms or the government. That is something to consider along with traditional clerking.

These are his personal views.As the United States grappled with a difficult 2016, one bright spot held steady throughout the year: an improving relationship between two U.S. allies, Korea and Japan.Last December, the two countries concluded an agreement regarding Korean women -- referred to euphemistically as “comfort women” -- trafficked for sexual purposes by the Japanese military during World War II. Though the agreement encountered opposition from some, implementation has been smooth. That agreement has paved the way for a burst of U.S.-Korea-Japan trilateral cooperation on everything from isolating North Korea to curing cancer. But one year after the agreement, prospects for the relationship look bleak. That's because the Korea-Japan relationship, unpopular even in the best of times, is deeply vulnerable to Korea's politics. The impeachment of President Park Geun-hye due to a corruption scandal has thrust Korean politics into turmoil. A new presidential election is likely in the coming months. As a new U.S. administration takes charge in Washington, it must act quickly to preserve recent gains and build a U.S.-Korea-Japan partnership that can withstand the ups and downs of domestic politics. The wounds from Japan’s brutal occupation of Korea throughout the first half of the twentieth century still run deep. An Asan Institute survey of Korean views of other countries from 2014-2016 consistently ranked Japan as less favorable than China or Russia; at low points in 2014, Japan even fell below North Korea. “Criticizing Japan has become such an integral part of Korean daily mentality,” former Brookings Institution Korea Chair Katharine Moon notes in a 2015 interview, “it’s moved from the realm of politics and policy to something very personal in people’s work life, home life.”Those sentiments make improving Korea-Japan relations a risk for Korean leaders. When a military info sharing agreement with Japan was first negotiated under Park's predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, Korea withdrew less than an hour before the signing ceremony due to domestic opposition. For the first two years of her tenure, Park refused even to meet with the Japanese Prime Minister. The comfort women agreement came only as Park enjoyed a healthy 43% approval rating at the end of 2015. Now, with Park impeached and contenders emerging for a new presidential contest in Korea, there is no one with the capital to move the Korea-Japan relationship forward. Opposition candidates have every incentive to score political points by attacking her administration’s achievements in Korea-Japan relations — thereby stoking both anti-Park and anti-Japan sentiments. Leading progressive candidate Moon Jae-in has already called for renegotiation of the comfort women agreement and further review of the military information-sharing pact signed last month. Korea-Japan relations have consistently failed to withstand difficult periods in domestic politics like this one. Is there anything the United States can do to break the cycle this time? The odds are long. But there are a couple of things the incoming Trump administration could do that can help.First, the Trump administration should designate champions for the Korea-Japan relationship within the U.S. government. Under the current administration, Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken drove the relationship forward by initiating quarterly trilateral meetings and insisting on concrete results. Similar high-level advocates in the next Administration can send a strong signal that the focus on Korea-Japan relations will continue. Vice President-elect Pence and Ivanka Trump are possibilities worth considering.Second, while we may not be able to stop the next downturn in Korea-Japan relations, we can raise the costs of such a downturn for powerful constituencies. I call it the “Obamacare strategy.” When the Affordable Care Act was just a concept, it was controversial and deeply vulnerable to ideological opposition. Now that 20 million people have gained health insurance under Obamacare, the benefits from Obamacare seem indispensable — even to many Trump voters. Obamacare now has a real constituency. Though Republicans may well follow through on their threat to repeal Obamacare, the cost of repeal grows higher the more people gain indispensable benefits from Obamacare. Similarly, if trilateral cooperation can produce concrete, indispensable benefits for constituencies in Korea, more people and interest groups will stand to lose if a downturn in Korea-Japan relations puts an end to those benefits.That means evolving our approach to trilateral cooperation to target powerful constituencies that could become advocates for good relations. The Obama administration’s approach to trilateral cooperation has been to debut as many initiatives as possible, as often as possible. That made sense in the past year, when the United States needed to generate a sense of momentum in a nascent partnership in the months after the comfort women agreement. Deputy Secretary Blinken’s efforts have transformed the trilateral partnership from an abstraction to something with a real architecture, rhythm, and results. He deserves tremendous credit.Now, it’s time to regularize and strengthen the trilateral initiatives that are most likely to become indispensable — especially in Korea. The more U.S.-Korea-Japan cooperation plays a unique role in isolating North Korea, for example, the more strategists in Korea will want to preserve that cooperation. In Japan, where the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is the dominant player, trilateral initiatives that counter Chinese aggression and improve security cooperation can assure the support of hawkish factions within the party. Trilateral cooperation opportunities that bring economic benefits to businesses can turn those businesses into advocates for good relations. The Trump administration needs to focus on generating a high volume of regular benefits from the most promising trilateral cooperation rather than producing a large quantity of new trilateral initiatives.Finally, much depends on Japan. The burden of reconciliation is mostly on Japan; after all, it was the clear aggressor. Further Japanese steps to redress its difficult past will empower those who favor Korea-Japan reconciliation and undercut the legitimacy of anti-Japanese sentiments expressed during the Korean election campaign. If, in this time of turbulence in Korea, Japan undertakes provocative actions such as a prime ministerial visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, the critics win. U.S. officials must strongly urge Japan not only to smoothly implement the comfort women agreement, but to take additional high-profile steps that go above and beyond the letter of that agreement.As President-elect Trump faces an aggressive China and Russia and a host of intense challenges that cut across borders, he will find that the United States is not powerful enough or popular enough to go it alone. We need partners who share the values we seek in the world and have the capabilities to help us achieve them. We need Korea and Japan, and we need them together. "
60,POLITICS,What Kerry Did,"James Zogby, ContributorPresident, Arab American Institute; Author, ""Arab Voices""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-kerry-did_us_5867bbfce4b014e7c72ee1a0,Secretary of State John Kerry’s valedictory speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict unleashed a firestorm of criticism,2016-12-31,"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry exits after delivering remarks on Middle East peace at the Department of State in Washington December 28, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586bf6f51500002c00916f3c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Secretary of State John Kerry’s valedictory speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict unleashed a firestorm of criticism from the very same folks who had just finished hyperventilating over the U.S. abstention on a Security Council resolution a few days earlier.The speech, itself, was divided into three parts. Kerry opened with an accounting of all that the Obama administration had done for Israel in the past eight years. And he closed with a list of principles he said should serve as the basis for a future Israeli-Palestinian peace. The largest part, the middle, was a passionate indictment of Israel’s settlement policy in the West Bank and East Jerusalem—the most comprehensive critique ever given by an American political leader.During the past 50 years, successive U.S. administrations have done their best to avoid public criticism of Israel. There have been momentary outbursts of displeasure. But, for the most part, when U.S. officials wanted to challenge Israel’s behavior, they prodded, cajoled, pleaded their case, or resorted to offering “incentives.” They have never “taken Israel to the wood shed.” That’s what Kerry did and that was what prompted the reaction.In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered the political equivalent of tantrum even before Kerry finished his remarks. President-elect Donald Trump tweeted his displeasure. And members of Congress, from both parties, rushed to issue statements pledging their full support for Israel and its leader, while roundly criticizing their own Secretary of State.Why the hysteria? As Kerry, himself acknowledged, the speech was not going to change realities on the ground nor would it force the Israelis to alter their behavior. And, as Donald Trump tweeted, with only a few weeks left before the end of the Obama administration, it is clear that Israel is not going to pay a price in terms of its relationship with Washington.None of these reactions, of course, paid any attention to the opening or closing parts of Kerry’s speech. Israel and its supporters have made a habit of treating as their due the aid and support they have received from the Obama administration. And, as for the “Kerry Principles,” they were bound to be ignored, since everyone knows what they are but see no possibility that they will be realized.What set off the firestorm was that Kerry dared to publicly and forcefully criticize Israeli policy. And that was what the overreaction intended to snuff out. The standard Israeli approach used in situations of this sort is to launch a campaign of intimidation designed to pummel the offender into submission and to discourage others from taking similar course.I remember back in 2003, in the lead up to the 2004 presidential primaries, then Senator Kerry addressed our Arab American Institute national conference poignantly describing the daily hardships faced by Palestinians under occupation. He concluded his remarks by condemning the “separation wall” that Israel was constructing in the West Bank, calling it “a barrier to peace.” For weeks, Kerry was pummeled by pro-Israeli activists and donors until he finally relented and apologized for his remarks.Much the same happened with Justice Richard Goldstone, one of the co-authors of the United Nations report on Israeli violations of human rights and international law in its 2008/9 onslaught of Gaza. I met the man and heard him describe how painful it had been for him to see what Israel had done and then feel compelled to condemn their behavior. The response from Israel and Congress was intense and unrelenting. Most critics denounced “Goldstone” without even reading the report. Facts didn’t matter, snuffing out criticism and making the critic pay a price did.After being shamefully battered and even denied entry to Israel to visit his family, Justice Goldstone relented and wrote a Washington Post op-ed apologizing for some of the language he had used to describe Israeli behavior. At that point Israel announced victory and called off the attack.This past summer, my colleagues and I went through somewhat the same experience after being appointed by Bernie Sanders to serve on the Democratic Party platform drafting committee. There was an effort to discredit and silence us even before the platform deliberations began. They didn’t need to turn the heat up too high because the Clinton campaign made it clear that they would brook no criticism of Israel in the document. As a result, our efforts to add the words “occupation” and “settlements” were in vain.And now comes Kerry’s State Department speech in which he didn’t just criticize Israel’s occupation and settlement policy, he also demolished the arguments Israelis use to defend their actions. At the same time, he provided a tutorial on the damage done to peace by settlements. Kerry’s speech will not change Israeli policy. And with Trump in the Oval Office three weeks, the speech most certainly will not affect a change in U.S. policy. But what Kerry has done, if he doesn’t relent, is shatter the taboo that has sheltered Israel from official criticism, while laying out the arguments needed to rebut Israeli efforts to justify their policies.To some, especially Palestinians, this may seem like “too little, too late”. But as someone who has been a part of the effort to create an American debate on Israeli policies, Kerry’s intervention is both welcome, validating, and empowering. He laid down markers that should help liberals and progressives define a policy agenda on the Israel-Palestine conflict—exactly what we need as we enter the challenges of the Trump era.Follow @jjz1600 for more."
61,POLITICS,"No, Donald Trump Wishing Happy New Year To His 'Many Enemies' Is In No Way the Same As Hillary Clinton's 'Basket Of Deplorables'","Michael Darer, ContributorStudent, Wesleyan University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/no-donald-trump-wishing-happy-new-year-to-his-many_us_5867fa6ee4b014e7c72ee1d7,"In his typically presidential style, Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to wish Americans a happy New Year, with all the grace",2016-12-31,"<p>Though Trump’s casual megalomania can often make him seem like a community-theater Iago, his continued positioning of himself in confrontation with a large sector of the people he his tasked with governing should be cause for perpetual alarm. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5867fb3e1500001200e9ddab.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In his typically presidential style, Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to wish Americans a happy New Year, with all the grace an poise befitting a future Commander-in-Chief. Reaching out to his “many enemies and those who have fought [him] and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do” the Donald assures citizens of the United States, from sea to shining sea, that his first year as president will most likely go exactly as many expected. He’s even generous enough to add a perfunctory “Love!” at the end of the message, in case his Christ-like benevolence were to be misinterpreted as the gloating douchebaggery of a small man who can’t quite reckon with how badly he lost the popular vote. I do adore an executive who knows when to turn the other puffy cheek.As many have expressed outrage over President-Elect Trump’s decision to paint many of the citizens he is sworn to serve and protect as pathetic foes, others have leapt to the man’s questionable defense. Claiming that one cannot rightly criticize this sort of playground smack-talk while defending the Donald’s political opponent former-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s choice to plop half of his supporters into a “basket of deplorables,” these apologists have continued the great conservative tradition of the false equivalency. ‘Tis the season, I suppose.Make no mistake: the President-Elect’s decision to position himself in literal opposition to the American people as his inauguration fast approaches bears little resemblance to Hillary Clinton’s decision to associate the Trump campaign with the views of its most vocal supporters. To say there is no comparison might be considered something of an understatement. Because, as much as the deplorables (both those who have chosen to wear the label like some sort of red armband that we all feel like we’ve seen somewhere; and those who have assumed the label by, I guess, accidentally happening to have deplorable views) might want to act as though this is fair retaliation for an unjust liberal campaign against being a racist shitheel, all that they demonstrate in doing so is fundamental inability to understand their own candidate and the criticisms being leveled against their behavior.In many ways, this is one more iteration of the disturbing trend of equating criticism of political and social views with discrimination against someone because of their race or ethnicity or religion or gender or gender identity or sexuality. As part of the decades-long campaign to appease currents of bigotry in America, the bogus idea that one can be “discriminated” against for being a racist has begun to take hold, with even avowedly liberal writers and thinkers arguing that it’s dangerous to act in a way that might be misconstrued as holding someone accountable for the political beliefs they seek to impose on the world around them.Though it’s possible (if more than a little beside-the-point) to argue that Clinton’s “deplorables” comment was politically unwise (since we live in a nation where staunchly opposing white supremacy can be deemed a risky proposition), it’s impossible to argue that what she said didn’t carry the ring of truth. Even before the beginning of his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump built his political brand by courting bigots, beginning with his spearheading of the overtly racist “birther” movement that sought to convince Americans that President Barack Obama was born outside of America. The movement was a direct assault on Obama’s blackness, and it also propelled a game-show host and modern-day snake-oil salesman into the American political arena. From there on out, the Donald’s romance with white nationalism only deepened. He announced his candidacy by calling an entire nation (as a synecdoche for an entire ethnic group) rapists and criminals. He openly allied himself with white supremacists like Steve Bannon and David Duke. He ran a campaign of such fundamental hatred that it was endorsed gleefully by the Ku Klux Klan. This, of course, entirely leaves out the online machinations of the Trump supporters who gathered under the white nationalist “alt-right” banner, which gleefully employed the rhetoric of white supremacy, misogyny, and anti-Semitism in an attempt to turn Trump into some sort of Nazi poster boy. The men involved in this collective, including Breitbart.com’s Milo Yiannopoulos, made a sport of harassing women, racial, sexual, and gender minorities at every opportunity, including viciously pursuing women who accused Trump of sexual assault after he bragged about committing it to Billy Bush.Footage and photos of Trump rallies are awash with men chanting Nazi slogans, misogynist slurs, and wearing homemade apparel that touts the same. Even as they claimed to feel wounded by a presidential candidate refusing to give the worst of them the benefit of the doubt, many adopted Clinton’s insult as a badge of rebellion, proudly announcing their commitment to making America as unsafe as possible for those who didn’t fit the grotesque standards of personhood that their mascots waved about. It was all a sort of “we’re here, we’re queer…” for the neo-Nazi set. In short, Hillary Clinton low-balled the number of Trump supporters who fit the deplorable bill. Even those who claimed they were drawn to the campaign by promises of economic stability knowingly signed on with the loudly advertised social agenda that Trump and his ilk made sure to plaster across their campaign. They signed on with a deplorable man surrounded by other deplorables, and if they suddenly felt victimized for being associated with those they put their stock in, the Americans whose lives are jeopardized by their thoughtless quest for re-centering in the narrative of this nation have no reason to feel any sympathy. Which brings us back to Donald Trump’s New Year’s tweet: an astounding display of dangerous pettiness from a man whose life is a litany of retaliatory spite. What makes the Donald’s designation of his political opponents as enemies most frightening is the way in which he himself has set the terms as to what constitutes an enemy of Donald Trump. On his Twitter, Trump has repeatedly disparaged those who have exercised their Constitutional right to peaceful protest. Honing in on flag burning, a protected freedom, Trump argued that those who engage in the practice should face a year in prison, or lose their citizenship. If this seems like a frighteningly autocratic position, that’s because it is. The leaders who have approached protest in the way that Donald Trump and his comrades say they plan to are uniformly anti-Democratic, and rarely stop once they cross the line.Secondly, Trump has repeatedly asked for the names of those in government on agendas which he has stated opposition to, specifically gender equality and climate change. This combined with the Donald’s plans for a registry of Muslim Americans paints a picture of a president who plans to be actively hostile and politically violent towards citizens whose political agendas do not align with his own. Following his victory in November, multiple sources reported that former-Apprentice contestant Omarosa Manigault (who Trump had previously named his campaign’s Director of African-American Outreach) claimed the Trump campaign was keeping a list of enemies. Prior to her official work with the Trump campaign Manigault had stated in an interview with Frontline: “Every critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump. It’s everyone who’s ever doubted Donald, who ever disagreed, who ever challenged him. It is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe.” Additionally, although Trump claimed he would not follow through with his plan to appoint a special prosecutor to re-try Hillary Clinton for potential misconduct during her tenure with the State Department, the claim itself rang of such show-trial-lite posturing that Trump’s decision to say such a thing, even in jest, should put every American on high alert.It’s quite easy to view Trump’s Twitter as a simple window into the impulse thinking of an egotist on his way to public office, but to discredit the ease with which he adopts autocratic rhetoric should not be taken lightly, even if he himself sees it as some sort of casual jab at his political opponents. In the run up to his inauguration, Trump has seemed to work over time to confirm nearly every fear his critics set forth about what his time in office might look like, and just how cruel and abnormal a Trump administration might prove to be. As the president of the United States, Donald Trump has a sworn duty to protect and uphold the rights of every single citizen of these United States, regardless of their feelings on his moral or political fitness. A president does not have the luxury of spite or pettiness, two qualities that Trump seems to hope his surplus of will someone erase his inability to speak coherently on any of duties as the head of the executive branch. If this New Year spells the beginning of one of the ugliest presidential administrations in American history, Trump seems to have little interest in disproving that. Instead, he seems desperate to confirm the truth about his own character and all those who leap to his defense, sucking at the white nationalist teat in hopes of prosperity they don’t deserve and empowerment they’ve built from the stolen dignity of their countrymen and women. If I had to think of a word for that, “deplorable” is probably the one I would settle on, as well."

With recent events throughout the world, I think that many of us also enter this new year with a sense of trepidation. For me personally, I am channeling any disquiet I might feel into a renewed focus on our mission at the Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation - that is to inspire new generations of change makers to make this world a more peaceful place through the life, actions and words of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. As we move forward to challenges this new year brings, I am reminded of some of the wisdom that the Archbishop has shared that I turn to when I am in need of some inspiration.1. “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.”We have all been here. We have seen someone not being treated fairly and made the conscious decision to NOT get involved. After all, it’s not our business, is it? Actually, yes, yes it it is. Apartheid, The Holocaust, the illegal occupation of countries, the Syrian refugee crisis – it is pretty easy to find a situation in the world where people are being oppressed. To stand by and do nothing while this is happening – this is no different than telling the aggressor, “I support you.”2. “Without forgiveness, there can be no future for a relationship between individuals or within and between nations.”What does it take to forgive? Our society tend to be one based on revenge and retribution. One of the greatest gifts that Archbishop Tutu helped to share with the world is that there is another way through forgiveness. Forgiveness is difficult. Archbishop Tutu’s granddaughter, Nyaniso Tutu-Burris, described forgiveness as an “ongoing process”. Every day you need to wake up and make the decision to forgive again. The Archbishop has written whole books on forgiveness: “Forgiveness is not forgetting; it is actually remembering -remembering and not using your right to hit back. Its a second chance for a new beginning. And the remembering part is particularly important. Especially if you don’t want to repeat what happened.”3. “Religion is like a knife: you can either use it to cut bread, or stick in someone’s back.”From Christians to Muslims to Atheists, people will argue that “other” religions cause so much of the unrest in the world today – and that isn’t necessarily wrong. But what if one uses the tenets of their faith, those based on love and compassion, to share experiences with peoples of other faiths? I have been very fortunate in my life to have worked alongside two great men of faith - the Archbishop and His Holiness the Dalai Lama. This year, with their release of The Book of Joy, I was reminded of that deep, profound friendship between the two men - two men from radically different faiths, who have come together to share with the world the peace and harmony that can be found through friendship, not despite of their differences, but because of them. As the Archbishop has said many times, “We must be ready to learn from one another, not claiming that we alone possess all truth and that somehow we have a corner on God.”4. “Resentment and anger are bad for your blood pressure and your digestion.”While the Archbishop is known for his sense of humor and this is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, There is a great deal of wisdom. A friend of the Foundation found himself getting so upset on social media because of comments that others were making that he disagreed with. Throughout the election cycle of the last year, he would spend hours upon hours arguing with friends of friends, or even complete strangers, with the end result being only that he felt more tense. I suggested to him that perhaps he just acknowledge to himself that a particular comment upset him, but then move on. He recently sent a message to me that this path has allowed him to have more time to work with youth and spend less time arguing on social media – and he feels more relaxed and energized.5. “Do your little bit of good where you are; it’s those little bits of good that overwhelm the world.” After a recent Peace3 event at Stanford University, a student came up and started to explain that with all the tragedy in the world, she felt overwhelmed by everything that she perceived needed to happen to make this world a better place. While it is true that sometimes the task at making an impact in the world can seem daunting, it doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t still try. It has been said that as one person, you might not be able to change the world, but you can change the world for one person. What can you do to make an impact in the life of one person in this new year?6. “Hope is being able to see there is light despite all of the darkness.”2016 has been a rough year for a lot of people. One thing that I keep seeing over and over again is people claiming that others seem to have lost their humanity or that the world has become a crueler place this year. I wholeheartedly reject this premise. Racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny... so many of these horrible things are very visible but they were always there. Now more of us just know it.But there is a light. I think back to earlier this month when 130 high school students gathered with me in St. Paul’s Chapel to start identifying issues in their community and what steps they could make to resolve them. I think of the hundreds of people (both women AND men) who are planning their trip for the Women’s March on Washington. I remember how people came together after the shootings in Orlando. This last year has definitely shown the ugly underbelly of what humans can think and do, but it is the response that others are having to that darkness that is the light that continues to give me hope.7. “Don’t raise your voice, improve your argument.”If you follow the election cycles of most any country, you might think that the individual or group that is the loudest is the most successful. But history has shown us time and time again that the best way to sway people to your way of thinking is not to be louder, but to be stronger with your argument. In the short term, the few may be influenced by shouting, in the long term, the many will stand with wisdom.8. “If you want peace, don’t talk to your friends, talk to your enemies.”Robert V. Taylor, the President of the Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation, is a regular contributor to Fox News. As a fairly liberal activist for social justice, his message contradicts the norm for what most people think would be typical content for Fox. But Robert understands something important, you don’t create peace by talking with people that agree with you, that have the same opinions as you. Peace comes from having a dialogue with people that are different than you. Maybe not necessarily your “enemies” but that have different world views, different life experiences.9. “Differences are not intended to separate, to alienate. We are different precisely in order to realize our need of one another.”Throughout history, people have tried to use our differences to create division. Sometimes you hear someone mention how we need to just all realize that we are the same. But we aren’t. Each and every one of us is an individual, we are all different. Sometimes those differences are easily distinguished, but other times, those differences are hidden. What is clear, is that these differences are what make our society beautiful. It is like a rainbow – do we look at the rainbow and think, “I wish that was all red.” No! We look at the beauty of all of the colors, working together to create a thing of beauty, and realize without any one part of the rainbow, it would be something completely different.10. “Ubuntu… my humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up in what is yours.”One of the greatest issues with mankind is the issue of “they/them”. It is easy to demonize “them”. ‘They” are taking our jobs, “they” are ruining the moral fabric of society, “they” want to attack us. But who is this “them”? “They are people. People like you and me. People with families and jobs and hopes and dreams – just like us. Recognizing that “they” are also people is the beginning of trying to understand their views. The Archbishop has said, “A person is a person through other persons. None of us comes into the world fully formed. We would not know how to think, or walk, or speak, or behave as human beings unless we learned it from other human beings. We need other human beings in order to be human. I am because other people are. A person is entitled to a stable community life, and the first of these communities is the family.”11. “Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and feed him for a lifetime. Teach a man to cycle and he will realize fishing is stupid and boring.”This is one of my favorite Archbishop quotes. Why? Because it it speaks to the fact that no matter what is going on in our lives, there is still a place for humor. Take time to laugh, to realize that it isn’t all serious, and that by experiencing joy, that joy spreads out to others.Which of these ideals can you put forward as we move into 2017? What can you do to inspire peace?"

With recent events throughout the world, I think that many of us also enter this new year with a sense of trepidation. For me personally, I am channeling any disquiet I might feel into a renewed focus on our mission at the Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation - that is to inspire new generations of change makers to make this world a more peaceful place through the life, actions and words of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. As we move forward to challenges this new year brings, I am reminded of some of the wisdom that the Archbishop has shared that I turn to when I am in need of some inspiration.1. “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.”We have all been here. We have seen someone not being treated fairly and made the conscious decision to NOT get involved. After all, it’s not our business, is it? Actually, yes, yes it it is. Apartheid, The Holocaust, the illegal occupation of countries, the Syrian refugee crisis – it is pretty easy to find a situation in the world where people are being oppressed. To stand by and do nothing while this is happening – this is no different than telling the aggressor, “I support you.”2. “Without forgiveness, there can be no future for a relationship between individuals or within and between nations.”What does it take to forgive? Our society tend to be one based on revenge and retribution. One of the greatest gifts that Archbishop Tutu helped to share with the world is that there is another way through forgiveness. Forgiveness is difficult. Archbishop Tutu’s granddaughter, Nyaniso Tutu-Burris, described forgiveness as an “ongoing process”. Every day you need to wake up and make the decision to forgive again. The Archbishop has written whole books on forgiveness: “Forgiveness is not forgetting; it is actually remembering -remembering and not using your right to hit back. Its a second chance for a new beginning. And the remembering part is particularly important. Especially if you don’t want to repeat what happened.”3. “Religion is like a knife: you can either use it to cut bread, or stick in someone’s back.”From Christians to Muslims to Atheists, people will argue that “other” religions cause so much of the unrest in the world today – and that isn’t necessarily wrong. But what if one uses the tenets of their faith, those based on love and compassion, to share experiences with peoples of other faiths? I have been very fortunate in my life to have worked alongside two great men of faith - the Archbishop and His Holiness the Dalai Lama. This year, with their release of The Book of Joy, I was reminded of that deep, profound friendship between the two men - two men from radically different faiths, who have come together to share with the world the peace and harmony that can be found through friendship, not despite of their differences, but because of them. As the Archbishop has said many times, “We must be ready to learn from one another, not claiming that we alone possess all truth and that somehow we have a corner on God.”4. “Resentment and anger are bad for your blood pressure and your digestion.”While the Archbishop is known for his sense of humor and this is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, There is a great deal of wisdom. A friend of the Foundation found himself getting so upset on social media because of comments that others were making that he disagreed with. Throughout the election cycle of the last year, he would spend hours upon hours arguing with friends of friends, or even complete strangers, with the end result being only that he felt more tense. I suggested to him that perhaps he just acknowledge to himself that a particular comment upset him, but then move on. He recently sent a message to me that this path has allowed him to have more time to work with youth and spend less time arguing on social media – and he feels more relaxed and energized.5. “Do your little bit of good where you are; it’s those little bits of good that overwhelm the world.” After a recent Peace3 event at Stanford University, a student came up and started to explain that with all the tragedy in the world, she felt overwhelmed by everything that she perceived needed to happen to make this world a better place. While it is true that sometimes the task at making an impact in the world can seem daunting, it doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t still try. It has been said that as one person, you might not be able to change the world, but you can change the world for one person. What can you do to make an impact in the life of one person in this new year?6. “Hope is being able to see there is light despite all of the darkness.”2016 has been a rough year for a lot of people.

I am asked all the time how we are able to keep at this excruciating pursuit ― that is, how we continue to have hope in this area of our lives in the face of intense tragedy. As we gladly put 2016 behind us and look to 2017, I have been highly reflective of what it means to have hope ― the real kind that propels us forward to act and change. I sense that is what so many of us are deeply seeking as we start this tumultuous new year.So to 2017, my resolution of hope:Two and a half years ago, my husband and I were sent home from the hospital the morning after giving birth to our son. Unlike most discharge stories you hear, our ride home didn’t include a nervous father driving cautiously below the speed limit while a frazzled mom fussed over him in the car seat. Instead, it was just the two of us in the front seats of our Corolla, driving home in complete silence. The previous evening, our son had been stillborn after battling an extremely rare congenital condition. While our kind nurses said we could stay at the hospital as long as we needed, I feared that if we didn’t leave that morning they would need to admit me forever. It was an unspeakably miserable ride home, which was mercilessly extended by rush hour traffic in Boston. I remember closing my eyes until we got home, unable to process the presence of people in other cars listening to NPR and drinking coffee, heading to their totally normal jobs for a totally normal day. How could they do such a thing while we were experiencing such deep suffering?Two and a half months ago, my husband and I boarded a Southwest flight from Wichita, Kansas back home to Boston that was ― once again ― anticipated to be with our newborn son. I had brought with me every type of infant carrier on the market and had daydreamed how the flight attendants would fawn over his tiny little fingers wrapped around my pinky. But the mother who had selected us back in June to adopt her child changed her mind just before he was born, deciding to parent him instead. So again we had to go back to our quiet home with its perfect nursery set up, just the two of us. I put on my headphones but turned on no music, closed my eyes and laid my head on my husband’s shoulder, praying that no one would say anything to me. Of course I don’t want pretzels or cookies ― how could you even ask me such a trivial question?These two lonely trips home bookended a merciless stretch of IVF cycles and miscarriages and adoption research and endless heavy decisions in between. But still, we press on in hope.__“Hope” is both a noun and a verb, but both of those classifications fall flat to the kind of hope that I speak of. As a noun, hope is exceedingly abstract. I bet if you asked 10 different people what the noun hope meant, you would get 10 different answers that vaguely alluded to other abstract concepts like trust and faith. This type of hope is too hard to grasp for pragmatists like me.But “hope” as a verb seems so submissive in the way it is typically expressed. To hope it doesn’t rain tomorrow, or to hope that your kids sleep past 5am, or to hope that your favorite soup is on the menu today - this type of hope that we typically throw into daily conversation is completely passive. In fact, I’d argue that this is the type of hope that breeds resentment. If tomorrow your kids wake up at 4:30am and it’s pouring rain and the cafe only has french onion soup rather than red lentil, then you may conclude that you had a lousy day even though you had absolutely nothing to do with what made it lousy. To hope in this sense is simply to watch the chips fall and respond accordingly whether or not they landed in your lap.To me, hope and fight are highly inter-dependent. To hope without fight is to passively and blindly expect good to come. To fight without hope is to toil in state of defeat, exhausted. But to fight alongside hope is to have an unwavering belief in the importance of a different future and a willingness to open yourself up to more pain in order to get there.__One of the strange parallels between losing our son and having our adoption fall through is they transpired in exactly the same amount of time, roughly two years apart. Our son received a terminal diagnosis early in the second trimester of our pregnancy, and passed away exactly 100 days later in July of 2014. For 100 days we loved and cared for a child who we knew, barring a miracle, we would never get to raise (I wrote about this more extensively here). The 100 days were not a guarantee - his condition was so rare that our doctors could not predict anything about how our pregnancy was going to continue. So we began each day by waking up and listening to his heart on a portable fetal doppler, a drumbeat that gave us the resolve to march onward and ask for a miracle. On the 100th morning of this ritual, the drumbeat silenced, and life as a family of three suspended.Remarkably, it was also 100 days between when a woman in Kansas selected us to adopt her child this past June, and when she informed us that she had changed her mind in September. For 100 days we grew to love a child we would ultimately never get to meet. Each night we whispered to him goodnight from thousands of miles away praying he would hear it. Then we stopped with no ceremony or closure. It was over, just like that.I believe in the importance of living one day at a time when you are in the thick of a crisis ― it’s how we survived those times when more than one single day’s worry would truly bury us. But in the moments where we needed to make a major decision about committing to this crazy dream, exiting our present and widening our perspective to the past and future was crucial. My husband and I are in our thirties, which means that if we live into our eighties we very well may have 20,000 days ahead of us. The prospect of living on this Earth for 20,000 more days without children of our own makes us infinitely more sad than the 100 days we just endured. Protecting ourselves from more pain today by giving up this hope promises exponentially more pain in the future. So we keep fighting alongside the hope that we will someday be parents because we refuse the accept the alternative, and when it gets to be too much right now we lean on our family and friends and faith to get us through.This kind of fighting hope ― fueled by perspective ― is what I am dedicated to live out in all areas of my life in 2017.__In the days after the election, I read (and re-read many times) a short but poignant essay in the New Yorker responding to Trump’s victory by one of my favorite authors, Junot Díaz. In it he wrote:“But all the fighting in the world will not help us if we do not also hope. What I’m trying to cultivate is not blind optimism but what the philosopher Jonathan Lear calls radical hope. ‘What makes this hope radical,’ Lear writes, ‘is that it is directed toward a future goodness that transcends the current ability to understand what it is.’ Radical hope is not so much something you have but something you practice; it demands flexibility, openness, and what Lear describes as ‘imaginative excellence.’ Radical hope is our best weapon against despair, even when despair seems justifiable; it makes the survival of the end of your world possible.”His piece was of course written in a very different context, but I believe this concept is transcendent and beautifully puts to words the type of hope I also speak of. Not just in parenting, but in all areas of life where I have an unwavering belief in the importance of a different future. And right now, there are many. I think it’s critically important as we all look to 2017 that we hold on to our ambitious goals in the face of our tragedies, make new ones with passion, and then fight alongside radical hope to get there. There have been many, many times in our hope to be parents where despair was justifiable, but we have survived the end of our world and continue to fight simply because we refuse to lose hope.Here’s to 2017, a year in which we fight together alongside hope. Happy New Year."

""Fur stands for the pubic hair"", wrote Freud. Since fur is a sensual object: soft, exotic, transformative, ripe with animal-otherness - it’s a highly sexualized symbol. According to art historian Joanna M. Gohmann, Ph.D, fur allows humans to safely explore behaviors often characterized as ‘animalistic’ at the expense of the non-human animal - especially their sexual animality. In sex, human animality is laid bare.But it isn’t just sex. The other reason people buy fur is because it’s a symbol of power. Power over animals and nature is an obvious starting point, but there is also a long history of fur, and specific types of fur, being used - and legally enforced through sumptuary laws - to distinguish between those in power (royalty, nobility and the wealthy) and those down the ladder - with potentially deadly consequences for those who broke the fashion laws. In many cases, dressing up in furs is a way of visually appearing to be on a higher rung of that ladder, even if the fur is ugly. This is a rare place in fashion where a symbol of power supersedes its need to be beautiful or even functional. An ugly or dowdy fur coat is still a desired object because in Western culture, the only thing more valued than beauty is power. To many people who are drawn to use the fur symbol, simply throwing a tattered, second-hand fur on top of any outfit feels transformative if not transcendent, and they might not even know why.But let’s get back to sex for a second, because while the political and economic power that fur represents can be invoked by nearly anyone, patriarchal power is the place at which the sex and power of fur tend to intersect.Dressing in fur, especially for femme-presenting people, can be interpreted as dressing as exotic prey, a trophy or a conquest, and thereby transforming into those who are pursued and overpowered by men. Wearing the skins of animals like wildcats makes the perceived difficulty (and payoff) of overpowering a dangerous predator even greater. In nature most animals will not allow humans to touch them. Touching occurs only when they are captured or killed, so the femme-presenting wearer of fur may represent the dangerous or docile sought and hunted, the desired, and ultimately the captured, killed, touched and consumed. As Brian Luke discusses in his book Brutal: Manhood and the Exploitation of Animals, many hunting writers describe hunting as a masculine, sexually-charged experience: using mating calls, mating scents, pursuing, waiting, and ultimately penetrating their victims with phallic arrows or guns and bullets, killing them, touching their previously forbidden bodies, and sometimes consuming them. They express loving the animals they capture or kill in no uncertain terms.In 1870, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s novel Venus in Furs established the motif of the fur-wearing woman as dominatrix, a sexually powerful and transgressive being, a predator with weapons who is not necessarily overpowered by man, but still maintains the exotic otherness of her animality as symbolized in fur and leather.Today, for most people, fur is not a necessity. High-tech synthetics outperform fur. But to some, the fur garment is an irresistible status-symbol, representing all or any of the things in the spectrum of power and sex - under the guise of utility, of course. Strangely, fur has also come to represent rebelliousness and transgression. In the wake of the anti-fur movement that reached global proportions in the 1990s and early 2000s, the power of fur is actually reinforced, which may seem counterintuitive considering the increased and ongoing release of exposés and investigations that document how horrific life and death is for animals caught in traps or languishing on fur farms. Yet the issue is progressively polarized, and for many people who take pride in wearing fur, they perceive those who are anti-fur as misled do-gooders at best (and terrorists at worst) and reject the supposed wholesomeness of compassion for animals in favor of an ostensibly rebellious symbol of ruthless power.How does this happen? It’s simple. In the same way that an ugly fur coat proves that power supersedes aesthetic beauty, a desire to appear powerful also supersedes virtuousness. In his book A Philosophy of Evil, contemporary philosopher Lars Svendsen argues that, “it's always easier to do evil than to do good; easier to hurt another human being in ways that will haunt them for the rest of their lives than to provide a comparable amount of help”. Wickedness is easy access to power. Virtuousness is a difficult path to power. Therefore, the willingness to harm (or at least the appearance of a willingness to harm) is rewarded with symbolic power. The more cruel a production process, the higher the payoff is perceived to be. We see this in cuisine with things like foie gras, ortolan and veal, and we see it in fashion with things like skins and furs. "

Excitement about the proposal ignores the boring reality: The biggest problem for the e-commerce giant to solve before it can start commercial drone delivery in the U.S. is government regulations, not technology.The patent, which Amazon applied for in 2014 and was awarded in April, describes an airship that would hover over metropolitan areas above commercial airspace at 45,000 feet. It would house a fleet of drones as well as a select inventory of products routinely restocked by smaller shuttle ships. If a customer ordered something stored on a nearby airship, a drone would be instructed to “engage the item,” navigate to the delivery location and arrive “within minutes.”The shuttles could also deliver workers to their jobs in the air ― if a human touch is even needed. The patent notes the possibility that the process could be fully automated or controlled remotely.One of the benefits of an airborne warehouse is the ability to move around depending on weather or demand, according to the patent. Amazon uses the example of a football game: An airship could be filled in advance with popular items, then hover above the field, conveniently displaying advertisements for the items it has in stock. Fans could potentially buy food or a jersey from their phones while watching the game, and a drone would deliver their order a few minutes later. Logan Campbell, chief executive of drone consulting firm Aerotas, said that, while the idea is exciting, there are so many existing regulatory roadblocks that it’s pointless to speculate about the specific challenges of building an effective airship-based delivery system. “It’s way, way, way too far out to actually say that we’ll be seeing a massive airship as the mothership to 100 drones in the near future,” Campbell said. “Right now it’s a crazy idea, and it’s a research project. It might turn into something, but it might not.”“All good ideas start as crazy ideas, and then you kind of work them out,” he added.Leavitt noted in a “Good Morning America” interview that companies often file lots of patents applications, and they don’t necessarily mean the company is putting resources into a particular project. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment Friday, and it’s unclear if it is seriously working on airships or if the idea is logistically, financially and technically sound. While the airship idea brings to mind zeppelins zipping over science-fiction cityscapes, Amazon’s push for faster delivery with the help of drones is far from fantasy. Earlier this month, it made its first Prime Air drone delivery from a British warehouse (firmly planted on Earth) to a customer two miles away. He received the test order, an Amazon Fire and popcorn, 13 minutes after making the purchase. However, in the U.S., Amazon has sparred with regulators and still faces challenges before it can use delivery drones at all. NASA has begun testing to develop a separate air traffic control system for drones, working in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration, but isn’t expected to finish trials or make recommendations until 2019. In the meantime, the FAA introduced its Part 107 rules to broadly regulate commercial drone use this summer, despite Amazon’s objections.The rules currently make Amazon’s plans impossible, whether or not an airship is involved, and prohibit such drone operations as flying above 400 feet, in darkness, from a moving aircraft, over people’s heads and outside an operator’s sightline.Campbell said Amazon has made impressive technological progress but hasn’t had similar success on the policy side. “If we’re talking about consumers actually getting deliveries, then this has been overhyped,” Campbell said. “It’s not entirely Amazon’s fault; it’s regulations that are challenging. Amazon has tried to take on the FAA, and so far they have not made much progress.” The FAA will grant narrow waivers from some of the Part 107 rules, and in August a startup that makes drones for the agriculture industry received an exemption to fly outside of an operator’s field of vision. Some experts believe the FAA rules are less a stumbling block for Amazon than a first step toward creating a better legal system for drones, according to Newsweek.Delivering packages by drone at all seemed at first like “a loopy idea, far-fetched and the subject of instant mockery on Twitter,” as New York Times technology writer David Streitfeld wrote when Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos first mentioned it in 2013. Now it’s considered all but a certainty, even if the timeline is hazy. Other companies are exploring or testing drone package delivery, including Google, Walmart and the United Parcel Service. Amazon holds a separate patent for a system of light poles that would serve as miniature drone docking stations. There’s no indication it’s any more viable than airships, but it seems to show a company rigorously exploring drone delivery from every angle.  Considering how the company’s other out-there ideas have worked out ― like entirely upending the publishing industry ― it’s safe to say it’s too early to write off flying warehouses. "

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a former Democratic presidential candidate, has vowed to hold President-elect Donald Trump accountable for his promises to help working people.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5867e8d11900002a000e25f4.jpeg?cache=1h2QCzhy6D&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) warned Donald Trump that the president-elect would face stiff opposition if he tries to privatize the Department of Veterans Affairs. The remarks from Sanders, a former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, was a response to a report that Trump is considering the move.“Privatizing the VA would be an insult to the more than 22 million veterans who risked their lives to defend our country and it would significantly lower the quality of health care they receive. Our goal, shared by The American Legion and other major veterans’ organizations, must be to improve the VA, not destroy it,” Sanders said in a statement Friday.“We will vigorously oppose any and all efforts to privatize the VA,” Sanders added.A Trump transition team official told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that full-scale privatization was “one of the options on the table,” as is a plan to allow veterans to opt out of the public system.Trump is also considering candidates to lead the VA with ties to Concerned Veterans for American, a group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers that backs privatization, the The Washington Post reported earlier this month. CVA, unlike traditional veterans groups, such as the American Legion, arose four years ago and is primarily focused on politics rather than services.The American Legion, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Paralyzed Veterans of America and many other veterans organizations oppose privatizing the VA because they say that only a publicly run medical system, free from concerns about profit, has the versatility to serve the special needs of military veterans. They also worry that the vouchers the government would provide veterans to purchase private care under some proposals would fail to keep pace with the cost of services.And creating a path for veterans to opt out of the VA system could ultimately sap it of funding, these advocates fear.Few veterans advocates dispute that the VA continues to struggle with a major backlog that has resulted in veterans failing to receive critical health care. Amid rising anger about the wait times and reports that VA officials were deliberately covering them up, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned in May 2014.Sanders, then-chairman of the VA committee, negotiated a bipartisan VA reform bill in the summer of 2014 that increased VA funding and permitted veterans to seek private care under select circumstances. Republican colleagues, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), have praised Sanders’ efforts. As a presidential candidate, Trump frequently touted the support he received from individual veterans and promised to improve the VA. “There will be no more waiting in line,” Trump said in July.But if Trump chooses to reform the VA through partial or total privatization, he may end up on a collision course with the American Legion and other mainstream groups popular among the veterans whose support he has trumpeted.Privatization is a “slap in the face to what we stand for,” American Legion Executive Director Verna Jones said at a meeting with transition team officials earlier this month."

Under the four-day program, any person who adopts a pet before New Year’s Day will have all adoption fees waived.Tam said the Hawaiian Humane Society wanted to energize its adoption efforts and find homes for its available shelter animals so that it could free up resources to take care of the more than 270 dogs they rescued from an abusive animal shelter back in October.Most of those recently rescued animals, Tam explained, aren’t ready for adoption, but they do require a lot of extra time and care.The adoption event turned out to be extremely successful and, on Thursday, a woman identified by the Hawaiian Humane Society as Jan visited the shelter and welcomed its very last pooch into her own family.“The community has been amazing,” Tam told HuffPost. “They’ve just been supportive and wanting to adopt, so we’ve been really fortunate.”Of course, the shelter didn’t stay empty for long after Beauty’s adoption.Since the Hawaiian Humane Society has an open-admissions policy (which means it will never turn away an animal that is dropped off at its shelter), it can receive up to 65 new animals every day, Tam told HuffPost.Fifteen animals were brought to the shelter Friday, but by the end of the day, all but three had been adopted, according to Tam.An estimated 7.6 million animals are dropped off at animal shelters across the U.S. every year, but only 2.7 million are adopted, according to statistics gathered by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.What’s more, only 35 percent of dogs that enter a shelter are adopted into new families, ASPCA reported.So if you’re considering adding a member to your family, avoid abusive puppy mills and adopt a companion animal from a shelter.Look how happy it’s made Beauty and Jan!"

About 600 are joining boss Gary Bertch on the cruise along with his wife, Becky, who founded the company with her husband in 1977. They’ll head down to Miami on chartered flights, spend a night in a five-star hotel, then hit the ocean. Spouses can also come free.The rest of the workers opted to take the week off and collect a $900 bonus.“We’d love to have everyone come on vacation with us but know it isn’t possible for all for personal reasons, so we wanted to have that alternative available to them,” Bertch told ABC News.The company started giving mass vacation incentives periodically in 1989. “We went to Acapulco that time,” Bertch said. “We did several cruises to various locations, various ports. And we did Hawaii. That was probably our biggest trip.” But the getaways stopped when times got tough in 2008.Bertch decided to revive the vacations. He challenged employees a year ago to meet certain goals, offering the cruise as an incentive. “We were anticipating we’d have better sales again this year,” he told the Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier. “We just tried to get all of our people pumped up a little more to achieve the various goals, both customer-oriented goals and financial goals.”Workers say the company is a special place to work.“I work right across the hallway from our vice president, Becky, and 20 feet away from Gary Bertch, and I can tell you that they have an open-door policy, and they always welcome anyone to come in and speak to them any time without a meeting or appointment,” marketing associate Tony Means told ABC.“We all get along pretty well here.

During the economic downturn, nearly 1/3 of all private sector jobs were created in Texas, many of which were in the energy sector.Which is exactly what makes Rick such an outstanding choice for the Department of Energy. Yes, I am aware of him infamously calling for the department to be shut down. However, that was because he felt that he and his fellow Texans had a handle on energy production in their state and he did not feel the federal government needed to infringe upon that.But now, he will get a chance to share Texas's successful economic and energy strategies with the rest of the country. And fear not, alternative energy advocates. For those of you who are so worried about what Rick's approach to energy will be, let Hudson Clean Energy CEO, Neil Auerbach put your mind at ease.As Mr. Auerbach wrote at CNBC.com Wednesday regarding Rick's energy record while Governor of Texas, ""During his tenure, natural gas production climbed 50 percent, while oil production soared by 260 percent. However, the growth of the wind industry under Perry's tenure was even more dramatic, growing from only 116 megawatts of production in 2000 to over 11,000 megawatts in 2013.""Auerbach added that, ""If Texas was a country, it would rank as the fifth largest producer of wind power in the world,"" while praising the former Governor's ""pragmatic approach to economic growth with energy at its core.""That's precisely what we need: a practical voice with the experience and knowledge to guide our energy policy in the right direction.As you can see, under Rick's leadership, Texas did produce a lot of oil and natural gas, but wind power grew exponentially as well. That is because he understands that all energy options should be on the table and we should be willing to use anything that produces positive results. That is the strategy of a forward thinking, market-oriented individual, who truly comprehends that results matter more than intent or ideology.President-elect Trump promised a no-nonsense, businesslike approach to government and by putting Rick in charge of the Department of Energy, he continues to show that his words are more than just hollow rhetoric.I'm excited for my friend and look forward to the terrific job he will do in making America's energy policies and production great again!"

John King has held a statewide post in government as head of education in New York State.

He even attended public school as a child.Betsy DeVos has none of those qualifications. She has never been a public school student and never worked as a teacher, administrator or state level education bureaucrat. Betsy DeVos is less qualified than John King.Arne Duncan was a barely qualified choice for Secretary of Education. But Arne Duncan had been responsible for a major urban school system, so he had at least some vague notion of what happens in a public school system. He had political connections not because he had money to throw around, but because he was a good and loyal friend to people with bigger political profiles. Hell, he was a good basketball player, meaning he was at least exposed to the concept of teamwork and the idea of working hard to achieve a goal.Betsy DeVos has never run an organization as sprawling and varied as an urban school district, and has no experience with any such educational system. Betsy DeVos is less qualified than Arne Duncan.Eva Moskowitz was a terrible choice for Secretary of Education. But Eva Moskowitz built a school-flavored business from the ground up, so she has at least some vague notion of the many moving parts involved in making a school work. And while Moskowitz is by no means wealth-impaired, she has showed political savvy and an ability to make friends in high places to get her own way.Betsy DeVos has no experience in the inner workings of a school or a business, and certainly not an organization that wants to be both. And she only knows one way to build political connections -- writing checks. Betsy DeVos is less qualified than Eva Moskowitz.Michelle Rhee (ex-DC chancellor) was an unspeakably awful choice for Secretary of Education. But like Duncan, she has been in charge of a major urban school district. She has stood in a classroom and tried to teach. And she is experienced at getting other people to invest in her vision and displayed a real gift for generating positive PR, even when she doesn't deserve it.Betsy DeVos has never run a school district. She has never taught. And she has never had to convince anyone to back her idea, because she can bankroll it all herself. Nor has she ever displayed any talent for being the public PR-friendly face of anything.All four of the above terrible, terrible choices for Secretary of Education worked their way up from a poor or middle class background, learning how to sell themselves, start an enterprise, make friends, gather influence, and just generally make their way in the world. Professionally, they have had to learn how to work other people to get what they want.Betsy DeVos was born rich, married rich, and has never had to build influence or make a case for her own views by any method other than exercising her bank account (a bank account that she never did a lick of work to fill up in the first place). A Secretary of Education has to build influence, make a case, sell an idea, and do the political work to push across policies. DeVos has never had to do any of these things; and a Secretary of Education cannot build political clout or support by flexing her personal wealth. DeVos has ideas about education, but she has never done any of the legwork or built understanding about how to implement her ideas beyond writing a check or hiring some people to astroturf support for programs. She has simply bought allies and bankrolled compliance; there is no reason to believe that she knows how to win agreement and cooperation from people who are not financially beholden to her. If DeVos had not been born rich, if she had not married rich, we would not be having this conversation, and she would not be a person of influence in education. DeVos is one of those masks that money puts on when it wants to walk around and do stuff; without the money, she's an empty sack with no more importance or influence than a regular citizen, or a teacher.The four candidates listed above are all lousy choices for the post, and yet all of them have qualifications that DeVos lacks. In fact, before we even start to discuss just how terrible and destructive her ideas about public education are, we should be talking about her complete lack of qualifications to run a federal department. She is not familiar with how schools work. She is not familiar with how large metropolitan or state systems for education work. She is not familiar with how to work with people who are not on her personal payroll. Her political experience is running advocacy groups of allies, not building coalitions that include opponents. She was born at the top, and worked her way to the top. Bottom line -- even if you think that Betsy DeVos is bang-on correct in her education ideas (I disagree, but let's skip that for the moment) there is no reason at all to believe that she has any of the tools necessary to succeed as head of the U.S. Department of Education. Betsy DeVos is supremely unqualified for the post of Secretary of Education, quite possibly the least qualified appointee on the Trump list. The Senate should not approve her appointment."
75,POLITICS,"Toilets, Trials, and Tolls: Cleaning Up After Pat McCrory","Harold Lloyd, ContributorWake Forest Law Professor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/toilets-trials-and-tolls_b_13914446.html,,2016-12-31,2016-12-31-1483209889-2114035-NCCoatofArms1876.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-31-1483209889-2114035-NCCoatofArms1876-thumb.jpg,"We all know that North Carolina's Gov. Pat McCrory hastily signed HB2 only to acknowledge that pre-existing state law discrimination remedies should not have been eliminated by that bill. Unfortunately, HB2 (which did much more damage than just eliminating previous private law causes of action) wasn't his or his party's only blunder. By the Charlotte Observer's tally, his party's legislature is losing an embarrassingly ever-growing number of matters in court including voter restrictions, abortion ultrasounds, preschool caps, retention elections, gerrymandered state legislative districts, gerrymandered congressional districts, Wake County school board districts, Wake County commissioner districts, teacher tenure, annexation, same-sex marriage, Planned Parenthood cuts, and coal ash. Were all that not bad enough, the legislature has ended the year by passing controversial Senate Bill 4 (which includes changing the board of elections & making other elections changes; making Supreme Court elections partisan; and modifying appellate review of cases) and by passing controversial House Bill 17 (which includes requiring senatorial ""advice & consent"" for certain gubernatorial appointments; reducing the governor's exempt employees from 1500 to 425; and otherwise limiting gubernatorial powers). These bills were hastily passed in special sessions that were initially publicized to provide relief for victims of Hurricane Matthew with little other notice and without reasonably-sufficient time for thorough legislative and public review. True to form, departing Gov. Pat. McCrory signed both pieces of legislation even though he found one bill in part ""wrong and short-sighted."" North Carolina's government is obviously broken.Unfortunately, this breakdown involves more than broken and embarrassing legislation. Infrastructure and basic governmental services are suffering in puzzling ways as well. For example, both Pat McCrory and the unlawfullly-gerrymandered legislature have collectively  refused to terminate a baffling fifty-year toll contract with a European company for toll lanes on I-77 despite much voter uproar (although termination did receive a hearing in the State House of Representatives only to die a mysterious death in the Senate). Under the terms of that baffling contract, the State is handing over to the European company for fifty years a number of HOV lanes that the state has already built and paid for. The European company is building--with financial assistance from North Carolina and a federally-backed loan--additional lanes that can only bear non-truck traffic. The European company will then be able to charge variable so-called ""market-rate"" tolls on ""its"" lanes for fifty years. Those varying tolls will somehow be determined based on current traffic. Drivers thus won't know from time to time just how much those tolls will be. Additionally, North Carolina has guaranteed minimum sums to the European company and has further agreed not to build competing lanes for the fifty-year period. Voters could and did fire un-gerrymandered McCrory in part because of this but many legislators were in safely-gerrymandered seats. North Carolina's government is obviously broken.Now for the good news. Because North Carolina has suffered so much bad publicity under Pat McCrory and the unlawfully-gerrymandered legislature, I want to give a shout out to North Carolina's Constitution. North Carolina's Constitution offers wise counsel in addition to various protections and safeguards to eliminate the mischief created by the Republican legislature. Article I, Section 35 of the North Carolina State Constitution in particular provides: ""A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty."" As a part of the body of the Constitution itself, this language instructs and empowers us to protect ""the blessings of liberty"" by reaffirming the fundamental principles underlying our State Constitution. Because we have such a strong Constitution, I reject claims that North Carolina is no longer a democracy. The government is broken but our basic laws are not.Here are textual highlights of some of these fundamental Constitutional principles, guarantees, and rights: Article I, Section 2 provides that all political power comes from ""the people."" An illegally-gerrymandered legislature on its face runs afoul of this rule and courts should not be bashful in providing appropriate remedies. Article I, Section 6 provides that ""The legislative, executive, and supreme judicial powers of the State government shall be forever separate and distinct from each other."" To the extent the legislature attempts to usurp such distinct executive power in any legislation, the courts should provide a remedy. By definition, such remedial power lies within the separate judicial power affirmed in Section 6. Article I, Section 18 provides in part that ""all courts shall be open"" and ""right and justice shall be administered without favor, denial, or delay."" Governor Cooper, legislators shut out by the majority or by others in their own majority party, and affected voters are all thus expressly entitled to meaningful judicial access. Article I, Section 19 provides in part that ""No person shall be denied equal protection of the laws."" There is no express exclusion of minority-party legislators here. Minority-party legislators should have equal rights to read, review, and debate bills rather than face bills dumped on the legislative floor to be passed in a day. In fact, shouldn't there be heightened equal-protection scrutiny here since the majority wields more power? The literal text and ancient history underlying Article II Section 22 of the State Constitution are consistent with such protections. That Section provides: ""All bills and resolutions of a legislative nature shall be read three times in each house before they become laws, and shall be signed by the presiding officers of both houses."" On its face, the phrase ""three readings"" is hard to reconcile with the practice of dumping legislation on the floor without sufficient time for reading, investigation, or debate by those who are seeing the legislation for the first time on the day of passage. History agrees with text. As John V. Orth notes in his book on the Constitution, this requirement of three readings ""comes from English parliamentary procedure, anciently designed to prevent spur-of-the-moment legislation."" (""Revenue bills have even further restrictions as I'll note below. I'll propose below that we correct our current Section 22 practices to conform with plain text and ancient purpose.) Finally, none of these principles works without the further principle that governors, legislators, officers of the court, and all others should speak the truth. Thus, Article I, Section 14 of the State Constitution affirms ""freedom of speech and of the press"" while wisely noting that ""every person shall be held responsible for their abuse."" Consistent with this, Rule 8.4 of the North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct provides that it is ""professional misconduct"" for a lawyer to ""engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation."" The comments to Rule 8.4 go even further: ""Lawyers holding public office assume legal responsibilities going beyond those of other citizens."" North Carolina has high standards indeed. How do we enforce these high standards? As for rushed and poorly-thought-out legislation, perhaps we can begin a cure by changing the way we now read Article II, Section 22. Despite the plain meaning of ""reading"" and the ancient purpose noted above of preventing hasty legislation, ""readings"" under Section 22 are now treated as mere formal requirements generally satisfied by simply reading out bill numbers or titles. This devolution has allowed the ""passage"" in a day of HB2 as well as the hasty ""passage"" of other controversial legislation. Shouldn't we demand instead that ""reading"" reflect the common sense notion that all legislators and the public actually have a reasonable period to read, comprehend, and reasonably analyze a bill before it becomes law? Again, Article I, Section 19 would support such a reading. It provides in part that ""No person shall be denied equal protection of the laws."" There is no express exclusion of minority-party legislators here. Again, shouldn't minority-party legislators have equal rights to read, review, and debate bills rather than face bills dumped on the legislative floor to be passed in a day? Again, shouldn't there be heightened scrutiny here since the majority wields more power? And don't the people of the State have the right to have all legislators fully participate? As noted above, Article I, Section 2 provides that all political power comes from ""the people."" Preventing full participation by representatives of any of the people on its face runs afoul of this rule and courts should not be bashful in providing appropriate remedies. Had all Republican and Democratic legislators had equal time to read HB2 and thus see that it stripped racial minorities and women of their right to sue for employment discrimination, minority and female legislators who hastily thought they favored the bill might well have voted differently regardless of party affiliation. Why shouldn't HB2, Senate Bill 4, and House Bill 17 all fail under this better reading of Section 22 which is supported by both Article I, Section 19 and Article I, Section 2? (In asking these questions, I'm aware that Article II, Section 23 governing ""revenue bills"" has such additional requirements as requiring readings on three different days. Some might argue that leaving the three-different-day requirement out of Section 22 means that extensive and complex bills can be dumped on the floor and passed in a day so long as the bills are not ""revenue bills."" I don't find this a good argument. The drafters of Section 22 no doubt wisely recognized that not all non-revenue bills require detailed debate and consideration. For example, a non-revenue bill correcting a misspelling of ""the"" as ""hte"" doesn't need three days to accomplish its reasoned goal. I imagine the drafters were depending upon the good faith of legislators operating under Section 22 to allocate time fairly and appropriately.) As for truth telling, voters' remedies at the ballot box are of course limited as long as we have our current unlawful gerrymandering. However, remedial elections are coming soon and voters should be vocal that they will hold legislators accountable for their words as well as deeds. Additionally, lawyer legislators and executive branch members must comply with Rule 8.4 and the heightened obligations of lawyers noted by the comments to the rules. No gerrymandering prohibits calling out such lawyers and demanding that they do better. For example, Republican legislators claim they had no year-end plans to pack the North Carolina Supreme Court while Gov. Pat McCrory claims legislators did have such plans. If Pat McCrory is telling the truth about plans to pack the Supreme Court, how can any lawyer legislators' deception about a matter as grave as packing the Supreme Court not violate Rule 8.4 and the noted comments to the Rule? Lawyers after all are officers of the court. Let's not forget that the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House are both lawyers bound by Rule 8.4 and its comment that ""Lawyers holding public office assume legal responsibilities going beyond those of other citizens."" By mentioning specific starting places for reform, I don't mean to suggest there are no others. Instead, I want to start more State Constitutional dialogue as we hopefully begin to undo the recent governmental mischief. I also want us to keep Article I, Section 35 front and center. Let's frequently refer to the fundamental principles that underlie our Constitution and democracy. If we do, we will fix the mess. I write this article in such a spirit."

No real surprise there.There are advocates for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, who say that statistics show that 21 million more Americans got health care who didn't have it before, and that those least able to afford it were the ones who benefitted from the ACA. There are advocates against the Affordable Care Act who point to what they say is a broken system, with insurers exiting the marketplace and premiums rising by double and in some cases triple digits -- so much so as to render plans in the ""Affordable"" Care Act unaffordable. Where do you start with a topic as broad and overwhelming as this? Trying to look at it on balance, there are some things the ACA got right and some it didn't. Let's look at a few key issues that I think need to be addressed:Get Costs Under ControlThe future of Obamacare is uncertain with president-elect Donald Trump about to be sworn in. There are a couple of things that we know for certain, however -- insurance premiums will spike next year, and things will change under Trump. Trump has pledged to repeal and replace Obamacare, so stay tuned, there are going to be ongoing conversations about this.A recently released government report says that health care premiums are going up in 2017. They're going up a lot. In order for the Affordable Care Act or any health insurance to work, you need everyone in the pool, so to speak. But what's happening is that only the sick patients are joining the pool. So the healthy patients are opting out and not paying premiums - they're not getting health insurance in many cases. Health insurance companies are losing millions of dollars and they're pulling out and not providing coverage under the Affordable Care Act. We're seeing that across the country. According to a report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), prices across the country could go up by double digits, although not everywhere. Premiums in some states could double while premiums in other states could actually drop. A mid-level benchmark plan could increase an average of about 25 percent. But there's going to be less choice. One fifth of consumers can only pick plans from one insurer. Let's take a worst-case scenario. Let's talk about the state of Arizona. One of the unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical single, 27-year-old male and the benchmark second-lowest cost silver plan -- that premium would jump significantly. So what does that look like? A $200 monthly premium in 2016 would become close to $400 in 2017. People who get their insurance through work probably won't see the spikes as much, because they're not going through healthcare.gov for their insurance, which is what this article is focusing on. But their prices will be going up as well. It's happening across the country. And we're talking right now about the basic plan sticker prices. There are subsidies available if you qualify that will bring the price down, and as people make less, there will be increased subsidies for that. So the key lesson is a simple one: you need to do your homework, look at different health plans, get a good review of the plans and see what's best for you.  Have you ever been to a restaurant, paid what you thought was your bill, left, and then weeks later gotten a half-dozen or so bills in the mail related to your service at that restaurant? No? You say you haven't? Perhaps you got a bill from the sous chef, who was an independent contractor not working directly for the restaurant? Maybe one from the food expediter, and then the one from the pastry chef, the maitre'd who escorted you to your table, the busboy who cleaned and set the table before you sat down and then cleared dishes after each course and filled water glasses? No? And just think -- some of those people were in your preferred network of restaurant service providers (and you got a good deal on the cost of their services), but some weren't (and you were charged what looks like an exorbitant amount).  Another issue related to costs is transparency. We must know clearly what treatments will cost. Have you ever been to a restaurant, paid what you thought was your bill, left, and then weeks later gotten a half-dozen or so bills in the mail related to your service at that restaurant? No? You say you haven't? Perhaps you got a bill from the sous chef, who was an independent contractor not working directly for the restaurant? Maybe one from the food expediter, and then the one from the pastry chef, the maitre'd who escorted you to your table, the busboy who cleaned and set the table before you sat down and then cleared dishes after each course and filled water glasses? No? And just think -- some of those workers were in your preferred network of restaurant service providers (and you got a good deal on the cost of their services), but some weren't (and you were charged what looks like an exorbitant amount). Of course, you had no idea on the night you visited and no control over whether or not any of your preferred restaurant service providers were on duty.Sounds kind of silly, doesn't it? I mean, who would go to a restaurant that charged like that? Who would go to a restaurant that blind-sided you with bills weeks after you dined there until your total bill at that restaurant ended up being about 10 times what you thought you would pay? Certainly not I, not you ... not anyone, I would suspect.So why should we put up with an arrangement like that with our health care costs? We need simplified, complete and total transparency into the costs of our care when we enter the hospital for a scheduled procedure, or even for emergency treatment. There should be no hidden costs that a patient gets hit with weeks or months after the fact.How, then, do we get costs under control? I would propose the kind of plan that Dr. Ben Carson has championed -- that we create Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) for people from the day that they are born to the day that they die, at which time they can pass any money in their HSA on. We can pay for these HSAs with the same traditional dollars that we currently pay for health care. Even if the government populates everyone's Health Savings Account -- all 315,000,000 of us in the US at $2,000 a year, that's $630 billion dollars. That's not a whole lot compared to what we're spending now, and everybody would have health care and you could always add more to your plan on your own. What you add on your own should be pretax and never be taxed, thus allowing everyone to save taxes and save for their heath. Your employer could add to it, anybody could add onto it; but everybody would have basic care. And that's what we're trying to do. If we bring it into the free market, that makes it work much better. But we also need to incorporate tort reform, and digital, electronic medical records. I would embed those records in a microchip that the patient can keep, rather than have them floating in cyberspace. I think people's medical records are much too important and much too private to be drifting in cyberspace. Those are some of the major components of the program, and I think that could be done for considerably less money than we're spending now. Also, to expand on a point above, we need to give people the ability to shift HSA funds within a family or to anyone of their choice. So if one member of a family or a friend or anyone needs a little more help with coverage during a challenging illness or injury, people can shift some of their funds to that individual. We're essentially making each family their own insurance company. This can provide families with an enormous amount of flexibility; and when a person dies, they can pass their HSA funds along to a family member or members. It gives you enormous flexibility without a middleman. Now, it doesn't take care of catastrophic health care, but you can buy a catastrophic health care policy, and it'll cost you a lot less because the vast majority of medical issues will be taken care of through your HSA. Because 80% of the medical encounters a patient has are going to be handled through HSAs, you won't have a big burden on major medical or catastrophic insurance. So the costs of that will plummet, and it will be much easier to acquire. And I would make that something you could acquire from any place in the country or even any place in the world that met our US insurance standards.By doing this, we're putting the responsibility for health care in the hands of the patient and the health care provider. What do you need for good health care? You need a patient and you need a provider. Along came a middleman to facilitate the relationship and now the middleman is the primary entity with the patient and the health care provider at its beck and call. That doesn't make any sense.Having individual HSAs also can help incentivize people to become more immersive in their overall health care rather than just looking for ways to treat the symptoms of their illnesses. This helps get to the core of and individual's health care, and that is to help that individual understand, manage and maintain proper health as best they can through proper nutrition and exercise and by ""keeping your inner army strong"". Now, to preserve as much of that $2,000 a year HSA money provided by the government and the additional amount people choose to add (funded with pretax dollars so individuals have less taxes and become incentivized to shelter even more funds for health care), individuals may become more aware of the impact of their own health care decisions on their own bottom line. Maybe they'll consume fewer cheeseburgers or milkshakes within a month and eat more fruits and vegetables; or perhaps smoke less or quit smoking altogether; or engage in a regular walking or workout routine. Who knows where it could lead? Many people won't save -- after all HSAs aren't a new concept and a vast number of people don't have them, even though they're currently available through some employers. But with baby boomers retiring and younger workers transitioning to self-employment as technology and artificial intelligence take over jobs people were previously performing, the focus should be on decreasing a person's overall tax burden by being able to spend for health care with pre-tax dollars. Recognize that in America we spend twice as much per capita on health care as many other countries. And yet we have these horrible access problems. So we have adequate resources, we just don't use them in an efficient way. ""What I propose we should do to open access up to more individuals is to expand the emergency room model. If you think about it, there's only really one place where, 24-7, 365 days of the year, you can be seen by a physician -- and that's in the ER. So we need to expand on that model. Let's multiply what works.""  Improve Access to Health Care Even if you have an HSA, even if you have catastrophic insurance, if you can't get access to your doctor, that's a problem. And right now, it can take weeks to see your primary care doctor for an appointment. Averages vary widely, depending on location, and hover around 14-24 days.In our current system, even with the advent of Obamacare, it won't get better; it will get worse. I'm worried, because if you look at it statistically, by 2030, which isn't that far away, one out of two people -- 50 percent of the US population -- are going to be obese. One out of three of us, by 2030, are going to have diabetes. In addition to that, there are aging baby boomers, and we're only at the beginning of that generation's march to retirement age. That will be ongoing for another 20 years. So there's a big stress on our system that will continue to grow over the next couple decades.What I propose we should do to open access up to more individuals is to expand the emergency room model. If you think about it, there's only really one place where, 24-7, 365 days of the year, you can be seen by a physician -- and that's in the ER. So we need to expand on that model. Let's multiply what works. What does the anatomy of that solution look like?Emergency rooms have become dangerously overcrowded (see my write-up on ER issues: The Emerging State of Medical Care In Our Nation's Emergency Rooms). It may sound counter-intuitive, but sending more people to the emergency room is my proposed solution. Instead of offering only emergency services, however, the ER would encompass mental health and primary care clinics and in essence create a ""central care system,"" allowing more people to be seen. Emergency rooms already provide 24-hour care to people who are in need of urgent medical attention, but also for those whose work schedules or other issues make it impossible to be seen during regular clinic hours. In the ER, the infrastructure already exists to see anyone with a common cold to mental health issues to heart attacks and strokes 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; obtain labs, X-rays and CT scans. Within an ER environment, people can get these done same-day; right now, it takes days to more likely weeks to get these scheduled through a Primary Care Physician (PCP). It's logical to use what already works. It's also logical to provide significantly more funding to these emergency departments to carry this extra burden. We don't even need to spend more, we just need to redistribute already allocated health care funds, since currently emergency care represents less than 2 percent of the nation's health care expenditure.However, it is a dangerous fantasy to think that urgent care centers or mini-clinics can eliminate ER overcrowding. While urgent care facilities are staffed with competent medical providers and use the best technology for many injuries and illnesses, they lack the expertise and the amount of resources to handle true emergencies. The wrong patient visiting an urgent care center in order to save money or time could well wind up costing a life. Urgent care centers are very much needed and should continue to be available, but they are no substitute for emergency care. We need to increase funding these safety nets within our health care system. I think the problem with ERs, as I've mentioned previously, is that they must treat you even if you don't have any insurance. So there has to be a mechanism by which when people walk in for treatment and they're uninsured, the facility has to be compensated by the work they do for patients from somewhere -- and this is where the government comes in. The government has to fund ERs to some degree.With today's 24-hour lifestyle, we can buy groceries, fly across the world, tweet a message to thousands of people, and even work out at the gym at any time, day or night. Medical care has to adapt to the fast-paced world in which we live. When a patient comes into the hospital central care system, he or she will initially present to a main check-in area where staff will determine how urgently the individual needs to be seen. A person experiencing a heart attack will be sent immediately to the emergency department, but a child with bronchitis will be directed to see another qualified practitioner quickly in the adjacent clinic or urgent care. By the same token, patients presenting with problems that do not need urgent treatment will be asked to schedule an appointment with a doctor at a local clinic within a couple of days.With the central care system, there will be physician assistants and nurse practitioners who are available to treat less urgent issues and thereby reduce waiting times. In this way more people can be seen appropriately, without sacrificing quality or timeliness of care. Think of a place like this as a hub. Patients come into a central location initially to be triaged. For a patient who is having or has had a heart attack -- off he goes through the big double doors for immediate care; for someone with a broken leg -- off he goes through door No. 7 to the orthopedist for a complete workup; for an elderly woman who is feverish, coughing uncontrollably and has had a history of pneumonia recently -- off she goes through door No. 3 for treatment.Of course patients needing to see providers for less critical situations will still spend some time in the central care waiting room, just as they currently do in doctors' offices and urgent care clinics. Using that time to educate people will improve understanding about disease prevention, healthy living, vaccinations, home treatments for common illnesses like flu and colds, and other issues related to health - call it ""wait to educate"". Introducing basic health education while people wait to see providers in the central care system may help them to avoid or more effectively manage chronic diseases and other common health issues. If we use the wait to educate concept, the information can be spread by word of mouth and it has the potential to benefit the entire community. In addition, there can be a virtual arm to this waiting room using a platform like liveClinic (described below).  Get Third Parties Under Control The center of the epicenter of health care is the doctor-patient relationship. Any other forces or third-party entities that come in should not be inserted between the doctor and the patient, but should be aligned behind the patient, supporting the patient, and/or behind the doctor, supporting the doctor.Now, the first two ideas I've outlined above are certainly workable, but unless you manage the special interest groups and protect the doctor-patient relationship -- the insurers, the lawyers, the lobbyists to name a few -- it will chip away at that doctor-patient relationship, which is the core. Third parties pull down the relationship, making it more difficult for the doctor and more difficult for the patient. With respect to health care, a third-party is typically known as the insurance company that pays the provider on behalf of the insured. In our current system, the consumer pays a co-pay -- only a small portion of the actual cost. At first glance, you may be just fine with that arrangement. You probably don't know and will never know the full retail value of the procedure and what negotiations the health care companies have done behind the scenes. So you don't really get a true sense of what something costs. Let's look at this from the perspective of a health insurer -- and we're not bashing health insurance here, health insurance is a good thing. Insurers have saved countless families from going bankrupt due to health care costs (which is the number one reason for bankruptcy in America). Insurance is NOT about saving money -- it's about protecting people financially and protecting people's assets when they have a catastrophic loss. People pool their money together by paying premiums every year so that when they have a big loss they don't get hit so hard financially. Originally insurance was supposed to be for big catastrophic losses but insurance companies adapted and started paying out for smaller claims. Another thing I'm worried about regarding rising costs of health care is that it's having a chilling effect on people even trying to see a doctor. I'll reference a publication put together by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP -- of which I'm a member) that shows that patients are delaying their health care. They're holding off even seeing a doctor because they don't know how much things are going to cost and they have a high deductible; they're afraid they'll get hit with unexpected bills that they won't be able to afford. (Remember that first section above regarding the restaurant scenario?) And the insurance companies, what they're trying to enact in the way of cost cutting is really, if you look at the numbers, profit boosting. On the one hand, the ACA contains provisions to protect consumers from being gouged by insurance companies at the worst and from unfair premium increases at the least. The ACA contains two checks -- a ""Rate Review Provision"" that requires insurance companies to justify rate hikes of more than 10% -- as well as an 80/20 rule, which defines how insurance companies can use the monies from premiums collected. Insurance companies offering ACA plans are mandated to spend at least 80% of premiums they receive on individual health care and ""quality improvement activities"" and not on overhead, administrative and marketing costs. If they don't hit that mark, then they have to return money to the insured in the form of a rebate. This was written into the ACA regulations to ensure that health insurance companies couldn't raise premiums to boost profits. On the other hand, the largest companies had the funds to merge. They increased their profits by offering less. (After all, you either maintain your profit margin by increasing revenue or cutting costs - sometimes both.) They're narrowing their network plans, for example, and all of a sudden your doctor is not covered in the network plan, you don't have enough primary care physicians in your plan, there isn't a specialist for you out there. You get a head bleed, and a neurosurgeon is not covered. That means more money coming out of an insured individual's pocket. That's a problem. That's why I started liveClinic (liveClinic.com). Our vision is to ""take care of the rest"" so doctors can focus on taking care of patients. The platform allows patients to communicate safely and conveniently with a doctor of their choosing. Regulatory codes and quality guidelines often hinder the free flow of information between patients and their doctors. At liveClinic, we aim to break down these barriers without breaking the rules. Designed with doctors in mind and patients at heart, this powerful and intelligent web platform and the corresponding interactive mobile applications saves the physician time and money by giving doctors the freedom to handle routine visits quickly and remotely, via voice or video chat. Having more options not only increases productivity, but encourages self-management among patients and extends clinical reach. This very same technology provides patients with more options for communicating with their doctor, and reduces the amount of time spent in the waiting room, away from work and school.liveClinic incentivizes doctors by decreasing their time on tedious administrative burdens so they can focus on patients. And I think you have to incentivize the doctor. People always focus on the patient, and that's OK, but if you incentivize the doctors you get happy doctors. Most doctors go into medicine to help their patients; so they will do that. But right now, under the status quo system, doctors are burning out. It's not good. According to a report in US News and World Report from earlier this year:  ""Awareness is growing around the stress that doctors-in-training and those practicing medicine experience. The statistics are alarming to some degree. Approximately one-third of physicians report experiencing burnout at any given point. As a matter of fact, doctors are 15 times more likely to burn out than professionals in any other line of work, and 45 percent of primary care physicians report that they would quit if they could afford to do so. Physicians have a 10 to 20 percent higher divorce rate than the general population and, sadly, there are 300 to 400 physician suicide deaths each year.""Doctors are getting jaded because of all the paperwork, the decreasing reimbursements, constantly growing administrative burdens, and the fact that we can order a pizza, a hotel room, an Uber ride immediately on a smart phone, but our patients can't even get access to us, so they seek care elsewhere (see my previous write up on the state of emergency rooms). Fantasy football websites have better user interface and functionality than do most electronic health care record databases. (The average ER doctor clicks on a mouse 4,000 times in a 10-hour shift according to a recent study - while still trying to see patients!) Everything's getting disjointed; people are going to ERs and urgent care clinics instead, and then their primary doc has no idea what's going on. So change has to focus on the center of the epicenter -- the doctor-patient relationship. That's what the liveClinic platform does.There are ways, given the current state of health care in America, that we can make positive, even transformational changes if we allow our thinking to evolve and focus on a different way of setting expectations on the patient side, the doctor side, and the third-party side -- all three phases. We must change, we can change, and change will be good for the entire health care industry and our overall economy. As a nation we can excel and lead the world in health care just as we do in other areas. After all, our health is our MOST valuable possession; without it we cannot lead our lives or the world.

In addition to giving it vast amounts of mobile storage space, the E-commerce leader plans to use these warehouses as launchpads for its drone delivery force. It has already branded these flying blimp-like storage facilities as Airborne Fulfillment Centers, or AFCs. How will they operate?Shuttles (smaller air ships) will be used to transport workers to and from the AFCs, replenish them with inventory, and provide them with necessary fuel, and supplies. The AFCs will hover at high altitudes - roughly 45,000 feet. Drones will be deployed to deliver ordered items to customers. As they descend to their destinations, the drones are expected to use little or no power.They laughed when I predicted packages will be delivered by drones  When I first wrote a post in August of 2013 suggesting that companies will deliver products via drones, a number of readers ""laughed at me"" in their disparaging replies. Here is just one of the more polite ones... ""What makes you think these drones won't have cameras, and audio recorders and sniffers? What leads you to think that these tracking devices will be accurate, tamper-proof, incorruptible and honest? Will they deliver to my fourth floor walkup? My fortieth floor elevator lobby? Stinky gas driven, or nuclear? Shoot-able? How about net-able? The unemployed, more everyday after this, will grab these and sell the parts. Especially the nuclear fuel. Yeah. Can't wait.""Vindication from Jeff Bezos and Charlie RoseNot long after my post, during a 60 Minutes broadcast, Jeff Bezos showed Charlie Rose a room full of ""Octocopters"" branded as Amazon Prime Air that will deliver products to customers. Bezos, Amazon, Charlie Rose and 60 Minutes have the corporate image credentials to give this idea credibility, and once the FAA issues are resolved, you will see this happen. At the time of the broadcast, Bezos said he is an optimist and predicted it will happen in 4 or 5 years. Others said it would take 15 years.Further vindication from WalmartIn 2015, Walmart announced it has asked the FAA for permission to test drones for delivery in its parking lots and at customer homes. It also wants to use drones to check inventories and the condition of its vast network of facilities. Since there is a Walmart store within 5 miles of 70% of the US population, drones potentially provide an efficient way to move product through its extensive supply chain.Amazon makes its first drone deliveryOn December 14th of this year (2016) - just 3 years after the optimistic prediction of 4 to 5 years, Amazon already made its first successful drone delivery to a customer in the UK. I hope that the naysayers are paying attention.Potential for being a very efficient distribution channelAs many already know, the Internet has become perhaps the most convenient channel for distributing products. Buyers can search for what they want, find products that fit their needs, compare prices, read reviews on the products and sellers, and order products 24/7 without leaving the comfort of their home or place of business.Main drawback The problem is that for products that are not in digital form, buyers have to wait for packages to be physically sent via common carriers or through the mail. Too often, shopping carts are abandoned once charges are shown. Currently, this is the bottleneck in the process. To overcome this bottleneck, those that want the product right away typically travel to a local store with the hope of finding it in stock. Of course, buyers still have to make their way to the store as they worry about time, traffic, parking, and other inconveniences. And, in some cases, they are disappointed to learn that the store does not have what they want.Technologies to solve the distribution problemsIn addition to Amazon's AFCs and drones, there are some interesting technologies available (and on the horizon) that might provide a solution to the problems related to physically distributing products. In particular, drones and 3-D printers hold a lot of promise in the not so distant future.3-D printersA technology that is here today and being rapidly advanced for delivery of products is 3-D printing. Users will be able to order products via the Internet, Smart TVs, and smart mobile devices. A 3-D printer at the ordering location (for those that have one) or at a 3-D printing center (operating similar to a FedEx copy center) will then make the products according to a blueprint, recipe, or software program. Where will the ingredients that are fed into the printer come from? There are many possibilities. They might be (1) already purchased in a traditional way and stored in the home, office, hospital or place of business, (2) loaded into purchased cartridges similar to ink cartridges in an inkjet printer, (3) delivered by drones, or (4) sent through a system of underground tubes similar to the way water, gas, and other utilities are delivered today. Taking this one step further, once products are used, a similar (but separate) tube system can be used to sterilize, recycle, and process any waste.If you think this sounds crazy, just wait...While this may sound far-fetched, the system of utilities, modes of transportation, and technologies that are commonplace today would be hard to imagine not so long ago. Perhaps the biggest hurdles are not technological. They are more likely political, legal, regulatory, and economic. Municipalities need the vision to invest resources in these delivery and recycling systems. If properly designed and executed, these systems will ultimately pay for themselves in convenience, efficiency, security, and time.Quantum teleportation a la Star TrekA bit further out on the technology advancement timeline is the concept of delivering physical products by quantum teleportation represented by the famous Star Trek phrase ""Beam me up, Scotty."" If and when this technology is ever available, which many futurists believe it will be, products ordered from a company at point A can be delivered quickly to point B.New forms of distribution and delivery are comingNo matter what technologies are employed, there are (and will continue to be) new ways to deliver physical products from seller to buyer. This holds tremendous promise for almost every field of endeavor from the distribution of good-tasting food to the delivery of life-saving medical devices and procedures. Thinking about this future is exciting. Making it a reality is even more exciting. With the recent patent announcement, Amazon is showing us, once again, that they are thinking about the future and working on potential solutions that can make storage, delivery, and fulfillment what we all want it to be. Look up, and stay tuned."

Some police officers and conservative media outlets argue that protest groups like the Black Lives Matter movement have promoted violence against officers, leading to a supposed “war on cops.”“This year, we’ve had more officers killed particularly by gunfire and more officers killed in ambush-style attacks and more cases where more than one officer is killed at the same time,” said William J. Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations.There were more incidents this year in which multiple officers were killed by a single shooter: eight in 2016 vs. two in 2015. But only three involved a clear ambush ― Dallas, Baton Rouge and a November incident in the Des Moines, Iowa, area in which two officers lost their lives. A separate count by the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund finds that a total of 21 officers died this year in ambush-style attacks. Although that’s the highest number in more than two decades, nearly half of those fatalities came during the three events above.The rest of the fatal shootings in 2016 occurred during routine law enforcement activity, often while officers were serving warrants or responding to domestic disputes or other calls.Still, Johnson believes President Barack Obama is in part to blame for what he sees as a chilling of relations between the police and the public. And that, Johnson said, has made the job of policing more dangerous.“We’re hopeful that with the new administration, they’ll be helpful in quelling this rising tide of violence against police,” he said.President-elect Donald Trump, who regularly jabbed at the Black Lives Matter movement during his campaign, has been an outspoken supporter of “law and order.” He’s also repeatedly pushed the narrative that the police are under siege. The Fraternal Order of Police, the nation’s largest union of rank-and-file officers, endorsed Trump earlier this year.Some supporters of police reform argue that police officials are not painting an honest picture of the data. They suggest that the law enforcement community is seeking instead to win the public relations battle and push back against the current momentum for reform.But that may not be entirely fair either, according to some law enforcement researchers. Police officers may honestly believe their portrayal of the data, because they, along with the rest of the public, are likely hearing about this sort of violence more often.“In the past, most shootings by police officers, as well as shootings of police officers, were typically local or regional news events,” said Philip Stinson, a criminologist at Ohio’s Bowling Green State University. “But after Ferguson, everyone is paying attention. So often, these incidents now become national and even international news events.”Still, Stinson, a former police officer himself, said the hard data suggest that policing was no more dangerous in 2016 than it has ever been.“I don’t buy the ‘war on cops’ narrative, nor do I draw any conclusions from small changes in the numbers of officers killed over a few years,” said Stinson. “Policing in this country is violent. ... It is business as usual on the streets and in policing.”"

The characterization of 2016 as something between a dumpster fire and a literal horror movie has become a recurring joke on some parts of the internet, thanks to an interminable presidential campaign punctuated by a parade of celebrity deaths and an unremitting assortment of other bad news.Most Americans’ impressions of this year, though, are rather less dramatic, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.Overall, 26 percent of Americans say that 2016 has been good or excellent for the country as a whole, 36 percent say that it has been only fair and 31 percent think that it has been poor. Those numbers, if somewhat pessimistic, are also basically in line with December of last year, when 25 percent said that 2015 had been good or excellent, 44 percent that it was fair and 27 percent that it was poor.Both this year and last, the public held a rosier view of their own lives. Forty-one percent say that they personally had an excellent or good year in 2016, with 36 percent saying that they had a fair year and just 19 percent that their year was poor. In 2015, those numbers were a similar 43 percent, 37 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Opinions of this year show a modest divide along party lines: Democrats are 13 points likelier than Republicans to say that 2016 was good or excellent both for the nation and for themselves.Partisanship plays a much larger role in expectations for the year ahead. Sixty-eight percent of Republicans, but just 13 percent of Democrats, expect 2017 to be a better year for the nation as a whole.In a sign of how polarization can extend far beyond political issues, personal expectations are only somewhat less politicized. Sixty percent of Republicans and just 29 percent of Democrats expect next year to be an improvement for them personally.Overall, 34 percent of Americans expect 2017 to be an improvement for the nation as a whole, with 30 percent expecting it to be worse and 18 percent predicting it’ll be just about the same.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 16-19 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

John Larson (D-Conn.), who helped organize the June sit-in over gun violence, called the rule proposal by Republicans ""Putin-like.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5865b16b1500002e00e9d9d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Newly proposed rule changes by Republicans to fine lawmakers for future breaches of decorum on the chamber floor sound an awful lot like something Russian President Vladimir Putin would do, according to one House Democrat.On a call with his colleagues Thursday, Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.) called the move a “Putin-like” response to a sit-in Democrats staged earlier this year as they attempted to pressure Republicans for a vote on gun control measures. During the 24-hour protest, Democrats took photos and live-streamed their speeches, calling for votes on legislation to bar those on a no-fly list from purchasing firearms and require background checks for gun purchases at gun shows and online. Democrats decided to hold the demonstration after a gunman killed 49 people in a Florida nightclub, making it the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.Republicans adjourned the House in response, shutting off microphones first, then the cameras. Larson confirmed in an interview with The Huffington Post after the call that he compared Republican leaders to Putin. “It was Putin-like. Lately with Republicans’ love of the Russians, we have to remind them that this isn’t the old Politburo,” Larson said, referring to the policy-making body under the former Soviet Union’s Communist Party. “This is still a democracy.” The newly proposed rule, which members will vote on as part of a larger package when they return in January, would grant the sergeant-at-arms the authority to fine lawmakers up to $2,500 for recording video or taking photos on the House floor.Larson called the changes “unprecedented and unconstitutional,” and a “zealous overreach” by Republicans. “It’s a strong-armed way of saying, ‘We’re showing you who’s in charge here,’” he said, adding that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Republican leadership did it to “throw red meat” to conservatives. In the months following the sit-in, the conservative House Freedom Caucus and other members called for leaders to exert some form of punishment on Democrats who had organized and led the protest. “Any analogies made to other foreign governments would best be used to describe the actions that happened on the House floor during the sit-in,” said one House Freedom Caucus member, requesting anonymity to speak more freely.Larson and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) met with Ryan at the speaker’s request days after the the sit-in.“To be charitable, this is uncharacteristic of Paul; he’s acting in response to the Freedom Caucus, who, when we met with him, he indicated they wanted to punish the members,” Larson said. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), newly elected chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, pushed back against the notion that his caucus members were behind the new fines.“There are several rules changes that are important to the House Freedom Caucus, most of which focus on making sure every member has a voice,” Meadows told HuffPost. “Any suggestion that HFC proposed a rule to fine members is pure fiction. While prior rules prohibited live-streams and photos to be taken on the floor, no fines could be implemented. Members, however, could be censured as punishment. The new fine would, according to Larson, immediately be deducted from lawmaker’s paychecks. Meadows, too, expressed some doubt over the constitutionality of the change. “While HFC has not had any formal discussions on the proposed rule, private conversations among some members would suggest that support of the rule is still an open question,” he said. Ryan’s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said the changes “will help ensure that order and decorum are preserved” in the House “so lawmakers can do the people’s work.”Larson and Lewis are waiting to hear back from the House parliamentarian on whether there is any precedent to establishing such a penalty on members over floor decorum. So far they haven’t come up with anything, Larson said. “I think they will be hard-pressed to find a precedent,” he said. “Yes, it was an act of civil disobedience, but this [new rule] is not dissimilar to a poll tax or some form of suppression to people’s ability to vote and speak. They are saying, ‘You better be careful what you say on that floor.’ And who determines that you were out of order?

I don’t expect acknowledgment or acceptance from white America.

This has always been my greatest fear,” Reynolds said, via an excerpt from People. “I don’t know if I could survive that.”She continued, “Carrie is my child and I love her with every ounce of strength I possess.”Tragically, Reynolds’ greatest fear was realized on Tuesday, when Fisher died a few days after suffering a heart attack while on a flight from London to Los Angeles. The heartbreak was just too much to bear.The iconic actress died a day after her beloved daughter, with her son, Todd Fisher, saying her final words were, “I miss her so much, I want to be with Carrie.”Reynolds reportedly suffered a stroke at Todd’s house on Wednesday while planning Fisher’s funeral. She later died at Cedars-Sinai Hospital.Todd later told ABC News that his mother died of “heartache,” adding that she was “very peaceful and quiet” when she died. Both women were extremely passionate about and dedicated to their careers as performers, writers and humanitarians. They will be sorely missed, and their mother-daughter bond will never be forgotten.

84,POLITICS,Donald Trump Praises Vladimir Putin: 'I Always Knew He Was Very Smart!',Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-vladimir-putin_us_5866b8e1e4b0eb58648952e0,The comment comes after the Obama administration announced its response to Russian hacking.,2016-12-30,"A woman walks past a mural showing President-elect Donald Trump (R) blowing marijuana smoke into the mouth of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the wall of a restaurant on Nov. 23, 2016, in Vilnius, Lithuania.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5866cb801500002e00e9dc48.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President-elect Donald Trump praised Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday afternoon, after the Russian leader said he would not expel any U.S. diplomats from his country.Trump tweeted, “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!”It’s shockingly direct praise from an incoming American president for a Russian leader who’s been accused by U.S. intelligence agencies and President Barack Obama of overseeing hacking efforts aimed at influencing the 2016 election.Trump’s praise comes after Obama announced that he would sanction Russian intelligence agencies and expel 35 suspected spies that the U.S. thinks were involved in the hacking effort. Both the FBI and CIA agree that Russia used cyber attacks to try to tip the election toward the country’s preferred winner: Trump.“All Americans should be alarmed by Russia’s actions,” the president said in a statement on Thursday. The 35 operatives who will be expelled are currently posted at Russian diplomatic facilities in Washington and San Francisco. The sanctions also bar two Russian intelligence agencies, three companies and four intelligence officers from traveling into or doing business with the U.S.Russians are also being barred from entering two compounds in Maryland and New York that the administration said were used for information-gathering.But in response, Putin said he would not retaliate.“While keeping the right for retaliatory measures, we will not descend to the level of ... irresponsible diplomacy,” the Russian leader said in a statement on Friday. Instead, Putin said he would await the incoming Trump administration to begin on Jan. 20 before making any decisions.The choice drew applause from Trump. The president-elect pinned his tweet at the top of his feed, and the Russian embassy’s official account retweeted it.Trump repeatedly praised Putin and Russia during and after the 2016 campaign, and declined opportunities to criticize the Russian leader and his government for human rights abuses and military actions in Syria and the Ukranian territory of Crimea.Trump specifically cited Putin’s leadership, telling MSNBC last December, “When people call you ‘brilliant’ it’s always good, especially when the person heads up Russia. He’s running his country and at least he’s a leader. You know, unlike we have in this country.”Trump told NBC’s Matt Lauer in September of this year that Putin was a better leader than Obama, and declined to say that Russia should not interfere in U.S. elections. “I’m not going to tell Putin what to do. Why should I tell Putin what to do?” he said.Most notably, during a press conference in July, Trump directly asked Russian intelligence agencies to hack into Hillary Clinton’s email server.“If they hacked, they probably have her 33,000 emails. I hope they do,” Trump said. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.”Trump’s interest in cozying up to Putin could be thwarted by established U.S. and Russian interests that directly collide, experts warn. Vladimir Frolov, a former adviser to the Russian government, told Foreign Policy he sees an inevitable end to the honeymoon.“Many inside the elite believe it would be idiocy to chain Russia’s fortune to the success of this wacko,” he said. “They will get along just fine for about a year, or until one of them invades somewhere, and then all bets are off.”Trump’s friendly comments towards Putin and Russia have drawn rebuke from within his own party. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel (R-Ky.) has said bluntly that the “Russians are not our friends.” However, McConnell reportedly told Obama prior to the election that if the administration were to release information about Russian hacking, he’d make it a partisan issue. Now, McConnell is part of a bipartisan group of senators calling for an investigation into Russian hacking.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) put out a statement Thursday supporting the sanctions, and Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have been frequent critics of Putin and Trump’s friendly comments toward him. However, there are those in Trump’s circle who seem to prefer a far closer relationship with Russia. Nigel Farage, the former leader of the nationalist U.K. Independence Party, tweeted that he was “pleased to see a mature response from Putin” after Obama’s sanctions were announced.Trump has also picked Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state. In 2013, Putin awarded Tillerson with Russia’s Order of Friendship. Exxon signed a contract for a joint venture with Russia’s state-owned oil company in 2011, and now holds drilling rights to 63.7 million acres in the country."

The thought of this choir and Mormonism being forever associated with a man who disparages minorities, brags about his sexual control of women, encourages intolerance and traffics in hate speech and bullying, was unacceptable,” Randall Thacker said in a statement. “I immediately knew there were probably thousands of people who felt the same way, so I created the space on Change.org for like-minded Mormons and their friends to share their feelings.”About 215 of the choir’s 360 members are expected to perform at the inauguration, church officials have told The Salt Lake City Tribune.By Thursday evening, nearly 19,000 people had signed the petition, which is seeking 25,000 signatures. The petition urges the Mormon Tabernacle Choir not to perform for an “incoming president who has demonstrated sexist, racist, misogynistic, and xenophobic behavior that does not align with the principles and teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.” Most of the signatures are from LDS members around the world, according to Thacker, a lifelong member of the church.The petition also encourages people to call and write the church to give their reasons for signing. Several mention that Trump’s values are incompatible with Mormonism or that the church should never become associated with politics. One quips: Conservative rocker “Ted Nugent and the choir? I don’t think so!” Another writes: “Horrible values. Separation of church and state. Pay your taxes.”Gina Colvin, an LDS scholar and Maori writer in New Zealand, told the Tribune that the choir’s planned participation in the inauguration “speaks to me of how little moral care the church has for the international cultural and political diversity of our church.”Thacker and other supporters plan to personally deliver the petition to the choir and church officials in the coming week, reports the Utah Standard-Examiner.There was no immediate comment from Trump.The president-elect’s team has struggled to find performers for his inauguration. The Rockettes will appear, though performers are upset, according to one dancer. “This is not a Republican or Democrat issue ... this is an issue of racism and sexism, something that’s much bigger than politics,” she said in an interview.

It pointedly also thanked Germany, France, Canada, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates for support.TRUMP AND MAY?Britain has long cherished its so-called “special relationship” with the United States as a central pillar of its foreign policy, but May has struggled to build relations with Trump’s transition team.Following his election, Trump spoke to nine other world leaders before he spoke to May while he caused astonishment in London when he suggested that Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage should be Britain’s ambassador to Washington.By openly criticising Kerry, who will leave office in just weeks, May moves British policy closer to Trump than its other European allies such as Germany and France.Trump has denounced the Obama administration’s treatment of Israel and promised to change course when he is sworn in on Jan. 20.“We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but not anymore,” Trump said in a series of tweets. “Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!”Germany’s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has come out in favour of the Kerry speech while France holds a Middle East conference next month in Paris.But Australia has distanced itself from Obama’s stance on Israel, ABC reported.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he was convinced peace with Israel was achievable but demanded that Israel halt settlement building before talks restarted.ISRAELNetanyahu has been witheringly critical of Kerry’s speech. In a statement released shortly after it was delivered, Netanyahu accused Kerry of bias and said Israel did not need to be lectured to by foreign leaders.Netanyahu said he looked forward to working with Trump.Kerry “obsessively dealt with settlements”, Netanyahu said in his response, and barely touched “the root of the conflict – Palestinian opposition to a Jewish state in any boundaries.”In Israel, Kerry’s speech has played into the hands of Israel’s far-right national-religious movement, led by Naftali Bennett, the education minister, who is in Netanyahu’s cabinet but very critical of Netanyahu and is trying to position himself as a future potential leader.Bennett’s party, Jewish Home, wants to annexe large parts of the West Bank and openly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state. He is advocating for more settlements and the legalisation of outpost settlements, which even the Israeli government considers illegal.“This [Obama] administation’s policy has left the Middle East up in flames,” Bennett said after Kerry’s speech. “The one free democracy has been thrown under the bus - and that’s Israel.”(Additional reporting by Luke Baker; Editing by Angus MacSwan)"

In one sense, it marked the first time all season the quarterback actually had weapons around him (the Eagles are currently 6-9).CeaseFire PA, the advocacy group, sent the gun locks to help remind the players to be responsible gun owners.“Our staff’s immediate reaction to the news about Wentz’s gifts to his teammates was to ensure that the gifts were used safely and responsibly,” Shira Goodman, the group’s executive director, said in a statement.There are a number of different types of gun locks, and it’s not clear which kind the group provided to the players. CeaseFire PA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Just last month, Eagles wide receiver Josh Huff was arrested and later cut from the team after he was charged with possessing an unloaded 9 mm handgun without a permit. Police said they also found a magazine that had six hollow-point bullets. “I’m a professional athlete,” Huff said after the incident. “What professional athlete don’t have a gun? I have a wife and I have a son at home. My job is to protect them at all costs, and my job is to protect myself as well, even though I know I have security here, but I have to protect myself as well.”CeaseFire PA has encouraged the gun owners to enroll in safety courses. In an informal poll of 37 Eagles players conducted by The Philadelphia Inquirer, 18 players said they owned a gun.The Eagles have not yet responded to the group’s gift.“We want them and their families to all be in top condition for next season,” Goodman said in the statement. “We welcome all Eagles players and fans to become our partners in working for a safer Pennsylvania.” "

Bennett will earn $16 million in 2017 and $19 million by March of 2018, the source told HuffPost.The deal is unheard of for a soon-to-be 32-year-old defensive linemen. It is also unique for the team, which has never done a deal with a player who has at least one year remaining on his contract. (Bennett had been signed through next season.)Bennett was previously the 27th-highest paid defensive linemen in the NFL. He held out briefly during training camp with the hopes of inking an extension, telling HuffPost, “You definitely want to get what you think you’re worth. When you put all the things together, I just don’t see a lot of guys having the type of impact I have.”Bennett helped the Seahawks lead the league in total defense over each of the last four seasons, including their Super Bowl victory over Denver. A Pro Bowl selection in 2015 and 2016, he has become one of the league’s premier two-way defensive ends, ranking first in quarterback hurries for all 4-3 defensive ends last year.Last offseason, Bennett skipped voluntary workouts but showed up for a mandatory minicamp and training camp. His production has been down in 2016, but only because he was hit by a series of injuries. He had to miss five games after undergoing knee surgery following a Week 6 game against Atlanta, and then suffered a neck injury in Seattle’s Week 15 win over the Rams. But when he’s been on the field, Bennett’s been terrific, tallying a slew of sacks and stops in the backfield.The decision to extend Bennett’s contract comes after the team has agreed to long-term extensions with linebackers Bobby Wagner and K.J. Wright, along with defensive backs Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor and Earl Thomas ― all elite players at their respective positions. Head coach Pete Carroll told HuffPost before the season, “We’re gonna make an effort ― an effort so he remains a Seahawk.”Undrafted in 2009 out of Texas A&M, Bennett was originally signed by the Seahawks before establishing himself as a legitimate starter with Tampa Bay. Then, he returned to Seattle in 2013, where he’s been a constant wrecking force ever since. The 9-5-1 Seahawks recently earned an NFC West championship for the third time in four years. Carroll and General Manager John Schneider hope that a happy and healthy Bennett means even more production for the league’s second-best scoring defense, and in turn, another deep postseason run.
