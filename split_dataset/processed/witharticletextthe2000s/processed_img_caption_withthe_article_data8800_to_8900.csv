Kim said in a Department of Justice press release.An indictment summarized in the release accuses the 46-year-old “X Gon’ Give It To Ya” singer of racking up an unpaid $1.7 million tax bill on income earned from recordings and performances in the early 2000s. In addition, Simmons allegedly failed to file tax returns from 2010 to 2015 despite making more than $2.3 million.He attempted to circumvent his obligations by “maintaining a cash lifestyle” and using the bank accounts of associates to pay expenses, according to the release.DMX also tried to conceal income from a reality show as well, prosecutors claim. He allegedly demanded that producers of “Celebrity Couples Therapy” reissue him a $125,000 check without withholding taxes or he would quit the show.A lawyer for DMX told Reuters that the rapper will plead innocent to the charges, according to the wire service’s video above.The rapper, whose first five albums debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, has a dubious track record outside of show business. He’s been arrested for drug possession, DUI, theft, animal cruelty, assault, child support avoidance, weapon possession and more, Billboard reported. In February 2016, he had to be revived by police and medics in a hotel parking lot after an alleged drug overdose.The Huffington Post reached out to a rep for DMX."

He has kept a relatively low profile in Washington, D.C., until recently, but has spent decades embedded in several high-stakes lobbying campaigns on behalf of the former Soviet Union.“I know of no Russian gun-for-hire who managed to run his campaigns so successfully, running circles around purportedly much more seasoned Washington hands,” veteran reporter Steve LeVine told Radio Free Europe in June 2016.Akhmetshin confirmed to The Associated Press on Friday that he had participated in the now-infamous meeting between President Donald Trump’s eldest son and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, and Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager at the time, also attended. The meeting came amid a lobbying campaign against the Magnitsky Act, legislation passed in 2012 that barred several Russian officials accused of human rights abuses from entering the U.S. and infuriated Russian President Vladimir Putin.Just days after the meeting, Akhmetshin hosted a screening of a Russian propaganda film at the Newseum in Washington. The movie was an effort to undermine evidence that the Kremlin had authorized the imprisonment, torture and eventual murder of a Russian lawyer and whistleblower named Sergei Magnitsky, whose death inspired the Magnitsky Act.Trump Jr. did not originally disclose Akhmetshin’s presence at the meeting. His attorney, Alan Futerfas, claimed Friday that his client wasn’t aware of the lobbyist’s background at the time of the meeting.“He is a U.S. citizen,” Futerfas told NBC News of the lobbyist. “He told me specifically he was not working for the Russian government, and in fact laughed when I asked him that question.” Akhmetshin was the subject of a letter that Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly in April as part of an investigation into potential violations committed by the lobbyist under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.Court papers from lawyers for International Mineral Resources, a Russian mining company that alleged Akhmetshin had orchestrated a cyberattack against them to tarnish their public image, described the lobbyist in November 2015 as “a former Soviet military counterintelligence officer.”The allegations were later withdrawn, according to The Daily Beast.Akhmetshin told the AP on Friday that he served in the Soviet military from 1986 to 1988, but denied ever receiving formal spy training. NBC News, which first reported that a Russian lobbyist attended the meeting between Veselnitskaya and Trump Jr., also said another unnamed individual was present. The sixth meeting attendee hasn’t been identified.Akhmetshin told the AP that he didn’t expect his meeting with Trump Jr. to be a “big deal.”The Trump Jr. meeting revelation is only the latest scandal to rock the White House, which has repeatedly denied that Trump campaign aides had connections to Russian government officials during the 2016 presidential election. Four U.S. intelligence agencies, including the FBI and CIA, reported in January that Putin ordered an influence campaign, including cyberattacks against Democratic National Committee servers, to tip the election in favor of Trump.Several Trump associates, including Kushner and Manafort, are under federal investigation over their potential links to the Kremlin.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that 17 intelligence agencies concluded Russia had interfered in the election. Four intelligence agencies investigated the issue and published the report. "

Bush, in conversation with his predecessor, President Bill Clinton, said Thursday it was important for a leader to be “humble in victory” in order to work with others.The pair, speaking in Dallas at the George W. Bush Presidential Library, spoke about their post-office friendship, and, although they didn’t mention the current president by name, several reporters noted their comments appeared to indirectly reference the current climate in the White House.“I think it starts with Bill Clinton being a person who refused to lord his victory over dad. In other words, he was humble in victory, which is very important in dealing with other people,” Bush, speaking about Clinton’s 1992 defeat over his father, George H.W. Bush, told a crowd gathered for the graduation of the Presidential Leadership Scholars program. “I think Dad was willing to rise above the political contest. It starts with the individual’s character, and both men in my judgment displayed strong character and therefore their friendship was able to be formed.”Bush was also asked what the most important quality is to be commander in chief. His reply: “Humility.”“I think it’s really important to know what you don’t know and listen to people who do know what you don’t know,” he said, according to NPR.Clinton continued with a similar sentiment: “If you want to be president, realize it’s about the people, not about you.”“You want to be able to say, ‘Things were better off when I quit, kids had a better future, things were coming together,’” he said. “You don’t want to say, ‘God, look at all the people I beat.’”Reuters notes many in the crowd thought the pair may have been referencing the administration of President Donald Trump. Trump has continued to speak about his win over presidential opponent Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton’s wife, nearly six months after he assumed office and has pressed on with his unsubstantiated claims that millions voted illegally in the 2016 election.During the talk in Dallas, former President Clinton lamented the current state of American politics, saying an increasing divide between political ideologies had him worried about the future.“One of the things that is wrong with America today, that bothers me more than anything else about our future, is we have separated ourselves into like-minded communities,” Clinton said. “Diverse groups make better decisions than homogeneous ones. Everyone knows that, but they almost can’t help themselves.”The pair, however, both said they’d recommend the presidency to young people today, with Clinton noting he’d advise the next generation to seek to hold the office “in a heartbeat.”Watch the entire conversation between the two below:"
4,POLITICS,Trump Is Violating The Iran Deal,"Reza Marashi and Tyler Cullis, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-is-violating-the-iran-deal_us_5968cd05e4b03389bb16ccdb,"With two years of successful implementation in the books, Washington should be celebrating the anniversary of a historic",2017-07-14,"Reza Marashi - Research Director, National Iranian American Council",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f7b94e2600001900c468f2.jpg?ops=100_100,"With two years of successful implementation in the books, Washington should be celebrating the anniversary of a historic Iran nuclear deal. Instead, President Trump is violating the pact and prompting its demise. With each passing day, it becomes less plausible that his violations are mistakes rather than malicious. This is all the more ironic given reports that his administration plans to once again re-certify Iran’s compliance with its Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) commitments. However, reaffirming that Iran is fulfilling its end of the bargain does not mean America is doing the same. As the deal turns two, all parties to the deal should consider three key points about their landmark diplomatic achievement as it exists today.First, it is now clear that the Trump administration intends to flout the full scope of U.S. obligations under the JCPOA so as to limit promised business ties with Iran. For instance, a White House press briefing revealed that President Trump spent his time at last week’s G-20 Summit urging nations to stop doing business with Iran. Trump’s directive to world leaders is the latest in a string of evidence that the U.S. is acting in material non-compliance with its express obligations under the JCPOA. These obligations include not just the formal lifting of nuclear-related sanctions, but also express commitments to “refrain from any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran...” and “from any action inconsistent with the letter, spirit, and intent of [the] JCPOA that would undermine its successful implementation.” Considering, too, that the U.S. has the positive obligation to “agree on steps to ensure Iran’s access in areas of trade, technology, finance, and energy,” Trump’s private urging to foreign countries to withdraw business ties with Iran puts the U.S. in irrefutable breach of the JCPOA. No one can any longer remain agnostic or in denial as to this basic fact.Second, in breaching the JCPOA, the Trump administration appears keen on adopting the failed playbook of the past. Soon after taking office in 2001, the Bush administration skirted U.S. obligations under the Agreed Framework, prompting North Korea’s departure from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and effectively weaponizing North Korea’s nuclear program. Neoconservative champions of that approach – one that haunts us to this day – are now pushing this same disastrous policy with Iran, hoping that death-by-a-thousand-paper cuts will sink the Iran deal and place Washington and Tehran back on the path towards war. To this end, the Trump administration is taking deliberate steps to breach the JCPOA and provoke an Iranian response.So far, though, the effect of Trump’s policy is to isolate only the United States. Next week, the Joint Commission to the JCPOA will meet to discuss implementation of the deal, and there can be little doubt that a central focus of that meeting will be America’s failure to abide by the terms of the agreement. The Trump administration will have effectively inverted the order of things at the Joint Commission so that America, not Iran, is the subject of the meeting and its lack of commitment to the deal bemoaned by other world powers. In the upside-down world of Washington, this is the position of “strength” from which the U.S. can challenge Iran. Pipe dreams aside, though, there can be no mistaking the fact that the U.S. has effectively ceased to be a constructive party to the nuclear deal. With the rest of the JCPOA parties indicating that they will move ahead with the nuclear accord regardless, the Trump administration has successfully cratered U.S. influence and caused the other parties to the deal to balance against it. Finally, it cannot be overstated that all of this was entirely avoidable – because the Obama administration had put U.S.-Iran relations on an entirely different trajectory. Multiple channels of dialogue were established, and both sides sought to use the JCPOA as a foundation from which dialogue on additional points of contention could grow. The clock ran out on Obama’s second term before more progress could be made, but Trump could have picked up where his predecessor left off. Heightened tensions with Tehran were not a fait accompli, and that is precisely the problem: The Trump administration has chosen to double down on discord that was in the process of being managed six months ago. There is time to reverse Trump’s policy direction. Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, will be in New York next week. It would be the height of diplomatic malpractice if Trump does not send a cabinet-level official to privately meet with him. Hawks in Washington can no longer deny that diplomacy with Iran can help achieve American interests because the JCPOA is the receipt from Obama’s efforts. Whether or not Trump chooses to rip up that receipt remains to be seen, but the current trajectory on the Iran nuclear deal’s second anniversary should alarm anyone who thinks more war in the Middle East is a bad idea."
5,POLITICS,Restoring A Sense Of Decency To Our Destructive Politics,"Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, ContributorRepresentative, U.S. Congress (IL-08)",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/restoring-a-sense-of-decency-to-our-destructive-politics_us_5968d228e4b022bb9372b107,We must reject the politics of meanness and contempt that increasingly dominate our airwaves.,2017-07-14,"<p>Congressman Krishnamoorthi meeting with constituents in a coffee shop in Schaumburg, IL.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5968d2431a00003800dbec2a.jpg?ops=crop_0_0_717_415%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The last few weeks of news have included President Trump’s verbal attack on the hosts of “Morning Joe” and his literal, although fake, attack on a figure representing CNN. This follows recent controversies over entertainment figures joking about assassination and displaying a decapitated head meant to resemble the president.While mockery and ridicule have long been a part of our politics, they have come to dominate what passes for political discourse today. After all, it’s easier to dismiss the opposition with a symbolic body-slam than to listen to their opinions or work to find common ground.We know that this trend toward hyper-partisanship has undermined the effectiveness of Congress in recent years. Legislating has ground to a halt. Obstructionism has become the new normal. Ordinary Americans disdain their own representatives and elected officials distrust their own colleagues.In the past, leaders of both parties have been able to reach across the partisan divide. They succeeded by retaining their own humanity and recognizing the same in their political opponents. They embraced a sense of decency in their lives and politics that is often missing today.The stories of our most successful legislators contain common elements of compassion, kindness and trust: The Congressman who prayed at the bedside of the nearly-slain president of the opposite party and went on to forge an historic partnership with him; the Senators who rallied across the aisle to the cause of suicide prevention after a fellow Senator’s son took his own life; an alcoholic Congressman who sponsored an alcoholic Senator from the opposite party as he took his first steps toward sobriety.Moreover, these rivals, who managed to put aside partisanship, passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Mental Health Parity Act, the Child Safety Act, and the Violence Against Women Act –- some of the most transformational legislation in recent history. Through collaboration, these politicians did what somehow seems impossible today: they reached across the aisle with civility and compassion and found common ground.Perhaps the recent shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) and others in a park in Alexandria, Virginia, provides an opportunity for those of us who serve in Congress to rediscover our own compassion and sense of decency. Perhaps they will enable us to look at our political opponents not as “bad” people, but as fellow-Americans equally committed to a future of hope and accomplishment. This will require us to extend the compassion and concern shown to Rep. Scalise and his fellow victims long after the sound of the gunshots has faded. Instead of a one-time demonstration of decency and humanity, it will require an ongoing commitment.The truth is that searching for our commonality instead of our differences could transform our dysfunctional politics. President Teddy Roosevelt recognized this, saying that “the most practical kind of politics is the politics of decency.” The true heroes of American democracy are those who have rejected partisanship and pedantry and, usually out of the spotlight, accomplished what democracy was designed to do. By making friends and sharing confidences, these men and women poured their humanity into their lawmaking for the good of our country and its citizens.In some ways, “decency” is a hazy concept; we know it when we see it. We are uplifted by stories of decency ― especially in politics, so often fraught with ambition and ego-driven competition. When the norm is decency, other virtues can thrive: integrity, honesty, compassion, kindness and trust. Relationships are stronger so politicians are more apt to work across the aisle. Rhetoric is less divisive, coalitions are more diverse, and dialogue is more frequent. In some ways, political decency is a sign of a healthy democracy, but in other ways it is the cause of it. Whichever the starting point, decency unites, it inspires, it brings out our strengths and shores up our weaknesses.Our political system has been bankrupted by the failures of Congress to act in ways that give meaning to the struggles our constituents endure. We must reject the politics of meanness and contempt that increasingly dominate our airwaves and Internet. This will require us to recommit ourselves to a mission of service ― with integrity, compassion, kindness and trust as our guides. Such a politics of decency may seem beyond our reach today, but it’s never too late to start."
6,RELIGION,#NeverthelessShePersisted: Rev. Jennifer Butler And The Power Of Nonviolent Resistance Today,"Susan Thistlethwaite, ContributorI am a Professor of Theology and President Emerita of Chicago ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neverthelessshepersisted-rev-jennifer-butler-and_us_5968f7a5e4b022bb9372b148,"In these times, the Rev. Jennifer Butler, CEO of Faith in Public Life, as well as other faith leaders, is standing for life",2017-07-14,<p>Rev. Jennifer Butler arrested at nonviolent protest on Capitol Hill</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5968f7f01a00001b00dbecbe.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In these times, the Rev. Jennifer Butler, CEO of Faith in Public Life, as well as other faith leaders, is standing for life and health against the forces of greed that will deal suffering and death for millions under the guise of the new Senate ‘health care’ bill.As Rev. Butler says, “this is not a health care bill, it is a death bill. We want life, not death.”This bill is so horrific that some faith leaders are willing to go to jail for nonviolent resistance against this death-dealing legislation. Rev. Butler and an interfaith group of leaders, were, in fact, just recently arrested on Capitol hill for their peaceful protest against a bill they called “immoral” and “sinful”. This is the kind of moral clarity religious leaders need to bring to the public square in these times. As Rev. Butler has said,My faith calls me to challenge powers and principalities that would harm the least of these. Therefore I and others like me must speak loudly and forcefully about the moral basis for our actions. We must not be ashamed or afraid to do so because people's lives and souls are at stake. This is the time to be exceptionally clear that this Senate bill would deal suffering and death under the guise of providing ‘health care.’The prophet Isaiah could be describing the need to denounce this travesty of a bill:Woe to those who enact evil statutes, and to those who constantly record unjust decisions, so as to deprive the needy of justice and rob the poor of my people of their rights. (10:1-3)Rev. William Barber II, a well-known faith leader for his work with the powerful Moral Mondays movement and now with Repairers of the Breach, who was also arrested with Rev. Butler, brings a similarly prophetic word, saying that the bill, in its “power to take health care [from people], is sin — it’s immoral.”Actions indeed speak louder than words, however. The act of being arrested for nonviolent witness for religious principle is powerful, and these faith leaders would say, now crucial way to stand against those who would deal death instead of life. Rev. Barber called on other religious leaders to join him in protest: “We call on clergy all over this country — it’s time for you now to come here. Even if it means arrest while you’re praying in protest. It’s time for us to come here and make our voices heard on behalf of the least, the sick, the broken, and those that will die if this bill [is passed].”There is a discussion today in the public square about a new ‘outspoken’ religious left. Let us remember that profound religious witness against injustice is not at all new, but in times of crisis it has emerged again and again and often the most formidable of these witnesses have been from the streets and the prisons instead of the pulpits or centers of religious power. Some of the most important religious witness in the history of the world, in fact, has been from prison.The German Christian pastor and theologian, Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote from prison, before his execution for his resistance to Hitler, asking if religious leaders like himself were “still of any use?” He wanted to know that because they had been silent and had not resisted Hitler early on. We have been silent witnesses of evil deeds; we have been drenched by many storms; we have learnt the arts of equivocation and pretense; experience has made us suspicious of others and kept us from being truthful and open; intolerable conflicts have worn us down and even made us cynical. Are we still of any use?Bonhoeffer had not been silent and he was arrested and eventually executed.In 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was arrested in Birmingham for participation in a nonviolent protest against the treatment of African Americans in Birmingham, Alabama. In response to criticism from eight white religious leaders in the south, he wrote a letter and in that famous public letter he gave an historical view of civil disobedience in principled faith witness. Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was seen sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar because a higher moral law was involved. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks before submitting to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience.We can never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was ""legal"" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was ""illegal."" It was ""illegal"" to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler's Germany. But I am sure that if I had lived in Germany during that time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers even though it was illegal. If I lived in a Communist country today where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I believe I would openly advocate disobeying these anti-religious laws.And Dr. King was later assassinated for his witness.This kind of public faith resistance takes enormous courage, but silence is worse. What kind of person of faith are you if you don’t speak out when massive harm is being done?Life and death. Lives and souls. That’s what is at stake.Rev. Jennifer Butler and these other faith leaders know this. Do you? Do I ?"
7,EDUCATION,"Do Girls Have Access To Team Sports? Many California Schools Aren't Telling, Despite Law","EdSource, ContributorNonprofit news site focused on education policy and its effects",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/do-girls-have-access-to-team-sports-many-california_us_59691009e4b09e26b6d7679c,"No research has found that girls are less interested in competitive athletic teams than boys, according to the Women's Sports Foundation.",2017-07-14,"<p>Avonna Usher, left, plays lacrosse for the Granite Bay High School team.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596910952100001900fc6f06.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jane Meredith AdamsLacrosse came to Avonna Usher, a 16-year-old junior at Granite Bay High School northeast of Sacramento, the way sports come to many young athletes — at school. The pure pleasure of hurling a 40-yard pass has driven her to attack her learning disability, improve her grades and win a verbal commitment to play lacrosse for the University of Oregon Ducks.But a new study finds that many California schools aren’t reporting their data, as required by a recent state law, to show that girls are getting the same shot at team sports as boys.“Many are just ignoring the law altogether,” said Kim Turner, a senior staff attorney at the nonprofit Legal Aid at Work, which runs the Fair Play for Girls in Sports Project and produced the study. The law, Senate Bill 1349 by Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara, is a data disclosure statute. It’s meant to force K-12 schools to tell the story, through data, of how they are serving girl athletes, a cohort historically relegated to worn-out fields, undesirable practice schedules and meager sports options compared to boy athletes.Without the data, it’s tough to tell if schools are complying with the 1972 federal Title IX law and the California Education Code, which require equal sports opportunities for girls and boys in federally funded K-12 schools. Title IX applies to athletics in colleges and universities as well.Fewer than half of the high schools surveyed by the Fair Play for Girls in Sports Project have posted their sports participation numbers on their school or district websites, as the law requires them to do every year, the study found. The first deadline was June 30, 2016 for 2015-16 interscholastic sports team participation; data for the 2016-17 school year were to be posted by June 30 of this year.The data that were posted, the study found, indicated a six-point gap between the percentage of girls enrolled in schools and the percentage of school athletes that are girls. “Girls across California are getting far fewer chances than boys to play sports, despite accounting for approximately half of students, and despite studies that show that girls are equally interested in sports in comparison with boys,” the study said.The study surveyed 107 California high schools, randomly selected, and found that 48 percent had posted the required three elements of data: the number of girl and boy team athletes, the number of teams offered to girls and boys, and total enrollment of girls and boys. From that information, parents and students could calculate whether the percentage of girls and boys on sports teams is proportional to their enrollment, as required by Title IX. The Fair Play for Girls in Sports Project has posted an online tool for users to enter school data and calculate whether there is a gap in sports participation rates by gender.The schools that posted data had the same demographics as the schools that did not post data — about 54 percent of students were eligible for free and reduced price meals based on low family income, and about 70 percent of those enrolled were students of color. “Inequities in sports for girls in California — and failure to post data that could shed a light on the issue — seem to cross all racial and socioeconomic lines,” the study said. The study did not list the names of the schools.No research has found that girls are less interested in competitive athletic teams than boys, according to the Women’s Sports Foundation, a nonprofit founded by tennis great Billie Jean King. Obstacles include a lack of teams and, more subtly, the sense that girls’ sports teams don’t matter as much as boys’ teams, according to the foundation. At a forum with new Oakland Unified Superintendent Kyla Johnson-Trammell last month, Jayda Hicks, a 16-year-old Oakland High student who plays first base on the softball team, said school leaders “don’t take the girls’ sports teams seriously.”Jayda added, “We don’t get as much recognition as the boys do.” And school leaders, she said, don’t pay attention to the way slighting the girls’ teams deflates the players. “They don’t notice how that affects us,” she said. “That can affect our daily lives and it can affect our performance in schools.”At Granite Bay High, part of the Roseville Joint Union High School District, Avonna said boys’ teams are held in higher esteem by school staff. Administrators show up to cheer on the male athletes, she said, but the only fans at girls’ lacrosse games are parents of the players. “The only time the principal comes is when we’re in the semi championships, and that’s because it’s required,” she said.Before Title IX passed in 1972, fewer than 300,000 girls played high school sports across the nation. In 2012, more than 3.2 million girls played on high school teams, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. But girls are still underrepresented in school athletics. Schools have three ways to prove they are serving girl athletes: provide data that show gender representation on teams is proportionate to overall enrollment, prove they are moving toward that goal or prove through a school survey that girls are not interested in playing on a sports team.In California, a court ruling and the data-disclosure law are pressing schools to do more. In 2014, the Ninth Circuit District Court upheld a lower court ruling that the Sweetwater Union High School District had “not fully and effectively accommodated the interests and abilities of female athletes” and was out of compliance with Title IX. Veronica Ollier, a member of the softball team, was the lead plaintiff in a class action suit that charged that the district gave girls’ teams subpar playing fields, facilities, schedules and transportation vehicles compared to the boys’ teams. In addition, the suit charged the district with retaliating against the girls who complained by firing the softball coach. The court agreed with those charges.The new data-disclosure law could provoke additional lawsuits. On the collegiate athletic level, Title IX lawsuits surged after 1994, when colleges were required to publicly disclose sports participation by gender, similar to the requirements of the California law, said Michael Smith, a partner at the Lorenzo Smith law firm that represents many California school districts. Smith declined to be interviewed, but in a video presentation on Senate Bill 1349 he said, “That’s the kind of scenario we could be facing after the full implementation of SB 1349 here in California.”He urged districts: “Let’s look comprehensively at our sports programs and decide whether or not we are providing equity at both the female and the male athletic competition levels.” He added, “Let’s in fact achieve sports equity in all of our California school districts.”Girls who play team sports are more likely to have better grades in school, higher levels of self-confidence and earn more money in future employment than non-athletes, according to the Women’s Sports Foundation.In Granite Bay, Avonna said sports are a way to counteract the cultural put-down of women.“We are already degraded as women,” she said. “It’s usually a guy thing — they go out and play sports. To be a girl and woman and showing the world I can do this, it’s good.”This story originally appeared on EdSource."

New diagnoses of HIV have fallen,2017-07-14,"<p>Roundtable attendees with <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/prince-harry"">Prince Harry</a> at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596884ec2100008860fc6dad.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Young people with HIV in North America and Europe now have near-normal life expectancy. New diagnoses of HIV have fallen among men who have sex with men in England. These recent findings are incredibly positive and should be celebrated. Progress is being made, but HIV/AIDS is far from over, especially in low-and middle-income countries, and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.The largest ever generation of adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa is at risk of HIV, many of these young people are failing to test for the virus and access the relevant follow-up care and treatment… and the world is not listening to them. Inevitably, new infection and death rates are rising in the region. Globally the number of adolescent deaths from AIDS tripled in 15 years and HIV is a leading cause of adolescent deaths in Africa. Women and girls are most at risk - around 7,500 young women become newly infected with HIV every week in sub-Saharan Africa.It is clear that adolescents and young people in this part of the world are being left behind in the HIV/AIDS response. Worse still, their views and needs are being overlooked - a stark reality that was brought home to us and global leaders in HIV/AIDS during a recent roundtable discussion organised by Sentebale, their Co-Founding Patron, Prince Harry, and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.We were privileged to welcome three of Sentebale’s youth advocates – young people living with HIV from Lesotho and Botswana - countries with the second and third highest infection rates of HIV in the world. Hearing their experiences first-hand was a powerful testimony to the challenges facing young people affected by HIV in southern Africa.We heard about the negative impact of a limited and poor education, and how youth-friendly health services are anything but. We learnt how the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS - still ingrained in the region’s facilities, schools and communities - makes young people think twice about visiting a testing clinic because of the attitudes of health professionals or, as the age of consent is often 16, the thought of having to ask their parents or guardians for permission - no easy task for any teenager.Pressure on young shoulders is immense, and this brings its own problems. The intersection between mental health issues and HIV can prevent people from receiving treatment and stop them taking it. This is just one area that must be further explored and addressed.We simply don’t yet know how best to tackle many of these problems. The youth advocates’ insights not only reinforce the importance of the School and Sentebale’s important HIV/AIDS adolescent research and programmes in southern Africa, but also crucially pave the way for new research avenues. By producing and using the most rigorous scientific evidence, more effective interventions can be shaped and implemented on the ground.Ultimately, the global community desperately needs to understand and learn from young people affected by HIV. We hope our roundtable discussion will spark new dialogue and research. At the event, global HIV leaders committed to moving young people higher up the agenda and to ensuring their voices are heard. This is a positive step but must be a catalyst for change. The 2018 International AIDS conference in Amsterdam is a key opportunity to keep the momentum going as young people will be a focus at the event.If we are to reduce stigma, breakdown barriers to treatment and care, and provide services that are tailored to the reality of being a young person living with or at risk of HIV, young people need to play an integral part in research and policymaking. Bringing the AIDS epidemic to an end requires the global health community to work together and listen to those directly affected.Last year Prince Harry called for the world to step-up its support for young people affected by HIV/AIDS. Empowering them, to ensure that their voices are heard and acted upon, is crucial if we are to make the great strides that are necessary. Young people – whatever their HIV status – deserve the chance to lead healthy, happy and productive lives."

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) called it “an absolute disaster.” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said it was an “abomination.” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) tweeted, “All Senate Republicans did was put lipstick on a pig.”I wish I could say I agree. But the proposal released today is much worse than lipstick on a pig. It’s more like a bad toupee on a pig. The “compromises” offered in this bill are unconvincing, and they make Republicans look terrible and cheap.Just like Republicans past (and failed) attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), this version of the bill retains its most fatal flaw: it would decimate Medicaid and devastate the people who rely on it. This law would slash federal Medicaid spending and undo the Medicaid expansion made possible by the ACA. That means 15 million people will lose their coverage in the next ten years.This bill does nothing to soften the $772 billion blow it would deliver to the program that provides health care coverage for seniors, people with disabilities and families with kids. So it’s disappointing to see that GOP lawmakers like Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who have expressed deep concern with past proposals’ cuts to Medicaid, have yet to declare their opposition to this latest attempt to strip health care from those who need it most.What’s even more astounding? This bill might be even worse than the last one. By including an amendment authored by right-winger Sen. Ted Cruz that would allow insurance companies to sell health care plans that don’t meet the minimum quality and coverage standards set by the Affordable Care Act. That’s going to hurt our most vulnerable citizens – people with preexisting conditions who will see the cost of coverage spike.Like a bad hair piece, the paltry sums this new bill offers to address the nation’s growing opioid crisis and rising costs for sicker, older people are just a cheap imitation of the real relief everyday Americans needs.But even though we can all see through this pathetic attempt to comb over the fatal flaws in the GOP health care plan, many moderate Republicans, like Sen. Shelley Capito of Washington and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, remain on the fence.Now more than ever before, Americans who will be impacted by this hurtful, harmful law must raise their voices and share their stories. We cannot allow Senate Republicans to obscure or disguise the fact that this bill could cause millions of Americans to lose their livelihoods, their life savings, and even their lives. It’s time to rise up, together, and expose this sham for what it really is.Dorian Warren is president of the Center for Community Change Action."

The researchers will not have the funds to analyze data they have spent the past two years collecting or incorporate their findings into assistance for teens and their families.“We are just reeling. We’re not sure how we’ll adapt,” said Jennifer Hettema, an associate research professor at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, which was finding ways to help doctors talk to Native American and Latino teens about avoiding pregnancy.More than a quarter of U.S. girls become pregnant by 20. The teen birth rate has continually declined over the past 20 years, but it remains high compared with other industrialized nations, particularly among poor and minority girls.Under the Trump administration, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program had two strikes against it: Former President Barack Obama started it, and social conservatives don’t want to give teens access to birth control.Eighty-one projects were awarded five-year grants in 2015. But last week, they received annual grant award letters from the Office of Adolescent Health, which were obtained by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting. Included was this sentence: “This award also shortens the project period to end June 30, 2018, at the end of this budget year.” In years past, the award letters said the project period would end June 30, 2020.In addition, a $2.9 million annual grant split among Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, the University of Michigan, the University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute, EngenderHealth in New York and Youth Catalytics in Vermont was eliminated immediately.These five groups were unfunded after one year of their five-year projects. They were responsible for providing resources, such as training for recruiting and communication, to the other grant holders. The five groups received letters saying that the cut was due to changing program priorities and that the projects were no longer in the federal government’s best interest.The elimination of funding was done outside the traditional federal budget process. Congress has begun negotiations on the spending bill, and on Wednesday, an appropriations subcommittee cut money for teen pregnancy prevention.Pat Paluzzi of the Healthy Teen Network in Baltimore said the axing of the program, including her project to develop an app to answer teen girls’ health questions, is “part and parcel of the shift to abstinence-only dollars.”“They don’t like to deal with the sexual reproductive health of teens,” Paluzzi said. “They frame it in this country as moral issues. Public health issues shouldn’t be political issues.”Several grantees were told by officials at the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Adolescent Health that the decision to eliminate funding came from the office of the assistant secretary for health. Last month, President Donald Trump appointed a new chief of staff there, Valerie Huber, who favors abstinence as the solution to teen pregnancy.The office of the assistant secretary for health on Thursday confirmed eliminating the final two years of funding for the 81 programs but declined to answer questions.“All of these grantees were given a project end date of June 30, 2018, allowing the grantees an opportunity to adjust their program and plan for an orderly close out,” a Health and Human Services Department spokesman said.The funded programs were exclusively involved in preventing youth pregnancies; no abortion counseling was provided.Some grant holders were unaware that their final two years of funding was eliminated until they were contacted by Reveal this week. They had thought the letters were a routine authorization of 2017-18 funds and hadn’t noticed the line saying it was the final year of funding.When Hettema contacted the Department of Health and Human Services for an explanation, staff in the Office of Adolescent Health “were extremely shocked and still trying to find out who made the decision and how this came about,” she said.The University of New Mexico had been recruiting for a randomized study of 1,000 participants in a program created for doctors’ offices to help low-income Latino and Native American teens. Now they’ll probably end up with half that number, which would turn it into a pilot study with much less value for health providers, Hettema said.“It’s kind of like building half a skyscraper and then saying, ‘Never mind,’ ” Hettema said. “And there are thousands of health care providers in this country who are winging it in terms of how to talk to teens about unintended pregnancies.”Luanne Rohrbach, an associate professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, said the eliminated programs, including the one she directed, are scientifically based.“We took decades of research on how to effectively approach prevention and have applied it on a large scale nationally,” she said. “We’re not out there doing what feels good. We’re doing what we know is effective. There are a lot of data from the program to show that it works.”The USC program supports a sexual health education program in middle schools in the Los Angeles and Compton unified school districts and in an alternative high school system. Included are workshops that teach parents how to talk to kids about delaying sexual activity and where to find health services for preventing disease and pregnancy.In the San Antonio area, Healthy Futures of Texas provides education on preventing teen pregnancies and uses a control group to assess the effectiveness of the program.“Our research design is to follow young people for a year and see if the program is making a difference,” said Dr. Janet Realini, associate vice president of Healthy Futures of Texas. Without the funds, “it’s going to be very difficult for us.”“The folks I’ve talked to who have had many federal grants say they would normally have had some notice,” she said.In May, Congress approved $101 million for the third year of the 81 grants. But Trump’s proposed budget did not include any funding for fiscal year 2018.Huber, the new chief of staff for the office of the assistant secretary for health, previously was the president of Ascend, which used to be named the National Abstinence Education Association.In a 2014 paper on the history of sex education, Huber criticized Obama for creating comprehensive sex education programs at the expense of focusing on abstinence.“Pro-sex organizations used every opportunity to attack abstinence education,” Huber wrote with co-author Michael Firmin. “This agenda was (and is) at least as much about destroying abstinence education as it is about supporting ‘comprehensive’ sex education. … The current Obama administration has used its fiscal scalpel to eliminate the growth of abstinence education within America’s school systems.”Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon who was a U.S. representative from Georgia, was confirmed by Congress as health secretary in February. He has been vehemently opposed to federal programs involving contraception.In Congress, he voted to eliminate Title X, which subsidizes contraception for low-income women. He opposed an Affordable Care Act provision that requires insurance plans to cover contraception.“Bring me one woman who has been left behind. Bring me one. There’s not one,” Price told a ThinkProgress reporter when asked about the provision in 2012. “The fact of the matter is this is a trampling on religious freedom and religious liberty in this country.”The U.S. teen birth rate remains higher than many other developed nations despite a continuing decline.In 1991, 62 out of every 1,000 females ages 15 to 19 gave birth, according to federal data. By 2014, it had dropped to 24. Health officials say the primary reason for the decline is more access to birth control because sexual activity has remained constant over the years.Rohrbach and other grantees said they have evidence that certain programs are successful in reaching teens to prevent pregnancies.Teen parents tend to have less education and are more likely to live in poverty and have chronic medical conditions. Thirty percent of teen girls who have dropped out of high school cite pregnancy or parenthood as a reason, according to the Congressional Research Service.The unfunded programs are designed to focus on the highest-risk communities in the country.“Yes, the teen pregnancy rate has gone down,” Rohrbach said. But “if you look at the kids that live in disadvantaged neighborhoods, you see that the decline in teen pregnancies is not as steep as it is nationwide. The rates of teen pregnancies are still relatively high.”Reveal reporter Trey Bundy contributed to this story.

12,TASTE,Sriracha Mac Sauce Is FINALLY Coming To McDonald's Nationwide,Carly Ledbetter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mcdonalds-sriracha-mac-sauce_us_5968dbc6e4b0d6341fe86421,🔥 PREPARE YOUR TASTE BUDS 🔥,2017-07-14,Wondering what to dip in the sauce? Nuggets will do.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5968f3f21500006303bfd989.png?cache=kNwMJq5dLu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sriracha, the hot sauce that’s saved our tastes buds from bland food countless times, has been around since 1980. People became truly obsessed with it around 2010, but it appears McDonald’s only recently discovered its popularity. On Thursday, the fast food chain added two limited-edition Sriracha items to its nationwide menu ― a Signature Sriracha sandwich and Sriracha Mac dipping sauce to give your fries an extra kick. (To be fair, McDonald’s first started testing out these Sriracha items last year in select markets.)The Signature Sriracha sandwich, a beef patty that comes with creamy Sriracha Mac Sauce, onions, tomatoes, white cheddar cheese and spinach, has another somewhat old “trendy” food item on it ― kale (another food trend that McDonald’s is a little late on). According to a press release, this is the first time kale will make an appearance on a McDonald’s sandwich, though it’s been featured in salads since 2015.And then there’s the Sriracha Mac dipping sauce. “The combination of Sriracha with our iconic Big Mac Sauce is the perfect blend of ingredients that speaks to our flavor fans who love Sriracha,” chef Michael Haracz, manager of culinary innovation at McDonald’s USA, said in a 2016 press release when the chain was testing out the sauce at select restaurants.

13,ENTERTAINMENT,Chance The Rapper Says SoundCloud Is 'Here To Stay' After Talk With Co-Founder,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chance-the-rapper-soundcloud_us_59692a97e4b0d6341fe8e07f,The future of the music service has been called into question in recent days.,2017-07-14,Chance The Rapper is doing what he can to help save Soundcloud. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59692b9b1500006303bfda26.jpeg?cache=ecZAdFgjug&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whether SoundCloud will make it to the end of summer, let alone the end of the year, has become something of an open question in recent days. Last week, Alexander Ljung, one of the music service’s co-founders, announced that the company was letting go of 173 of its employees, or 40 percent of its workforce. What’s worse, sources told TechCrunch that the layoffs only made sure the company could make it to the fourth quarter of the financial year “fully funded,” leading to questions about how long the struggling service could last.The news caused alarm among the service’s dedicated user base, among them Chance The Rapper, who told his 4.75 million followers on Thursday that he was “working” on solving the incredibly complex financial problem. What a difference a day can make. On Friday, Chance, an independent artist-turned-megastar, said he spoke with Ljung and that SoundCloud is “here to stay.”About an hour later, SoundCloud echoed Chance’s message over Twitter. Ljung also blogged about the current state of things on the SoundCloud blog: Hey everyone,Now, did Chance really just swoop in and save the day? While we’d like to believe so ― who doesn’t want to believe in Chance? ― it’s also just as (if not more) likely that Ljung told Chance what he wanted to hear. After all, Ljung isn’t going to tell anyone right now, much less someone with millions of Twitter followers, that his company is doomed.But if you want to believe, then believe. It’s Friday after all."

16,POLITICS,Pope's Confidantes Pen Blistering Critique Of Steve Bannon's View of Christianity,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/popes-confidantes-pen-blistering-critique-of-steve-bannons-view-of-christianity_us_5968e8a3e4b0d6341fe8706c,They did not hold back.,2017-07-14,"Pope Francis meets U.S. President Donald Trump during a private audience at the Vatican, May 24, 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5969172d1500006303bfd9e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two of Pope Francis’ close confidantes have published a scathing rebuke of how a certain strand of what they call religious “fundamentalism” has become fused with politics in America.The Vatican-vetted article, published in the Rome-based Jesuit publication La Civiltà Cattolica, calls out “evangelical fundamentalists” and explicitly mentions President Donald Trump, who identifies as a Presbyterian, and his adviser Steve Bannon, who identifies as Catholic.The authors of the article are the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, the editor-in-chief of La Civiltà Cattolica, and Rev. Marcelo Figueroa, a Presbyterian pastor who serves as editor-in-chief of an edition of the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano published for Francis’ home country of Argentina. The article attacks the decades-old partnership between two strands of American Christianity ― fundamentalist evangelicals and Catholics who are brought together by the “same desire for religious influence in the political sphere.” Although these two groups differ on a number of theological issues, they have come together since the 1980s and 1990s over issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, according to the AP. Spadaro and Figueroa accused this group of misinterpreting verses in the Bible to fit their own political stances on a wide range of topics ― from war-mongering to climate change to the idea of America as a “promised land” that is to be defended against all odds. The authors wrote that these evangelicals and Catholics “condemn traditional ecumenism and yet promote an ecumenism of conflict that unites them in the nostalgic dream of a theocratic type of state.” One of the most worrisome aspects of this alliance for the pair is how it encourages hatred of different ethnicities and conflates Islam with terrorism. This view of the world stands in stark contrast to Pope Francis’ interfaith outreach and his repeated calls to build bridges, not walls. “The most dangerous prospect for this strange ecumenism is attributable to its xenophobic and Islamophobic vision that wants walls and purifying deportations,” the authors wrote. At one point, Spadaro and Figueroa compared Bannon’s worldview to that of the so-called Islamic State, calling Bannon a “supporter of an apocalyptic geopolitics.” They claim this vision of the world reduces everything to a battle between good and evil, between God and Satan. Spadaro and Figueroa wrote that the desire of these Christian fundamentalists is to “submit the state to the Bible with a logic that is no different from the one that inspires Islamic fundamentalism.”“We must not forget that the theopolitics spread by Isis is based on the same cult of an apocalypse that needs to be brought about as soon as possible,” they wrote. Figueroa is a longtime friend of the pope and at one point, co-hosted a TV show with Francis for a Catholic channel in Buenos Aires. Figueroa was personally chosen by Francis last year to run the Argentine edition of L’Osservatore Romano. Spadaro, who like Francis is a Jesuit, has maintained close communication with the pope since Francis’ election. Under his watch, La Civiltà Cattolica has become “one of the foremost vehicles for understanding the views of the current pontificate,” according to the Catholic news organization Crux. The AP reports that the publication has become an “unofficial mouthpiece of the papacy.”La Civiltà Cattolica isn’t an official Vatican news source, but it is reviewed by the Vatican’s Secretary of State before it is published, according to Crux. In contrast to this “apocalyptic” view of politics and religion, the two authors claim that Francis seeks another path. The pope, they say “radically rejects” the idea of creating an actual Kingdom of God here on earth through politics, including at the level of a political “party.” “Francis wants to break the organic link between culture, politics, institution and Church. Spirituality cannot tie itself to governments or military pacts for it is at the service of all men and women. Religions cannot consider some people as sworn enemies nor others as eternal friends. Religion should not become the guarantor of the dominant classes,” the pair wrote."

Roberson.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596820611a00003300dbeb36.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An Airbnb host in Amsterdam accused of pushing a guest down a flight of stairs for missing her checkout time faces attempted murder charges. Video of the confrontation went viral after the guest’s friend, Zanele Muholi, a popular South African artist and activist, posted it to Instagram on Saturday.The video shows the host, a white male, telling Sibahle Steve Nkumbi, a South African filmmaker and student in Bern, Switzerland, to get out of his rental property.The host then pushes Nkumbi, sending her head-first down a long staircase. She lands at the bottom, face-down and motionless.“He threw their belongings out ... for a few mins late checkout,” Muholi, who was also staying in the Airbnb rental, wrote on Instagram. Muholi, who said Nkumbi was sent to the hospital, claimed the confrontation stemmed from “racism and can’t be justified.” Nkumbi sustained a concussion, bump to the head and bruises, according to South African news site News24. Amsterdam police arrested the host, who is reportedly 47 years old. Dutch prosectors told Reuters they are considering charging him with attempted murder.Police told South African news site Independent Online that four women had rented the apartment and were due to check out at 11 a.m. on Saturday.The women got into an argument with the Airbnb host over their checkout time around 12:30 p.m. before the confrontation became physical and one woman fell down the stairs, a spokesperson for the Amsterdam police said.Nkumbi was in Amsterdam to write about Muholi’s photography exhibit at the Stedelijk Museum one day earlier. The museum had booked the Airbnb rental for the artists to stay in, according to HuffPost South Africa.In a YouTube interview with independent journalist Kevin P. Roberson, Nkumbi claimed that the man grabbed her as she was trying to leave the apartment and threw her down the stairs. She also said she believes the confrontation was racially motivated.According to Nkumbi, a woman knocked on their rental unit and politely told them that they were late for checkout, saying they had to pack up and leave immediately. Nkumbi said she had “apologized profusely” and asked for a moment to gather their things. The woman came back a few minutes later with her husband, who was visibly angry and banging on the door, Nkumbi recalled, adding that the man was verbally abusive and referred to the women as “you people.”Nkumbi said the man appeared to be emotional and told her and her friends, “You’re not the great artist that you think you are,” “You’re not the queen that you think you are” and “This is not Africa.”“The connection of those words, any person of color that reads this and has been a witness or has witnessed racist attacks, you know it when it happens to you,” Nkumbi said on YouTube.The man pushed Nkumbi as she tried to steady herself on the wall, but eventually she lost grip of the wall and “flew down” the stairs. She passed out from the fall and later woke up in the hospital.“His body language, his facial expression, the way that he was actually looking at us, it was not a matter of you looking at another human,” Nkumbi said. “I guarantee you, had this been a white person, it would have turned out differently.”Muholi, who filmed the incident, told HuffPost South Africa that she believes the man is racist and a coward.“How does he justify pushing a defenseless woman the way he did?” Muholi said.“He must have looked at her and concluded that it was me since we both have dreadlocks,” she added. “It pisses me off to think this man was ready to kill my friend for no apparent reason, barely 24 hours since the opening of the exhibition. It makes me so mad.”David King, Airbnb’s director of diversity and belonging, called the incident “appalling and unconscionable” in a statement sent to HuffPost. King and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky are reaching out to the guests.“We will take the strongest actions we can against such abhorrent conduct, including banning people for life from our platform and assisting law enforcement with their investigation and potential prosecution,” King said. “Nobody should ever be treated like this and it will not be tolerated.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said the man was charged with attempted murder. Dutch prosecutors told Reuters that they are considering pressing charges, but have not yet done so. "

20,POLITICS,Some GOP Lawmakers Really Want To Carry Guns In The Capitol,Dana Liebelson and Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-lawmakers-guns-capitol_us_5967d469e4b03389bb16218c,"“I feel like I have very good aim,” said one House Republican.",2017-07-14,Rep. Ted Yoho compares carrying a concealed gun everywhere to carrying a cell phone.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5967d52e1500002000bfd794.jpeg?ops=crop_54_125_4433_2485%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) loves the idea of bringing a gun to work.He can’t do it right now. Congressional lawmakers and others who can carry concealed guns elsewhere still have to apply for a D.C.-specific permit if they want to be armed in the city, and only law enforcement officers are allowed to carry inside the U.S. Capitol. But after a gunman opened fire on GOP lawmakers during baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, last month, House Republicans introduced a flurry of bills that would let them carry concealed weapons almost anywhere.For Yoho, carrying a concealed gun is just like having a cell phone in his pocket. He’s usually armed when he’s home, and he was packing at a recent constituent event in his northern Florida district. When his office had a staff retreat, he took the entire team out skeet shooting. So he’s all for arming members of Congress.“I think it’s a good idea. I have the right to protect myself,” Yoho told HuffPost. “I feel like I have very good aim. My wife is better.”The bills that Yoho’s colleagues are pushing — there are at least three of them — vary slightly. One would let members of Congress carry a concealed weapon anywhere in the country, including in the Capitol, with a permit. (There are a few exceptions ― for instance, where the Secret Service prohibits it.) Another bill would allow the lawmakers to carry a concealed gun almost anywhere and let the U.S. Capitol Police make the rules about carrying inside the Capitol. A third bill would let the lawmakers carry a gun anywhere in the United States, except for the Capitol.Some Republicans couldn’t contain their excitement at the prospect of being able to carry a hidden weapon at work.“Oh. Oh yes,” said Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), as a smile spread across his face. “Because sometimes I walk out [of the building] and I don’t go back to my office.”Asked if that meant he worries he might be attacked once he leaves the safety of the Capitol, Sessions replied sharply, “I didn’t say ‘worry.’ You know what? When you’ve got a place where five or more members [of Congress] are without police, you become a target.”During the attack on GOP lawmakers last month, which injured Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) and others, law enforcement officers already on the scene helped subdue the shooter. But the only reason that the armed Capitol Police were there was to provide the security escort that Scalise receives as a member of the House Republican leadership. The other lawmakers present — two of whom, Reps. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) and Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), are co-sponsors of the new bills — were unarmed.Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) — who moved his congressional office in Kentucky out of a gun-free building and encourages his employees to carry firearms — said he has talked to members of Congress and a staffer who were at the baseball practice who “believe they could have done something” if they’d had a gun.Some of those lawmakers are “very proficient” with firearms, Massie said. “I know this because I’ve shot with them at the congressional shooting competition.” Lawmakers might also have had a “better position on the shooter,” he added.Gun rights advocates routinely claim that arming ordinary citizens helps prevent shootings. But of 62 mass shootings in the United States over the last 30 years, not a single one was ended this way, according to an in-depth investigation by Mother Jones. It’s not just unusual for armed civilians to try to intervene in a shooting rampage, but those attempts are rarely successful, the magazine found.“It’s a crazy thing to have gone through, obviously,” said Peter Ambler, who served as legislative director for then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) at the time she was shot in the head in Tucson, Arizona, in 2011. “You sort of feel really vulnerable in situations like that.”But, he added, “there’s a big difference between owning a gun or having one on you, and also knowing how to effectively use it in a situation.” Ambler, who was not there the day his boss was critically injured, is now executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, the Giffords-founded gun violence prevention group.An armed civilian who helped subdue the gunman in Tucson also almost shot an innocent person. The officers who shot the gunman at the GOP baseball practice “spend their professional lives training for situations like that,” Ambler noted. Most average people aren’t going to have that kind of training, he said.Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) said he didn’t worry there could be consequences if lawmakers carried guns ― and, say, one of them was a bad shot. “I don’t worry about that too much because I already carry a gun,” he said. “I don’t worry about anything.”“He’s only worried about the good shots,” Sessions chimed in with a laugh.Some of their Democratic colleagues, however, were horrified at the idea of members of Congress walking around with concealed weapons.“There are a lot of members that don’t know how to handle firearms,” said Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), who noted she has a BB gun at home, but just for shooting squirrels. “There’s enough high emotion around this place. It would not be just a danger to members of Congress. It would be a danger to the public.”None of the bills focused on expanding lawmakers’ access to guns is expected to go very far. But gun control advocates worry that they reflect another, broader push by the National Rifle Association to mandate concealed carry reciprocity nationwide, which would require states to recognize concealed carry gun permits from all other states. Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) introduced the NRA-backed legislation in January and it has a whopping 200 co-sponsors — nearly half of the House of Representatives.Prior to the baseball practice shooting, GOP lawmakers and the NRA appeared to be focusing on an effort to loosen restrictions on gun silencers. But the shooting took place on the same day that a House committee hearing was scheduled to address that topic. That hearing was promptly canceled and hasn’t been rescheduled. The NRA’s focus has turned to making it easy for people to carry concealed nationwide.“In the days after the Alexandria shooting, the gun lobby made a calculated shift from focusing on making firearm silencers more widely available to pushing proposals to move us towards ‘concealed carry reciprocity’ ... [which] would decimate our nation’s public safety laws,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, in an email.It’s unclear when, or if, the reciprocity bill will get a vote. The NRA did not respond to a request for comment on legislative strategy. Although Massie isn’t a co-sponsor on the lawmaker-specific bills, he has his own proposal to allow concealed carry permit holders from other states to bear arms in Washington, D.C.“We’ve got to take care of everybody at the same time, not just the lawmakers,” he said.But members of Congress really want to pack heat themselves. Yoho laughed when asked if he felt comfortable with someone like Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.), best known for body-slamming a reporter on the campaign trail, carrying a gun in the Capitol.“Keeps you in check, doesn’t it?” he said."

The massive blast demolished the house, across from the fields where they were working, as well as a swing set nearby. Ali’s 10-year-old daughter Abeer, who had been on the swing, was killed instantly.Terrified they could be hit by another airstrike amid Yemen’s civil war, Ali’s family left the farm. They found a place to dig a makeshift underground bunker, which Ali described as a “big hole covered with curtains,” for the family to live in.But without the farm’s produce to eat and sell, they struggled to survive. By April, the war looked set to take another of Ali’s children. This time, it was 3-month-old Ishraq. Diagnosed with severe malnutrition, Ishraq was fighting for her life at the al-Jamhouri medical center in Saada City. “Our children cry day and night because of the lack of food and clean water,” Ali told reporter and activist Ahmad Algohbary at the hospital. “There are times that I wish for death instead of living this life.” Located in northern Yemen along the Saudi border, Saada governorate is one of the most isolated and dangerous parts of the war-torn country and nearly inaccessible to journalists and foreigners. The constant violence has made civilian life extremely difficult. Bombings have reduced many schools and markets in the once-lively Saada City to rubble. In rural areas, where the air campaign has been relentless and resources have traditionally been scarce, the destruction is even worse.Before the war, Yemen relied on imports for more than 90 percent of its staple foods. These days, aid deliveries to Saada are complicated by checkpoints and road blockades manned by military forces loyal to the government as well as the bombings by the international coalition that supports President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.Saada governorate is the birthplace of the Houthi movement, an armed Shiite rebellion that swept through the southern part of the country in 2014 and eventually overtook the capital. The offensive forced Hadi’s government to flee further south to the port city of Aden. The government soon garnered support from a military coalition of nine Middle Eastern and African countries, led by Saudi Arabia.Both the U.S. and the U.K. provide the Saudis with arms. In May, the Trump administration committed to $110 billion in weapons sales for the Saudi kingdom.The coalition’s airplanes have conducted at least 2,166 bombings in Saada governorate since the start of 2015, according to the Yemen Data Project, an independent effort to collect and disseminate information on the war. That’s an average of 127 bombings each month. Strikes on non-military sites like mosques, markets and hospitals outnumber hits on military targets 3 to 1, the database says.So far this year, Saada has seen 268 bombings. The most recent attack, on a market last month, killed at least 25 civilians who were out shopping.In Saada City, aid workers have warned, the nutritional situation is at emergency levels. The city has the highest rates of stunted growth and development in the world, with 1 in 8 children affected due to malnutrition. Over 67 percent of children living in the governorate are chronically malnourished, according to UNICEF. Nearly 10 percent of children under age 5 are acutely malnourished, with 2 percent of that group suffering severe acute malnutrition. “We only had a small number of cases of malnutrition before the war, but after the war, we have gotten so many,” Dr. Ali al-Kamadi, who works in al-Jamhouri’s nutrition department, told Algohbary in April.The April visit was the citizen journalist’s fifth trip to Saada governorate this year. Algohbary, who lives in Yemen’s capital city of Sanaa, sat down with the staff at al-Jamhouri and the families of several children diagnosed with malnutrition. He provided HuffPost with photos as well as Arabic transcripts of his interviews.Even as the situation in Saada deteriorates daily, al-Kamadi said the hospital has still managed to provide crucial life-saving support for children in the region, including the baby son of Nadia Mohammed.Mohammed told Algohbary that she had sold all of her gold to buy her family any food she could find. The 33-year-old mother couldn’t recall the last time her family had eaten meat or rice.In the weeks and months before arriving at the hospital, her 10-month-old baby, Naji, had cried relentlessly. Mohammed and her husband noticed that the baby’s stomach had started to swell and they had cauterized it in a desperate effort to stop the swelling and alleviate the pain. The centuries-old medical practice is used in Yemen to treat a wide range of diseases, only sometimes effectively.“We thought it would help him recover, but he kept crying,” Mohammed recalled.Finally, she heard about al-Jamhouri from neighbors. At the hospital, she learned that Naji was suffering from a severe type of malnutrition called kwashiorkor, which is caused by a lack of protein and often leads to a bloated stomach. After receiving treatment at al-Jamhouri, Naji is recovering at home with his family.Children like Naji are on the frontline of Yemen’s health crisis. Even before the civil war ravaged the country, Yemen was the poorest nation in the Middle East. Today, more than 2 million children there are malnourished. Half a million suffer from severe acute malnutrition, which is a life-threatening condition.Weakened by the lack of the food, children are at increased risk of dying from preventable diseases like cholera. Yemen is battling a cholera outbreak that has already affected 300,000 people and has killed more than 1,600.Every year, about 40,000 children in the country don’t live past their fifth birthday. “The conflict in Yemen is fueling one of the world’s worst children’s crises,” Bismarck Swangin, a communications specialist with UNICEF based in Sanaa, told HuffPost. The crisis is compounded by the damage the war has done to the country’s health care system. More than half of medical facilities are partially destroyed or closed due to severe shortages in medicine, equipment, staff and infrastructure. A de facto naval blockade imposed by the Saudi-led coalition has restricted the importation of food, medical supplies and fuel. Civilians have been prevented from traveling abroad for medical treatment ever since commercial flights to Sanaa were suspended in August 2016.The Houthi rebels, government forces and coalition planes have all been accused of targeting health centers ― by bombing facilities, stealing ambulances, and looting medicine and medical equipment, according to a report by Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict. “Hospitals are being systematically attacked as a tactic of war by Saudi and their allies,” said Christine Monaghan, research officer at the Watchlist. “Those attacks, coupled with the denial of access to humanitarian aid because of the blockade, has meant that the civilian population, particularly children, are dying of preventable diseases on a large scale,” she added.Before the war began in 2015, Saada governorate counted 700,000 residents, but many civilians fled as resources became scarce and the Saudi coalition urged them to evacuate in 2015. The population of Saada City itself has been cut in half with just 25,000 civilians remaining. The al-Jamhouri hospital is a rare lifeline to those caught between poverty and violence. It is one of perhaps no more than four functioning medical centers in the governorate. Al-Jamhouri contains a maternity ward, a trauma center, surgical wards and emergency rooms. The international medical organization Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, had supported the hospital with drugs, medical equipment and staff. However, it was forced to withdraw its people in August 2016 when the increase in bombings made Saada too dangerous.Many doctors who still work in Yemen are near despair.Dr. al-Kamadi said that families often have to break off treatment for their children at al-Jamhouri when they run out of funds to cover the cost of medicine, food and hotel stays.Dr. Mariam Aldogani, who works in Sanaa for the international aid organization Save the Children, said doctors in the country see up to 180 patients a day, even though many health workers have not received salaries for months.“We cannot keep up,” Aldogani told HuffPost over Skype. “Medical workers are struggling. We are simply not able to cover the medical needs of the country.”“I’ve seen the fear in the eyes of mothers,” Aldogani added. “The hardest part of my job is not being able to save everyone.” As the clock is ticking, UNICEF and other humanitarian organizations are calling for donations. Members of the international community pledged to meet just over half of the United Nations’ $2.1 billion appeal at a summit in Geneva, Switzerland, in April.“I fail to grasp how the international community can see this crisis unfold without doing its utmost to limit the suffering that Yemenis are facing,” Mutasim Hamdan, Yemen country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said during the summit. Aid workers are pleading with countries like the U.S. and the U.K. to go beyond donating and stop the flow of arms to the warring parties in Yemen.“The day in which there are no weapons sold to any warring parties anywhere in the world, it would be very difficult for war to take place,” U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said at the summit when asked about the complicity of major donor countries that have also supplied arms for Yemen’s conflict.In the meantime, Yemen’s smallest citizens are running out of time.Grandmother Alia Alaloot told Algohbary about her long journey in search of safety. Alaloot’s adult children were farmers in Saada’s Saqeen district when a cluster bomb hit the family farm earlier this year. Alaloot was left to raise her newborn grandson Faris alone.She and the baby first sought shelter in a refugee camp in al-Manbaah, a city located in the neighboring Hajjah governorate near the Saudi border. But much like Saada City, the Houthi-controlled Manbaah was the frequent target of Saudi shelling. It wasn’t long before food in the refugee camp ran out.Alaloot realized she could not stay. She and the starving baby set out on a six-hour trip to al-Jamhouri, traveling by donkey and then by cab. After months of intensive treatment at the hospital, Faris is recovering. He’s in stable condition."

23,MEDIA,Trump Speaks Off The Record To Reporters Amid Solo News Conference Drought,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-off-the-record-press_us_59677c34e4b0a0c6f1e662de,"The White House later decided to allow portions on the record, leaving journalists in an awkward spot.",2017-07-13,"U.S. President Donald Trump, with his hand on his heart, and French President Emmanuel Macron listen to the national anthems during a welcome ceremony at Les Invalides in Paris on Thursday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596785f11a00003300dbe915.jpeg?cache=omZZftNPAA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump, who hasn’t held a solo press conference since February, on Wednesday night spent more than an hour talking with reporters who were traveling with him to Paris. But the journalists aboard Air Force One didn’t report Thursday morning what he said. The conversation ― which comes amid investigations into Trump associates’ links to Russia, along with increased scrutiny on close family members’ roles during the 2016 campaign ― was designated off the record. “Why did the reporters allow that to happen?” Tim Grieve, McClatchy’s vice president for news, asked on Twitter. “If POTUS has something to say to the press, he can say it on the record.”Grieve wasn’t alone in questioning the decision to give Trump the courtesy to speak off the record, particularly during this newsy time that comes amid a news conference drought. As journalists on social media debated the ground rules on Thursday, Trump seemed to retroactively change them following his meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.Trump asked New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, who is traveling with the president, why she didn’t publish his remarks from the previous night and asked if she heard him say they could be used on the record, according to a pool report she filed for the press corps. Haberman recalled telling Trump she was under the impression that the remarks were off the record since deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had declared them as such. Sanders later told HuffPost the White House would “release some excerpts from the conversation.”The White House’s decision created a dilemma for the reporters, with the Trump team now appearing to unilaterally decide what parts of an off-the-record conversation would be made public. Such ground rules are traditionally hashed out between the two parties of a conversation. Some journalists suggested that reporters shouldn’t abide by the original off-the-record ground rules and that the new arrangement is effectively quote-approval, a practice news organizations typically balk at. Journalists have given past presidents, including Barack Obama, the opportunity to visit the back of the plane on foreign trips and speak off the record. The reasoning, typically, is that it’s helpful to hear the president speak candidly and that such insights can better inform future reporting. And journalists have allowed Trump to speak off the record when desired, even as he has maligned the media and dubbed it “the enemy of the people.” Last month, Trump bashed the “fake news” media at a raucous Iowa rally and then spoke off the record to reporters for nearly half an hour on the flight back to Washington. The off-the-record discussion this week came hours after Trump tweeted about how the “Fake Media” makes up sources for stories, an unproven claim he’s made before to deflect scrutiny of his administration. The president has bucked tradition by holding only one solo, full-scale news conference during his first six months in office. This tally is fewer than any of Trump’s predecessors at this point in their presidencies since Ronald Reagan, according to Yahoo News.Trump has held about a dozen bilateral news conferences with foreign leaders, and participated in another one on Thursday with Macron. But these exchanges typically allow for only two questions from each of the leaders’ respective press corps, not an opportunity for Trump to face sustained questions.And although Trump did sit down with Reuters on Wednesday, most of his recent interviews have been with sympathetic hosts on Fox News or supporters like Pat Robertson, the televangelist who has suggested the president’s critics are serving Satan. There have also been no televised daily press briefings over the past two weeks, and journalists have said both on- and off-camera briefings increasingly yield little useful or new information. The Trump White House’s commitment to press access was also questioned Thursday when pool reporters, the rotating group of journalists trailing the president for the larger press corps, didn’t get to cover his remarks at the U.S. ambassador’s house in Paris. Haberman, the pool reporter on duty, informed her colleagues in the press that she learned from the president’s official Twitter feed that he had given remarks “to assembled service members and their families while the pool was kept in a holding room downstairs.”Other reporters noted the lack of coverage.Sanders told HuffPost that “it’s protocol that the press does not cover the meet and greets at the embassy.”“This was standard in previous administrations as well,” she said.In a later pool report, Haberman said some veteran White House reporters had told her that they had covered such meet-and-greets during the previous administration.

Dr. William Barber (C) is arrested for protesting against new GOP health care legislation in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's offices on Capitol Hill July 13, 2017 in Washington, DC. The latest version of the proposed bill aims to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also knows as Obamacare.

They were charged with crowding, obstructing, or incommoding. All 11 opted to pay fines and were released later in the day. The Rev. William Barber II, a prominent progressive Christian activist and president of the North Carolina NAACP, was among the four men and seven women who were arrested.Speaking at a rally before the arrest, Barber told a crowd of about 50 protestors that it was imperative for people of faith to speak out against the Better Care Reconciliation Act, the Republican party’s attempt at repealing and replacing President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.“We’re saying today it’s time for other clergy to come,” he said, according to Religion News Service. “It’s time for moral agents to step up. It’s time for us to go down to the house of power and challenge the way power is being used.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republican leaders unveiled a new version of the controversial measure on Thursday. The new bill promises to provide about $70 billion in additional funds to states to help make health care more affordable and also keeps in place some of Obamacare’s taxes on wealthy individuals. It still attempts to essentially restructure Medicaid and backtrack on the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of the program. The latest iteration of the bill is already receiving criticism from moderate Republican senators who are concerned about its deep cuts to Medicaid. The interfaith clergy protesting the bill on Thursday believe it is an inherently immoral policy that requires a religious response.The Rev. Traci Blackmon, executive minister of justice & witness ministries for the United Church of Christ, framed the protest in religious terms outside of McConnell’s office.“It is time to stop calling God by other names when you really want to call God capitalism. It is time to stop cloaking your greed in religious language,” Blackmon said. “If you can turn your back on people who are suffering from conditions that will no longer be able to be treated, don’t tell me you are pro-life.”“Health care is human right. Taking healthcare is sin. It’s wrong. It’s unjust. It’s immoral,” Barber said during the protest.The rally, called “The March to Save Medicaid, Save Lives,” aimed to send a “moral message that we cannot cut Medicaid – a lifeline for so many children, seniors and people with disabilities,” according to a press release. Religious leaders joined together in song and listened to speeches as they marched through the Russell Senate Office Building to McConnell’s office. Barber and Blackmon were also joined by Rev. Jennifer Butler, CEO of the progressive advocacy group Faith in Public Life and Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, Director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.“Kill the bill!” Barber shouted during the protest, while his co-protestors echoed him. “Let the people live!”Watch a video of the action below.

The new bill promises to provide about $70 billion in additional funds to states to help make health care more affordable and also keeps in place some of Obamacare’s taxes on wealthy individuals. It still attempts to essentially restructure Medicaid and backtrack on the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of the program. The latest iteration of the bill is already receiving criticism from moderate Republican senators who are concerned about its deep cuts to Medicaid. The interfaith clergy protesting the bill on Thursday believe it is an inherently immoral policy that requires a religious response.The Rev. Traci Blackmon, executive minister of justice & witness ministries for the United Church of Christ, framed the protest in religious terms outside of McConnell’s office.“It is time to stop calling God by other names when you really want to call God capitalism. It is time to stop cloaking your greed in religious language,” Blackmon said. “If you can turn your back on people who are suffering from conditions that will no longer be able to be treated, don’t tell me you are pro-life.”“Health care is human right. Taking healthcare is sin. It’s wrong. It’s unjust. It’s immoral,” Barber said during the protest.The rally, called “The March to Save Medicaid, Save Lives,” aimed to send a “moral message that we cannot cut Medicaid – a lifeline for so many children, seniors and people with disabilities,” according to a press release. Religious leaders joined together in song and listened to speeches as they marched through the Russell Senate Office Building to McConnell’s office. Barber and Blackmon were also joined by Rev. Jennifer Butler, CEO of the progressive advocacy group Faith in Public Life and Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, Director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.“Kill the bill!” Barber shouted during the protest, while his co-protestors echoed him. “Let the people live!”Watch a video of the action below.

31,POLITICS,Sheldon Silver Conviction Overturned After Supreme Court Changed The Definition Of Corruption,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheldon-silver-supreme-court-corruption_us_5967cb11e4b0d6341fe7978b,The McDonnell v. U.S. decision limited what prosecutors can charge as public corruption.,2017-07-13,Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell's corruption conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court in a 9-0 decision that relied on the court's limited definition of corruption in its 2010 Citizens United ruling.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5967ccad1a00003300dbea8a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― An appellate court on Thursday overturned the corruption conviction of Sheldon Silver, the powerful former Democratic Party leader of the New York State Assembly, based on a Supreme Court ruling that loosened the definition of corruption for politicians and public officials.Silver ruled one half of the New York State legislature for more than two decades before being found guilty in 2015 on seven counts related to his acceptance of a steady stream of payments through a law firm in exchange for official acts like directing grant money to his clients. But a subsequent Supreme Court decision shrank the definition of official corruption so much that Silver may now skate free.In 2016, a unanimous Supreme Court threw out the corruption conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, on the grounds that he did not take any official actions on behalf of the government after he received more than $700,000 in gifts from the head of a nutrition supplement business who his wife had a crush on. The decision in McDonnell v. U.S., penned by Chief Justice John Roberts and based on the court’s 2010 Citizens United ruling, limited the scope of corruption prosecutions to include only formal government actions taken in exchange for gifts, contributions or bribes. All three judges on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals tossed Silver’s conviction because, in light of the McDonnell decision, the jury was not properly instructed on what to consider an official action. “Given the teachings of the Supreme Court in McDonnell, and the particular circumstances of this case, we simply cannot reach that conclusion” that the jury was properly instructed, the judges wrote.Prosecutors for the Southern District of New York immediately announced that they would retry the case. “[W]e look forward to presenting to another jury the evidence of decades-long corruption by one of the most powerful politicians in New York state history,” acting U.S. attorney Joon Kim said in a statement.Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the southern district who prosecuted Silver and was fired by President Donald Trump in March, said in a tweet, “The evidence was strong. The Supreme Court changed the law. I expect Sheldon Silver to be retried and re-convicted.”“Nothing about this decision in any way indicates that what Sheldon Silver did was legal,” Dan Weiner, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, told HuffPost.Weiner said that unlike McDonnell, who hawked his benefactor’s diet pills at dinners in exchange for a Rolex, a sports car and other gifts, the Silver case featured solid evidence that the former assembly speaker took official action through his public position in exchange for payments through the law firm that employed him.“The facts seemed strong,” Megan McAllen, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center, said about Silver’s now-overturned conviction.While that might mean a successful re-prosecution, McAllen explained that the court’s overturning of the Silver conviction is more “fallout from the Supreme Court’s pretty short-sighted decision ― really narrowing the standards for corruption convictions.”Zephyr Teachout, an expert on corruption and the law at Fordham University and a Democratic congressional candidate in 2016, told HuffPost that she thought the appellate court was simply doing what it had to do in light of the McDonnell ruling. “I don’t see this as fatal,” she said.Silver may ultimately be convicted again on retrial despite the McDonnell decision. What concerns Teachout, though, is that the Supreme Court has repeatedly missed the point of protecting democracy from corruption in its cases from Citizens United to McDonnell.“The Supreme Court seems to think that our corruption problem is too many people trading explicit bags of cash for explicitly agreed-upon governmental actions,” she said. “That’s not our corruption problem. Our corruption problem is sophisticated political actors getting rich and powerful in exchange for doing favors for their donors.”McAllen echoed this. “In the wink-and-nod world of political corruption it makes it really difficult for the prosecutors to bring a case,” she said.And that is the ultimate concern. Silver will get another trial, but some public corruption investigations may not take place because of the court’s tightened definition of corruption."
32,POLITICS,The New Senate Health Care Bill Is Still An Assault On The Safety Net,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-senate-health-care-bill-is-still-an-assault-on-the-safety-net_us_596791a5e4b0a0c6f1e69c3c,Big Medicaid cuts and weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions remain at its heart.,2017-07-13,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell unveiled new language for the Senate GOP health care bill Thursday, but he still has to gather the votes needed to advance it.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596791ee2100003700fc6b46.jpeg?cache=9HZ9QPDGpE&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The new Senate Republican health care bill is out. It’s basically the same as the old one.New legislative language unveiled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) Thursday does include some notable changes, including leaving in place Affordable Care Act taxes on wealthy individuals and giving in to conservative demands that health insurance be further deregulated, according to a summary.At its core, however, the revised version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act ― which McConnell pulled two weeks ago because too few Republican senators planned to vote for it ― remains a vehicle for massive cuts to Medicaid, less financial assistance for people who buy private health insurance, and the return of skimpy junk insurance policies and discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. Taxes on the rich would remain, but health care companies would enjoy a major tax cut.The Congressional Budget Office projected the original bill would result in 49 million Americans being uninsured by 2026, compared with 28 million if the Affordable Care Act were left in place. Senate rules governing the legislative process McConnell is using to consider the bill require a new Congressional Budget Office score be completed before he can bring the measure to the floor. McConnell has said he wants to pass the legislation next week.While the changes to the bill may bring that number of uninsured down, the modified GOP legislation still seeks to significantly scale back federal support for health coverage programs. The bill cuts overall Medicaid funding by more than 30 percent, eliminates the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of that program and replaces Obamacare’s tax credit subsidies with smaller ones that would be available to fewer people.GOP senators met Thursday morning to review the new legislation, and McConnell still faces an uphill path to the 50 votes he needs to advance the bill.The Kentucky Republican can afford to lose just two of the 52 Republican senators; in his constitutional role as president of the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence can cast a tie-breaking vote, if needed. Already, GOP Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Susan Collins (Maine) have all but definitively declared they won’t support the bill.As happened when the House debated and ultimately passed its American Health Care Act in May, the core disputes between the more conservative wing of the GOP conference and “moderate” lawmakers are proving difficult to resolve.To appease Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other conservatives, McConnell included new provisions that would create a two-tiered health insurance market. Insurers would be able to offer plans that exclude people with pre-existing conditions or charge them higher rates ― or to market plans without comprehensive benefits ― just as long as they sell at least one plan with more comprehensive coverage that is available to everybody at a uniform price.The health insurance industry warns this system would fail because healthy customers would flock to the deregulated market, leaving sicker people behind in the Affordable Care Act-regulated market and leading to high costs and unaffordable premiums, especially for those who earn too much to qualify for tax credits to defray their costs.This part of the bill is in addition to the sweeping changes the underlying measure would make to the health insurance system, including allowing insurers to sell policies with less coverage but higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs than are permitted under the Affordable Care Act.The bill also would repeal the law’s individual mandate that most Americans obtain health coverage or face a tax penalty and its requirement that large employers offer health benefits to workers.States would be allowed to waive that law’s requirements for coverage of core benefits ― such as hospitalizations, prescription drugs, maternity care and mental health. This would undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, who could be offered plans that don’t cover medical services and products needed to treat their ailments. People whose health coverage lapses for more than 63 days would be locked out of the insurance market for six months.And insurers could charge older customers five times what they charge younger people, up from three times under the Affordable Care Act.Another set of provisions in the Better Care Reconciliation Act would permit small businesses to band together to buy health benefits for their workers through “association health plans” sponsored by trade organizations. This may allow these companies to save money by offering skimpier plans, but they also risk further unbalancing the market for people who buy their own insurance because healthier people would be absorbed into association health plans.Republican senators in the “moderate” camp, including Collins, Dean Heller (Nev.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) appear to have gotten little in the rewrite that might win their votes, particularly since they identified the Better Care Reconciliation Act’s enormous Medicaid cuts as their chief concern ― and the new bill retains them. That’s in spite of a new provision that would help Alaska’s exceptionally high-cost health insurance market.In addition to adopting a form of the insurance deregulation provisions favored by Cruz, the new bill includes other changes, according to the bill text and summary. They include: States would have access to $182 billion over 10 years to shore up their insurance markets through mechanisms that would compensate insurance companies that cover the sickest patients.Jonathan Cohn contributed reporting. This article has been updated with additional details from the new bill."
33,THE WORLDPOST,Trump Jr. Has Broken The Law. It's Time For Enforcement Action.,"Paul S. Ryan, ContributorVice president of policy and litigation, Common Cause",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-jr-russia-collusion_us_59667f20e4b0a8d46d11bf50,Here's how he broke the law and what needs to happen next.,2017-07-13,Donald Trump Jr. arrives at Trump Tower in New York. Jan. 18.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59669c461500002000bfd508.jpeg?cache=XF4eghHa2k&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Donald Trump Jr. released emails that implicate him, his brother-in-law and the former chairman of his father’s presidential campaign as potential partners in the Russian government’s effort to influence last year’s election, he also unveiled his first line of defense. But his claim that he and the campaign received nothing of value from their meeting with Kremlin-connected lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya is no defense at all.As complaints filed on Monday by Common Cause explain, federal campaign finance law makes it just as illegal for the Trump campaign or any other American to solicit a political contribution from a foreign citizen as to accept one. And the law does not limit contributions to money; anything of value, provided without charge or for less than its fair market price, is covered. That’s a common sense provision; without it, foreigners could intercede in our elections by providing candidates with airplane rides, hotel rooms and every sort of other service imaginable at no charge. All those goods and services would be just as troubling — and just as corrupting — as cash donations.The emails make it clear that the Trump Tower meeting was a solicitation. While Trump Jr. apparently did not initiate the contact with Veselnitskaya, he pursued it energetically. His three-word answer — “I love it” — to a friend’s claim that Veselnitskaya wanted to provide the Trump campaign with information about Hillary Clinton gathered by the Russian government speaks volumes. And his emailed request for a call with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov — “could we do a call first thing next week” — to obtain the offered information on Clinton is an illegal solicitation of a contribution from a foreign national.Also, remarkably, upon learning via email that Russians were offering opposition research on Clinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” Donald Trump Jr. expressed no alarm or surprise in his reply. Is it possible, or even likely, that team Trump was already aware of Russia’s meddling in our election, approved of such activity and may have even been coordinating with Russia on it?After sending that message, Trump Jr. arranged to meet Veselnitskaya at his office in Trump Tower — just one floor below his father’s suite — and got Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, and Paul Manafort, then Trump campaign chairman, to join them. The evidence is overwhelming that he did so expecting that the Russian would furnish information gathered by her government that would embarrass Clinton and help the Trump campaign. Both the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice have important roles to play in the enforcement of campaign finance laws. Illegally soliciting a contribution from a foreign national is subject only to F.E.C.-imposed minor civil penalties under the campaign finance act, meaning a small fine. However, with the complaint we filed, we’ve requested that the D.O.J. investigate the matter because it’s quite possible that a D.O.J. investigation would reveal that the Trump campaign was actually involved in making illegal contributions or expenditures, which would be subject to criminal prosecution and penalties — larger fines and imprisonment up to five years.Other emerging evidence raises questions of additional possible illegal activity and in some cases indicates that the Trump forces were aware of and perhaps cooperating in Russia’s electoral espionage and knew they shouldn’t have been. Consider:On June 7, 2016, two days before his son, Kushner and Manafort met with Veselnitskaya — and just hours after they set up the meeting — candidate Trump publicly promised to deliver “a major speech” within a few days “discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.” He never followed through, but his promise hints that he was expecting to come into possession of information damaging to Clinton.On July 27, roughly six weeks after the meeting, Trump Sr. publicly encouraged Russian intelligence services to steal and release any Clinton emails they could obtain. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” he said. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”At the very least, all this adds up to a compelling case for more digging, by special counsel Mueller, congressional investigators, the F.E.C., the press and by a yet-to-be-created independent commission like the ones that investigated the Kennedy assassination and the September 11 attacks.A sneak attack on our democratic process by a foreign adversary demands that kind of attention. I don’t often agree with Dick Cheney, in fact I think this is a first, but the former vice president is correct in asserting that the Russian attack is equivalent to an act of war.And yet the president continues to call it a witch hunt. Sad."

Trump signs the National Security Presidential Memorandum on Strengthening the Policy of the United States Toward Cuba, Miami, June 16, 2017 </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596770f621000025a7fc6ac7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On June 16, 2017, President Donald Trump announced his new Cuba policy in a speech in Miami, declaring that he was “canceling” President Barack Obama’s opening to Havana. Here are eight things you need to know about what Trump did—and didn’t –do.(1) National Security Presidential Memorandum on Cuba (NSPM)During President Trump’s appearance in Miami, he signed a new National Security Presidential Memorandum on Cuba which formalized elements of his new policy and replaced President Obama’s Presidential Directive on Cuba signed in October 2016. Obama’s directive laid out the rationale for a policy of engagement with Cuba and directed executive branch agencies to work toward its implementation. Rescinding it has no immediate practical effect, but signals that President Trump is no longer interested in a policy of normalization—something that was also clear from the confrontational tone of his Miami speech.(2) Travel OpportunitiesOne of the main policy changes President Trump announced was tightening restricts on travel to Cuba and stepping up enforcement to be sure that travelers are going for a legally approved purpose. There are 12 categories of legal travel to Cuba, but the most popular one for non-Cuban Americans is “people-to-people” educational travel, offered by cruise ships and travel providers like National Geographic and Classic Journeys. President Obama legalized individual people-to-people trips, which meant travelers could go on their own and pursue a personalized itinerary. President Trump canceled that. Now, to go on a people-to-people trip, you’ll have to go in an organized group led by a licensed traveler provider, and follow a set itinerary. But you can still bring back rum and cigars. (3) Transactions Benefiting the Cuban MilitaryThe other major policy change President Trump announced was a ban on any direct transactions with entities that would benefit the Cuban military disproportionately. The terms “direct” and “disproportionate” haven’t been defined yet. That will happen when the Treasury Department issues the implementing regulations. This could get complicated, because a lot of enterprises in the tourism sector, including hotels, restaurants, tourist taxis, rental cars, and retail stores are controlled by the Cuban armed forces ministry. The State Department will produce a list of prohibited enterprises, which should clarify who you can do business with in Cuba and who you can’t. The good news: ports, airports, and telecommunications are exempt from the new regulations, so cruise ships, airlines, and Google are all safe. Existing contracts are exempt, too.(4) RemittancesAt first glance, Trump’s National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM) seems to say that remittances will be unaffected, but another section of the NSPM expands the definition of “prohibited government officials” of Cuba from a few dozen people to hundreds of thousands. That’s important because under existing regulations, Americans cannot send remittances to any Cuban who is a prohibited person. We’ll just have to wait and see how the Treasury Department sorts that out when it writes the regulations.(5) Diplomatic RelationsDespite a very tough speech in Miami that denounced the Cuban government, President Trump did not break diplomatic relations with Havana. The United States and Cuba restored diplomatic relations on July 20, 2015. President Obama nominated career foreign service officer Jeffrey DeLaurentis, who was already serving in Havana as chief of the U.S. embassy, as ambassador, but he was never confirmed by the Senate. President Trump has not named an ambassador, but in his Miami speech, he indicated that he intended to keep the embassy open. So if you’re traveling to Cuba or doing business there, the embassy will still provide consular services as needed.(6) Terrorism ListPresident Trump has not put Cuba back on the State Department’s list of countries that support international terrorism. Cuba was on that list until 2015, when the U.S. intelligence community concluded that it met the conditions for being removed and President Obama removed it. Since then, U.S. and Cuban law enforcement officials have been cooperating on counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, and cyber crime. President Trump’s NSPM mentions law enforcement as an area where engagement with Cuba serves U.S. national interest.(7) Immigration PolicyPresident Trump is not restoring the wet foot/dry foot immigration policy that gave Cubans arriving in the United States a fast track to permanent residence and citizenship that no other immigrants enjoyed. President Obama ended wet foot/dry foot just before leaving office and President-elect Trump did not object at the time. Cuban immigrants are now treated no differently than immigrants from other countries. In his Miami speech, President Trump specifically said that he would not be changing that policy. (8) Bilateral AccordsBetween December 17, 2014, When President Obama announced the normalization of relations with Cuba, and the time he left office two years later, Cuba and the United States signed almost two dozen bilateral agreements on issues of mutual interest ranging from environmental protection to commercial air service. global health, and law enforcement. President Trump has not abrogated any of those agreements, and his NSPM lists many of the fields in which agreements have been signed as fields in which the United States will continue to engage with Cuba because it is in the national interest."

I imagine a labyrinth that patients and staff can walk through to soothe their thoughts and a pathway that weaves through different sections of a natural oasis.My dreams are starting to come true.Magical things happen every day when you’re in a garden. It draws individuals out and puts them in a more positive frame of mind.I know from experience. In 2013, I took over a modestly sized courtyard flower garden that had been tended for many years. With the help of a colleague, I slowly added more flowers to the garden, including zinnias, lilacs, and hibiscuses, and cared for it with the help of staff and patients. Many people witnessed the progress, as that area gets a lot of foot traffic and is visible from many of the Admissions Building’s windows.During the second season, I recruited a teenager—who was struggling considerably with her mental illness at the time—to plant a bunch of sunflower seeds with me and used the process as metaphor. We would talk about how plants grow and then how sometimes they have to go through a difficult period, maybe losing a branch and then growing another one. The premise of garden therapy is that people can see how nature works and heals itself and how it continues on, despite the setbacks. That young patient was so calm when we were in the garden.After several years of witnessing the positive effects of the garden on patients and staff, I have decided to take my horticultural project to the next level.Unfortunately, after our Admissions Building was renovated last year, its once verdant courtyard was looking somewhat ragged. I, however, saw this as an opportunity to further expand the plantings, beautify the courtyard, and get more patients and staff involved.Kelly Carlson, PhD, PMHNP-BC, McLean’s Nursing professional development specialist, immediately embraced this plan. Carlson, who has been working on nurse-led quality improvement projects around the hospital, saw this garden project as a perfect way to educate staff about grounding techniques—a therapeutic skillset for improving patient care.Therapeutic gardening can be a powerful way to ground psychiatric patients because it puts them in contact with nature and other people and gets their bodies moving. Grounding techniques help people detach from emotional pain by reconnecting with the external world and the present moment. While researchers are still learning exactly how tending plants affects the brain, what is known is that gardening reduces stress by decreasing the production of cortisol. And some research studies have confirmed its beneficial effects—particularly on elderly individuals and people with developmental delays.I can tell you that I continue to personally observe these positive effects over and over. For instance, a young woman who was experiencing suicidal thoughts did some planting with me recently and she reported that our work in the garden was the only positive thing in her day.Another young man whose aggression had been worrying staff reluctantly agreed to come out to the garden with me. Once there, he began talking enthusiastically about how he used to help his grandmother in her garden and asked me whether it would be okay to help me. He turned out to be a tremendous worker—weeding, raking, digging, and planting. He and another challenging teenage boy bonded through their experiences in the garden, working together and experiencing a calmness they had not demonstrated before while in treatment.While many patients get their hands dirty on a regular basis, others simply enjoy the garden from a seat on the patio or from a window in their room. There was the very depressed man who, for months, would silently watch others at work in the garden from the adjacent patio. After a while, he began identifying the plants as well as the weeds and sharing his own long history with horticulture. When he was discharged, he donated flowers to the garden.I am not the only staff member who is trying to bring more green into mental health care. The Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder Inpatient Program has a vegetable garden next to mine and a nurse from Geriatric Psychiatry Inpatient Services plans to create a garden for the program. Meanwhile, a behavior therapist who is pursuing a certification in horticultural therapy is hoping to plant herbs—with information explaining their therapeutic properties—outside the McLean building that houses our cafeteria, welcoming people to smell, touch, and enjoy them.All of these horticultural therapy projects fit in well with McLean’s long history of capitalizing on its beautiful landscape for the benefit of patients. In fact, famed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted helped to pick out the location for our main campus and walked its grounds as a patient.We have long used grounding techniques in this environment as a way to wake up individuals’ senses, helping them to come out of their painful places and connect with the outside world, whether by taking a walk, looking at a colorful tree, or picking up an aromatic pinecone. We look forward to continuing and building on this therapeutic tradition.Jeanette Kingsley, RN, is a nurse at the Short Term Unit, part of the Adult Inpatient Services at McLean Hospital, providing acute mental health treatment for individuals in crisis.

39,POLITICS,Sessions Argues 'Sanctuary' Cities Breed Crime By Citing Study That Says They Don't,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-sanctuary-cities_us_5967b870e4b0174186260c2b,The Trump administration has a history of twisting the facts on immigration policies.,2017-07-13,U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a news conference on Thursday. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5967b9bd1a00003400dbea32.jpeg?cache=FmDXuVrdYP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Wednesday that a study had found so-called sanctuary cities have more violent crime than others, it came as a surprise to the people who conducted the research.“When cities like Philadelphia, Boston or San Francisco advertise that they have these policies, the criminals are taking notice, too. They’ve got a good idea of where they might want to go, it seems to me,” Sessions said during a speech railing against jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with deportation efforts. “According to a recent study from the University of California, Riverside, cities with these policies have more violent crime on average than those that don’t.”But that’s not what the study showed, according to one of its authors. In fact, it found that there’s no evidence of sanctuary policies having any effect on crime ― and researchers say they believe Sessions and the conservative media are twisting their study to fit their own narratives about the dangers of immigration.Sessions, along with President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, has made a mission of forcing jurisdictions to cooperate with immigration enforcement. “This narrative that sanctuary policies increase crime rates is one that has not been backed up by a single shred of evidence,” said Benjamin Gonzalez-O’Brien, one of the authors of the study and an assistant professor of political science at Highline College.Gonzalez-O’Brien co-authored a study on sanctuary policies with Loren Collingwood, assistant professor of political science at University of California, Riverside, and Stephen El-Khatib, a graduate student at the same university. They looked at data from 55 cities and found that a sanctuary designation had no statistical effect on crime. In the months since they published a piece on their findings in The Washington Post, their writing has been cherry-picked by conservative media outlets and opponents of sanctuary policies and used as evidence that they are dangerous. Gonzalez-O’Brien said he was “surprised and pretty upset” on Wednesday when he began receiving messages saying Sessions had referenced their study during a speech. He has done extensive research on immigration and crime rates, and said the inaccurate narrative that sanctuary cities breed crime “puts people in danger” because those policies are partly meant to encourage undocumented communities to work with police. This may be happening under Trump, as fewer Latinos report rape and domestic abuse, according to some law enforcement officials.Gonzalez-O’Brien and the other researchers set out to set the record straight, although the Justice Department isn’t backing down: A spokesman said the department stands by the speech in spite of the researchers saying Sessions misstated their findings.The Justice Department referred HuffPost to an article in Fox News that briefly references the study by Gonzalez-O’Brien, Collingwood and El-Khatib. The Fox News reporter quotes from the piece the researchers wrote for the Post’s Monkey Cage blog in October and from the study itself, but doesn’t provide links to either source or specify where the quotes come from. Fox News wrote that the study “found ‘violent crime is slightly higher in sanctuary cities.’ It concluded there was ‘no statistically discernible difference in violent crime rates, rape, or property crime across’ 55 cities studied.” That article left out some crucial context, as did a piece on the conservative outlet WND, Gonzalez-O’Brien said. The researchers did write in their Washington Post piece that ”[v]iolent crime is slightly higher in sanctuary cities than non-sanctuary cities,” but the next line said that “the relationship is not statistically significant before or after a sanctuary policy is passed.” Some cities saw an increase in crime, but others saw decreases or no change ― overall, the research suggests no relationship between violent crime and sanctuary policies, Gonzalez-O’Brien said. It’s right there in the headline: “Sanctuary cities do not experience an increase in crime.” “[Fox News] chose the section of the Monkey Cage blog post that fit the narrative that they were trying to tell,” Gonzalez-O’Brien said. “That’s exactly what Jeff Sessions did in his speech. This was not what we found in our study. We found no relationship between violent crime and sanctuary policies.”Sessions has previously misrepresented the truth while criticizing sanctuary policies. He has repeatedly implied that it is illegal for jurisdictions to decline to hold individuals when Immigration and Customs Enforcement asks them to, which is the basis of many sanctuary policies. That’s not the case ― which the Justice Department has said and which Sessions himself acknowledged in May after a judge put a temporary halt on Trump’s anti-sanctuary city executive order. Gonzalez-O’Brien said he wants people to have the facts so they can decide where they stand on the issue of sanctuary cities. Their study was peer-reviewed, and their data is publicly available. He said the administration should do its own research into whether sanctuary city policies lead to more crime. “If the administration is so convinced that sanctuary cities breed crime we would encourage them to actually do some research and actually collect some data ― which they have access to ― and to actually show that this is in fact the case,” he said. “The fact that they haven’t done so is probably because they can’t.” "
40,POLITICS,Mexico's Promise To Protect Migrant Human Rights In US Marred By Contradictions,"Nidia Melissa Bautista, ContributorJournalist and NYU graduate student",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mexicos-promise-to-protect-migrant-human-rights-in_us_596792e5e4b0524d8fa7fb84,"Last month, Mexico co-convened the Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America with the U.S. Department of State",2017-07-13,"<p>Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and President <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"">Donald Trump</a> at 2017 G20 Hamburg Summit.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5967a8581a00001800dbe9de.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last month, Mexico co-convened the Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America with the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in Miami. The government officials discussed, among other issues, how to facilitate the Trump administration’s plan to stem the flow of Central American migration. Mexico’s prominent role in the conference, and its role as enforcer of military led-U.S. foreign policy in the region, demonstrates the country’s willingness to facilitate Trump’s policy of discrimination and violence against migrants in the region. This is the contradiction at the heart of the Mexican domestic and foreign policy around migrant human rights.Eighteen months after President Donald Trump first floated his campaign promise to build a massive wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Enrique Peña Nieto finally confronted him. In televised remarks delivered in January, Mexico’s president said his country wouldn’t pay for any such wall, despite Trump’s insistence. He later canceled a state visit over the issue. As an administration marred with corruption scandals and a human rights crisis, Peña Nieto seemed firm in his support of Mexican nationals living in the United States. “Our communities aren’t alone. The Mexican government will offer the legal counsel to guarantee the protection they need,” Peña Nieto said. “Where there is an at-risk Mexican immigrant in need of our help, we should be there, their country should be there for them.”For many Mexicans, the firm response from Peña Nieto was long overdue. Peña Nieto already suffered the lowest approval rating of any Mexican president in recent history and the public largely viewed his delayed response to Trump as more evidence of weak leadership. Peña Nieto appears to be taking more actions to protect Mexican migrants abroad, as the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration intensifies. Mexico’s Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray has pledged to seek United Nations intervention if necessary to defend the human rights and due process of Mexicans living in the U.S. The Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights Miguel Ruiz Cabañas also condemned what he described as U.S. racism and xenophobia in the U.S. in front of the UN Human Rights Council in March. But it remains to be seen whether those increasingly confrontational words will be matched by government policy. Ironically, while the Mexican government insists that “all Mexicans should be treated with absolute respect to their civil rights and human rights,” domestically the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party has failed to uphold a basic respect for rule of law and security. Not only have human rights abuses skyrocketed under Peña Nieto, but so has the criminalization of Central American migrants.Mexico’s treatment of Central American migrants and its inability to address human rights issues reveals deep contradictions underlying the promises made earlier this year. Leading up to the Miami conference, Trump commended Mexico’s role in the summit—which builds on the regional plan Alliance for Prosperity started in 2014—while Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has said it sees Mexico as a potential ally for stemming the migration flow. Vice President Mike Pence also called for an end to “illegal and dangerous migration” from Central America.While government representatives discussed the economic, security, and governance challenges in the region, the glaring omission of the conference was talk about human rights. Mexico has largely failed to protect Central American refugees and migrants in the last decade.Instead, under the Southern Border Program launched in 2014, Mexico has prioritized the detention and deportation of Central American migrants. Reports of extortions, mass deportations, kidnappings and other human rights abuses against migrants have spiked since then. According to an Amnesty International Report, 174,526 migrants had been apprehended and detained and 136,420 deported since November of last year. Approximately 97% were from Central America.It’s difficult to believe Mexico’s promises of protecting migrants against the Trump administration’s discrimination when we look at how Mexico protects human rights at home. Mexico has one of the worst rates impunity in the world, where 98 percent of crimes go unpunished, according to the Center for Impunity and Justice Studies. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein visited in 2015 and in his report revealed that 151,233 people have been killed over the last ten years, and at least 26,000 have gone missing since 2007.In January, when Trump signed the executive orders to increase the prosecution of undocumented immigrants and expand construction of the border wall, Mexican president Peña Nieto scrapped his plan to visit the White House. Leaders across the political spectrum called on the president to cancel visit, which he heeded. “I regret and condemn the United States’ decision to continue with the construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides us,” Peña Nieto said in a video.Laura Carlsen, a political analyst and director of the Center for International Policy’s Americas Program in Mexico City, remains skeptical whether Mexico’s opposition of Trump’s immigration policies will move beyond rhetoric and support migrants on the ground. “It’s not clear if there has been a big change, if you measure it by actions and not just mere declarations,” Carlsen said in an interview. “It’s very important for Peña Nieto, who has had the lowest popularity rating in modern history, to appear firm against Trump now.”In addition to examining the Peña Nieto administration’s sincerity in protecting migrants’ rights in the U.S., the question remains how exactly will Mexico monitor rampant human rights abuses. The foreign ministry has promised to offer mobile consular services, 24-hour telephone lines, and other consular services like passport transactions available to immigrants. But, if Trump’s immigration policies are to be taken seriously along with the threat they pose to thousands of immigrant families, then Mexico should be compelled to monitor the human rights abuses that often occur in immigration roundups and detention centers.Gerardo Cruz Sánchez was arrested in California for crossing the border in 2016 and immediately placed in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. He contracted pneumonia while in prison. As his illness worsened, his pleas for medical attention were continually rebuffed, according to the San Diego Tribune. Cruz Sánchez languished on his blood-soaked mattress for months. He eventually was taken to a local hospital where he later died. Inadequate health care, physical and sexual abuse, overcrowding and discrimination is prevalent in the country’s 200 detention centers, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. It is still unclear how Mexico will monitor these human rights abuses. Besides the creation of Immigrant Defense Centers in the 50 consulates and embassies, an initiative to provide consular assistance as well as legal representation to all Mexican migrants, the statements from Mexican officials released in the last few months have done little to clarify how Mexico will protect its nationals in these situations.In his opening remarks at the Miami conference, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. and Mexico share a commitment to enforce the rule of law at both of Mexico’s borders. Tillerson spoke about protecting U.S. security interests, fighting transnational crime networks and promoting legal migration. In his opening remarks, Vice President Mike Pence emphasized the administration’s commitment to thwarting undocumented immigration. “President Trump has already taken decisive action to protect the American people from the harshest consequences of illegal immigration and the transnational drug trade,” Pence said. “Thanks to President Donald Trump, illegal crossings at America’s southern border are down nearly 70 percent since the start of this year. And we are grateful for our partners in Mexico and across the Northern Triangle who have contributed to our progress in this area.”While Mexico’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Luis Videgaray emphasized sustainable development and investment in Central America’s Northern Triangle as a solution to drive down migration, U.S. representatives at the conference emphasized security and enforcement. Heightened immigration enforcement, and in effect the criminalization of thousands of migrants, unites Mexico and the U.S. in its approach to Central American migration.As the Trump administration plans to increase detention and deportations, Mexico needs to make clear how it plans to implement its promise to protect immigrant rights and needs to prepare concrete, on-the-ground plans to protect human rights of detained immigrants and come up with ways to hold the U.S. accountable for abuses. More fundamentally, it needs to address its role in perpetuating human rights abuses against migrants in its own territory."

Earhart took off on her final flight on July 2, 1937. Yamano said it took him just 30 minutes of searching a Japanese library website to find the photo.“I have never believed the theory that Earhart was captured by the Japanese military, so I decided to find out for myself,” Yamano told the Guardian. “I was sure that the same photo must be on record in Japan.”The History Channel presented the photo to viewers on Sunday, in the 2-hour documentary “Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence.” Retired U.S. Treasury agent Les Kinney was credited as finding the former “top secret” file at the National Archives.Kinney said he believed the photo was taken in 1937, the same year the legendary pilot and her navigator vanished during an attempted round-the-world flight.The History Channel website reported:“Kinney argues the photo must have been taken before 1943, as U.S. air forces conducted more than 30 bombing runs on Jaluit in 1943-44. He believes the plane on the barge is the Electra, and that two of the people on the dock are Earhart and Noonan.”As part of the program’s investigation, Kent Gibson, a forensic analyst, said it was “very likely” that the individuals in the photo are Earhart and Noonan.Kinney said the image “clearly indicates that Earhart was captured by the Japanese.”However, prior to the documentary airing, the US National Archives told Gizmodo they were unable to obtain any evidence supporting the photograph was taken specifically in 1937.“There is no confirmation on either a date or content in the photograph,” said James P. Pritchett, the director of public and media communications at the National Archives.Japan’s Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry and National Archives also spoke out, saying they have no records of Earhart or Noonan being in their custody, WTVJ News reported.Yamano told the Guardian he was surprised, “that the documentary makers didn’t confirm the date of the photograph or the publication in which it originally appeared. That’s the first thing they should have done.”The development comes roughly a week after the basic cable network tweeted a photo of George Washington along with the caption, “On This Day in History 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg ends.”Followers were quick to point out that Washington, who died in 1799, was not present when Gettysburg was fought.For its part, the History Channel says investigators are “exploring the latest developments about Amelia Earhart and we will be transparent in our findings.”“Ultimately, historical accuracy is most important to us and our viewers,” it said in a statement obtained by CBS News.Tips?

Saudi Arabia, which has some of the most repressive rules in the world for women, will gradually introduce phys ed classes for female students when schools are back in session later this summer, Education Minister Ahmed al-Issa announced on Tuesday, according to Arab news outlets. The Shura Council, Saudi Arabia’s advisory body to the monarchy, approved the change in 2014, but vocal critics with highly conservative interpretations of Islamic law insisted that female participation in sports was immodest and kept the classes from starting.Details about the program’s offerings weren’t released. It’s unclear whether the classes will be mandatory or an extracurricular activity.Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Ross said Tuesday it was “remarkable that [physical education for girls] was ever prohibited.” The international civil rights organization has long campaigned for Saudi officials to lift some of its strict policies, including bans on women driving and male guardianship laws, which require women get permission from men to travel abroad, marry or be released from prison.Moving ahead with physical education for girls is part of the Saudi Vision 2030, which aims to improve happiness among Saudi citizens, officials said. Goals of the plan include getting more women in the workforce, and encouraging people to exercise. The government hopes to increase the percentage of people who exercise at least once a week from 13 percent to 40 percent. Earlier this week, the Shura Council called on the private sector to build more gyms for women. Last summer, Saudi Arabia sent women to the Olympic Games for the second time ever."

Both groups say they could be targeted for attacks in Iraq because they are visible minorities.Those arrested by immigration authorities had outstanding deportation orders and many had been convicted of serious crimes, ranging from homicide to weapons and drug charges, according to the U.S. government.In his ruling, Goldsmith said sending the Iraqis back now would expose them to a “substantiated risk of death, torture, or other grave persecution before their legal claims can be tested in a court.”A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.Some of those arrested came to the United States as children and committed their crimes decades ago, but they had been allowed to stay because Iraq previously declined to issue them travel documents.That changed after Iraq agreed in March to start accepting U.S. deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from President Donald Trump’s revised temporary travel ban.[nL1N1J90JG](Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by James Dalgleish and Andrew Hay)"

Instead, a raft of new editing positions are being created as others are being eliminated. Baker is calling for both internal and external candidates to fill these roles. “We need to introduce new faces, new skills and a greater diversity to our news leadership,” Baker said in the memo. “We need to be genuinely inclusive ― and that starts with the leadership. We must have genuine equality of opportunity and a workforce that is properly rewarded and motivated.”The statement, in its rather reserved way, seems to be something of a response to the Journal newsroom’s increasingly loud calls for greater diversity. Reporters voiced their frustration in a series of emails to Baker and his deputy, Matt Murray, earlier this year, asking that something be done about issues including the lack of women in masthead-level roles, the gender imbalance in news bylines and the reported gender pay gap. (Full disclosure: This reporter was an editor at the Journal from 2006 to 2011.)Murray is set to be promoted to executive editor as part of the reorganization. The full memo to staff is available on the website of IAPE, the news guild that represents the Journal’s reporters and conducted pay audits.“We haven’t had any discussions with management over today’s note,” Tim Martell, the executive director of IAPE, said in an email to HuffPost. “But taking Mr. Baker’s words at face value, this does appear to be a first step along the path laid out by Will Lewis in his Monday memo.”The announcement comes just two days after William Lewis, the chief executive of the Journal’s parent company Dow Jones, pledged to focus on promoting more women throughout the company. He said the first goal was having 40 percent of senior roles filled by women. Neither Dow Jones nor the Journal would reveal what percentage of employees, or senior leaders, are currently women. A spokesman told HuffPost such information would be forthcoming.Baker said in the memo that he’d discuss the changes at upcoming meetings with staff.The changes Baker announced are part of the 128-year-old publication’s efforts to become more mobile-friendly, Baker wrote in his 2,300-word email. He said stories in the paper needed to be more “digestible.”Earlier this month, the paper shuttered eight of its blogs. Baker himself has been the focus of criticism over the past several months, as some people have argued the paper hasn’t been tough enough in its coverage of President Donald Trump.“While we produce the world’s best journalism, too often we write too many stories,” Baker wrote. “They are not conceived with a mobile audience in mind; they are often too long and prolix; they receive too many rewrites and edits.”"
45,POLITICS,U.S. Reaches Trump's Desired Refugee Cap As Revised Travel Ban Goes Into Effect,Willa Frej,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-travel-ban-refugee-cap_us_595cf6e4e4b05c37bb81318d,"About 50,000 refugees have been resettled. Not many more are likely to make it in.",2017-07-12,"Activists protest on the first day of the the partial reinstatement of the Trump travel ban at Los Angeles International Airport, June 29, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595d248b1500006303bfc2a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The United States shut its doors to refugees at the end of the day on Wednesday. Under President Donald Trump’s revised travel ban, refugee arrivals would be cut off once the resettlement ceiling of 50,000 for this fiscal year has been reached ― save for refugees who can prove a “bona fide relationship” with an acceptable party in the U.S., according to the State Department.These figures represent something of a win for Trump, who has repeatedly tried to slash the refugee resettlement quota from 110,000 to 50,000. But for refugees who had already completed the vetting process and scheduled travel to the United States, Wednesday’s cutoff will yet again throw them into devastating limbo, experts say. The Supreme Court announced last month that it would allow a limited version of Trump’s travel ban to go into effect until the court reviews the case in October. People from the six Muslim-majority countries targeted in the ban ― Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― can only enter the country if they have a proven “bona fide relationship” with either a family member or an approved entity in the U.S.Joseph Kabila, 32, is a Congolese refugee who fled to Malawi in 2011. After beginning the resettlement process in 2015, he was one of the last refugees to land on U.S. soil Wednesday afternoon before the 50,000 mark was reached. After a handful of delays, he said he knows how lucky he is to have made it.Since the travel ban hasn’t been implemented in full, the cap on the number of refugees who can be admitted into the United States wasn’t technically lowered to 50,000. But the criteria for entry became so narrow in the recent Supreme Court ruling that few refugees are expected to enter the U.S. after Wednesday.“After we reach 50,000 refugee arrivals for FY2017, only those individuals who have a credible claim to a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States will be eligible for admission through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program,” a State Department spokeswoman told HuffPost.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will continue to interview refugee applicants overseas who have a credible claim to a bona fide relationship, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said Tuesday. If approved, the vast majority would be expected to travel to the U.S. next fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, 2017.A refugee must have a family member already living in the U.S. to prove a familial relationship. (Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law don’t count.) Absent an approved family member, a refugee would need to prove they have some kind of relationship with an approved U.S. entity ― which could be nearly impossible, since senior administration officials have specified that the nine domestic refugee resettlement agencies don’t count.“Clearly, the administration wants to dismantle the refugee resettlement program,” said Jen Smyers, director of policy and advocacy in the immigration and refugee program at Church World Service, one of the resettlement agencies. “I just can’t see how the relationships that refugees have with agencies wouldn’t be recognized.”What happens after Wednesday is anyone’s guess.Many refugees already have trips to the U.S. booked through the end of the month, Smyers said, and now their plans could be upended. “Our local offices have already booked their apartments, are planning to meet them at airports, are enrolling their children in schools, are ready to help them learn English,” she said.Resettlement agencies have yet to receive any official guidance, Smyers added. So far, the State Department hasn’t canceled any of the refugee flights that are scheduled past Wednesday.This uncertainty places already vulnerable people in total limbo.“Some of these folks are coming from very remote refugee camps,” Smyers said. “They sell their belongings, they give up their shelter.” In other words, they’re hardly in a good position to have to learn at the last minute that they won’t be allowed into the U.S. after all.Even for refugees who may be able to prove ties to family or an entity in the U.S., there’s no guarantee that their arrival will happen in a timely manner.Fifty percent of refugees “have some kind of family tie with people in the United States,” a senior administration official said recently, but the government plans to “examine case by case to determine whether or not those family ties in each case are covered under the definitions that have been established.”This article has been updated with information about Citizenship and Immigration Services interviewing overseas applicants, and after the 50,000 threshold had been reached.

As seen in emails the president’s eldest son published to Twitter, the meeting was arranged by music publicist Rob Goldstone, who claimed the meeting was part of the Kremlin’s efforts to help his father get elected.Trump Jr. has defended the meeting as “political opposition research” and said “nothing” came out of it. He also told Hannity he did not share details of the conversation with his father.The latest revelations have reportedly caused turmoil in the White House, with Trump raging at the media and different factions within the administration blaming each other for the controversy. According to The Washington Post, Trump’s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner have been pushing the president to fire his chief of staff, Reince Priebus. Meanwhile, sources told The New York Times the president has been lashing out at his personal lawyer, Mark Kasowitz, over his handling of the case, while Kasowitz has blamed Kushner for the fallout."
47,POLITICS,White House Misspells 'Inaccurately' While Hitting CBO For Inaccuracy,Nick Wing and Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-cbo-typo_us_59666617e4b0a8d46d11706e,The White House needs a copyeditor -- and a better argument.,2017-07-12,"President Barack Obama signs the Affordable Care Act in the East Room of the White House on March 23, 2010.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59667f892100003400fc6994.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The White House attempted to discredit the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday, releasing a video that questions the accuracy of the agency’s previous projections on health insurance coverage under Obamacare.Issued as a heated health care debate continues on Capitol Hill, the administration seems to be arguing that because CBO estimates have been off before, there is no reason to trust its recent reports predicting that a Republican-led effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act would have devastating effects.But just 10 seconds into the video, the White House instead managed to strain its credibility with a misspelling of the word “inaccurately.”A short time later, the White House Twitter account deleted the video and re-posted a version with the spelling corrected.The mistake fits a well-documented trend of the administration’s communications team stepping on its own message with embarrassing typos and other blunders and miscues.But the White House doesn’t just need a copy editor. It needs a better argument, too.Republicans ― both in President Donald Trump’s administration and Congress ― have been challenging the CBO’s credibility ever since it first produced estimates showing that Obamacare repeal legislation would mean no insurance for 20 or even 30 million people, depending on the specific bill. CBO’s estimates of the Senate GOP bill, which the chamber’s leaders introduced last month, suggested the number of people without insurance would rise by 22 million.That number has helped to alienate the public ― and it has spooked Republican senators at a time when GOP leaders are a few votes short of the 50 they need to pass a bill. And so the White House, which wants that vote badly, has resumed its campaign against the CBO, using a variety of disingenuous arguments.On the most important number, the overall number of people with and without health insurance under Obamacare, CBO was not far off. When the ACA first became law, CBO predicted that, by 2016, the percent of non-elderly Americans without coverage would fall to 7.6 percent. That was before the Supreme Court made the law’s expansion of Medicaid optional ― a decision that nobody (not even the lawsuit’s supporters) expected.If you adjust for the effects of that decision, as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities did recently, the initial CBO projection for 2016 becomes 9.4 percent. The actual 2016 rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Health Insurance Study (NHIS), was 10.4 percent. The CBO and NHIS figures aren’t precisely the same, because everybody who studies the uninsured uses slightly different methods and baselines. But comparisons to other surveys yields basically the same result: CBO didn’t miss by much.The biggest error in CBO calculations was enrollment in ACA health care exchanges, which has fallen far below projections at 10.3 million. That’s the figure Republicans keep citing and that’s in the White House video, which it says left the CBO projection “off by over 14 million.” But at least part of that error occurred because the CBO expected more employers to drop job-based coverage, leading people to seek coverage under Obamacare. But that didn’t happen ― which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The fact that CBO guessed wrong on employer behavior doesn’t make its error on exchange enrollment any smaller. But it’s a reminder that error can run in both directions ― and that, frequently, mistakes in the underlying projections about how insurance will change can offset one another. (Case in point: The program as a whole also appears to be costing the federal government less than anticipated ― which, again, isn’t a bad thing.)None of this means CBO is perfect or that its predictions should be treated as gospel. Many conservatives think the CBO overestimates the impact of ending the individual mandate ― the requirement that people get insurance or pay a financial penalty to the government. They may be right. But CBO’s experts are smart, rigorous and scrupulous. (Don’t forget, the current director is a Republican appointee.) More important, its projections are as good as anybody’s ― and quite possibly better, as a 2015 Commonwealth Fund report showed.Pretend for a moment CBO predictions about the Republican Senate bill are way, way off, and the actual effect on the uninsured rate would end up being just half what the agency’s economists believe ― 11 million fewer people with health care coverage. That’s still a lot! And it doesn’t even account for all the people who would pay more for their medical care because, under the GOP proposal, insurance would tend to have less comprehensive coverage and in some cases leave out key services.The reality of the Senate bill is that, by design, it would drain a huge amount of money out of federal health programs. Some people would be better off. Young and healthy people might be happy with skimpier health plans, for the sake of the lower premiums that come with them. Very wealthy people would no longer pay the extra income taxes to finance Obamacare’s coverage expansion.But many others would pay the price, because their insurance would cover less or they would simply have no coverage at all ― and the numbers of these people would, by all accounts, be in the tens of millions.Beating up the CBO won’t change that. Even if the administration gets the spelling right the next time."

Climate change is expected to exacerbate these extreme weather patterns, the researchers noted, making crops even more vulnerable in the decades to come. Wheat supplies roughly 20 percent of all dietary calories worldwide.The study by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre analyzed harvest and climate data in wheat-producing countries between 1980 and 2010. It found that excess rain and cloud cover ― also prompted by climate change ― have an even bigger effect on the grain than drought. The wetter climate breeds pests and diseases that wipe out plants and shrink the annual harvest. “There are indications that the results and effects of global warming, and especially the recent acceleration of global warming, are already visible as a signal,” Matteo Zampieri, an Italian climatologist and irrigation expert working for the European Union, told HuffPost Tuesday. “They are emerging in a statistically significant way.”The findings were published last month in the journal Environmental Research Letters, and the researchers are now expanding the study to examine corn and rice. Climate has an even bigger effect on corn, accounting for as much as 50 percent of its yield variability, they found.Rice requires a more sophisticated analysis, Zampieri said. The grain is often grown in deliberately flooded paddies, making it less sensitive to weather fluctuations. But water scarcity ― yet another impact of global climate change ― would likely decrease rice production as well.As food production drops, prices will go up. Studies have already found that manmade global warming has driven up the cost of food by as much as 20 percent over the past few decades. Beef prices alone skyrocketed 34 percent from 2010 to 2014 amid historic droughts in cattle-ranching states like California and Texas.Another factor will be the world’s growing population. More people will mean more competition for water and other resources ― making it more important than ever for crop yields to reach their potential, Zampieri said."

According to local outlet The Missoulian, the bill changed the legal definition of sexual assault and rape in Montana. The bill “removes the requirement of force from the definition of ‘consent.’”Before Monday, survivors had to prove that they fought back or were threatened into submission during their assault in order to prosecute their attackers. That definition of rape completely left out cases where survivors were drugged or the attacker was in a position of authority that prevented the victim from speaking up. Montana’s original definition of assault also allowed the attacker to claim consent was given if the victim was married to or in a previous relationship with their attacker. Sen. Diane Sands told The Missoulian that many of the state’s sexual assault laws were completely outdated. “Most of these laws were passed in the 1970s when we had a very different idea of what sexual assault was. We have had many cases of a sexual assault that everyone agrees was a sexual assault [but] isn’t a sexual assault under the law,” she said. “We looked at really what it takes to convict someone of sexual assault. I’m very pleased we could actually pass these pieces of legislation, in most cases pretty much unanimously.” Along with expanding the definition of assault, Senate Bill 29 creates a more comprehensive conversation about sexual crimes because it takes into account the fight or flight experience so many survivors encounter. If a person doesn’t fight back during their attack, their assault can still be considered assault under the new statute. Head over the The Missoulian to read more about Senate Bill 29. "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596689f61800003500673fd0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump Jr.’s hopes of getting Russian government help for his father in last year’s election have popularized a word for critics of the White House: “treason.”And it is almost certainly wrong ― at least in the legal sense.“There is a lot of behavior that is really bad, and is a betrayal of the United States,” said Carlton Larson, a law professor at University of California, Davis, and an expert on the topic. “But it’s not technically treason.”The younger Trump on Tuesday published an email chain from June 2016 showing his interest in obtaining negative information about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, even though the business associate offering it said it came from the Russian government.“If it’s what you say I love it,” Trump Jr. wrote back within minutes of receiving the offer.While the colloquial meaning of treason is acting against the interest of one’s country, the legal definition ― spelled out in the United States Code ― is much narrower. The law states that an American citizen who “levies war” against the government or gives “aid and comfort” to the nation’s enemies is guilty of treason, punishable by at least five years in prison and possible execution. Russia, a potent geopolitical adversary with thousands of nuclear warheads, is not technically an enemy of the United States.“Russia does not qualify. We’re not at war with them. There are no active hostilities,” said Paul Crane, a University of Richmond law professor and former federal prosecutor. “That would be the first hurdle.”This is the message of many Republicans, from members of Congress who call the rhetoric overheated, to the president’s defenders in the conservative media, to the White House itself, where deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders earlier this week said: “I think those new words are ridiculous.”But supporters of President Donald Trump probably shouldn’t take the near impossibility of a treason charge as a sign the president and his team are in the clear. A variety of other statutes could come into play, Crane said.Among them are campaign finance laws that prohibit foreign involvement in federal elections, he said, as well as broader anti-corruption laws that prohibit offering a benefit in return for election assistance.These cases are not necessarily easy to prove, Crane said. “There is a line that can’t be crossed. It’s always unclear when you hit that line,” he said, adding that another danger area is if one party encouraged the other to commit a crime – stealing emails, for example. “Conspiracy is always on the table.”On July 27, 2016, Trump during a news conference invited Russia to hack into computer systems to find the emails Clinton had deleted from her private server: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.” Trump later said he was joking.On May 9, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading the agency’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election, and into whether Trump’s campaign had colluded with Russian officials. Trump had earlier asked Comey to drop a related probe into Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his contact with Russians, but Comey refused.Trump’s press office initially claimed the president was merely following the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his top deputy when he fired Comey. But Trump on May 11 told NBC News that he was going to fire Comey regardless of the Justice Department’s recommendation, and added that the Russia investigation played into his thinking. Trump also told Russia’s foreign minister and its U.S. ambassador during their May 10 Oval Office visit that Comey’s probe was putting “great pressure” on him, and that Comey was a “nut job,” according to a New York Times report that the White House has not refuted.In January, the Office of National Intelligence issued the consensus view of U.S. intelligence agencies that not only had Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election, but it had done so to hurt Clinton and help Trump.“We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency,” the report states. “We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.”Just days after Comey’s firing, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to handle the Russia probe. Mueller has hired a number of prosecutors for his team, but has not given any public updates on the status of his investigation or possible charges he may be considering.UC Davis’s Larson said Trump and his campaign staff are lucky that the United States has such a narrow definition for treason. A Russian citizen who colluded with the CIA to influence the Russian government, for example, would almost certainly have a tough time of it.“I think there’s a decent chance that Putin would call that person a traitor,” Larson said."

53,QUEER VOICES,How This Year's Pride Gave Me Hope,"Amelia, ContributorMother and breadwinner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-this-years-pride-gave-me-hope_us_59666cf8e4b0524d8fa7fa64,"As I watched my family at Pride, it started to flicker, the tiniest little ember of hope.",2017-07-12,<p>My sister-in-law and I in our matching shirts.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5966774e180000a285673f71.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was a few days after the election. I was still in shock, filled with anger and fear. I wanted to get out, to run away, to change reality, so I wouldn’t need to be so scared for so many people I loved. I was in the car with all three of my sons, headed on some mindless errand, when my oldest, now a strapping 12 years old, pointed up at the direction indicator on my car.“We’re going north,” he announced. “Canada is north.”“Yep. Should we just keep driving?” I asked, only partially kidding.He looked at me seriously for a moment, then shook his head.“No,” he said firmly. “Then who would fight here?”And there is nothing like being put in your place by a middle schooler.My children were very affected by the election results. This was personal to them. My 10 year old started confronting every adult he encountered and asking “Who did you vote for?” If they did not immediately respond “Hillary Clinton,” he then asked them why they hated his brother and his friends who are gay, and his uncle and cousins who are black, and his teachers who are immigrants? Why did they hate everyone he loved?The election was real to them ― just as real as it was to me. In truth, they have handled it a lot better than I have. They have been able to move on, and shake the dark cloud of those electoral college results. I haven’t.I’ve had a hard time writing since the election. For nearly six years people have told me how the story of my son, who came out as gay at 7 years old, and of our family has given them hope. But after last November, I no longer felt like I had any hope to give. Any words of comfort and light that I tried to write felt false, like a pitiful attempt to deny reality. Things were not ok. And I couldn’t pretend they were.I got fed up with myself pretty quickly. Why couldn’t I find something to grasp onto? Just a little something to tell that this would not last forever, that things could and would get better.And I finally found it. At the Pride parade.Pride has always been an important family event for us, and we go every year, but this year it was even more so, because my brother and his family were joining us.Earlier this year my brother and his wife had opened their bedroom closet to find my oldest niece wearing a rainbow squid hat and holding a sign that said “Lesbi honest, I like girls.” Later in the year, her younger sister, with far less fanfare, came out as pansexual. For the older’s high school graduation several months later, I gifted her with a t-shirt that said “Liberals for Gay Space Socialism.”My brother, upon seeing and coveting the shirt, announced he need one in each of the Pride colors. He turned to me and said, “Coming out is different in our family.” Yes, indeed it is.But back to Pride... My nieces marched with the LGBTQ band at the very start of the parade, and joined us after they had completed. I sat back in the shade (I wilt in heat and can get a sunburn inside a house if I sit too near a closed window) and watched my family ― chosen and biological alike.My oldest son, too cool to collect beads these days, but waving to all the crowd and calling out the names of the people he recognizes.My middle son, playing the part of king of all beads this year, and he added arm bands as well.My youngest son, as kinetic as always, waving his rainbow flag where ever he goes.My younger niece, in a rainbow propellor beanie, diving for the tshirts thrown into the crowd.My older niece, her face so beautiful and bright as she watches the parade.My brother, so happy to be there to support his girls.My sister-in-law, proudly sporting a “Mama Bear” shirt with a black cartoon bear standing protectively over her rainbow colored cub.My husband, tall enough to catch the beads flying over everyone else’s heads, and telling the kids to drink water.My friends, our chosen family, helping the kids collect beads, trinkets, and candy, and periodically reminding them to run back to me to get another layer of sunblock.As I watched them, it started to flicker, the tiniest little ember of hope. This was my family. They were all so happy and filled with joy to be at Pride, to be together. Twenty, even ten years ago, this wouldn’t have been a reality. Yet here I was, looking at the people I love most in the world, and watching them celebrate the incredible people they are. Suddenly, my eyes were filled with tears, and that ember sparked into a flame, because here was hope, here was the future.And then came the gratitude, because I was so lucky that the future was now, right in front of me. I was grateful for each and every person who came out to the parade that day for creating such a wonderful setting. So many people that the streets were overwhelmed. Here in the midwest, in a red state, we had not stopped fighting. We had not hidden ourselves away. We were out, we were proud, and we were not going anywhere.After the parade was over, and all our stuff had been packed up, we lined the kiddos all along the now empty route for a picture. Gay, lesbian, pansexual, and currently unidentified, they stood together, making faces at their parents. All family―in more ways than one. And each one an entire universe of reasons to hope."

During the talk, Elgort opened up about how he was pitched by director Edgar Wright to be in the film as well as what it was like playing the lead character Baby in relation to the other supporting characters in the movie.When asked about Elgort’s initial pitch to be in “Baby Driver”, the young star told the audience:“The first thing I got from this movie was Edgar. We had a meeting and we really got along and we talked about music the whole time. We didn’t talk about movies at all. We talked music and I didn’t know why but it was cool to talk about music with him. Then he said ‘I have a script that I think you’re going to like because it has a lot to do with music and the main character, you might be right for it. So you know, you should read it.’ I read it and it was on this iPad. They made this special app for it. I’ve never read a script like this and it had little logos at the top of every page and if you clicked the logo you heard the song that went with the scene. The movie is moving to music at all times. The music that I heard when I read the script is the music that’s still in the movie now.”Elgort raved about working with Wright for his original story line and original characters, calling him a “genius” with his precise focus to details throughout the flick.“Everything is deliberate and that’s why I’ve seen the film FIVE times now and I’m still picking up on things. I was IN the film! I was there every day filming and I’m STILL picking up on stuff! There’s so many details. It’s incredible.”Elgort’s character Baby has refreshing traits that will get viewers discussing. He went on to describe his intricate, multi-dimensional character as such:“So Baby when you first meet him with the heist group; the criminals, he’s serious and quiet. But in the very beginning of the movie, the second they go into the bank, he starts singing along and dancing along to the Blues Explosion. And then they come back and he’s serious again. So yes he is a shy character but just around certain people. I think internally he’s a kid who wants to enjoy himself and listen to music. It’s just sort of that his life is a little bit serious sometimes when he has to be a part of a bank robbery. There’s always different sides to characters and with Edgar we spent a lot of time in preparing Baby and finding his different sides. You see him with Joe, his foster dad and you see him be parental. You see him alone in the car. You see him be kind of silly and dancing along to music. You see him with the criminals being shy and you see him towards the end of the movie where he has to stand up and be a man and protect this girl that he has fallen in love with. So you see a lot of different sides to him.”You can see how the action packed storyline unfolds by catching Ansel Elgort as Baby in “Baby Driver” in theaters now."

Lyles called the police to her home, where she resided with her children. Suffering from mental health issues, the 30-year-old black mother was armed with two knives. Officers killed her in front of her children. It is time for police to learn to respect the lives of black people and the mentally ill.Fifteen years ago, in June 2002, Sophia King was killed by a police officer in Austin, Texas. King was well-known in the Rosewood Courts housing project, where she lived. She was a black woman with a history of schizophrenia; the systems that should have supported her, failed her. On that fateful summer night, King had raised her knife during a disagreement with the housing project manager. That’s when an Austin police officer shot the 23-year-old mother of two. Her shooting caused public officials to review police use of force and the community's response to the mentally ill. It brought community leaders together to discuss ways to improve Austin’s awareness of mental illness, resulting in the formation of the Mayor’s Mental Health Task Force Monitoring Committee.In November 2014, 37-year-old Tanisha Anderson, a mentally ill woman with a heart condition, died shortly after two Cleveland police officers physically restrained her in a prone position outside her home. After agreeing to allow officers to escort her to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, she “began actively resisting the officers. A short time later, the woman stopped struggling and appeared to go limp,” they said. Anderson was taken to the hospital by ambulance and pronounced dead an hour later.On August 1, 2016, Korryn Gaines recorded video of her standoff with Baltimore County police officers and posted it on social media ― just before she was gunned down after firing at the officers. Police had arrived at her apartment with two warrants for her and her boyfriend. After obtaining a key from the apartment manager, police entered and found Gaines cradling her son in one arm and holding a shotgun in the other. She warned police to leave, then opened fire. She was killed and her son was wounded.On October 18, 2016, New York police sergeant Hugh Barry shot and killed 66-year-old Deborah Danner, while responding to a call about an “emotionally disturbed person.” Barry persuaded Danner to drop the scissors she brandished, but then she allegedly picked up a bat and attacked Barry with it. He shot her twice in her chest. Although Barry had a stun gun, he chose not to use it. This incident raised questions about the use of force by NYPD when interacting with “emotionally disturbed” people. At a news conference, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio said the sergeant had not followed protocol for dealing with those with mental illness. The officer neither used his Taser nor waited for emergency personnel trained to deal with such situations. On May 31, Barry was charged with murder in the death of Danner.It is time for these senseless killings to stop! I write poetry to archive different moments in my life. I wrote, Sophia Tears because I wanted people to remember these women who died at the hands of police. From Sophia King to Charleena Lyles, the intersections of race, gender, mental illness, and police violence are yielding the erasure and oppression of more and more black women. We must say their names, and demand a change.Ironically, in 2012, Danner had written an article about her illness titled “Living With Schizophrenia,” opening with these statements: ""Any chronic illness is a curse. Schizophrenia is no different -- it's only 'saving grace' -- if you will, is that as far as I know it's not a fatal disease.""That is, unless you are a mentally ill black woman who has the misfortune of an encounter with the police.Dr. Candice Bledsoe is a SMU faculty member at the Simmons School of Education and executive director of the Action Research Center in Dallas, Texas.

Salt, no pepper. It is a filling worth trying as pea season comes to an end. (It would be very good with fava/broad beans too, but that would be quite a bit more work because of the indispensable extra step of peeling the blanched beans.)The question arose of how to dress these ravioli (which I won’t describe in detail, because their ingredients tell the whole story: for the filling combine ricotta, peas, mint and salt). The first thought was a standard one: Butter and mint, maybe with some parmesan at the table. But there was a lot of mint in the filling, and more would have been too much. It is no secret that one of the first pea dishes Jackie and I eat each summer is peas à la française, one of whose defining ingredients is little springtime onions. So, for us, peas find a good friend in any member of the onion family. Leeks, for instance: new-season leeks had just begun to appear at the market, and I had some in the house.And echoing the peas in the ravioli with peas in their dressing seemed to be a fine idea: there would be a textural contrast with the crushed peas in the pasta filling; they would taste good; and they would look gorgeous with the pale green-white of the leeks and the yellow of the pasta.Early in the day I shelled enough peas (the smaller and younger the better) to yield a generous half cup (around 120 ml by volume). If these had been older and bigger, I’d have blanched them for a minute or two in boiling water, then chilled them in cold water and set them aside. A half hour before guests arrived, I cut the white part (just extending into the light green) of five thin, well-washed leeks into 1/4 to 3/8-inch (6 to 10-mm) rounds; these were short, and the white part measured only 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) in length, so adjust quantities accordingly. Cut thicker ones on the smaller side for the sake of even cooking. In a pan large enough to eventually hold the 28 ravioli (they were small, and seven to a portion was a nice first course), I melted about a tablespoon and a half (20 g) butter and added the leeks still damp from rinsing, along with salt. Over low heat and with the pan partially covered, I cooked them until they were just tender, adding dribbles of water as needed, then set them aside. When the ravioli went into their boiling water, I reheated the leeks and added the peas, which were tender in about 90 seconds, then turned off the heat and waited for the ravioli. When they were done, I relit the fire under the leek-pea mixture and drained and added the ravioli. I splashed in a little of the pasta-cooking water to generate a glossy butter finish, adjusted the salt, and that was that. No cheese was needed.It was a perfect companion to the pea-based ravioli, but you could serve it with any small-format egg pasta, such as farfalle – or indeed with spaetzle. Very delicate, very elegant, very summery. And delicious."

And if I was left untouched by their frightening descriptions, didn’t I just want to feel, you know, “refreshed” and “clean”?How can you say no to that?A woman’s role is to remain clean, pure, fresh, hygienic (and of course young)—pick your adjective. Even religions stress the importance of a woman’s clean skin, imposing special rules for women who are menstruating and thus unclean to attend service, let alone have their prayers heard.And if you’re not the religious type, don’t worry, the cosmetics industry is here to remind you every single day that a woman is expected to remain clean, or better, spotless, that she can beat time if she wants, and that there is a formula and a solution for absolutely every type of woman to choose from: cosmetics without glycerine or parabens, 100% organic, with airless or biodegradable packaging, you name it and they will deliver, or rather the industry is already one step ahead of you to let you know that your needs are their sole concern. They are working for you, actually, inventing skin problems you didn’t even know you had, and having the solution ready for you to buy. A faithful industry with a 62.46 billion US dollar revenue between the years of 2002 and 2016 in the USA only.Which makes me think that by buying that sulphate-free face balm I am probably giving another teenager the opportunity of a cosmetics career.And at the same time I’m turning my back on scandals revealing that cleaning products could actually contain toxic chemicals that do more harm than good, or that certain personal care products contain microbeads, or “plastic bullets”, that end up in our oceans and get ingested by fish with unknown yet impact on the food chain.Or ignoring the fact that the cosmetics industry actually profits by exploiting under-aged workers in cocoa farms, palm plantations and mica mines in countries that haven’t even solved the problem of clean water, to help you keep your skin clean.So why this obsession with cleanliness? And what do we really think about it?* * * *“Be careful, don’t get dirty,” I often catch myself calling to my children. At their age, I wouldn’t return home before nightfall and I had bloody knees and all the filth of the neighbourhood street on my skin.Times change though. Today if I let my children play outdoors unaccompanied, I’d probably get sued. And along with the shift in habits is a shift in the way we view our contact with nature—and with dirt and filth—as something that has to be avoided at all costs.The problem is that filth has acquired such a negative connotation that as parents we prefer to buy our children screens (mobiles, tablets, etc.) to keep them still, quiet and of course clean, rather than make them change their clothes three times a day, or heaven forbid, have clothes on with stains on them!But why? My children also ask me that. “Why? We do have a washing machine, don’t we?”The answer lies in our tendency to pay more attention to the facade than to the core of things. Our body image, our appearance, counts more than our inner attributes. It’s the way others see us, and not how we really are that counts.We don’t tolerate people with filthy mouths, but we don’t mind them having filthy minds (as long as they keep their thoughts to themselves). Because cleanliness has come to be closely associated with order and therefore clean children mirror their mother’s ability to parent them. We live in a world of perceptions, as fashion designer Bill Blass so eloquently put it.So when my children ask me why they shouldn’t get dirty, the honest answer would be, “Because it makes me look bad, and people will seize the chance to point a finger at me”. But I can’t say that. I can’t even admit it.Instead, I mumble lame excuses about fabrics that don’t clean easily, not wasting water, the lack of time to iron, to which my children’s response is usually, “Don’t iron, then. I’ll put my shirt under my mattress, like in the army.”Don’t tempt me.Previously published as ‘On Being Clean’ in Irena’s GAZE column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:The Stain That Trump Has Left on America by Maria BehanHow I Found Joy in Domestic Order by Annie Mark-WestfallWhy the Morality in Wonder Woman Matters by Reverend Rachel KesslerLet’s Stop Shaming and Start Supporting Moms by Jami IngledueMy S&M Marriage by James Prenatt"

The border is already well-defended, undocumented migration from Mexico has dropped dramatically since 2008, and undocumented immigrants don’t take jobs away from Americans. That said, building a wall is actually a good idea. Several walls, in fact. But not to keep out undocumented immigrants. To keep out the sea. Flooded Coastal Communities Earlier this year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a report on how rising sea levels brought on by climate change could affect U.S. coastal communities, home to 40 percent of our population. In a worst-case scenario, the agency estimates that seas along the coasts in some places could rise nearly 2.5 meters — about 8 feet — by the year 2100. That’s 2 feet higher than what NOAA estimated just five years ago. The year 2100, however, is a long way off, and sea level rise is a serious problem right now. More than 90 U.S. coastal communities are already experiencing chronic flooding, according to a new study by researchers at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) published today in the journal Elementa. These high tide floods, which are often only a foot or two deep, can cover coastal roads for hours, trap residents in their homes, disrupt businesses, and cause structural damage. The incidence of chronic flooding — which UCS defines as occurring at least 26 times a year and affecting 10 percent or more of a municipality’s usable land — will increase as time goes on due to climate change. The only question is how much. UCS researchers project that the number of chronically inundated cities and towns will double by 2035. By mid-century, the number of localities likely will jump to somewhere between 270 and 360, depending on whether carbon emissions continue to rise or decline. A 2014 UCS sea level rise study, meanwhile, estimated that the number of high-tide floods in two-thirds of 52 cities along the Eastern and Gulf coasts, including Boston, Miami, Philadelphia and Savannah, could triple by 2030. Several New Jersey shore towns could see at least 80 tidal floods a year, while Annapolis, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., could average more than 150 tidal floods annually. Throw in some hurricanes and other storms, and this increased flooding along the two coasts will likely devastate local economies. Let’s translate that into language our real-estate-developer-in-chief would understand. If we continue to burn fossil fuels at present rates, “by 2050 between $66 billion and $106 billion worth of existing coastal property will likely be below sea level nationwide, with $238 billion to $507 billion worth of property below sea level by 2100,” according to a 2014 report commissioned by the Risky Business Project headed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer.That bill will come due well before 2050, however. “Within the next 15 years,” the Risky Business report projected, “higher sea levels combined with storm surge will likely increase the average annual cost of coastal storms along the Eastern Seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico by $2 billion to $3.5 billion. Adding in the potential changes in hurricane activity, the likely increase in average annual losses grows to up to $7.3 billion, bringing the total annual price tag for hurricanes and other coastal storms to $35 billion.” So, if President Trump is keen on building a wall, his administration should provide federal support to coastal states, counties and cities that are already grappling with rising ocean levels. They will need not only walls, but also bulkheads, jetties and other hardened structures, as well as vegetated dunes, salt marshes and other natural “soft” shoreline defenses to hold back the sea. And all of that infrastructure may still not be enough. A good number of coastal residents will have to abandon their homes and businesses and move inland to higher ground. Trump Properties at Risk Several coastal cities are now considering sea walls and other barriers. City officials in Boston, for example, are exploring the possibility of building a 4-mile-long sea wall in an arc around Boston Harbor that would stand at least 20 feet above the water at low tide. They also are investigating other ways to protect city residents and $80 billion worth of real estate, including constructing berms around neighborhoods, redirecting flood waters into canals, and flood-proofing buildings. Meanwhile, more than 60 elected officials and business leaders in Texas sent a letter to President Trump in April requesting $15 billion in federal funds for a coastal barrier system to defend the Houston and Galveston bay areas from hurricane storm surges. The signatories, who include 20 mayors and eight state legislators, stressed the area’s economic importance — and its vulnerability. In 2008, Hurricane Ike caused more than $29 billion in damages on the state’s upper coast. If Ike had hit the port of Houston, the letter pointed out, it would have resulted in more than $100 billion in damages. Given there are no Trump hotels or golf courses in Texas or Massachusetts, President Trump may not care much about Houston or Boston. But he — or at least someone in his far-flung empire — apparently does worry about the threat rising seas pose to Trump properties. His Irish firm, for instance, has been trying to get a permit to build a nearly 2-mile long, 13-foot-high wall to protect a Trump luxury golf resort in the village of Doonbeg from rising sea levels and increasingly severe storms. As it turns out, there are a number of Trump properties here in the United States that also are in harm’s way. New York City: Let’s start with Trump’s hometown, New York, where his family owns 13 buildings in Manhattan. Five years ago, Hurricane Sandy, which cost the region $60 billion, prompted local officials to look into ways to defend the city from floods and storm surge. As writer Jeff Goodell pointed out in a July 2016 feature in Rolling Stone, “Can New York Be Saved in the Era of Global Warming?” a lot is at stake. Home to 8.5 million people, the city generates nearly 10 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. Then there’s its vast network of subways, tunnels and other underground infrastructure, and — of course — row upon row of skyscrapers. By Goodell’s count, “71,500 buildings worth more than $100 billion stand in high-risk flood zones today, with thousands more buildings at risk with each foot of sea level rise.” The eight Trump buildings clustered around Central Park’s south end and the Upper East Side are relatively safe, but two of his properties — the 46-story Trump Soho Hotel Condominium and the 70-story Trump Building on Wall Street — are on the island’s southern tip, one of the most vulnerable areas in the city. New York is currently planning to construct a massive barrier system, dubbed “the Big U,” that may eventually loop around the bottom of Manhattan, from 42nd Street on the East Side to 57th Street on the West Side. The barrier, more of a berm than a wall, will be covered by grass and trees, as well as benches and bike paths, and is expected to cost more than $3 billion. Will the Trump administration include it in its infrastructure plans — and will those plans ever get off the ground? Florida: South Florida also is worthy of the president’s attention. After all, it’s home to his “Winter White House,” the $200-million, 123-room Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, as well as the Trump Towers and Trump Grande complex in Sunny Isles Beach, and Trump Hollywood in Hollywood, all which sit on narrow barrier islands between Florida’s Intercoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean. There are also three Trump golf courses in the state, in Jupiter, Miami, and West Palm Beach. All of the properties, except the Jupiter golf course, are at risk. Mar-a-Lago’s 20 acres stretch the width of a barrier island off the coast of Palm Beach, an area already plagued by chronic tidal flooding. A 3-foot sea level rise — expected by 2060 or 2080 depending on how fast the ocean rises — would inundate the resort’s western lawn and nearby roads that lead to the property. Likewise, a 3-foot sea level rise would flood much of the west side of the barrier island where the Trump Towers and Trump Grande complex are located, just east of North Miami Beach. Both properties would be spared in that scenario, but add another foot and major sections of the main road running south to Miami Beach would be permanently under water.Before that happens, though, chronic flooding along the coast is expected to worsen significantly. Based on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates and tide gauge data, a 2016 UCS report projected that tidal floods in Coral Gables, Miami, Miami Beach and other South Florida municipalities will jump from today’s six times per year to as many as 80 times per year by 2030 and more than 380 times per year by 2045 — more than one a day. But given that saltwater is already tainting regional drinking water supplies and tidal flooding is commonplace even when the sun is shining, government agencies are now beginning to respond to the threat. Three years ago, Miami Beach initiated a $500-million pump project to keep water off the streets. Last year, Fort Lauderdale raised the required height for sea walls, but only for rehab projects and new construction. Delray Beach has installed valves in some sea walls that prevent saltwater from spilling into the city’s drainage system. And later this year, Miami will kick off a $100-million flood prevention program to raise roads, install pumps and water mains, and redo sewer connections in two neighborhoods, part of a citywide effort that is expected to cost as much as $500 million. But much more needs to be done to protect the 3.5 million state residents at risk of coastal flooding, and that will take millions, if not billions, of dollars. Hawaii: Finally, the Trump family owns a hotel on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu. Like South Florida, tidal flooding is already wreaking havoc in the city, and rising sea levels will make things much worse. According to a March University of Hawaii study, if the sea level increases 3 feet, flooding that occurs when groundwater seeps above ground level would inundate much of Honolulu. “The flooding will threaten $5 billion of taxable real estate; flood nearly 30 miles of roadway; and impact pedestrians, commercial and recreation activities, tourism, transportation and infrastructure,” said Shellie Habel, lead author of the study. “The flooding will occur regardless of seawall construction, and thus will require innovative planning and intensive engineering efforts to accommodate standing water in the streets.” An Ounce of Prevention Boston, Honolulu, Houston, Miami and New York are just a small sample of the cities and towns that will need federal assistance to protect their residents and real estate from rising seas. The cost of adaptation, including sea barriers, pump stations, and better road and bridge design, will not come cheap, but compared to the cost of everyday flooding, let alone hurricanes and storm surges, it’s a bargain. Beyond adaptation, however, there’s an obvious, common-sense solution: prevention. How can the world avoid a 3-foot sea level rise by 2060, let alone an 8-foot rise by 2100? By dramatically reducing carbon emissions. A certain amount of sea level rise is already locked in, but slashing emissions would slow the rising sea rate and reduce the frequency and intensity of the resulting floods. Would it save Mar-a-Lago and other Trump coastal properties? Yes, it most certainly would. Will that stark reality stop Trump from trying to sabotage worldwide efforts to curb carbon emissions? One could only hope so.Elliott Negin is a senior writer at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). Research assistance was provided by climate scientist Kristina Dahl, a UCS consultant.

But the former mayor of New York and the current governor of California also saw an opportunity. Maybe Trump had created a watershed moment for climate action? He has certainly motivated a loud response.State, city and business leaders are now more eager than ever to win a clean energy future. Over 2,000 American cities, states and businesses have announced they will pick up the slack to ensure the U.S. drives down its emissions. They know that if they don’t keep up, they risk being left behind, whether or not the federal government plays a role. After all, they are already the largest contributors to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Federal leadership has a crucial and irreplaceable role in setting the national agenda, but local action has the potential to offset federal inaction — and do more than that. They can demonstrate that investing in a clean energy future makes economic sense.Savvy state, city and businesses leaders already realize the green revolution has started. U.S. carbon emissions are falling. Coal is being out-competed by better, cheaper alternatives. Renewables are increasingly affordable, with prices now about a third of what they used to be, and they’re generating more electricity than ever. And efficiency technologies are saving ratepayers money while creating good-paying jobs and strengthening businesses.These are among the reasons why the former mayor of the most populous and economically powerful U.S. city has teamed up with the governor of the most populous and economically powerful U.S. state. Michael Bloomberg and Governor Jerry Brown are helping to spearhead America’s Pledge and “We Are Still In” ― to help states, cities and businesses uphold America’s climate pledge and win a clean energy future.Here are some of the ways cities, states and businesses are embracing this challenge:Cities: The power and incentive to leadHome to about 60 percent of Americans and the majority of the country’s GDP, U.S. cities have a record of showing the federal government what needs to be done, including teaming up to combat climate change and showing that measures like energy efficiency standards and low-carbon transit make economic sense because they more than pay for themselves.Many cities have already started the effort to uphold America’s climate pledge. At least 350 American mayors have already committed to adopt, honor and uphold the Paris Agreement goals, despite federal opposition, and 140 cities actively manage climate risks and measure their impact as part of the Compact of Mayors. 133 of American cities have joined the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy dedicated to reducing emissions and strengthening climate resilience.Cities are eager to take to climate action not only because it makes economic sense but also because of the costly impacts. Their future resilience and survival may in many cases depend on it, as many are perched dangerously on the frontline of fast rising sea levels, increasing and more severe inundations, extreme droughts, hurricanes and heat waves disrupting their citizens and economy.States: Creating jobs and growing the economyState governments understand that clean energy and energy efficiency create local, good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced because they’re in industries like electrical work and installation. For example, Texas, one of the most fossil-fuel-friendly states, currently has the most wind energy jobs of any state in the country and that growth is not slowing down.States and the utility companies they often regulate can save money by reducing energy waste. Energy efficiency measures are the least expensive way for states to meet their energy needs, commonly returning more than $2 or $3 in energy supply spending for every $1 invested.States have also stepped up to lead. Twelve states and Puerto Rico formed the bipartisan U.S. Climate Alliance, representing about one-third of the U.S. population and GDP. At least 17 governors released individual statements standing by Paris.Businesses: Doubling Down on Climate CommitmentsFollowing Trump’s retreat on the Paris agreement, more than 1,000 businesses signed on to the “We Are Still In” statement in support of the Paris Agreement. And the businesses working to do this aren’t just the small ones, and they aren’t just giving it lip service.Some of America’s biggest brands – including Coca Cola, General Mills, Hewlett Packard, Kellogg Company, Pepsi, Phillip Morris, Proctor & Gamble, Pfizer, Wal-Mart Stores and Xerox are among 43 U.S. companies, as part of the Science Based Targets initiative, that have already created (or in the process of creating) targets for reducing emissions in-line with what the science says is needed to address climate change.They’re doing this not only because it’s the right thing to do but also because they know it makes business sense. From mitigating the risk of massive droughts and floods disrupting their corporate assets, customers and the economy ― to saving on more efficient energy use and cheaper forms of reliable clean energy, companies know very well that acting on climate is a smart business decision. Initiatives like the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA) are helping to drive that action by simplifying renewable energy purchasing for businesses and utilities.If American businesses are to stay competitive and innovative, they will take to the market of the future; a clean, reliable and efficient one.The United States can still win a clean energy future. But the clock is ticking. How long will it take? Will it be fast enough? And will the We Are Still In coalition, galvanized by the leadership of Bloomberg and Brown, be enough to offset federal inaction? WRI looks forward to working with these leaders, along with the Rocky Mountain Institute and others to understand how much ground states, cities, and businesses can make up. One things we know: subnational leaders understand the stakes. They are taking action. And there is no time to lose.Sam Adams is Director of WRI United States, World Resources Institute, and former Mayor of Portland, Oregon. "

Yohe, ContributorHuffington Foundation Professor of Economics and Environmental...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/making-infrastructure-great-again-means-acknowledging-climate-change_us_59662e7ae4b09b587d63dd61,"Not factoring climate into infrastructure improvements is a waste of taxpayer dollars, plain and simple.",2017-07-12,"A car passes a section of Route 112 that was washed out during Hurricane Irene in Halifax, Vermont August 29, 2011.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59662f612100003400fc681a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remember “Infrastructure Week” last month? No?That’s not surprising. Given that it was clearly the Trump administration’s attempt to distract from the various scandals plaguing Washington, few paid it much mind.But let’s imagine what could have happened if the administration had engaged thoughtfully and meaningfully on infrastructure this month. Of all of the things that Trump campaigned on, the dismal state of American infrastructure was one of the few issues that is both true and bipartisan.To “make infrastructure great again,” any and all legislation should absolutely consider climate change when planning for the future of America’s roads, bridges, electric grid and other important systems. To deny its impact on infrastructure is to force states to pay to build and rebuild after climate-fueled natural disasters that will become more frequent and more intense. Not factoring climate into infrastructure improvements is a waste of taxpayer dollars, plain and simple.The Trump administration, to varying degrees, has claimed time and time again that it’s impossible to know the impact of human activity on our climate. Unfortunately for the administration, the science is not on its side. Rigorous science tells us that increases in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, like heavy rains and flash flooding, droughts and wildfires, prolonged and exaggerated heat waves, rising seas and associated coastal flooding, bear the fingerprints of global climate change. What’s more, the scientific community is in undeniable consensus: human activity is changing the climate and enhancing these impacts.Just ask citizens of Vermont their opinion about failing to take account of increasingly extreme weather events when planning new road construction after a natural disaster. NOAA data show that, across the nation, increased rainfall linked to climate change has been producing more and larger floods that cause enormous economic damage and risk American lives for years. A downgraded Hurricane Irene, for example, dumped up to 11 inches of rain across most of Vermont in August of 2011. More than 300 bridges, 800 homes and businesses, and 6 railroad lines were damaged or destroyed; and at least 3 people died.Vermont balked mightily when FEMA rejected their plan to upgrade certain bridges for cause in comparison to uniform pre-disaster designs that then existing federal codes required. They appealed the necessity of uniform standards on length, height, and location and, fortunately for taxpayers, they won exceptions on November 9, 2016 for bridges built in constricted urban spaces and high-volume locations dominated by high sediment transport. Note the 5-year discrepancy in time. Vermonters understood in 2011 that they were living in a non-stationary climate. For their own good, they risked forfeiting federal reimbursement by deciding to move forward without prior and guaranteed FEMA approval. They have successfully endured a number of very large storms since, but they are more secure for eschewing the notion that one failed bridge design should fit all.  Similarly, we must take climate in account when looking at our health care system. It would be foolish to build new medical facilities without recognizing that severe heat waves will occur more frequently, that new diseases will emerge in nearly every location, and that climate change will dramatically alter the profiles of the major medical challenges that will face hospitals and medical staffs across the country. Missing those futures in the planning stage would guarantee that the new facilities will be woefully underprepared. Along our coasts, building new port facilities without taking account of sea level rise would similarly guarantee that they will be flooded and damaged with increasing frequency. It should be noted that the Department of Defense will not make this mistake even during the tenure of President Trump. Secretary Mattis has already reasserted the long-standing DOD understanding that climate change is a “risk enhancer”, not only for strategic planning, but also for plans to refurbish military installations around the country and the world. They will not stop short of arming, for example, the Newport News Shipyard against current and future coastal flooding. These few examples should make it clear that the Trump administration’s dismissal of the growing threat of climate places most of the $1 trillion infrastructure investment package unnecessarily at risk. Well over half of all Americans―and a majority of people in all 50 states―think that the climate is changing and that it will continue to change. What if these constituents were to speak up in upcoming statewide elections? Americans understand that human actions are a primary cause of climate change, and that something has to be done. Reaching members of Congress to demand prioritizing climate in infrastructure improvements would be a heavy lift in this political environment, but that is how American democracy is supposed to work. Washington is supposed to acknowledge and support the informed will of the people, and not the contrarian will of the president. "

What is happening in Yemen is not merely a violent conflict between combating forces for power, but the willful subjugation of millions of innocent civilians to starvation, disease, and ruin that transcends the human capacity to descend even below the lowest pit of darkness, from which there is no exit.Seven million people face starvation, and 19 out of 28 million of Yemen’s population are in desperate need of humanitarian aid. Both the Saudis and the Houthis are restricting food and medicine supplies from reaching starving children; many of them are cholera-ridden, on the verge of joining the thousands who have already died from starvation and disease. More than 10,000 have been killed, and nearly 40,000 injured. UNICEF reports nearly 300,000 cholera cases, and a joint statement from UNICEF and the World Health Organization declares the infection is spreading at a rate of 5,000 new cases per day.The AP documented at least 18 clandestine lockups across southern Yemen run by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) or Yemini forces, where torture of unimaginable cruelty is routine. The torture of prisoners is reducing them to less than an animal ready for the slaughter. One example of such extreme torture is the “grill,” in which the prisoner is tied to a spit like a roast and spun in a circle of fire.Another method of slow death is where detainees are crammed in shipping containers and guards light a fire underneath to fill it with smoke, slowly suffocating detainees. Prisoners are blindfolded and shackled in place in a box too small to stand in for most of their detention. Constant beating by steel wires is common, which often results in the death of the detainee. As Dostoyevsky said: “People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that’s a great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, so artistically cruel.” The U.S. has been aware for some time of allegations of torture, but professes that there have not been such abuses.Moreover, the blockade of imports of food, medicine, and fuel, which Yemen is completely dependent on, is making the situation dire beyond comprehension. If humanitarian aid is not provided immediately, millions of children will starve to death, even though the international community is cognizant of this ominous situation.The conflict escalated in March 2015 when the Saudi-led coalition (including Bahrain and Sunni-majority Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Sudan, Qatar, and the UAE) began a military operation to restore the internationally-recognized government of Abu Rabu Mansour Hadi to power.The Saudis’ targets are the Houthi forces, who are a Zaydi Shiite Muslim minority and have been fighting for control of the country. They are loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in 2011 following a popular uprising instigated by the Arab Spring. The Houthis have suffered immense discrimination, and their grievances have been addressed neither before nor after the Gulf Cooperation Council’s March 2013 initiative that launched a National Dialogue Conference, which failed to resolve the dispute over the distribution of power.The Houthis joined forces with Saleh and expanded their influence in northwestern Yemen, culminating in a major military offensive against the military and a few rival tribes in which they captured the capital Sana’a in September 2014. The Saudis’ bombing against the Houthis has been indiscriminate: schools, hospitals, homes, marketplaces, weddings, and even funeral homes were targeted to maximize casualties, egregiously violating the laws of war and continuing to do so with impunity.The Saudis claim Iran is behind the Houthis’ rebellion. Although Iran and the Houthis adhere to a different school of Shiite Islam, they share similar geopolitical interests. Iran is challenging Saudi Arabia for regional dominance, while the Houthis are the main rival to Hadi and the US-Saudi backed government in Sana’a. For the Saudis, losing Sana’a would allow Iran to exert major influence in the Arabian Peninsula in addition to its alliances with Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. The Saudi coalition is meant to signal to Iran that it will not be allowed to gain any influence in Yemen.The US along with the United Kingdom have for many years been selling offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia, which are now used to attack Houthi-held areas. The UAE, Kuwait, and Jordan received licenses to sell and service American-made military helicopters for Saudi Arabia, which sends a clear message to this unholy coalition that they can kill with impunity.UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd shamelessly said [selling arms is] “good for our industry”—not an acceptable reason to sell offensive weapons that kill people indiscriminately. Nevertheless, the US does have national security and economic interests in the Arabian Peninsula: particularly, it seeks to ensure free passage in the Bab al-Mandeb, through which 4.7 million barrels of oil pass each day; and the support of a government in Sana’a that would cooperate with US counter-terrorism battles. That said, the US’ direct involvement in the conflict makes it complicit in the coalition’s violation of the laws of war, and top US officials could be subjected to legal liability.Sadly, the Trump administration has forfeited its moral responsibility by not insisting that Saudi Arabia, over which it exercises tremendous influence, open the ports to ensure that enough food and aid enters the country, without which millions will starve to death.The conflict is going from bad to worse as international efforts to press both sides have been woefully inadequate, and media attention is nearly absent. Continued fighting will further fuel the struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and contribute to other regional conflicts. Moreover, the prospect of finding a peaceful solution is becoming increasingly difficult and laden with uncertainty, as the Trump administration believes that a solution lies with more military force. Trump justifies his bellicose approach as he sees Iran as the culprit who is raging a proxy war against the Saudis and benefiting from continued instability.For these reasons, the EU’s neutrality has allowed it to maintain contact with all the conflicting parties, and is best positioned to build on its credibility to persuade both sides to agree on a ceasefire and settlement. The Houthis want to negotiate with someone with authority rather than a mediator, and refuse to have talks with UN-appointed envoy Ismail Ould Sheikh Ahmed, who they consider to be biased. They also view the US and the UK with suspicion, as they are the chief suppliers of weapons to Saudi Arabia.Although France and Britain are supportive of the military campaign, they can be coaxed by the EU into introducing a UNSC resolution that must first, focus on a ceasefire; second, address the humanitarian crisis; and third, work on a permanent solution that would take the Houthis’ interest into full account. As Gandhi once observed: “Three-fourths of the miseries and misunderstandings in the world will disappear if we step into the shoes of our adversaries and understand their standpoint.”The conflict in Yemen can end only through a political solution, as no solution secured by force will survive. The Trump administration must learn from Iraq and Syria’s intractable violent conflicts, which could not be resolved through military means. To resolve the conflict in Yemen, the US must join hands with the EU to achieve a peace agreement and put an end to the unconscionable tragedy inflicted on millions of innocent people.Just take a look at the eyes of a starving, sick, and dehydrated little child whose heart is just about to stop. Multiply this image by tens of thousands and ask yourself, where have we gone wrong? We have gone wrong because it has been long since we lost our humanitarian and moral compass."

Today, former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg and California Governor Jerry Brown announced “America’s Pledge,” a plan for cities and states to lead the way on cutting climate pollution 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.By reaching that target, the US will meet our nation’s commitment for reducing climate pollution that we set at climate talks in Paris in 2015. The dismay amongst Americans and people around the world continues after Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and his increased climate action isolation at last weekend’s G-20 meeting. This new pledge shows a pathway for the US to meet the agreement regardless of his decision.That historically bad move by Trump has ceded U.S. leadership on fighting climate disruption to other countries, and has even caused some to refer to the global alliance of powers as the G-19, signaling our lack of leadership on the world stage as humanity faces an unprecedented threat. The lack of leadership by Trump on climate has inspired cities across the U.S. to pass their own resolutions supporting the Paris Agreement, and now there’s even more they can do to counter Trump’s inaction.Over the coming months, California Governor Jerry Brown’s Administration will join with Bloomberg Philanthropies (which supports the Sierra Club) and partners to calculate the collective climate action potential of U.S. states, cities, businesses, universities and others – thousands of which have already committed themselves to cut emissions – and submit that progress to the United Nations. This will further inspire others to join, keeping the U.S. as a global leader in reducing climate pollution. The Sierra Club’s work in the Beyond Coal Campaign to replace coal plants with renewable energy will be an important engine of that progress, and our Ready For 100 Campaign will continue securing commitments to 100 percent clean energy from more mayors and cities. “The American government may have pulled out of the Paris Agreement, but American society remains committed to it — and we will redouble our efforts to achieve its goals,” said Michael Bloomberg.But we’re not letting the Trump administration off the hook. America’s Pledge is not intended as substitute for U.S. federal government responsibility for climate policy and action. Rather, the pledge aims to quantify, communicate and encourage climate action in the United States, as participants across the U.S. find new ways to work with the international community and interact with international climate policy processes. Climate action will continue to happen in the U.S. thanks to action by cities, states, businesses, and grassroots advocates, including the Sierra Club and our Beyond Coal and Ready For 100 Campaigns. Together we will continue to make a difference via “America’s Pledge,” which will help fill the gap and keep climate action and the Paris Agreement process on track through these next few turbulent years."

Since then, the iconic bald performer has gone on to tour around the world, become a HIV awareness advocate and has spread a message of strength and self-love.But how did all begin? During an interview with Hey Qween’s Jonny McGovern, Ongina talked all about her journey to the legendary runway and life after the cameras stopped rolling.READ MORE: Isis King Talks Her Transition, Homelessness and ‘Top Model’“It was around 2001 and I was living in New York City,” says Ongina on her early days in the New York club scene. “I was partying in APT and I was seeing people like Glenn Moore and Kevin Aviance and it wasn’t drag per se, it was just giving looks.”It wasn’t until a few years later, when she started working at Lucky Cheng’s, an Asian fusion restaurant with drag queen servers, that she really started playing with the art of makeup and female illusion. Interestingly enough, Ongina reveals that back then she worked there alongside Trans icon Laverne Cox.But like many performers, Ongina’s sights eventually settled on Hollywood with hopes of becoming a star.“People that move to Hollywood are here to be something and when I was coming here I was like ‘I want Ongina to be famous’ like as a joke... but not really.”“In 2006 I moved to Los Angeles where I started working as a visual merchandiser for this company called Intermix,” she says. “But when I moved here I actually stopped doing drag.”“It was a year after I found out I was HIV positive so there were a lot of personal things I had to overcome and work through,” she reveals. “So when I got here I became so busy with work that I actually put Ongina away.” It wasn’t until one fateful night in Downtown Los Angeles where another soon-to-be Drag Race star, Raja, was performing for a packed house.“I don’t even remember what the place was called, but Raja was performing,” she says. “Now I had never heard of Raja, had never seen her, but when I saw her I instantly knew I wanted to do drag again.” READ MORE: Dita Von Teese Bares It All On Hey Qween “It was just one of those moments where this creative genius had reignited this fire inside me.” Soon Ongina was back on stage, wowing the Los Angeles audience. As fate would have it, one of those audience members was casting for a new reality competition show called “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”Unfortunately for that casting agent, Ongina wasn’t exactly interested in doing the show.“So there was this one lady, she was super sweet, but she harassed me for like three weeks and I saw her everywhere,” she reveals. “She was really persistent, she was not going to take no for an answer. But I told her, ‘No. I’m not a drag queen and that sounds really intimidating.’”After weeks of asking, Ongina eventually gave in, filming two hours of tape for what was supposed to be a five minute audition video. After viewing the tapes and bringing her in for an in-studio interview, producers offered her a spot.As we all know, Ongina did not end up winning the crown that first season, but what she did win was the hearts of fans all around the country.By making her HIV status known to the world she showed viewers everywhere that you can do anything even when faced with hardships and tragedy.“It was a very emotional roller coaster ride, it was overwhelming and it was something that I never thought I would have to carry on my shoulders, but I did it proudly.”  READ MORE: Nina Bo’Nina Brown On Her Struggle With Loving Herself “I put myself out there and I was overcome with emotion. And all of those emotions were for me, I let it all out for me, it made me feel better and I was finally able to say it out loud.” “At the time only a few people knew, even my parents didn’t know at the time. I didn’t know it was going to reach a level that it did, where people where inspired by what I did, I was just blown away.” She adds, “The universe has given me the opportunity to do all of that and it is amazing and it has changed my life forever.” Watch part one of Ongina’s full interview below and for more fabulous videos head to the Hey Qween Youtube channel!

The initiative, announced Tuesday, will run for six months in seven low-income parts of Aberdeen, a coastal city in Scotland with a population of 212,000. The initiative will provide free sanitary products in schools in low-income areas, as well as in women’s and homeless shelters. The program was announced by the Community Food Initiatives North East and Equalities Secretary Angela Constance, and the Scottish government reportedly gave 10,000 pounds (or around $12,000) to CFINE for the program. Monica Lennon, a member of Scottish Parliament who has proposed a bill to provide all Scottish women with free menstrual products, welcomed the initiative, but told the Scotsman that she hopes it will result in further action. “A pilot scheme is a welcome step in the right direction, but we must go much further to help women and girls across the country who are facing a monthly struggle to access the products they need,” she said. According to the Scotsman, the results of the pilot program will be used to inform any future policies on “period poverty.”H/T Independent"
68,WOMEN,How Anti-Abortion Laws Negatively Affect Women's Health At Large,Jenavieve Hatch,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-anti-abortion-laws-negatively-affect-womens-health-at-large_us_59651872e4b005b0fdc90efa,A new documentary explores the hidden ways women are being punished.,2017-07-12,Anti-abortion protestors come together to protest in Arizona. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59652bb61800003800673c14.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the 12th week of Laurie Bertram Roberts’ second pregnancy, she went to the hospital because she feared she was having a miscarriage. The doctors at the Catholic hospital she went to told her that she was indeed having a miscarriage, but that they couldn’t do anything because the fetus, which had stopped growing weeks ago, still had a heartbeat. After she’d been sent home, she began bleeding so heavily that she passed out. Only when the fetus’s heart stopped beating hours later, and when Roberts was close to dying from all of the blood loss, was she able to be treated. Roberts’ story is not unique ― many women have been forced to access health care at Catholic hospitals, and had their health care adversely affected because of it. This is just one example of what can happen when we consider a fetus a person.“Birthright: A War Story,” directed by Civia Tamarkin and co-written by Luchina Fisher, looks at how the anti-abortion rights movement and the religious right have mobilized in the days after Roe v. Wade was passed in 1973, and how the legislation passed by these groups affects women.Tamarkin told HuffPost during an interview for AOL BUILD that the growing presence of Catholic hospitals stems from anti-abortion groups’ constant push for personhood laws and religious-based health care. “From the day that Roe v. Wade came into effect, the opposition has been trying to establish a constitutional amendment stating that a fetus is protected and is a person guaranteed all the rights under the constitution,” she said. “Since then, there have been various measures to declare the personhood of the fetus...if you establish the personhood of the fetus, then any harm to that fetus falls under criminal statutes, like homicide.” Fisher agreed: “It’s an intrusion of women’s lives right from the very beginning [of a pregnancy].” Because of their insidious nature ― take recent legislation in Arkansas, for example ― personhood laws can fly under the radar, and are often a way to chip away at abortion access without a legislator ever having to use the word “abortion.”The expansion of Catholic hospitals is another way to limit what a woman can choose to do with the fetus that grows inside her body. When private Catholic hospitals buy out general hospitals, their rules change, and all health care provided must meet the regulations of Catholic health care. The Catholic church is, of course, highly outspoken against abortion, often even in the case of rape, incest, or a miscarriage like the one that Roberts had. What both Tamarkin and Fisher want to see in the U.S. is the same anger and urgency directed toward laws like these that women had before Roe v. Wade was passed.“People need to get active,” she said.“Women need to go back to taking to the streets. The Women’s March was so effective, but that was back in January...this is now July, and we are not seeing those kinds of numbers despite all the action that the Trump administration is taking.”Check out the full Q&A above, and check out the “Birthright” website for release dates and more information."

Knowing how to react to the answer can be even harder. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596672b0180000cb15673f5b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you’ve been following my blogs and podcasts, you know I’ve been concerned of late with all the attention directed at Netflix’s “13 Reasons Why.” In my book, “R U OK? Teen Depression and Suicide” I speak to the importance of parents, teachers, counselors and peers asking one key question to at-risk teens: R U OK? What concerns me about “13 Reasons Why” is not that it doesn’t accurately show the risk factors for suicide (it certainly does), it’s that the parents, counselors, teachers and peers portrayed in the show offer no direction on how to handle an at-risk child, student or friend.Before you ask, “R U OK?” it’s important that you’re prepared for what you hear in response. As a confidant to someone in pain, you have a certain responsibility to act in that person’s best interest. In fact, how you respond could be the key to saving a life –literally or figuratively.Recognize the warning signsIf you’re asking the question “R U OK?” chances are, you’ve witnessed some symptoms of depression or warning signs for suicide. As you talk to your friend, child or student, it’s important that you keep these warning signs in mind. In my book, I outline several symptoms and warning signs for depression and suicide, including withdrawal from family and friends, disinterest in favorite extracurricular activities, behavioral problems, substance abuse, risky behavior, declining grades, physical pain, low self-esteem, conflict with family and friends, sadness, anxiety and thoughts of hopelessness. Prepare yourself to identify these symptoms or warning signs when they arise in the conversation, as you could be the key to helping a friend or loved one get help.Be prepared to get helpSome problems are too big for a good friend – or even a loving parent – to fix on their own. As you listen to your friend, student or loved one, it’s important that you know what resources are available if and when you need to find additional support. If you ever suspect that a friend or loved one is at risk of harming himself or someone else, it’s imperative you seek professional help immediately. This isn’t about betraying the confidence of a friend; it’s about saving and healing a life. I’ve included resources at the end of this blog that are available to help you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.Don’t try to “fix it”Depression is treatable, but as a friend (or even a teacher), it may not be your place to start in on “fixing” the problem. In fact, offering “solutions” to someone with severe depression might only serve to make that person feel more hopeless. Don’t ever tell someone who is depressed or suicidal to “snap out of it,” or “look on the bright side.” Chances are, if your friend or loved one is confiding in you, he or she is really just looking for someone to listen and understand. Show empathy, love and support. Offer to help them on their journey to health and healing; but don’t assume you can fix them alone.Keep the “mind difference” in mindWhether you’re talking to a student, child or peer, it’s important to remember that the teen brain is far different from a mature adult brain. Adults have all been teenagers before, but it’s easy to forget how differently the teenage mind works. In fact, male brains are not fully mature until age 25, while females’ typically mature at 21. This means that teen brains are not equipped with the same problem-solving and decision-making skills as those of mature adults. It also explains why so many teens act on impulse, misread social cues and emotions, get into accidents or fights and engage in risky behavior – teens don’t think like adults do. Another important factor to remember: one in five teens live with a mental health condition. Half will develop this by age 14, three-quarters by age 24. If your friend or loved one has a mental health issue, know that you can offer support and encouragement, but he or she likely needs professional help and treatment.Let them know you careAbove all, someone suffering from depression or at risk for suicide needs to know they are loved. This is more than just listening to what they have to say; it’s important to acknowledge their growth and accomplishments, offer reassurance and kindness and show them that you are on their side. In my book, I offer some words of encouragement you can use for friends or loved ones struggling with depression:I’m always here for you, even when times are bad.I love you for who you are.I’m on your side.We’re a team.You’re important to me.You’re not alone.You make my life better just by being in it.Of course, if you suspect a friend, child or student is at risk for suicide, no amount of encouraging words will replace the professional help and treatment they really need.

According to Barnes, the former NWA rapper severely beat her, attempting to throw her down a flight of stairs, stomping on her fingers, and throwing her down a flight of stairs. Barnes sued Dr. Dre and the case was later settled out of court, but at the time, the rapper refused to apologize for assaulting her. He said in a Rolling Stone interview at the time:“I just did it, you know. Ain’t nothing you can do now by talking about it. Besides, it ain’t no big thing — I just threw her through a door.”In 2015, when details about his assault against Barnes and also ex-girlfriend Michel’le resurfaced, the music mogul issued a brief statement to the New York Times in which he apologized to the women he hurt and added, “I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives.”Now, in the second part of his new HBO docuseries “The Defiant Ones,” which aired on Monday, Dr. Dre has gone in-depth in addressing the Dee Barnes incident. “Any man that puts his hands on a female is a f**king idiot,” Dre says in the Allen Hughes-directed docuseries.“He’s out of his f**king mind, and I was out of my f**king mind at the time. I f**ked up, I paid for it, I’m sorry for it, I apologize for it.”The rapper explained that he himself experienced abuse as a child, and watched his mother get abused, which makes his actions in the past doubly egregious. “There’s absolutely no excuse for it. No woman should ever be treated that way.”The 52-year-old said the assault had been like a “dark cloud” following him throughout his career.“It’s a major blemish on who I am as a man, and every time it comes up, it just makes me feel f‑‑‑ed up.”It’s important to acknowledge, though, that Dr. Dre has continued to enjoy a lucrative career despite his past.

The bill consists of several laws, as well as changes to the Marriage Act, both legalizing gay marriages and swapping out gender specific wording for neutral terms across several laws.References to “husband,” “wife,” “father” and “mother” will be changed to “spouse” and “parent” in a number of laws, including the Criminal Code, the Code of Civil Organization and Procedure, The Interpretation Act, The Civil Unions Act and the Civil Code, reports Malta Independent. The new bill also grants same-sex couples equal rights to adopt children.“Malta wants to keep leading on LGBT issues and civil liberties, to serve as a model for the rest of the world,” Malta’s recently re-elected Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told the BBC.Malta’s population of fewer than 450,000 inhabitants is overwhelmingly Catholic, and the Roman Catholic church plays a prominent role in the Mediterranean country’s civic life.Malta Archbishop Charles Scicluna spoke out against the changes to the Marriage Act and the introduction of gender neutral terminology.“We are not against gays,” he recently told a church community, according to the BBC. “But we do not need to change the way in which God created marriage to enable us to say that two men or two women can get married.”Divorce was illegal in the island nation until 2011. But since then, the Parliament has enacted a number of progressive laws, including recognizing same-sex unions in 2014. Two years later, Malta became the first European country to ban gay conversion therapy.With Wednesday’s vote, Malta joins more than a dozen other European countries that have legalized same-sex marriage, including Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands."

McConnell is expected to release a revised health care bill Thursday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59669304180000a085673ffe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Republicans are still moving ahead with a vote on their health care bill next week, but barring some sudden changes of hearts, it looks like they will fall short of the votes ― and no one seems to have a real idea of what to do then.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is expected to release the text of a revised bill Thursday, along with an amendment drafted by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that would dramatically undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions in the name of lowering costs for healthy people. On Wednesday afternoon, Cruz suggested, but did not directly state, that he would vote against the motion to proceed on the bill if his amendment was not attached.“If there are not meaningful protections for consumer freedom that will lower premiums, then the bill will not go forward,” Cruz said.Pressed on whether that meant he would vote against a motion to proceed, Cruz said the bill would not “have the votes” to go forward. The Cruz amendment would allow insurers who offer at least one health plan that complies with Obamacare regulations to offer other, cheaper plans that don’t.Regardless of whether Cruz’s amendment is included, a vote on the motion to proceed may be going down anyway. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told Politico on Tuesday she was “not optimistic” that this would be a bill she could support, and Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) famously expressed a number of issues with the bill in a high-profile news conference in June ― issues that would largely be exacerbated or unaddressed with the addition of Cruz’s amendment. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has also strongly suggested he would vote against a motion to proceed on the revised bill no matter the status of Cruz’s amendment. He called it “the same as the old bill, except worse,” and, should a motion to proceed fail, he would push Senate GOP leaders to hold a vote on a straight repeal.“I ran on repealing Obamacare,” Paul told reporters Wednesday. “It doesn’t repeal Obamacare. It creates a giant Obamacare superfund. I can’t be for that.”“If they lose on this vote, I’m giving them an alternative,” Paul said. “The alternative is two bills: clean repeal, and a big government spending bill that they can work with Democrats on for big government-spending Republicans.”Republicans seem to acknowledge that they will, at some point, need to stabilize Obamacare markets. Even in their bill replacing the Affordable Care Act, there are funds that would reimburse insurers for the cost of their most expensive patients, allowing them to hold down premium increases.But without their bill, many Republicans concede they should do something to bring more certainty to insurers offering plans in 2018.At a minimum, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has suggested Republicans could fund the so-called cost-sharing reductions (CSRs), which subsidize the cost of Obamacare plans for people with incomes up to 250 percent of the poverty level. President Donald Trump has threatened to end those payments, and, in response to that uncertainty, insurers have offered more expensive plans or simply not offered plans at all.Funding those CSR payments would be a small step that Republicans could take ― with Democrats ― to reinforce the Obamacare insurance markets. But that move would almost certainly draw the ire of conservatives, and it’s unclear what legislative vehicle Congress could use for CSRs. A budget deal or debt ceiling increase with Democrats would be an obvious choice, but there’s little impetus to pass one of those bills at this point, and Republicans would functionally be giving up on their repeal efforts and removing the one negotiating chip they may have to force Democrats to the table on a bipartisan health care bill.A more likely scenario ― the actual bare minimum ― is that Republicans do nothing. The Trump administration could continue to make the CSR payments or could end them and truly throw the Obamacare exchanges into chaos. Trump has the CSR payments as leverage to extract concessions on other priorities, like his wall along the Mexican border in an omnibus spending deal, and he could make the subsidies contingent upon an item like that funding. It would then be up to Democrats whether they would give in to Trump’s demands or gamble that voters will just blame Republicans for the collapse of the insurance market and, perhaps, a government shutdown.That potential showdown is all the more reason some Republicans are floating the idea of working with Democrats on new legislation.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) claims to already be working on a bipartisan health care bill ― a strategy endorsed by more moderate Republicans, such as Collins and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) ― but his idea of a bipartisan measure at this point sounds less than half-baked and far short of bipartisan.“We’re trying to find consensus among ourselves and at the same time reach out to some Democrats who would be open-minded to the solutions being at the state level, not necessarily in Washington,” Graham said Wednesday.If that sounds like like something Democrats might resist, it probably should. Graham’s idea of Democrats jumping aboard seems more aspirational than real.“It is a concept,” he said. “I hope it can get bipartisanship.”Asked about the basic tenets of his health care bill, Graham declined to provide any real details until Republicans had either passed or dispensed with their current legislation. (Graham said he thought the bill coming to the floor next week would fail.)But the GOP’s best hope of getting a bill through still seems to be this week’s revised legislation. While the health care plan continued to appear short on support Wednesday, McConnell still has more than $400 billion in savings he can dole out to win over reluctant Republicans. Many of Murkowski’s concerns for Alaska could be addressed with that money, as could some concerns of other Republicans over the phaseout of the Medicaid expansion and high premiums for low-income seniors, though aides and senators have indicated that the new bill will mostly preserve the current provisions on ending the Medicaid expansion.McConnell could also get a helping hand from the Senate parliamentarian, as she’ll have to rule on whether Cruz’s open-ended language on coverage options is actually allowable in a reconciliation bill, which requires only 50 votes to pass but limits what senators can do in order to reconcile spending with their budget. While striking down the Cruz language could be the death blow for the health care bill, it could also convince Cruz and other conservatives ― like Mike Lee (R-Utah) ― to accept a more incremental approach. At this point, McConnell seems to need a shakeup, and a parliamentary ruling could be what shifts the current dynamics.The idea, however, of Republicans going back to the drawing board, perhaps seeking out some Democrats to support their measure, doesn’t look like a winning strategy. Republicans are already split over a health care bill for both repealing too much of Obamacare and not enough, and Democrats appear completely united in their opposition to anything resembling the Republican plan.If the revised bill fails, GOP senators have little idea what Plan B is. “I’ll leave that up to the leadership to decide what to do,” Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said Wednesday. “You’re going to have a health care system that implodes.”As it happens, that part isn’t entirely true. The markets appear to be in better shape than Burr and his allies concede ― or perhaps even realize. Just this week, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation released a study of insurer financial performance that concluded “the individual market has been stabilizing and insurers are regaining profitability.” Premiums or out-of-pocket costs remain a lot higher than many people feel they can afford, and insurer pullouts have left some areas, particularly rural ones, with few or even no choice of insurers. But some carriers are expanding their options, filling in gaps others are leaving, and many industry officials say the biggest source of uncertainty isn’t the underlying market weakness that plagued the program in its first few years; it’s the neglect and sabotage from hostile officials, including the ones working out of the White House.With a little more money, or at least some assurances that the existing money will continue, the worst outcomes of an Obamacare market collapse could be avoided.But Republicans don’t look all that interested in that white flag approach ― at least not until they’ve demonstrated they can’t pass a bill of their own. And even then, Republican leaders see big problems if they can’t muscle through this health care legislation.Asked on Wednesday what Republicans would do if they couldn’t pass their bill, GOP Conference Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) suggested Republicans didn’t have a backup plan.“That would be highly problematic,” Thune said.Jonathan Cohn contributed to this report.CORRECTION: This article previously misstated the upper threshold for CSRs as 400 percent of the poverty level; the correct figure is 250 percent of the poverty level."

And he said no, I did not. Absolutely not. I then asked him a second time in a totally different way. He said absolutely not,” Trump said.(Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Howard Goller and Peter Cooney)"
