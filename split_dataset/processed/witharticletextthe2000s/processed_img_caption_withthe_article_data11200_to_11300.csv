The contract is worth $69 million, with Trufant earning nearly $14 million per season and almost $42 million in guaranteed money. Trufant, who was previously signed through the 2017-18 NFL season, is now under contract for the next six seasons with Atlanta. The deal makes him the fourth-highest paid cornerback in the NFL in terms of guaranteed dollars.With the league shifting more and more toward passing, possessing quality corners has become increasingly important. The 26-year-old Trufant earned Pro Bowl honors in 2015, and was likely well on his way to another selection last season before requiring season-ending surgery after suffering a pectoral injury.As a precaution, the former Falcons’ first-round pick will be held out of offseason workouts, but clearly the team isn’t worried.“Trufant is coming along great,” head coach Dan Quinn recently said at the NFC coaches breakfast in Phoenix. “We won’t have him practice during [organized team activities (OTAs)], but by the time we get to training camp, he’ll be ready to go and battle.”All in all, it has been a highly productive and eventful offseason for GM Thomas Dimitroff and the entire organization. As the team gets set to debut its $1.6 billion new state-of-the-art Mercedes Benz Stadium, it will do so with a new offensive coordinator in Steve Sarkisian ― a story first broken by HuffPost ― after former OC Kyle Shanahan left to become the head coach of the 49ers.While the record-breaking Atlanta offense ― led by MVP Matt Ryan and All-World receiver Julio Jones ― garners most of the headlines, it’s worth noting that the Falcons defense improved dramatically during the second half of last season.During its final nine games, it surrendered only 22 points per matchup, totaling an impressive 22 sacks and 18 forced turnovers, including a pick-six of Tom Brady in Super Bowl LI.In turn, retaining a shutdown corner like Trufant (who has 48 career passes defensed) for the long-term is undeniably a huge boon for a promising young defense that helped propel the franchise to its second ever Super Bowl appearance.Trufant will once again join forces with Jalen Collins and Robert Alford, two other young corners who played well in his absence. Trufant is also flanked by safety Keanu Neal (Atlanta’s 2016 first-rounder), who led all rookies with five forced fumbles last year, while ranking second with 106 tackles.Don’t forget about linebacker Deion Jones either. The 2016 second-rounder ― notice a theme here ― led all rookies with 108 tackles last season and was tied for first with three interceptions. Rounding out the defense is 24-year-old outside linebacker Vic Beasley, Jr., who led the league with 15.5 sacks last year.

1,POLITICS,Democrats Are Walking A Careful Line In Criticism Of Trump’s Syria Strike,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-criticism-donald-trump-syria-strike_us_58e80e73e4b00de141039d53,Many of them agree with the idea of retaliation.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the most progressive member of the Senate Democratic caucus, was a case in point.“It is very questionable whether it is legal” to bomb the Syrian air force without congressional involvement, Sanders told The Huffington Post.Some of Sanders’ colleagues were less equivocal, including Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who said this “certainly is not a lawful act.” On the other end of the spectrum, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said it “seems like a reasonable exercise of presidential power.” But only a handful of Democrats questioned the evidence that Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons on civilians, the efficacy of using force to address that crime or the overall pattern of U.S. involvement in the Middle East.The relatively measured criticism from top Democrats reflects a complex array of factors that have again put the party out of step with some grassroots members. In many cases, Democratic lawmakers simply agree with the need to punish Assad for using chemical weapons on the town of Khan Sheikhoun, even as they are uneasy about Trump’s leadership, the legality of his actions or the consequences of a strike.That leaves Democrats in an interesting political position. For months they have taken every opportunity to lambaste Trump as a threat to the very fabric of the American republic. And from Trump’s travel ban to the Obamacare replacement debacle, the strategy has largely paid off. Now, with Trump launching the first direct attacks on the Syrian government, Democrats are more ambivalent.Larry Korb, a senior fellow at the Democratic-aligned Center for American Progress, said he was “not surprised” that Democrats were sympathetic to the idea of a retaliatory airstrike. Many Democrats subscribe to a “responsibility to protect” doctrine that swift force is justified to prevent major humanitarian catastrophes, according to Korb.Democrats should be more concerned, Korb said, with the prospect of this leading to more significant U.S. intervention in Syria.“The real question is: What comes next?” said Korb, who supported the Obama administration’s decision not to heed calls to arm Syrian rebel groups more aggressively or remove Assad by force.The fact that Democrats may have substantial reasons to embrace the idea of retaliating against Assad does not diminish the divide between many elected leaders and the ardent anti-interventionism of the party’s base. “My expectations [of Democrats] were very low, and my expectations were met,” said Phyllis Bennis, a foreign policy expert at the left-wing Institute for Policy Studies. “Am I disappointed that we don’t have an antiwar party? Yes, I am.”Bennis represents a wing of the peace camp that believes military force, whether legal or not, is justified only in very limited circumstances of self-defense. The last U.S. intervention she considers “legitimate” was World War II.Bennis and other progressive critics argue that there should be a full international investigation of the use of chemical weapons to determine definitively whether Assad is responsible, which they admit is extremely likely. “Having a full investigation is not some sort of delaying tactic. It is essential to getting real accountability,” said Stephen Miles, director of the progressive Win Without War coalition. That view got a high-profile boost from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who urged caution in an interview with The Globe and Mail on Thursday. Trudeau called for a United Nations Security Council resolution that will enable the world “to determine first of all who was responsible for these attacks and how we will move forward.”Even if Assad’s guilt is established, punishing him militarily would not be an effective response, according to Miles of Win Without War. He supports removing the weapons from Syria, negotiating a diplomatic end to the war and trying alleged war criminals.“The ultimate accountability comes from international tribunals,” Miles said. “It is really gratifying to blow things up, but that doesn’t make it accountability.” But Win Without War, Credo, MoveOn.org and Peace Action, which jointly condemned Trump’s strike as a “reckless act of war,” have largely mirrored Democrats’ talking points about the strikes’ legality in their mobilization strategy.A petition Credo is circulating that quickly picked up over 57,000 signatures calls on Democrats to “rein in Donald Trump’s unauthorized military strikes and hold immediate emergency deliberations on Trump’s illegal escalation of military engagement in Syria.”Miles praised House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for demanding that Congress reconvene to debate a new authorization for use of military force ― and saved his criticism for Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who voiced unreserved agreement with Trump’s decision.“It’s not the first time we have seen Democrats in Congress who are way out of touch with where their base is,” he said.Democrats have often chafed under Republican claims that they are weak on national security. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, critics saw signs of this insecurity in the ease with which Democratic lawmakers lined up behind then-President George W. Bush’s invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.But veteran Democratic foreign policy thinkers argue that Democrats’ ambivalence about President Trump’s missile strikes against Assad have more to do with former President Barack Obama and his foreign policy legacy than the ghosts of the Bush presidency.Obama famously warned the Syrian government that use of chemical weapons would cross a “red line,” forcing the United States to consider military action against Assad’s regime.When the U.S. concluded in August 2013 that Assad had used chemical weapons against civilians in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, Obama announced plans to launch missile strikes against Syrian military targets.After the British Parliament rejected a bid for the United Kingdom to participate in the strike, Obama decided to seek congressional approval for the move. It soon became clear that the strike faced bipartisan opposition, and the White House pulled the request.Despite public opposition to the retaliatory strike, Obama endured a lot of criticism, including from members of his own party, for not honoring his “red line” ultimatum, undermining U.S. credibility.“The residue of the decision not to bomb in 2013 created an environment where the next time it happened a strike was going to be a foregone conclusion. There’d be no alternative,” said Steven Simon, who was senior director of Middle Eastern and North African affairs on Obama’s National Security Council in 2011 and 2012.That leaves Democrats who want to avoid a replay of 2013 with limited grounds on which to criticize Trump, admitted Simon, now a history professor at Amherst College.“They have sort of squared the circle by applauding the use of force but registering concerns about lack of congressional consultation,” Simon said.Then there is the matter of deeper disagreement within the Democratic Party about Obama’s broader policy toward Syria. Obama rejected the suggestions of many advisers, including then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to intervene more forcefully to protect Syrian civilians and speed up Assad’s ouster. Those disagreements were evident in Clinton’s campaign promise to create a no-fly zone in Syria, as well as her calls Thursday for the U.S. to take out all of Assad’s airfields ― a more ambitious step than Trump ended up taking.Clinton and other proponents of greater intervention in Syria argue that by declining to diminish Assad, the U.S. will never have the leverage needed to stop his atrocities and forge a diplomatic solution.As a candidate, Trump ran against Clinton’s strategy, repeatedly insisting that Assad was preferable to the Syrian groups trying to overthrow him.For Democrats hoping Trump would adopt a more Clintonian approach, it is tempting to view his strike on the Syrian airfield as the beginning of a recognition that Assad must face greater pressure, including the threat of force, to end the conflict.But one such proponent of more robust action, Michael Breen, president of the center-left Truman Center and Truman National Security Project, warned against getting too optimistic. Breen is concerned about Trump’s haste and apparent lack of strategy. “A lot of people wanted to see the U.S. get more involved in Syria and wanted to see a response to the regime’s atrocities, but it is way too early to suddenly say Donald Trump is a different president than he was two days ago.” Ryan Grim and Mike McAuliff contributed reporting."

3,POLITICS,Iowa Secretary Of State's Office Released Statistics That Its Own Staff Objected To,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iowa-voter-id-fraud_us_58e909e1e4b05413bfe365dd,"""It sounds like we are suggesting that 'bounce backs' are [voter] fraud or likely to be fraud.”",2017-04-08,"Carol Olson, Iowa's deputy secretary of state for elections, objected to releasing statistics highlighting voting irregularities.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e90b042c00006568ff2fd7.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an effort to highlight voter irregularities and push for stricter voting laws, Iowa’s top election official pushed statistics on alleged voter fraud that even a member of his own staff privately suggested were misleading, emails obtained by the Huffington Post reveal.This past January, Iowa’s Secretary of State Paul Pate (R) introduced a bill that required those who wanted to cast a ballot to show official identification, eliminated straight party voting, and established post election audits of the vote.This effort was part of a nationwide push by Republicans to enforce voter ID laws, even though voter fraud is virtually nonexistent. And to sell the measure, his office did what other Republicans have as well: it argued that while there’s been no evidence of voter fraud in Iowa, elections are insecure and could potentially be cheated.To substantiate his argument, Pate’s office drafted a statement for a reporter from the local Gazette newspaper, noting that in Iowa it appeared 41 felons had cast ballots and that more than 200 election day voter registrations, or EDRs, had bounced back. The draft statement included the caveats that the irregularities “do not necessarily constitute fraud” and that the state would have a more complete picture of election data come March. Pate urged his staff to release it.“We need to release info and these stats are public already. When an auditor turns them over to the county attorney or sheriff for action that pretty much makes it public. Am I missing something?,” he wrote in an email.But releasing the statistics drew an objection from Carol Olson, Pate’s deputy secretary of state for elections, who suggested they were misleading. “I do not believe that we should say that 41 felons illegally cast ballots. We encouraged them to use provisional ballots, so that would feel a little like we baited them to do something illegal,” she wrote. “And it’s risky to label it ‘illegal’ because we don’t know the circumstances. It might be illegal, but [it] might not be, if someone really believed their rights were restored. We can report the number of felons voting, but let’s not call it illegal,” she wrote. Olson noted that some of the statistics suggested something nefarious when it could simply be attributed to human error. “I’m also really reluctant to say that 207 EDR’s (sic) from 15 counties bounced back. In the context of a discussion on election fraud, it sounds like we are suggesting that “bounce backs” are fraud or likely to be fraud,” she wrote. “First, it’s only a partial report. What about the other 84 counties? How does this fit into the overall process of EDRs? The vast majority of these ‘bounce-backs’ are sloppy addresses from voters in too much of a hurry when they register at the polls. That’s a real reason to discourage EDR and a real reason to have pollbooks, but it’s not an indicator of illegal activity.”Olson said she was concerned about releasing statistics on fraud because it would push reporters to look into them more.“My reason for recommending not to provide the “fraud” information is that we can never provide the media enough info. No matter what we give them, they are always looking for more details, more dirt. We have no idea if any of these cases will be prosecuted or even investigated,” she wrote. “We have no idea how many other situations were never referred to us. I also don’t want county auditors to feel reluctant to talk with us about concerning cases because they fear a reporter will be calling them up demanding more information.”Despite these concerns, Pate’s office pushed the statistics anyway. His communications director provided the reporter from The Gazette the numbers Olson found objectionable, while providing the caveats that the irregularities weren’t necessarily fraud and the data was incomplete. “County auditors from 15 counties reported a total of 207 Election Day voter registrations have bounced back in the initial phase. These are just preliminary and auditors are working on resolving. They do not necessarily constitute fraud. This includes about half of the largest counties. It is not a complete statewide list yet. We will not have a more accurate picture of these until around March,” Kevin Hall, the spokesman, wrote in his response to the reporter.Similar numbers ended up in a Jan. 13 story stating that more than 250 registrations bounced back and that 41 felons cast ballots. The Gazette did not describe the felon votes as “illegal” and noted that Pate believed the number of unverified voters would drop.In an email to The Huffington Post, Hall said that Olson’s comments were being mischaracterized.“You are mischaracterizing Carol’s comments, just as she predicted the media would in the last paragraph of the email you pasted below,” he wrote.Different versions of Pate’s bill have passed the Iowa House and Senate and it is expected to become law soon. Critics of the bill argue that a voter ID requirement will discourage minorities, the elderly and the poor from voting, a concern dismissed by Pate’s office because the legislation will provide a free voter identification card for those who lack the required ID. In at least one email, Olson acknowledged there was more that could be included in the bill to make it easier to vote. In January, Joel Miller, the Linn County auditor, asked Olson whether Pate’s bill would include a provision for automatic voter registration. Such a provision, he noted, “would get voter IDs into the hands of more of our citizens with virtually no effort or cost.”“That’s true. Not a likely addition to this bill, however. Thanks for reaching out, tho!,” Olson wrote back. "

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) says Montana House hopeful Rob Quist is the kind of candidate Democrats should be putting up in traditionally Republican areas.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e6f48c2c00006568ff2c67.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has offered to travel to Montana to help boost insurgent House candidate Rob Quist, who is running in a surprisingly competitive special election for the at-large seat previously held by Ryan Zinke, who is now secretary of the department of interior. The stop would be part of a national tour Sanders is doing with Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez after Easter, the Vermont senator told The Huffington Post in an interview. The duo plan to hit roughly nine states, but the details are still being worked out.Sanders, whose organization, Our Revolution, has endorsed Quist, said that the House hopeful is the kind of candidate Democrats should be putting up in traditionally Republican areas. “The idea that we have a major political party today, which has essentially given up on half of the country is beyond absurd. It is pathetic, because many of those states are some of the states in the most economic distress,” he said. “My impression is [Quist]’s a very strong candidate who stands up for working people, understands that we need a government that represents all of us and not the one percent. So if we can be of help to Quist, happy to do that as well.”Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, will already be in the neighborhood, so to speak, with plans to stop in Omaha, Nebraska. “There is going to be a mayor’s race and my understanding is that the Democratic candidate there has a chance to win if voter turnout is high, and we’ll do what we can to create high voter turnout,” Sanders said. “In Montana, if it works out, we’d love to go to Montana and help Quist in his race.” Quist, a bluegrass legend in the state, starts with unusually high name recognition for a first-time candidate. He endorsed Sanders during the Democratic primary and has run a populist campaign based on preserving access to and conserving public lands, expanding healthcare coverage and protecting reproductive freedom rights.He did not immediately return a request for comment, nor did Quist’s spokeswoman. Republicans in red districts often try to paint Democrats as beholden to coastal elites such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), as the party is trying to do to both Quist and Jon Ossoff, a Democrat running in a special election in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. Quist has already been attacked for his support of Sanders during the primary, though it’s unclear if that approach is effective against him, as the senator is a rural populist from Vermont, not an urban-center politician. Sanders thinks his politics can play in rural areas across the country. “In Kentucky, for example, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul should have to explain to their state, which may have benefited more than any other state in this country from the ACA, why it is that they think it is appropriate to throw hundreds of thousands of people in their own state off of healthcare,” Sanders said. “I look forward to their explanation as to why they think that is good public policy. Our job is to go to Kentucky and go to other states and say to working class people and young people that they are not alone. That in their own state, there are a whole lot of people who are prepared to stand up and fight against a right wing agenda which benefits the wealthy and the powerful at the expense of their middle class and working families.”Take a survey: should the national Democratic Party jump into the Montana special election, or stay away to avoid getting caught up in a potential loss?"
5,POLITICS,Trump Administration Infighting Comes To A Head,Sebastian Murdock,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-white-house-cant-seem-to-stop-its-infighting_us_58e901a5e4b00de14103db0e,It's like watching the worst reality TV show ever.,2017-04-08,"White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, left, has reportedly accused Senior Adviser Jared Kushner of planting stories about him and vice-versa.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e90c7a16000021004d977d.jpeg?cache=d72rKCfEWl&ops=crop_1037_0_3717_2645%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Speculation of a major White House shakeup is growing, as reports of tensions between President Donald Trump’s top advisers continue to emerge. And if there’s anything the president is especially adept at, it’s firing people.At his Florida resort in Mar-a-Lago this week, Trump reportedly brought together chief strategist Steve Bannon and son-in-law Jared Kushner to try and hash out rumored tensions. Kushner recently took on more responsibilities within the White House, while Bannon has seen his own role shrink.Kushner, the husband of the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, was quickly folded into the commander in chief’s inner circle following the election. Kushner has already developed a close relationship with the Chinese government and he was pictured in Iraq this week, awkwardly sporting a flak jacket on top of a blazer as he met with top military brass.His approach apparently hasn’t set well with Bannon. Botched executive orders and the failure of a health care bill have created tension between the two. And it all came to a head this week, when new details emerged that Kushner had played a pivotal role in kicking Bannon off the National Security Council. Each has accused the other of planting negative stories about them in the media, White House aides told Politico. Following Bannon’s removal from the NCS, The Daily Beast reported that Bannon allegedly called Kushner a “cuck” and “globalist.” Sources told the publication that Bannon thought Kushner tried to “shiv him and push him out the door.”White House aides told The New York Times that the president hoped this weekend’s Mar-a-Lago meeting would help smooth tensions. But Axios and The Wall Street Journal have reported that Bannon and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus could be demoted or downright dismissed. White House sources told The Huffington Post that the president is considering replacing Priebus with Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn, who currently serves as Trump’s top economic adviser. For all the obvious infighting, the administration is still staying firm in its stance that everything is going according to plan. “I think first of all a very high amount of tension in the White House is normal,” former House speaker Newt Gingrich told the New York Times. “I think they have particular tension right now because the health bill failed.”The White House has also denied reports of a staff shakeup, writing in a statement that “the only thing we are shaking up is the way Washington operates as we push the president’s aggressive agenda forward.” "

John McCain for having been a prisoner of war.,2017-04-08,President Donald Trump has declared Sunday “National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day.”,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58949e702800001f00996aab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump paid tribute to former prisoners of war, despite having mocked Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for having been captured.Declaring Sunday “National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day,” Trump said that “America honors our service men and women imprisoned during war. These patriots have moved and inspired our Nation through their unyielding sacrifices and devout allegiance.”The honor, which is undoubtedly a deserving one, is a bit ironic given Trump’s previous comments about POWs. Trump has on multiple occasions criticized McCain’s military credentials and mocked him for having been a prisoner of war.“He’s a war hero because he was captured,” he said in July 2015. “I like people who weren’t captured.”Days later, he retweeted a tweet claiming McCain “is not a hero.”Trump has also said that he “wouldn’t want to be in a foxhole” with McCain, who spent five years in captivity after being shot down in Vietnam. The president avoided serving in the Vietnam War with multiple draft deferments. He once joked that his sex life was his “own personal Vietnam.”But the irony of this weekend’s tribute extends far beyond the president’s feud with McCain. In his federal budget proposal released last month, Trump proposed cutting services that many vets rely on, including Meals on Wheels, affordable housing, and a key interagency council on homelessness. He also received widespread criticism after attacking the parents of a slain U.S. soldier."
7,IMPACT,Electricity Is The Gift That Can Keep On Giving In Africa,"Llewellyn King, ContributorJournalist, broadcaster, public speaker",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/electricity-is-the-gift-that-can-keep-on-giving-in_us_58e90d75e4b00dd8e016ec59,"When a village is electrified, good things flow.",2017-04-08,"<p>South Africa - August 24, 2014: African woman with child collecting water from the river on the road leading to local Game Reserve.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e90d8e1500002500c7ea75.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"He is generic Africa Man. You can see him everywhere, walking barefoot across the Savannah and desert landscapes. He is on a mission that gets harder as time goes on.His mission is to find enough wood — a few dry sticks here, some roots there — to make a fire for a hot meal and to bathe. He walks and walks, adding a stick and a piece of scrub wood to the bundle carried, in the traditional way, on his head.Generic Africa Woman is busy, too. Her mission is to draw water. She carries a container on her head, filled with water from a distant well, to make dinner — a meal of maize (corn) porridge with maybe a stew of some meat or even caterpillar — and to bathe.African life is picturesque, but it is not pretty. Hardship is in daily attendance in much of Africa, blighted from deforestation and polluted water.Yet Western aid has not been easily delivered. Much of it has been stolen, some of it has been misapplied and some of it has led to aid dependency.So, as an old Africa hand (I was born in what is now Zimbabwe, and left when I was 20 years old), I was elated to learn of a new and critical partnership just announced between the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and the U.S. Department of State’s Power Africa initiative. Electricity anywhere is the gift that gives and gives, but especially when it begins to transform lives of hard struggle to ones that are less so.When I was a boy, the opening of a power station or the building of a power line were events that brought forth celebration. Electricity signaled a better tomorrow.When a village — whether it is in Bolivia, India or Uganda — is electrified, good things flow. A simple hotplate replaces days of firewood collection and those who can read can do so after the sun sets: hygiene improves, education is facilitated and expectations soar.When the shantytowns that surround Johannesburg, South Africa, were electrified, the productivity of workers who flood into the city every day went up. Simply, they were saved from the drudgery of collecting animal droppings, wood scraps and other combustible stuff to burn.The colonizers of Africa realized the need for electricity. Hence, in my part of the continent, two great dams were built on the Zambezi River: the Kariba, between Zimbabwe and Zambia, and the Cahora Bassa in Mozambique.As a very young reporter, I covered the construction of the Kariba Dam, and its near destruction by unusually heavy flooding, in 1957. It has been the backbone of electricity supply for Zimbabwe and Zambia for more than 50 years.But in recent years the dam, holding back the world’s largest, man-made impoundment of water, has begun to show deterioration in the concave wall, but especially behind the wall. The outflow has been eroding the plunge pool and threatening the wall. Hundreds of millions of dollars have had to be raised internationally for remediation, which is yet to begin in earnest. If the dam should fail, about 4 million people would die downstream.The dam also has been producing much less electricity than it had been previously due to multi-year drought in the region. Copper production in Zambia, a vital industry, has had to be curtailed because of severe electric shortages. Blackouts are routine throughout the region.Electricity is also a problem in South Africa, the industrial and commercial giant of Africa. Delay in ordering new generation, political interference in the decision processes and other problems, stemming from the end of apartheid, have damaged the system. Blackouts are affecting South Africa’s competitive posture.Now the government is being romanced by Russia, hoping to sell it a new nuclear plant on favorable terms. It would join the two-unit, 1,860-MW Koeberg Nuclear Power Station, which has been operating since 1984. Unfortunately emerging countries have a fascination with big, showy projects, like the national airlines and steel mills that have cost them so dearly in their post-colonial phase.EEI and the State Department need to guide the countries of Africa to today’s energy solutions, not yesterday’s. Africa needs to turn to its most abundant resource: sunshine. In North Africa, Morocco is building the world’s largest solar installation. Way to go."

April 6.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e9026916000020004d976e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. President Donald Trump claims the objective of his cruise missile strike on Syria is to deter Syrian President Bashar Assad from using chemical weapons again. But six years into Syria’s brutal civil war, Trump does not have the luxury of defining his objective that narrowly. Whether he likes it or not, he will be judged by his intervention’s impact on the trajectory of this war. And there, his action has no path to success.By now, it is clear that the missile strike has not impeded Assad from using his air force to strike rebel strongholds. In fact, Syrian warplanes reportedly carried out strikes yesterday against rebels near the city of Homs — taking off from the very air base hit by U.S. missiles. Trump even gave Assad advanced notice via Russian President Vladimir Putin, which enabled the Syrian dictator to move his troops and bunker his planes. Moreover, Trump left one of the airstrips at the targeted base untouched, which is why Assad could quickly use the base to launch further attacks.Very soon, Trump will face the first reactions to his strike. Both Assad and Putin are likely to intensify their assault on the rebel strongholds and the civilians living in those areas. The end result will be a more intensified civil war with more civilian casualties and even greater difficulty for diplomatic efforts to bear fruit. This will create two opposite pressures ― pressure to de-escalate as a result of confusion over what the U.S. is trying to achieve and pressure to escalate in order to save face and achieve a defensible result before any de-escalation takes place.The de-escalation option will reveal the significant limitations to Trump’s new-won sympathy for the plight of the Syrian people, as well as to his commitment to prolonged military operations. If he chooses escalation, on the other hand, he risks a wider regional war, including potential confrontation with Russia. The dynamics of this particularly complicated conflict will make Trump lose control of the course of events. Furthermore, the type of military operation that could potentially steer developments in Syria is so sizable that both Congress and the American public would vehemently oppose it, as they did in 2013.Whichever path Trump chooses, success is unlikely.But what if Trump had the political maneuverability to get away with the narrow objective of simply deterring Assad from gassing his own people? Couldn’t the cruise missile strike be successful?Even in that hypothetical scenario, the odds are against Trump because it won’t entirely remove the use of chemical weapons from the Syrian theater. After all, the so-called Islamic State has reportedly used chemical weapons in Syria and Iraq more than 52 times. Nor will it stop Assad from killing thousands of his own people using conventional weapons. The pictures may be less alarming, but the carnage will continue, making Trump’s action difficult to defend.At that point, the very same people cheering Trump’s intervention will turn against him, feeling betrayed and let down. In their view, Trump will have left the job unfinished. The impulse that “something must be done” to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Syria is correct. But when that “something” can only mean military measures, the U.S. makes itself part of the problem rather than the solution.It is profoundly hypocritical of Trump to launch missile strikes to protect Syrian children when he himself has prevented those same children from finding refuge in America. During his election campaign, Trump callously stated that he could “look in [Syrian refugee children’s] faces and say ‘You can’t come.’ I’ll look them in the face.”Helping ensure that children and civilians aren’t trapped in Syria should be the first and most obvious thing the U.S. can do to help. Second, a far more robust dedication toward finding a diplomatic solution is needed, although such a solution is now more difficult to achieve. Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry should be commended for his efforts to broker a Syrian deal. I describe in my forthcoming book on the Iran deal negotiations that Kerry, together with former President Barack Obama, provided a key ingredient for the success of those talks: a near unprecedented degree of political will and commitment toward making the negotiations succeed. Diplomacy over Iran’s nuclear program had been taking place on and off for more than a decade. But those negotiations were profoundly flawed. And even when they became more appropriately structured and realistic, they often faltered due to insufficient political will from one or both sides. The readiness to expend the necessary political capital and pay the domestic political price to achieve a deal was simply missing. Diplomacy had to succeed on the cheap.But complex international disputes such as the stand-off over the Iranian nuclear program or the Syrian civil war cannot be resolved on the cheap. Trump launching strikes before trying diplomacy gives little hope that he has the political will to truly resolve the conflict."
9,QUEER VOICES,A Second Chance: How An Educator Helped My Trans Son Find His Greatness,"Marsha Aizumi, ContributorAuthor, 'Two Spirits, One Heart'; PFLAG National Board Member",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-second-chance_us_58e92e61e4b06f8c18beec6f,"""I write this story to thank all the educators who may never know the impact their words and decisions may have on the life of a student.""",2017-04-08,<p>Marsha and Superintendent David Vannasdall 2017</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e92fc52c00002600ff300b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recently I had the opportunity to thank someone who I believe changed the course of my child’s future. I didn’t realize it completely, until the moment when Dr. David Vannasdall walked into the room and tears began to roll down my face. He is the superintendent of a local school district and we had been brought together to film Diane Sawyer’s 20/20 Special following up on Caitlin Jenner’s story and talking about transgender issues.But let me begin at the beginning . . . .Ten years ago, my daughter announced to me, “I am not going back to school.” I was devastated, because she was a senior in high school and had 6 months to graduate. My position at the time was a director of educational programs for a dropout recovery charter school. And here I was faced with a child who was ready to drop out.Unbeknownst to me, my child had been bullied and harassed, since she had come out as a lesbian two years prior. When I asked years later, why she didn’t confide in me she said, “I was already a target and I was afraid that if I told you, you would go down to the school, kick down the principal’s door and demand that the school do something.” She didn’t want others to think she needed her mom to fight her battles. But, now diagnosed agoraphobic (viewing the world as unsafe) with panic attacks, she had withstood all she could. There was no more.With this announcement, I did what every concerned mother would do. I marched down to the principal’s office and DIDN’T kick down the principal’s door but said, “You must help my child.” Since I was not aware of the daily harassment that my child experienced, I concentrated on the agoraphobia and panic attacks. The principal, vice principal and I came up with a plan that would allow her to finish her studies independently, but come to school one period a day as an office assistant, a place she felt safe. Thankfully she graduated, but just barely. However, she was not able to experience senior prom, walking at graduation and attend her senior celebration. But she did complete her studies to get her high school diploma and I was so grateful. The principal who helped her graduate was Dr. Vannasdall.The next two years were fraught with challenges, depression and thoughts of suicide for my child. As a mother, I couldn’t figure out how to help her. Then my daughter came out a second time announcing, she wasn’t really a lesbian, she was a transgender individual who has always been my son. I didn’t know what all of this meant, but I knew if I didn’t get it right, I would lose my child. We took the next year to transition my son.It took Aiden 9 years to get his bachelor’s degree. In those 9 years, he changed from a scared, depressed and withdrawn young person to a confident, outgoing, happy young man. He is now in graduate school, pursuing his master’s degree in education. Last month, he was chosen as one of the 125 most influential individuals from the University of La Verne for their 125 year anniversary gala. Married, working in charter school education and an activist in the LGBTQ community, today Aiden sees a future for himself of love and contribution.And so when Dr. David Vannasdall walked into the room, all of these memories flashed before my eyes, and I knew that one person who believed and supported my child over a decade ago gave Aiden hope that somehow he could make it in the world. I never thanked that man so many years ago, but between tears in my eyes and gratitude in my heart, I got the opportunity to thank him then.I write this story to thank all the educators who may never know the impact their words and decisions may have on the life of a student. What you have said and done may change the course of their lives. Perhaps you have created one less challenge for the student to overcome, like Aiden obtaining his high school diploma. Or maybe you sent a message that this young person is important by taking the time to find a unique solution. I believe one person listening and caring has the potential to place hope in a student’s heart, and because of that hope they can find their way. For any educator who has taken the time to show lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender students they are seen and valued, I am so grateful for you. And I hope that one day you will know the ripple effect of your actions, just like Superintendent Vannasdall learned that his belief in my son created a path for Aiden to find his greatness . . . .Note: The Diane Sawyer 20/20 Special on Caitlin Jenner and transgender issues will air on April 21st at 10:00pm PST on ABC."

The creative team meets every year after one season ends,2017-04-08,<p>Dar Adal and Elizabeth Keane in a brief moment of detente.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e82efa2c00002600ff2f2a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Showtime’s Homeland wraps up its sixth season Sunday and as usual, the wrapping will have some loose ends hanging out. “I think it’s very fair to say everything won’t be resolved,” says executive producer Lesli Linka Glatter, who directed Sunday’s 9 p.m. ET episode. Truth is, there’s no reason a TV show should get to neatly tie up issues whose real-life incarnations often grow murkier by the day. One of the central themes on Homeland this year has been a high-stakes, at times lethal rift between President-Elect Elizabeth Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) and Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham), director of the country’s most important intelligence agency, the CIA. “A rift between the chief executive and the intelligence community,” says Glatter. “Crazy, right?”To enhance his side’s chances, Dar Adal has been quietly collaborating with Brett O’Keefe (Jake Weber), host of a popular conservative television talk show, to systematically make up or distort news in ways that discredit the president-elect. The fake news operation isn’t two fanatics with a laptop. It’s a massive hi-tech room, bigger than most legitimate newsrooms, filled with trained operatives who send their product around the world through the most sophisticated media channels. “The fake news storyline was in place long before we started hearing about things like ‘alternative facts’,” says Glatter. “When we first looked at the set for our‘fake newsroom,’ we were afraid we had gone too far, that we were into Parallax View territory. “Now we know we didn’t go too far at all. We were accurate in a way that, personally, I’m not sure I’m thrilled about.”Homeland’s storylines, which largely follow the path of former CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes), have always danced with real-life events, and that’s not accidental.Creator Alex Gansa and his team meet every year with intelligence officials and other plugged-in people to gauge what might be timely topics from that world. The goal isn’t to imitate life, Gansa has often said, but tapping into current issues has given the show’s storylines some eerie parallels to real life. This season has had an additional connection to America because after several years abroad, it’s set in New York. “We thought it was time to come back to America,” says Glatter. “New York was Ground Zero for the largest terrorist attack on American soil, and the repercussions of 9/11 are something we live out all the time.” Carrie referenced 9/11 at the beginning of the series, when she told her fellow agent, friend and mentor Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin) that she must have missed something before 9/11 and she couldn’t let it happen again. Since then, however, Carrie has gradually begun to wonder if our government’s post-9/11 response has been the right move. “We’re looking at both the reaction to 9/11 and the overreaction,” Glatter says. “We have to be vigilant, of course. But since 9/11 there have been 95 deaths in this country from terrorism, and most of those have been homegrown. At the same time, we have 35,000 deaths a year from gun violence. “Yet we spent billions on counterterrorism. It’s become an industry. So we’re trying to look at both sides. At its best, that’s what Homeland does.”So even though Dar Adal has done reprehensible things this season, like separating Carrie from her daughter, Glatter says the show isn’t framing him as a one-dimensional agent of evil. “Dar is committed to keeping America safe,” says Glatter. “And he believes the incoming president will not do that. He feels he’s doing what’s appropriate and right.”For that matter, she says, so does Brett O’Keefe, the crowd-inciting talk show host. “He loves America and he feels he’s doing what’s best,” she says. “Whether or not we agree with him.”Most of Homeland was already in place when the real-life election was held last fall, and Glatter acknowledges that the outcome was surprising enough that parts of the show were “recalibrated.” That included moving O’Keefe forward a couple of episodes. It did not include changing much about President-Elect Keane.“Fortunately, we had already chosen not to make her anything like Hillary Clinton,” says Glatter. Also unaffected by the election, but timely in terms of the current conversation, Homeland focused heavily this year on Peter Quinn (Rupert Friend), an operative and friend of Carrie’s who suffered a stroke last season. He walks with a limp and sometimes has trouble with words. He’s sometimes angry. He has also shown relentless determination and uncovered some of the season’s most critical secrets. “Rupert has done an incredible job,” says Glatter. “And he’s gotten so much positive response from veterans’ groups and stroke victims.”It wouldn’t be surprising if Emmy voters followed suit. Homeland has already been renewed for two more seasons, its seventh and eighth, which Gansa says will be its last. Glatter says Gansa hasn’t yet outlined his plans for those seasons. The creative team meets every year after one season ends, she says, and starts assembling the pieces for the next.Gansa said at the start of this season that he wouldn’t mind keeping the show in New York for the last two years, but there’s been no further indication that will or won’t happen.Meanwhile, Glatter says she directed Sunday’s episode “mostly in the moment for what’s happening in the show now, but with a little eye to what could happen next season.”She says her purely personal sense is that “there are still things to unravel” before everyone starts moving toward the end.Which, if Homeland history is any indication, will not finish the game."

At the tender age of nine, I was diagnosed with a rare heart condition. Less than two years later, I became the recipient of a heart and kidney transplant ― all before my twelfth birthday. You would think that this medical saga would end there, right? It hasn’t. At twenty-six-years old, I have become a cancer survivor and I’m now a wheelchair user.I’ve survived a great deal which has motivated me to champion for the rights of people with disabilities. Like most people, becoming disabled wasn’t on my list of plans, but it’s one club you don’t have to be born into to join. If you’re lucky enough to live to old age, you will likely develop a disability. That’s why health care reform and disability rights should matter to all of us, because it could be you one day. If it wasn’t for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), I wouldn’t be here today. The ACA permitted me to stay on my father’s insurance until age twenty-six, and subsequently receive cancer treatment at Johns Hopkins.Naturally, I was thrilled to hear that the effort to repeal the ACA failed. Prior to the ACA, I spent much of college frightened that I’d be kicked off my parent’s health care plan — the insurance company made several attempts to do so. Then the ACA was passed and my fears were put to rest. I was lucky enough to visit the White House and thank President Obama in person for saving my life through the ACA. After the election, I became terrified that the ACA would be repealed.The proposed ACA repeal legislation meant that millions would lose their health care. I felt hopeless, but not helpless. I still had faith in lawmakers to do the right thing to protect us. Congressman Steny Hoyer is one of those leaders. As my representative, he’s spent fifty years in public office fighting for the little guys like me. In January, we spoke at a “Save the ACA” rally at Bowie State University. He spoke about his decades long work to pass influential legislation like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and reminded attendees that disabled Americas would be harmed by a repeal.I shared my experiences and the stories of my fellow women with disabilities that benefit from the ACA, Medicaid and services provided by Planned Parenthood Metro Washington. I was beyond nervous. My palms were sweating and my hands were trembling. Rep. Hoyer then reached out and helped me out of my wheelchair and to the podium to speak my truth. For me, the ACA goes beyond health care. This law improves more than individual health ― it expands opportunity. The ACA freed me from the constant worry of being kicked off my health insurance. As a result, I graduated from college and started a career of my own which is an obstacle in it of itself for the disabled.According to research released by the GradNation campaign, “75 percent of students with a disability believe they will continue from high school to postsecondary school, while only about 60 percent of parents expected their disabled child to do so.” So, attending college is often just a dream for disabled students that rarely comes to fruition. Sadly, the disability unemployment rate is 10.7% as many of us struggle to enter the workforce. The ACA changed that because access to health care means a pathway to education and employment for the disabled.Humbled by this opportunity to share my story, I stepped down from the stage feeling motivated. I thought it would be the last time I’d interact with Rep Hoyer. Luckily, I was wrong. He surprised me with a phone call inviting me to attend President Trump’s Joint Address to Congress as his guest. We talked about what my attendance symbolized. I, along with other attendees, represented the faces of America and the lives in the balance if health care reform was repealed. He met with me in his Capitol office, I was only expecting a handshake and perhaps a selfie, but he had something different mind.We had a heart to heart about what lay on the horizon for disabled people under a Trump presidency. The outlook seemed grim but we remain optimistic because we could hear the loud roar of the American people championing for progression and not regression. Women and men joined together for numerous nationwide demonstrations. They demanded an end to threats to defund Planned Parenthood and took to town halls to remind Congress that they work for us the American people, and what’s in our best interest is affordable health care.As we left to attend the President’s address, he told me about his fifty years in office and running for office in his twenties. He reminded me that even the youngest person can effect change. Politics has the power to fuel revolutions that can liberate even the most marginalized people. We went our separate ways as he sat on the House Floor and I was sat in the balcony gallery. I was joined by remarkable veterans who fought for their country only to return with crippling disabilities and Muslim-Americans impacted by the President’s discriminatory immigration ban. The beauty of America is its diversity, which much of the President’s address seemed to focus on limiting. Trump’s words spoke to moving forward with initiatives that would further divide the United States by race, class, gender, religion and, quite frankly, limits to our freedom. After Trump closed his address, I left the Capitol in wheelchair paratransit and wept the entire 1 hour drive home. I was scared for the future of my country but inspired by Mr. Hoyer’s words reminding me that we cannot give up or give in. He was right. The results speak for itself. Trump and proponents of the new health care bill failed in their attempt to repeal the ACA, but they have pledged to not give up in their attempts to repeal the health care law. All of this was thanks to the spirit of the American people that made their voices heard across the country. The wellbeing and humanity of our fellow citizens were protected. The resistance is not over and this will not be the last time we see the foundation of Capitol Hill for the greater good of the country.We are America, the beautiful. The strong and the resistance.

At the tender age of nine, I was diagnosed with a rare heart condition. Less than two years later, I became the recipient of a heart and kidney transplant ― all before my twelfth birthday. You would think that this medical saga would end there, right? It hasn’t. At twenty-six-years old, I have become a cancer survivor and I’m now a wheelchair user.I’ve survived a great deal which has motivated me to champion for the rights of people with disabilities. Like most people, becoming disabled wasn’t on my list of plans, but it’s one club you don’t have to be born into to join. If you’re lucky enough to live to old age, you will likely develop a disability. That’s why health care reform and disability rights should matter to all of us, because it could be you one day. If it wasn’t for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), I wouldn’t be here today. The ACA permitted me to stay on my father’s insurance until age twenty-six, and subsequently receive cancer treatment at Johns Hopkins.Naturally, I was thrilled to hear that the effort to repeal the ACA failed. Prior to the ACA, I spent much of college frightened that I’d be kicked off my parent’s health care plan — the insurance company made several attempts to do so. Then the ACA was passed and my fears were put to rest. I was lucky enough to visit the White House and thank President Obama in person for saving my life through the ACA.

14,BLACK VOICES,"Dr. King Died Fighting For Economic Justice. Nearly Half A Century Later, We Continue His Fight.","Genevieve Sneed, ContributorHome care worker and Fight for $15 activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dr-king-died-fighting-for-economic-justice_us_58e8f60ae4b058f0a02f9c0d,"For more than 40 years, I’ve worked as a home care worker. Yet I’ve never been paid more than $9 an hour.",2017-04-08,"Women take part in a National Day of Action 15 dollar per hour minimum wage protest at the Massachusetts State House in Boston on Nov. 29, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e8f7181500002000c7ea53.jpeg?cache=mCneTKJ6hi&ops=crop_7_30_3668_1883%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. came to Memphis. He marched in solidarity with Black sanitation workers striking for higher pay and union rights to build a better future for their families and generations to come. They were part of Dr. King’s Poor People’s Campaign, fighting for economic justice for poor Americans of all backgrounds. But that day is forever remembered as the day Dr. King was tragically murdered by a white supremacist at the Lorraine Motel.Forty-nine years later, the barriers to economic and racial justice — which Dr. King fought so hard to break down — remain firmly entrenched. More than half of Black workers in America are still paid less than $15/hour. And Black women like me make only 63 percent as much as white men. That’s why I marched through the streets of Memphis on Tuesday to honor Dr. King’s memory and carry on his fight with thousands of workers in the Fight for $15 and the Movement for Black lives.I’m 62 years old and I’ve never participated in a protest before. For more than 40 years, I’ve worked as a home care worker here in Memphis—helping seniors and people with disabilities with their daily needs, from bathing, cleaning, using the bathroom,and cooking, to administering medication and wound care. I started by caring full-time for my brother, who has a severe disability, after my mother passed away. I’ve devoted my life to caring for others, and my job is skilled—it requires patience, compassion, and training. Yet I’ve never been paid more than $9 an hour.Ninety percent of home care workers are women, and predominantly women of color. While people of color make up one-fourth of the total U.S. workforce, we comprise over half of the home care workforce. So it’s no coincidence that home care workers are also some of the lowest paid workers. There is no better example of a workforce that has been systematically oppressed under a legacy of racism, sexism, and economic injustice than home care. Due to our nation’s rapidly aging population, home care is one of the most in-demand, fastest-growing professions in the country. Yet home care workers are paid an average annual salary of $13,300—and over half of us must rely on some form of public assistance.Discrimination against women of color in the workplace is deeply ingrained in America, from our culture to our legal code. Until 2015, for example, home care workers were deliberately excluded from the Fair Labor Standards Act that ensures protections like minimum wage and overtime. Yes, you read that correctly: just two years ago, home care workers could legally be paid less than the minimum wage and work countless hours without being paid for overtime.Economic injustice is not only hugely damaging to people of color—it’s damaging to entire communities. Low pay for home care work discourages people from going into an essential and in-demand profession. The shortage of home care workersprevents many seniors and people with disabilities from getting the care they need, forcing Tennesseans into costly nursing homes before they’re ready ― and increasing costs for taxpayers, who wind up footing the bill. This is why I joined together with other workers of color in the Fight for $15 movement two years ago. We’ve won raises for 22 million Americans—including 10 million who are currently on a path to $15. But millions of workers like me are still not paid enough to support our families.As Dr. King did, we’re fighting for future generations so they don’t have to live in a world in which the color of your skin too often dictates your pay. My children are in the home care workforce. They shouldn’t have to make impossible choices—like whether to pay the electricity bill or buy groceries—like I do. They deserve to be able to care for their own families while caring for others. All workers should—regardless of race or what neighborhood they come from. Dr. King said in 1961 that “the two most dynamic and cohesive liberal forces in the country are the labor movement and the Negro freedom movement. Together, we can be architects of democracy.” Today, I will stand in front of the Lorraine Motel to continue his fight. Like Dr. King, I refuse to be intimidated—and I will never stop fighting the evils of racism and economic injustice that have held back Black and Brown people for too long. We remember this as the day Dr. King was assassinated. Let’s also remember it as the day we keep his fight alive."
15,THE WORLDPOST,At Least 15 Percent Of The World’s Tree Species Are Under Threat Of Extinction,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/global-tree-database_us_58e769cae4b058f0a02e0c39,"More than 60,000 species are currently living. Many of them are in trouble, according to the world's first global trees database.",2017-04-08,Botanic Gardens Conservation International unveiled the first-ever database of all the world's tree species this week. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e8a7cd2c00006268ff2f73.jpeg?cache=zdHSitgRJV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The planet is on the brink of the sixth mass extinction, an epoch that scientists say could see humans wiping out at least 75 percent of the Earth’s species. Much has already been made of humans’ impact on wildlife. Last year, a damning World Wildlife Fund report revealed that people were on track to killing off two-thirds of the world’s vertebrates.But it’s not just birds and bears that are facing extinction due to human activity. Thousands of tree species are under threat as well, according to the first global database of the world’s trees, unveiled this week by Botanic Gardens Conservation International.The UK-based organization, whose members include hundreds of botanical institutions worldwide, said it pulled data from more than 500 published sources to create the online database GlobalTreeSearch, the world’s first “global, authoritative list of tree species.” BGCI, in collaboration with the International Union for Conservation of Nature, identified 60,065 tree species currently living on Earth. Of that number, more than half were found to only occur in a single country, which could suggest an increased vulnerability to threats, said the authors of the database.The researchers described their findings in a paper published this week in the Journal of Sustainable Forestry. According to the paper, the conservation status of only about 20,000 tree species, or 30 percent of the world’s trees, are currently known. But of those assessed, almost half ― or 9,600 tree species ― are considered threatened with extinction. This means that around 15 percent of all tree species are under threat.More than 300 species are critically endangered, with just 50 or fewer individual trees left on the planet, the researchers said. One particular species, the Karomia gigas, or Chinese Hats tree, was found to have only one population of trees still living — just six trees in a remote part of Tanzania. The researchers said the tree had been driven to extinction from over harvesting for construction and furniture-making. Deforestation and over exploitation were found to be the leading threats facing the world’s trees, according to the paper. Compiling the database was a massive undertaking, said BCGI. “Although it seems extraordinary that it has taken us until 2017 to publish the first global, authoritative list of tree species, it is worth remembering that GlobalTreeSearch represents a huge scientific effort encompassing the discovery, collection and describing of tens of thousands of plant species,” said Paul Smith, BGCI’s secretary general, in a statement this week. “This is ‘big science’ involving the work of thousands of botanists over a period of centuries.” BCGI said it hopes the database will serve as an important tool for tree conservation. The database ― which lists the geographical distribution of tree species ― could, for instance, help conservationists locate individual species, said Smith. “Getting location information, such as which countries do these trees occur in, gives us key information for conservation purposes. That is hugely useful for us in prioritizing which ones we need to do conservation action on and which ones we need to do assessments to find out what their status is,” he said.―Dominique Mosbergen is a reporter at The Huffington Post covering climate change, extreme weather and extinction.

16,POLITICS,Trump Is About To Find Out Why Obama Avoided Military Intervention In Syria,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-2013-syria-trump-strike_us_58e8f930e4b00de14103d8f4,It's not clear whether the president has a plan to manage the fallout of strikes against the Assad regime.,2017-04-08,"Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in September 2013, after announcing an agreement aimed at eliminating the Assad regime's chemical weapons arsenal.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e8fa7e2c00006268ff2fbe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― On Thursday night, President Donald Trump authorized the military to launch several dozen cruise missiles from the Mediterranean Sea at a Syrian airfield. The strike was meant to punish Syria’s President Bashar Assad for allegedly using chemical weapons to attack his own citizens.It was a dramatic reversal, not only from Trump’s own pledges to limit U.S. involvement in Syria but from his predecessor, who for years resisted growing calls to intervene militarily against the Assad regime. President Barack Obama’s decision to refrain from engagement in 2013 was criticized as feckless at the time and is cited now as one of the reasons that Trump was forced to act. But a revisiting of the arguments and calculations that led Obama to make his decision ― from the fear that it would not be a deterrent to the concerns over how the U.S. would respond to future attacks on civilians ― provides an important blueprint for the major hurdles that Trump will now have to confront. Even if the Assad regime stops using chemical weapons, it will continue to pummel civilians with barrel bombs, predicted Ilan Goldenberg, a former State Department official during the Obama administration. “You’ll see many more pictures of ‘beautiful [Syrian] babies’ [dying] on TV ― specifically to humiliate the United States and show the fecklessness of military action,” he said.“What will the United States do? Will it get drawn in the way it did in Libya where we started with a civilian protection operation and ended up with a regime change operation?” Goldenberg continued. “This is the biggest danger and I think this was Obama’s biggest concern.”The Obama administration resisted getting pulled into the Syrian civil war, which began during the Arab Spring protests in 2011. But in August 2013, a sarin gas attack allegedly carried out by the Assad regime killed 1,400 Syrians. It was a humanitarian catastrophe and a clear challenge to Obama’s self-imposed “red line” against the use of chemical weapons, which he laid out the previous year. At first, Obama appeared poised to respond quickly with limited airstrikes ― a variation of what Trump did on Thursday. Three days after the 2013 chemical weapons attack, the U.S. sent armed warships into the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the military drew up attack plans.But Obama never ordered the military to strike. In the days following the 2013 gas attack, the administration attempted to drum up international and domestic support for a retaliatory response. Obama had hoped for a coordinated response with an ally, but the British Parliament voted down the United Kingdom’s participation. Their vote raised the specter of whether Obama, as well, would allow his government’s legislative branch to have a say. After a 45-minute walk around the South Lawn of the White House with his chief-of-staff, he announced that he would ask for congressional approval ― even as he maintained that he had the authority to order the strike without consulting lawmakers.By that point, however, it was becoming clearer that the American public, still reeling from drawn-out wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and an ill-fated intervention in Libya, opposed the move. Lawmakers said they were inundated with calls from constituents urging them to vote against military action. After weeks of deliberation, it was unclear if Obama could get enough votes from Congress. By the time all the views within the administration had filtered up to Obama, he had heard passionate cases both for and against intervention, said Perry Cammack, a staffer for then-Secretary of State John Kerry, at the time. And then, in what appeared to be an-off-the-cuff rhetorical remark, Kerry told reporters the only way for Assad to avoid military action was to turn over his chemical weapons stockpile to the international community within a week. “But he isn’t about to do it and it can’t be done,” Kerry said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov jumped at the narrow opportunity. Five days later ― Washington and Moscow announced a deal in which Syria would do what Kerry had almost jokingly proposed. Obama called off the military strike. In the years since, even some of Obama’s most strident supporters questioned whether this was the right call. Backing down, they said, damaged U.S. credibility and strengthened Assad’s sense of impunity. But even as the civilian death toll in Syria mounted, Obama maintained that he’d acted prudently. A limited strike would have no practical effect on the Assad regime ― and surviving an attack from the U.S. risked emboldening rather than deterring the dictator, his camp argued. Obama also worried about starting down the slippery slope to deeper involvement in another quagmire in the Middle East.  Whereas Obama has been faulted for overthinking matters to the point of crippling inaction, critics of the current president say his weakness is his apparent lack of interest in planning. “I have no confidence these guys have any plan whatsoever,” Goldenberg said.  Moreover, all of the concerns that made the Obama administration second-guess military action in Syria are still relevant today. If anything, the situation there is messier now than in 2013. The Islamic State militant group controls parts of Syria and Iraq. The U.S. air war against the group depends, in large part on Syria staying out of the way. Meanwhile, Russia has entered the Syrian civil war as a staunch defender of the Assad regime, providing air support to the embattled dictator. The crowded airspace is managed by a fragile deconfliction pact between the U.S. and Russia. Trump seemed to recognize these complications too ― both during the 2013 debate when he strongly advised the U.S. not to engage in Syria and the presidential campaign when he warned that involvement would precipitate World War III. But in a span of a news cycle, his tune changed this week.  During his daily intelligence briefing on the day of the attack, he asked for military options, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters. Two days later, he had settled on an option and ordered the military to move forward. His administration notified foreign allies and congressional leadership after the missiles were launched, minutes before they hit their targets.  The haste with which Trump acted stands in contrast to the weeks of deliberation culminating in a decision not to strike in 2013. Cammack, the former Kerry staffer, described it as “a reflection of the temperaments of the two presidents.” But it also allowed Trump to avoid a pitfall that ensnared his predecessor. By moving swiftly, the president earned plaudits from lawmakers and pundits ― some of whom swooned over the images that the military had released of the damage to the Syrian airfield. Even those who have accused Trump of being unhinged in the past praised the strikes as a decisive and proportionate response to Assad’s use of chemical weapons. That might be because the U.S. was already regularly dropping bombs in Syria against ISIS, making the public somewhat desensitized to further military action there. But it also could be because by skipping the deliberative process that the Obama administration so meticulously engaged in, the Trump administration didn’t give the public time to sour on the idea.  And yet, the speed with which Trump flipped positions and ordered military action based on his newfound distaste for the Assad regime risks doing exactly what Obama feared in 2013: sparking a series of unforeseen consequences. It is unclear whether the strikes will have any meaningful impact on the Assad regime. Hours after the U.S. attack, Reuters reported that Syrian warplanes took off from the base hit by American cruise missiles. On Friday and Saturday, Khan Sheikhoun, the opposition-held site of the chemical weapons attack earlier in the week, was hit by more airstrikes.  “I’m worried about whether they did enough of their homework given how quickly decisions were made,” said Eric Pelofsky, a former National Security Council official in the Obama administration. “ What happens if the Assad regime targets our aircraft as they are continuing to prosecute the war on ISIS inside Syrian airspace? Are we prepared to take down their air defenses ― and for the consequences of doing that?” continued Pelofsky, who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Even some who criticized Obama’s inaction worried that Trump’s impulsive decision-making process could backfire. “Horrible as the Khan Sheikhoun attack was, the Assad government has used chemical weapons dozens and dozens of times, and has committed numerous other war crimes,” Kori Schake, a former Bush administration official, wrote Friday. “The indiscipline that has characterized the Trump’s actions may lead him to emotional reactions without corresponding strategy.”S.V.

17,HEALTHY LIVING,10 Fundamental Truths That Will Change Your Life,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-fundamental-truths-that-will-change-your-life_us_58dc0459e4b07f61a2bb8ae0,Many of life’s essential truths need repeating.,2017-04-08,<p>You can achieve amazing things if you stay focused on the right things. Dr. Travis Bradberry shares 10 fundamental truths that you don’t want to lose sight of.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dc04941d000014007d1327.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s surprising how easy it is to lose sight of the important things in life. Busy schedules and regular routines have a tendency to put the brain on autopilot.When things aren’t going quite the way you’d like them to, it’s often because you’ve lost focus on what really matters. But focusing on life’s fundamental truths can be difficult, especially when they remind you that you’re heading in the wrong direction.The best things in life don’t come easily, and failing to observe yourself carefully is a sure path to mediocrity. I believe that Socrates said it best:“The unexamined life isn’t worth living.” Socrates’ observation also applies to business. When Eric Schmidt was CEO of Google, he famously said, “We run this company on questions, not answers.”Life and business run on questions, not answers. You should be asking yourself regularly if you’re headed in the right direction.Many of life’s essential truths need repeating. We need reminders that help us to stay focused on them. Keep these truths handy and they’re sure to give you a much-needed boost.1. Great success is often preceded by failure. You will never experience true success until you learn to embrace failure. Your mistakes pave the way for you to succeed by revealing when you’re on the wrong path.The biggest breakthroughs typically come when you’re feeling the most frustrated and the most stuck. It’s this frustration that forces you to think differently, to look outside the box and see the solution that you’ve been missing.Success takes patience and the ability to maintain a good attitude even while suffering for what you believe in.2. Being busy does not equal being productive. Look at everyone around you. They all seem so busy—running from meeting to meeting and firing off emails. Yet how many of them are really producing, really succeeding at a high level?Success doesn’t come from movement and activity. It comes from focus—from ensuring that your time is used efficiently and productively.You get the same number of hours in the day as everyone else. Use yours wisely. After all, you’re the product of your output, not your effort. Make certain your efforts are dedicated to tasks that get results.3. You’re only as good as those you associate with. You should strive to surround yourself with people who inspire you, people who make you want to be better. And you probably do. But what about the people who drag you down? Why do you allow them to be a part of your life?Anyone who makes you feel worthless, anxious, or uninspired is wasting your time and, quite possibly, making you more like them. Life is too short to associate with people like this. Cut them loose.4. You’re living the life you’ve created. You are not a victim of circumstance. No one can force you to make decisions and take actions that run contrary to your values and aspirations.The circumstances you’re living in today are your own—you created them. Likewise, your future is entirely up to you. If you’re feeling stuck, it’s probably because you’re afraid to take the risks necessary to achieve your goals and live your dreams.When it’s time to take action, remember that it’s always better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb than at the top of one you don’t.5. Fear is the #1 source of regret. When it’s all said and done, you will lament the chances you didn’t take far more than you will your failures. Don’t be afraid to take risks.I often hear people say, “What’s the worst thing that can happen to you? Will it kill you?” Yet, death isn’t the worst thing that can happen to you.The worst thing that can happen to you is allowing yourself to die inside while you’re still alive.6. You don’t have to wait for an apology to forgive. Life goes a lot smoother once you let go of grudges and forgive even those who never said they were sorry. Grudges let negative events from your past ruin today’s happiness. Hate and anger are emotional parasites that destroy your joy in life.The negative emotions that come with holding on to a grudge create a stress response in your body, and holding on to stress can have devastating health consequences. Researchers at Emory University have shown that holding on to stress contributes to high blood pressure and heart disease.When you forgive someone, it doesn’t condone their actions; it simply frees you from being their eternal victim.7. Live in the moment. You can’t reach your full potential until you learn to live your life in the present.No amount of guilt can change the past, and no amount of anxiety can change the future. It’s impossible to be happy if you’re constantly somewhere else, unable to fully embrace the reality (good or bad) of this very moment.To help yourself live in the moment, you must do two things:1) Accept your past. If you don’t make peace with your past, it will never leave you and, in doing so, it will create your future.2) Accept the uncertainty of the future. Worry has no place in the here and now. As Mark Twain once said, “Worrying is like paying a debt you don’t owe.”8. Your self-worth must come from within. When your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from comparing yourself to others, you are no longer the master of your own destiny. When you feel good about something that you’ve done, don’t allow anyone’s opinions or accomplishments to take that away from you.While it’s impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don’t have to compare yourself to others, and you can always take people’s opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what other people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within. Regardless of what people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain—you’re never as good or bad as they say you are.9. Life is short. None of us are guaranteed a tomorrow. Yet, when someone dies unexpectedly it causes us to take stock of our own life: what’s really important, how we spend our time, and how we treat other people.Loss is a raw, visceral reminder of the frailty of life. It shouldn’t be.Remind yourself every morning when you wake up that each day is a gift and you’re bound to make the most of the blessing you’ve been given. The moment you start acting like life is a blessing is the moment it will start acting like one.It shouldn’t be.After all, a great day begins with a great mindset.10. Change is inevitable—embrace it. Only when you embrace change can you find the good in it. You need to have an open mind and open arms if you’re going to recognize, and capitalize on, the opportunities that change creates.You’re bound to fail when you keep doing the same things you always have in the hope that ignoring change will make it go away.After all, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.Life doesn’t stop for anyone. When things are going well, appreciate them and enjoy them, as they are bound to change. If you are always searching for something more, something better, that you think is going to make you happy, you’ll never be present enough to enjoy the great moments before they’re gone.Bringing It All TogetherStaying focused and asking the hard questions can be extremely uncomfortable. But we don’t learn and grow by sticking with what’s comfortable.Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more?

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) took to the Senate floor last month to denounce the previous rule that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued in August.Murkowski called it “bad for Alaska, bad for hunters, bad for our native peoples, bad for America,” and a “direct attack on states’ rights.”In Sullivan’s argument, the lawmaker said the change was for Alaskans “who value hunting as a deep part of their culture.” The Humane Society of the United States condemned the rollback.

The core mission of UNFPA is to ensure that marginalized women get adequate access to maternal health care so that they can deliver healthy babies in a dignified way. The U.S. helped found the organization in 1969.If the Trump administration follows through with its plan to pull $76 million from UNFPA, the organization would lose about 7 percent of its budget and be forced to shutter some maternal health clinics and stop offering certain health care services in areas facing humanitarian crises ― something that could put the lives of thousands of women and unborn children at risk. This is particularly of concern in Syria, which is reeling from both a deadly chemical attack earlier this week and a U.S. airstrike that was waged in response to it. “If you look at what’s happened in the past week, in terms of Syrians fleeing from the most horrific and unimaginable violence ― the Syrian situation is not going away. It’s only increasing in scale,” Craven said. “Pregnancy continues even in conflict and natural disaster.”UNFPA, which operates programs in 150 countries, is still in an early stage of assessing which initiatives it will have to axe. But the organization released a number of devastating figures to demonstrate where the cuts will be felt most. Trump slashing UNFPA’s budget would result in about 48,000 pregnant women in Syria losing access to safe deliveries, the group said in a release.The organization supports pregnant women in the country in a variety of ways, including by providing delivery kits containing a plastic sheet, a razor blade, a bar of soap, a rope and string. This is the most “rudimentary” way to ensure a safe delivery, Craven said. UNFPA runs the only maternal health clinic at the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, and Craven said the funding cuts will hurt Syrian women who are “lucky” enough to make it there. About 7,100 babies have been born at the ward without a single maternal death. The cuts will also likely lead to about 50,000 people in Yemen losing access to reproductive health services. Nearly 120 midwives stand to lose their home-based clinics, which could also lead to more women dying in childbirth. Home births play a critical role in remote conflict zones where women can’t access hospitals.“This is, yet again, another attack on sexual and reproductive health and those key services that are really essential,” said Jonathan Rucks, advocacy director of Population Action International, a group that works with UNFPA to champion women’s reproductive rights. “Another attack on women’s health without any regard for the implications for this decision.”Rucks said he found it particularly frustrating that the U.S. State Department didn’t even visit China before deciding to cut funding to UNFPA. “They’ve made this decision without doing any research in country,” Rucks said. “They literally sat at a desk and Googled, and did a desk review and made a determination. They are now moving to defund, which is going to have an incredible impact on humanitarian settings around the world.”The State Department said in a statement to The Huffington Post that there is no evidence that UNFPA directly engages in coercive abortions or involuntary sterilizations in China. But the U.N. group partners with the Chinese government agency responsible for implementing the country’s two-child policy, which the State Department said it considered enough of a reason to defund the group.But UNFPA’s connection doesn’t signify much, Craven said.The National Health and Family Planning Commission in China is the equivalent of a Ministry of Health, she said, adding that it’s standard for any human rights organization operating in China to work with it.“If you look at any group working in China, that’s the entity everyone has to engage with,” Craven said. “It’s no different than what we do in every country where we work.”The UNFPA’s programs in China focus on advancing reproductive rights, so individuals can choose when and how many children to have. In the past, the State Department found no fault in UNFPA’s programs in China. Department members lauded the UNFPA’s efforts in China in 2015, after visiting the country with the U.S. Agency for International Development.“During its recent visit, the U.S. delegation observed the positive impact of UNFPA’s rights-based programming in China,” the organizations said in a statement at the time. “We commend [UNFPA’s] adherence to demonstrating the advantages of a voluntary approach to family planning and were pleased to see ... increased provider emphasis on patient rights, especially with regard to privacy and confidentiality.”Former President George W. Bush also defunded UNFPA between 2002 and 2008. That decision was disappointing at the time, but the world wasn’t facing the number of humanitarian crises that it is now. Also, the Bush administration conducted a two-week visit to China before making that decision and also didn’t find any evidence to suggest that UNFPA knowingly supported or participated in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. “At the end of the day, they both did the same thing,” Rucks said of Bush and Trump. “At least [the Bush] administration sent someone to China. … At least they went.” This article has been updated with comment from the State Department and with more information about how UNFPA works with the Chinese government.

With about 2,000 workers, it churns out 3.5-million pounds of pork each day.

From a plane, the Midwestern fields look like an endless stretch of grids and circles, dotted with barns and farmhouses. But on the ground it’s textured and complicated, as diverse in opinions and experiences and origins as the rest of this vast country.I grew up in Delphi, Ind., a town of 2,800 people about two and a half hours south of Chicago, an hour and a half north of the state capital of Indianapolis. Here, the land is flat, occasionally sloping down into the graceful valleys of the Tippecanoe and Wabash rivers.It’s a place as familiar to me as my own body, or so I thought. I would not be who I am today without this town, its teachers or my family. These are the people who’ve always supported me. Each time I come home — although I was never a good fit for its culture of football and faith — I’m welcomed as warmly as if I’d never left.After the election of Donald Trump, I felt the need to go back, to leave the liberal bubble of my adopted home on the West Coast, and talk with the people I’ve known all my life. In 2008, Obama won the town’s vote. Back then, I felt optimistic that my nearly all-white, conservative town had voted for the country’s first black president. But this year, Trump won the region by a large margin. I wondered whether without knowing it I’d become a stranger in my own land.As I drove into town, the brown-gray look of winter was setting in. Here and there, a few trees still stood vibrant and golden, holding out against the inevitable. Several Donald Trump signs stood out — defiant spots of red, white and blue in the otherwise muted landscape.Inside my grandmother’s house, the green shag carpeting set a warm tone. It’s gone unchanged my whole life. But I was startled to see something that I’d never noticed before. A gun that looked like a Glock sat on a wooden end table, as if it had always been there. I had my young daughter with me, and my own mother — sensing my concern — quickly moved the gun out of reach. When I asked my grandmother about it, she laughed and said it was a BB gun that she uses to shoot at squirrels that bother the birds. But she also told me that her neighbors now openly carried guns. That it scared her.She’s in her 80s, a feisty, blunt-spoken woman. Not easy to scare. She wears her faith openly — a guardian angel pin glinted on her shoulder and carved wooden hands in prayer rested on a table in her living room. But she’s not going to church regularly anymore. One congregation seemed too old. Other services started too early. These days, she mostly goes to church on television.As we talked about the story of the town, she said she had something to show me. By her bedside was a box of yellowed newspapers. My grandfather, Wayne VanSickle, smiled from the front pages. He served four terms as the town’s mayor. She’d saved every clipping from his campaigns. My grandfather died years ago, but the newspapers help her keep his memory alive.Her memories of the town were unrecognizable to me. For forty years, she bagged groceries, stocked shelves and worked in the meat department in one of the grocery stores. She and my grandfather went square-dancing in one of the local nightspots and watched movies in one of the town’s two theaters. She remembered when her husband went door to door, campaigning for votes. Her home videos from the time showed homecoming parades in the courthouse square, hundreds of people celebrating. Her descriptions sounded like a town that I’d never known, but wished I had.She sounded exasperated but resigned about its current state. “There’s nothing for kids, there’s no pride anymore,” she said. “I really don’t know. It really just came a little at a time.”The place that I remember from my childhood in the 1980s had a courthouse square surrounded by small shops that vanished, one by one. It was a silent hollowing out. A woman’s clothing store, where I could twirl in front of the three-paneled mirror in the back. A soda fountain that always smelled deliciously of fresh sawdust, its counter lined with glass candy jars. An appliance store where the owner’s young son hid in the tree out front. All gone.I grew up in the farmlands about five miles from town. My parents, who met in high school, built a house in a forest along a river bend. It was an idyllic place. I woke each morning to a sweeping view of the river. In the summer, the air was humid and thick with the sweet scent of my mother’s zinnias and cockscomb and bleeding hearts. We picked blackberries and hunted mushrooms in the woods and caught fireflies in jars. We canoed down the river and fished in a nearby pond and took family bike rides on country roads. At night, the stars were unlike anything I’ve seen in a city.There was no need to lock the house. The biggest threats were the brazen peacocks who took up residence on our roof, or the raccoons that would get stuck in our woodshed. In the winter, neighbors would show up — unasked and unannounced — to plow open our driveway. I learned to cross country ski in the snowy fields. When ice storms knocked out our electricity, we made pancakes on our wood stove.My mother was an elementary school teacher who stayed home when my sister and I were young. Each December, my father, the town’s postmaster, collected the letters sent to Santa and sat at our kitchen table, writing handwritten responses to each child. On Christmas, I rode with him to deliver packages.I remember the lines of cars leaving the local factories at shift change. The two factories made faucets and furniture. They were located near a stone quarry on the edge of town. In the 1990s, a hog processing plant opened near my school. It was impossible to make it through downtown without smelling and seeing the pigs on their way to the plant, squeezed into semi trucks.For me, trips to town meant a stop by the library, a grand brick building where I made my first childhood friends in story hour. The children’s librarian always knew the right book to suggest. We shopped at the town’s grocery store. We never made it through the aisles without seeing someone we knew. My school was in town. Each morning, I rode the bus, sitting on the cold vinyl seat and watching as the fields and farms flew by. It seemed a long way then, riding in the darkness.In school, I always felt like an awkward fit. In class, I was the girl who always had her hand raised. I was terrible at every sport, the basis of the pecking order of small-town social life. The Future Farmers of America was the biggest school club, but I joined the academic teams and the school paper and loved art class.I left after high school for college in Chicago, and I never planned to move back. I felt stifled by the town, and I wanted a career that wouldn’t be possible there. When I go home now, none of my childhood friends remain. They’ve all left for cities. I often see their parents and my former teachers, but it’s unusual to see someone of my generation. Many of the pig plant workers are immigrants or people who drive in from a nearby city.In the summer of 2003, the faucet factory closed and moved to China. I was an intern at the Indianapolis Star. I’d seen the news come across the AP wire and asked if I could go and write a story. An editor said no, that a news brief would suffice. I mention this not to sound prescient, but to explain how as my town crumbled, as many other towns fell apart, it barely seemed to merit a mention.As the years passed, my parents sounded less and less optimistic about the future. They desperately wanted Delphi to succeed. When I returned for holidays, they showed me volunteer projects they’d worked on. Three of my grandparents remain there, and my parents help to care for them. But my parents also have begun to talk about moving somewhere else or traveling for a few months a year, an extraordinary step for them. The grocery’s selection has dwindled, and my parents are now driving to the state capital every few weeks to grocery shop.In 2009, my parent’s doctor, the local family practitioner, died unexpectedly. Not long after, a story appeared in The New York Times that he’d become a whistleblower about infections he believed were caused by industrial hog farms and that such an infection may have led to his own death. The air now often smells so foul from the hog excrement that my parents have to keep their windows closed.Hundreds of people used to make their living here, doing solid work that provided middle-class jobs, enough for small luxuries and college tuition. Now, as I drive past the old factories, mine is the only car on the road. A barbed wire fence greets passersby. The UAW labor union office, housed in a white building across from the factories, used to advertise meetings and fish fry dinners. Now, it stands empty. Its sign broken, dangling in the wind. Its rusty mailbox overflowing with letters claimed by no one.A container business has since moved into the old faucet factory. Stacks of crates fill the old parking lot. Local news reports cheered when the business moved in, but it offered dozens of jobs, not hundreds.A sign next door, on the abandoned furniture factory, blares “no weapons allowed.” The bleeding here began in earnest in 2008, when 150 workers lost their jobs. By 2013, the factory finally closed its doors and headed to Mexico. Now, large “for-lease” signs advertise the buildings to potential tenants. A banner for a Christmas celebration covers the old shipping and receiving sign, but the wind has unraveled the ties, and it flaps forlornly. Across the street, in view of the factory, a Trump/Pence sign stands defiantly in a large dirt pile. “Make America Great Again.”The town’s main employer is the hog plant. With about 2,000 workers, it churns out 3.5-million pounds of pork each day. Its wages start around $12-an-hour. The plant was running ads for workers when I was there, but I kept hearing that many people would rather commute to other cities for better pay making cars for Subaru or engines for Caterpillar.Shane Evans knows the town’s troubles and its hopes inside and out. At 26, the town’s current mayor has a round face framed by a neatly trimmed beard and a slight Indiana twang. He’s unfailingly polite. He grew up here and left for college and law school. But unlike me, he returned, and he’s dedicated himself to revitalizing the town.I didn’t know Shane when I was growing up. He’s eight years younger. But I realized immediately that we had common ties. My uncle was his wrestling coach. Recently, he had jokingly offered to help my grandma repaint her house. When I asked him about the local schools, he listed off all of the teachers who had retired after the state shifted focus to put greater emphasis on test scores — history, biology, physics, English — we’d had all of the same teachers, all gone now.“I hear quite a bit from the older generation that there aren’t as many kids anymore,” Shane told me.Most young people leave town after high school, he said. He wants to focus on appealing to people in their mid-thirties with children looking for a good place to raise their kids. He hasn’t figured out how to attract them, but he’s trying.Before his election, the town had received a multimillion dollar state and federal grant to revitalize its downtown. When I drove in, I was surprised to see new sidewalks and renovated storefronts. The town’s opera house, abandoned for years, has been restored. A pub, the Brick & Mortar, recently opened, with exposed brick walls and craft beer. A teahouse, run by the former mayor’s wife, serves the lunch crowd in a cozy space decorated with tea pots and folksy art. For the first time in my memory, it looks like things might be turning around.One of the town’s biggest boosters is Jane Miller, a petite woman in her sixties with a warm smile and an exuberant optimism. I spent an afternoon with Jane and her now-husband, who was my high school civics teacher. Jane was born here. She raised her kids in the Chicago suburbs, but she moved back years ago. She told me that she was so grateful the local grocery store was still in business. When her mother began suffering from dementia, the grocer would always call if her mother came in with unusual requests. What are the chances that would happen at Wal-Mart or Costco, she said.Jane suggested that I stop by the opera house for the local production of “A Christmas Carol.” By the time I arrived, theatergoers were spilling into the street. Lights twinkled in the windows of the theater. I thought about how thrilled I would have been to have some place like that when I was growing up. On the stairs, I met Sara Daly Brosman, my high school theater director. She wore an elegant blue and white shawl wrapped around her thin shoulders. Her daughter, Claire, and I had been close friends. Like so many others, Claire had moved away. As I followed Sara through the halls, I recognized many cast members — parents of childhood friends and former teachers. But many of the younger cast members came from nearby cities.Inside the theater, Sara and I sat down among the lines of red and gold chairs. The place had been reborn, but Sara sounded worried. She believed deeply in community theater, but the town had a long way to go. She was reeling from the recent election and what it meant. “What is it that he holds over them? Because they see something I don’t,” she said.As I walked back into the chilly evening, I saw that someone had hung a Trump sign in the window of the nextdoor store front.My grandfather’s memory loomed over my conversations. He’d died when I was in high school, but he’d devoted so much of his life to this place. I felt like I needed to visit his grave, to see a physical reminder of my roots.It had been so long that I couldn’t quite remember where it was. I saw “VanSickle” in letters on a black stone before realizing it belonged to my second-cousin. Another stone, also engraved with “VanSickle” belonged to Jane’s late husband. Then, I saw the gray stone, marked with a World War II veteran sign and engraved with an etching of one of the wooden bird houses that he loved to make. I looked around the cemetery and realized that I knew many of the names, that I’d gone to school with their grandchildren. I wondered if my parent’s generation will be the last to be buried here.It wasn’t the only thing that made me sad about the future of the town — and my connection to it. My favorite teacher, Mrs. Cox — I still call her that — told me the local school system had changed. She’d heard the elementary school had eliminated the librarian position, boxed up most of its library books and thrown some of the boxes away. If her own kids were young, she wouldn’t choose to send them to Delphi’s schools, she said. All four are gone, just like me.I drove home in silence. As I neared the outskirts of town, I saw an overpass for the new highway bypass. Above me, the lights of semi trucks looked like carnival rides in the sky as they pulled off the road, one after another, and lined up to deliver hogs to slaughter.On my last morning, I met another woman who had shaped my life, Teresa Isley, my piano teacher. As a child, I often practiced in her living room as her three young children played around us. Back then, Teresa had nearly forty piano students. A devout Christian, she and her family had left town to be missionaries in Jamaica. When they came back, no one had signed up for lessons. Now, the piano mostly sits silent. She runs a daycare instead. It’s the same at her church. She worries that when she stops playing its piano, there will be no one to take her place.It’s the benefit and the curse of a small town. Each person plays an outsized role. Often, when I call my parents, they are at the opera house, manning the elevator or taking tickets.

From a plane, the Midwestern fields look like an endless stretch of grids and circles, dotted with barns and farmhouses. But on the ground it’s textured and complicated, as diverse in opinions and experiences and origins as the rest of this vast country.I grew up in Delphi, Ind., a town of 2,800 people about two and a half hours south of Chicago, an hour and a half north of the state capital of Indianapolis. Here, the land is flat, occasionally sloping down into the graceful valleys of the Tippecanoe and Wabash rivers.It’s a place as familiar to me as my own body, or so I thought. I would not be who I am today without this town, its teachers or my family. These are the people who’ve always supported me. Each time I come home — although I was never a good fit for its culture of football and faith — I’m welcomed as warmly as if I’d never left.After the election of Donald Trump, I felt the need to go back, to leave the liberal bubble of my adopted home on the West Coast, and talk with the people I’ve known all my life. In 2008, Obama won the town’s vote. Back then, I felt optimistic that my nearly all-white, conservative town had voted for the country’s first black president. But this year, Trump won the region by a large margin. I wondered whether without knowing it I’d become a stranger in my own land.As I drove into town, the brown-gray look of winter was setting in. Here and there, a few trees still stood vibrant and golden, holding out against the inevitable. Several Donald Trump signs stood out — defiant spots of red, white and blue in the otherwise muted landscape.Inside my grandmother’s house, the green shag carpeting set a warm tone. It’s gone unchanged my whole life. But I was startled to see something that I’d never noticed before. A gun that looked like a Glock sat on a wooden end table, as if it had always been there. I had my young daughter with me, and my own mother — sensing my concern — quickly moved the gun out of reach. When I asked my grandmother about it, she laughed and said it was a BB gun that she uses to shoot at squirrels that bother the birds. But she also told me that her neighbors now openly carried guns. That it scared her.She’s in her 80s, a feisty, blunt-spoken woman. Not easy to scare. She wears her faith openly — a guardian angel pin glinted on her shoulder and carved wooden hands in prayer rested on a table in her living room. But she’s not going to church regularly anymore. One congregation seemed too old. Other services started too early. These days, she mostly goes to church on television.As we talked about the story of the town, she said she had something to show me. By her bedside was a box of yellowed newspapers. My grandfather, Wayne VanSickle, smiled from the front pages. He served four terms as the town’s mayor. She’d saved every clipping from his campaigns. My grandfather died years ago, but the newspapers help her keep his memory alive.Her memories of the town were unrecognizable to me. For forty years, she bagged groceries, stocked shelves and worked in the meat department in one of the grocery stores. She and my grandfather went square-dancing in one of the local nightspots and watched movies in one of the town’s two theaters. She remembered when her husband went door to door, campaigning for votes. Her home videos from the time showed homecoming parades in the courthouse square, hundreds of people celebrating. Her descriptions sounded like a town that I’d never known, but wished I had.She sounded exasperated but resigned about its current state. “There’s nothing for kids, there’s no pride anymore,” she said. “I really don’t know. It really just came a little at a time.”The place that I remember from my childhood in the 1980s had a courthouse square surrounded by small shops that vanished, one by one. It was a silent hollowing out. A woman’s clothing store, where I could twirl in front of the three-paneled mirror in the back. A soda fountain that always smelled deliciously of fresh sawdust, its counter lined with glass candy jars. An appliance store where the owner’s young son hid in the tree out front. All gone.I grew up in the farmlands about five miles from town. My parents, who met in high school, built a house in a forest along a river bend. It was an idyllic place. I woke each morning to a sweeping view of the river. In the summer, the air was humid and thick with the sweet scent of my mother’s zinnias and cockscomb and bleeding hearts. We picked blackberries and hunted mushrooms in the woods and caught fireflies in jars. We canoed down the river and fished in a nearby pond and took family bike rides on country roads. At night, the stars were unlike anything I’ve seen in a city.There was no need to lock the house. The biggest threats were the brazen peacocks who took up residence on our roof, or the raccoons that would get stuck in our woodshed. In the winter, neighbors would show up — unasked and unannounced — to plow open our driveway. I learned to cross country ski in the snowy fields. When ice storms knocked out our electricity, we made pancakes on our wood stove.My mother was an elementary school teacher who stayed home when my sister and I were young. Each December, my father, the town’s postmaster, collected the letters sent to Santa and sat at our kitchen table, writing handwritten responses to each child. On Christmas, I rode with him to deliver packages.I remember the lines of cars leaving the local factories at shift change. The two factories made faucets and furniture. They were located near a stone quarry on the edge of town. In the 1990s, a hog processing plant opened near my school. It was impossible to make it through downtown without smelling and seeing the pigs on their way to the plant, squeezed into semi trucks.For me, trips to town meant a stop by the library, a grand brick building where I made my first childhood friends in story hour. The children’s librarian always knew the right book to suggest. We shopped at the town’s grocery store. We never made it through the aisles without seeing someone we knew. My school was in town. Each morning, I rode the bus, sitting on the cold vinyl seat and watching as the fields and farms flew by. It seemed a long way then, riding in the darkness.In school, I always felt like an awkward fit. In class, I was the girl who always had her hand raised. I was terrible at every sport, the basis of the pecking order of small-town social life. The Future Farmers of America was the biggest school club, but I joined the academic teams and the school paper and loved art class.I left after high school for college in Chicago, and I never planned to move back. I felt stifled by the town, and I wanted a career that wouldn’t be possible there. When I go home now, none of my childhood friends remain. They’ve all left for cities. I often see their parents and my former teachers, but it’s unusual to see someone of my generation. Many of the pig plant workers are immigrants or people who drive in from a nearby city.In the summer of 2003, the faucet factory closed and moved to China. I was an intern at the Indianapolis Star. I’d seen the news come across the AP wire and asked if I could go and write a story. An editor said no, that a news brief would suffice. I mention this not to sound prescient, but to explain how as my town crumbled, as many other towns fell apart, it barely seemed to merit a mention.As the years passed, my parents sounded less and less optimistic about the future. They desperately wanted Delphi to succeed. When I returned for holidays, they showed me volunteer projects they’d worked on. Three of my grandparents remain there, and my parents help to care for them. But my parents also have begun to talk about moving somewhere else or traveling for a few months a year, an extraordinary step for them. The grocery’s selection has dwindled, and my parents are now driving to the state capital every few weeks to grocery shop.In 2009, my parent’s doctor, the local family practitioner, died unexpectedly. Not long after, a story appeared in The New York Times that he’d become a whistleblower about infections he believed were caused by industrial hog farms and that such an infection may have led to his own death. The air now often smells so foul from the hog excrement that my parents have to keep their windows closed.Hundreds of people used to make their living here, doing solid work that provided middle-class jobs, enough for small luxuries and college tuition. Now, as I drive past the old factories, mine is the only car on the road. A barbed wire fence greets passersby. The UAW labor union office, housed in a white building across from the factories, used to advertise meetings and fish fry dinners. Now, it stands empty. Its sign broken, dangling in the wind. Its rusty mailbox overflowing with letters claimed by no one.A container business has since moved into the old faucet factory. Stacks of crates fill the old parking lot. Local news reports cheered when the business moved in, but it offered dozens of jobs, not hundreds.A sign next door, on the abandoned furniture factory, blares “no weapons allowed.” The bleeding here began in earnest in 2008, when 150 workers lost their jobs. By 2013, the factory finally closed its doors and headed to Mexico. Now, large “for-lease” signs advertise the buildings to potential tenants. A banner for a Christmas celebration covers the old shipping and receiving sign, but the wind has unraveled the ties, and it flaps forlornly. Across the street, in view of the factory, a Trump/Pence sign stands defiantly in a large dirt pile. “Make America Great Again.”The town’s main employer is the hog plant. With about 2,000 workers, it churns out 3.5-million pounds of pork each day. Its wages start around $12-an-hour. The plant was running ads for workers when I was there, but I kept hearing that many people would rather commute to other cities for better pay making cars for Subaru or engines for Caterpillar.Shane Evans knows the town’s troubles and its hopes inside and out. At 26, the town’s current mayor has a round face framed by a neatly trimmed beard and a slight Indiana twang. He’s unfailingly polite. He grew up here and left for college and law school. But unlike me, he returned, and he’s dedicated himself to revitalizing the town.I didn’t know Shane when I was growing up. He’s eight years younger. But I realized immediately that we had common ties. My uncle was his wrestling coach. Recently, he had jokingly offered to help my grandma repaint her house. When I asked him about the local schools, he listed off all of the teachers who had retired after the state shifted focus to put greater emphasis on test scores — history, biology, physics, English — we’d had all of the same teachers, all gone now.“I hear quite a bit from the older generation that there aren’t as many kids anymore,” Shane told me.Most young people leave town after high school, he said. He wants to focus on appealing to people in their mid-thirties with children looking for a good place to raise their kids. He hasn’t figured out how to attract them, but he’s trying.Before his election, the town had received a multimillion dollar state and federal grant to revitalize its downtown. When I drove in, I was surprised to see new sidewalks and renovated storefronts. The town’s opera house, abandoned for years, has been restored. A pub, the Brick & Mortar, recently opened, with exposed brick walls and craft beer. A teahouse, run by the former mayor’s wife, serves the lunch crowd in a cozy space decorated with tea pots and folksy art. For the first time in my memory, it looks like things might be turning around.One of the town’s biggest boosters is Jane Miller, a petite woman in her sixties with a warm smile and an exuberant optimism. I spent an afternoon with Jane and her now-husband, who was my high school civics teacher. Jane was born here. She raised her kids in the Chicago suburbs, but she moved back years ago. She told me that she was so grateful the local grocery store was still in business. When her mother began suffering from dementia, the grocer would always call if her mother came in with unusual requests. What are the chances that would happen at Wal-Mart or Costco, she said.Jane suggested that I stop by the opera house for the local production of “A Christmas Carol.” By the time I arrived, theatergoers were spilling into the street. Lights twinkled in the windows of the theater. I thought about how thrilled I would have been to have some place like that when I was growing up. On the stairs, I met Sara Daly Brosman, my high school theater director. She wore an elegant blue and white shawl wrapped around her thin shoulders. Her daughter, Claire, and I had been close friends. Like so many others, Claire had moved away. As I followed Sara through the halls, I recognized many cast members — parents of childhood friends and former teachers. But many of the younger cast members came from nearby cities.Inside the theater, Sara and I sat down among the lines of red and gold chairs. The place had been reborn, but Sara sounded worried. She believed deeply in community theater, but the town had a long way to go. She was reeling from the recent election and what it meant. “What is it that he holds over them? Because they see something I don’t,” she said.As I walked back into the chilly evening, I saw that someone had hung a Trump sign in the window of the nextdoor store front.My grandfather’s memory loomed over my conversations. He’d died when I was in high school, but he’d devoted so much of his life to this place. I felt like I needed to visit his grave, to see a physical reminder of my roots.It had been so long that I couldn’t quite remember where it was. I saw “VanSickle” in letters on a black stone before realizing it belonged to my second-cousin. Another stone, also engraved with “VanSickle” belonged to Jane’s late husband. Then, I saw the gray stone, marked with a World War II veteran sign and engraved with an etching of one of the wooden bird houses that he loved to make. I looked around the cemetery and realized that I knew many of the names, that I’d gone to school with their grandchildren. I wondered if my parent’s generation will be the last to be buried here.It wasn’t the only thing that made me sad about the future of the town — and my connection to it. My favorite teacher, Mrs. Cox — I still call her that — told me the local school system had changed. She’d heard the elementary school had eliminated the librarian position, boxed up most of its library books and thrown some of the boxes away. If her own kids were young, she wouldn’t choose to send them to Delphi’s schools, she said. All four are gone, just like me.I drove home in silence. As I neared the outskirts of town, I saw an overpass for the new highway bypass. Above me, the lights of semi trucks looked like carnival rides in the sky as they pulled off the road, one after another, and lined up to deliver hogs to slaughter.On my last morning, I met another woman who had shaped my life, Teresa Isley, my piano teacher. As a child, I often practiced in her living room as her three young children played around us. Back then, Teresa had nearly forty piano students. A devout Christian, she and her family had left town to be missionaries in Jamaica. When they came back, no one had signed up for lessons. Now, the piano mostly sits silent. She runs a daycare instead. It’s the same at her church. She worries that when she stops playing its piano, there will be no one to take her place.It’s the benefit and the curse of a small town. Each person plays an outsized role. Often, when I call my parents, they are at the opera house, manning the elevator or taking tickets. Just before I arrived, my parents had rushed around making props for “A Christmas Carol” and fixing a broken theater seat. When I told the mayor that I thought that was the appealing part of living in a small town, he laughed and suggested that I move back and revitalize the local newspaper. When I told my mom that, she looked serious, shook her head and said, “Don’t move back.”Abbie VanSickle is a reporter for the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley’s Graduate School of Journalism."
23,POLITICS,The Unbearable Whiteness Of Trumpistan Illuminates Half-truths Of 'Racial Realism',"Ben Piven, ContributorDigital Editor & Journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-unbearable-whiteness-of-trumpistan-illuminates_us_58518aa9e4b0320ed05a9a77,"Balancing between demagoguery of white supremacy on right, failures of PC politics If there were ever any illusions during",2016-12-15,"<p>On March 19, 2016, a Trump supporter attends the presidential candidate’s rally in which he addressed immigration issues. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585192e71c000013000eb8c7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Balancing between demagoguery of white supremacy on right, failures of PC politicsIf there were ever any illusions during many months of intense race-baiting, there is no doubt left that the victorious ascent of Donald Trump to the presidency is largely a racial phenomenon. Sure there are other highly important factors behind his electoral success. But the clear and present reality has reared its unsightly head: our nation was never truly post-racial, and many seemingly deracialized areas of society have again become racialized. Rival yet complementary ideological systems that had served to sublimate racial animosities -- political correctness on the liberal left and colorblind meritocracy on the conservative right -- have both been thrown to the curb.Although each made us more comfortable with our identities, PC culture and the myth of race-neutral treatment now seem mere shadows of their former selves.Droves of angry European-descended voters stormed the polls on November 8, seizing back their power from yesteryear and blasting away at any pretense of multiculturalism in favor of white ethnic identity. While not all Trump voters are supporters of separation and supremacy, the result was a resounding defeat of inclusiveness. “America is a white country in terms of its rooted historical identity,” Richard Spencer, director of the National Policy Institute, told Al Jazeera last week. Spencer said the real issue is not building a wall to keep out undocumented immigrants, but preventing profound demographic change due to legal immigration. “This is ours. It’s not yours,” he claimed. “We respect you, but you’re not going to live here.”How do we reconcile such illiberal racialist ideology with the democratic privilege of peddling politics, no matter how intolerant and loathsome? And how do we know if “average” Trump voters back such an ethnocentric approach?‘False gods of political correctness’The prospect of whites eventually becoming a minority not long after an “un-American” half-black president ruled for eight whole years is frightful to the populist, nativist, and paleoconservative right. This was the intellectual foundation of Trumpist racialism, which has heralded the return of a cabinet reminiscent (minus the conspicuous policy inexperience) of the 1950’s -- mostly older white men of corporate and military backgrounds.The new cabinet picks are set to roll back the Obama administration’s progressive actions across a wide spectrum of issues. On the racial front, the early appointees earned the eager and resounding approval of America’s most famous former KKK leader. “Americans are on the way to taking back our government, our nation and our children's future!” exclaimed David Duke on social media. Views espoused by the incoming leadership range from rabidly anti-immigration sentiment to Islamophobic zealotry and staunch opposition to civil rights legislation. “Race realism” is the term often used to describe the ostensibly scientific and ingrained truth of racial politics and has been embraced by the Alt-Right as a way to mobilize the subjective narratives of the white nationalist movement.At the core of their critique is the notion that nonwhite minority groups do not make America better and therefore should live elsewhere. On a moral level this is repugnant, but also on a practical level, the argument is at best absurd. If you want to know the “truth” about Mexicans or Muslims, their positive contributions should be highlighted too. Calling sufficient attention to criminals and terrorists is understandable, but it’s an insult to intelligent Americans to assert that Mexican immigrants disproportionately commit crimes or that there aren’t millions of hard-working Muslims who enrich the economic and social fabric of U.S. society.Trump’s clique was labeled “a group of marauding conservatives who reject both the failures of establishment conservatism and the false gods of political correctness” by James Edwards, a far-right radio commentator. But this characterization simply whitewashes the agenda of promoting one-sided theories, a culture of pointless racial insensitivity, and fear-mongering of the Other. And if we want realism, then let’s just admit that, while not all Trump voters are racist, a significant percentage are. On the one hand, maybe it’s natural to want the best for your racial group and be honest about emerging from behind a traditional conservative colorblind veneer to acknowledge clear preferences. But undergirding allegations about who’s responsible for white under-achievement and victimization are new code words that use “Americanness” and “greatness,” or lack thereof, as proxies for whiteness.Meanwhile, as our first black president gives way to our first billionaire authoritarian, Barack Obama has been clarifying his own identity politics and experiences with racism.“Barack Obama’s victories in 2008 and 2012 were dismissed by some of his critics as merely symbolic,” wrote Ta-Nehisi Coates in his recent essay My President Was Black. “But there is nothing ‘mere’ about symbols.” And to that end, the Hawaii-born multiracial president has offered up candid reflections on the meaning of race.“The concept of race is not just genetic,” Obama said in an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, explaining that race exists in multiple ways. “It’s cultural. This notion of people who look different than the mainstream, suffering terrible oppression but somehow being able to make out of that a music and a language and a faith and a patriotism.” In a rational, liberal, and pragmatic context, the 44th President acknowledges his firm intellectual belief in race being both scientific and societal. In some contexts, this is also referred to as race realism, and is contrasted with his racial idealism from 8 years back.Explicit attention on groups’ relative strengths and weaknesses may not be comfortable ground for most liberals, but plenty of employers in diverse states are placing high value on racial differences -- actually using ethnic identity as a positive discriminatory qualification for jobs. Despite legal and cultural barriers, affirmative action can be refashioned as good for business, whether making certain customers more comfortable or simply because particular demographic groups are better fits for some roles. Equal opportunity believers may be skeptical. However, this sort of functional diversity can transcend the limitations of identity politics by focusing on mutual economic benefits.Negating ‘race denialism’White nationalists most certainly reject the virtues of diversity, even absent the PC parameters. But they have even less interest in so-called race denialists: those who either believe race doesn’t exist at all or scholars who say the key elements of race are socially constructed. Critical race theorists, who fall under the latter category, hold that structural constraints intrinsic to the American legal and economic system prevent individual members of oppressed racial groups from attaining justice. Blacks and Hispanics, among others, face entrenched racism dealing with urban housing, allocation of government benefits, and court rulings. From microaggressions and a lack of safe spaces to police brutality and racial profiling, the Black Lives Matter narrative reflects the same sort of subjectivity that the Alt-Right, at the opposite ideological pole, has now co-opted from liberal identity politics. But of course, white nationalists would be happy to claim the white privilege of walking down the street or into a corner store without being monitored. They also would obviously not be upset with the fact that African-Americans -- across the ever-growing black class and status divides -- disproportionately experience the vagaries of the criminal justice system.One wonders whether the first big racial controversy of the Trump presidency will revolve around some new instance of a young black male being unfairly targeted by the police, with conservatives defending how law enforcement are merely doing their job. Or will a huge conflagration arise with the next major act of Islamic radicalism that threatens to engulf the whole of America's Arab and Muslim populations?The third, quite likely possibility is a fresh iteration of immigration crisis in which a large group of Hispanics is swept up in the fervor over whether we need so many immigrants. Their advocates will ask, “Who else will do those jobs?” And economists will wonder how to attain higher growth without continued immigration -- from raising the retirement age or overnight productivity gains?The debate continues over whether low-skilled immigration does harm to native-born American workers, especially white men, who are increasingly dropping out of the labor force. At the same time, irrespective of the political rhetoric, about two-thirds of Americans have expressed support for permanent legal status of undocumented immigrants already in the country.Race, class, and powerIn the aftermath of a presidential election that trashed conventional wisdom, the fiscal-electoral complex (as measured by the disenfranchisement index topped by blue states) will continue to favor rural, white voters in less populous states. During November, the mirage of populism wafted over America, but the election was a tangible victory for corporate elites and the hardline conservative movement across the board. Yes, there are nonwhite Trump supporters, but explicit and implicit appeals to re-assert white dominance are undeniable. Instead of merely parroting identity politics for white people, will class-based critiques suffice going forward? Bernie Sanders, the populist leftist senator from Vermont who nearly defeated Hillary Clinton on the coattails of white rage, continues to insist that identity politics is not the answer. He recognizes the intersectionality of race, poverty, and injustice. But for him, discarding political correctness means elevating criticism of trade deals that corporations have cherished. Sanders even attributes Trump’s win to this strategy: “I think [Donald] said some outrageous and painful things, but I think people are tired of the same old [PC] rhetoric.”Adam Burgos, a postdoctoral fellow at Bucknell University who studies the politics of race, said that economic and racial experiences are inextricably linked in a complex nexus. “You can’t pull those two apart,” Burgos said. “The cultural changes that have enabled more nonwhite people to make at least a modicum of progress reflect this interdependence.”“White ‘economic anxiety’ is only understandable though the relationship between economics and race.”"

Respondents say by a 9-point margin, 43 percent to 34 percent, that it’s currently politically possible to pass stricter gun laws.Overall, 48 percent would like to see laws covering the sale of handguns made more strict, with 13 percent saying they should be made less restrictive and 29 percent that they should be left unchanged. By a 5-point margin, 43 percent to 38 percent, Americans say that stricter gun control laws and enforcement would do more to prevent shootings than would allowing more private citizens to carry guns for protection. A plurality, 42 percent, say stricter gun control laws would reduce the number of shootings in the United States, while 11 percent think they would increase shootings, and a third that they wouldn’t make much difference.Opinions, however, are sharply divided along partisan lines, with Democrats more than twice as likely as Republicans to think that increased gun control would help to reduce shootings.Democrats say by a 46-point margin, 66 percent to 20 percent, that stricter gun laws would do more to stop shootings than arming more private citizens. Republicans say by a 38-point margin, 61 percent to 23 percent, that allowing more private citizens to carry guns would be more effective. Independents are close to evenly split between the two positions, with 39 percent favoring allowing more people to carry guns for protection, and 36 percent preferring more gun laws and enforcement. There’s also substantial disagreement on how serious an issue gun violence is. Three-quarters of Democrats, but just 42 percent of independents and 37 percent of Republicans, consider gun violence to be a “very serious” problem facing the nation.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 9-12 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

When someone places an order through Sharebite, the app takes a portion of those proceeds and sends it to City Harvest.“The larger the order, the more meals we share,” Mohsin Memon, co-founder and CEO of Sharebite told The Huffington Post. “With an average transaction of $25, we are sharing enough to donate two meals for every order.”For the month of December, the app is upping its do-gooder game and will be donating five meals per order to kick off its “Million Meal Mission,” a campaign in which Sharebite hopes to donate a million meals to New York kids within a year.The app also gives restaurants the option to help curb their food waste by allowing them to promote and sell surplus food or dishes. These promotions are featured at the top of the restaurants’ pages, and can be altered in real time.So, for instance, if a restaurant had a pasta special for the day that didn’t sell as well as the restaurant had anticipated, the eatery could log on to the app and sell that particular pasta dish at a discounted rate before it closes for the day.

We refuse to facilitate mass deportations of people the government believes to be undesirable.”The letter vows to not participate in creating databases of identifying information for the U.S. government on the basis of race, religion or national origin, to minimize the collection or retention of data that could facilitate such targeting and to oppose any misuse of data at their respective organizations considered illegal or unethical.Trump clashed with Silicon Valley on several issues during the campaign, including immigration, government surveillance and encryption, and his victory last month alarmed many companies who feared he might follow through on his pledges.

Democratic firm Public Policy Polling released a poll on Tuesday asking 400 Democrats nationwide whom they would vote for in a 2020 Democratic primary. In October, Morning Consult and Politico fielded a 2020 survey. Ignore these polls. They are utterly meaningless. I’m not even going to give you the links to them.Don’t look at any polls with the year 2020 mentioned. The political actors who will play a part in the next presidential election might not even be on our radar yet. The Trump administration that will change our country over the next four years is still taking shape. Asking Americans whether they would vote for Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Vice President-elect Mike Pence in 2020 doesn’t mean anything for what will ultimately happen in that election. It’s ridiculous to think that Americans would have any clue whom they might vote for in a few years. Even polls two years ahead of the election still have little relevance ― people choose names based more on whether they recognize that person than actual political preferences.Releasing polls on 2020 is also a disservice to the polling field, which is reeling from reputation problems since missing results in several key states in November. Pollsters: Please don’t add to the field’s problems by asking laughably irrelevant questions. Media: Please do not report on 2020 hypotheticals. Don’t encourage the bad behavior.HuffPost Pollster won’t track polls or create charts for 2020 until we are within two years of the election. For the primaries, we’ll begin tracking in January 2018, and for the general election, we’ll start charts in November 2018.It’s not really surprising that PPP would release this poll. After all, it traffics in attention-grabbing but dubious questions. Some of their greatest hits include asking about bombing the fictional kingdom of Agrabah and asking whether Hillary Clinton is the devil. Morning Consult hasn’t typically engaged in this type of question, but putting out a poll for the next election over three years before the first primary certainly fits the bill of trolling America. PPP justifies their poll by claiming it wants the “baseline” for where the race starts. But a baseline is useless if it doesn’t include the relevant candidates: In late 2012, when it polled on the 2016 contest, PPP asked questions about eventual candidates such as Clinton, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie, plus a few other Republicans and Democrats who didn’t end up running, like Andrew Cuomo, Elizabeth Warren and Paul Ryan. Donald Trump wasn’t in the mix, and he’s a big reason Rubio didn’t perform well in the 2016 primaries. More useful polls are asking questions about Trump’s cabinet picks and conflicts of interest. They’re asking what Americans think of key policy proposals that a Trump administration might pursue. These are the questions that provide insight and valuable information right now: We need to know what Americans are willing to put up with in a Trump regime, and what will result in substantial pushback. We need to know the shape of our country as it is now, not which name Americans happen to recognize on a ballot test question. Just because you can ask a poll question doesn’t mean you should."

30,POLITICS,Nothing Can Shake The Faith Of Donald Trump's Top Twitter Fan,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-bill-mitchell_us_58515af4e4b0e411bfd48c63,"“Trump just wins. It’s remarkable,"" Bill Mitchell says.",2016-12-14,“He’s just better at everything!” says online radio host Bill Mitchell of President-elect Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585160c91c000039050eb7e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bill Mitchell has plans ― serious, big-league plans. “I’d love to do a ‘Regis and Kathie’-type show, but for politics,” the executive recruiter-turned-online radio host and vocal Donald Trump supporter said in an interview with The Huffington Post. “Something that brings information and intelligence. You have a good time watching, and you come away feeling a little more encouraged than when you showed up.”For the uninitiated, Mitchell is easily Trump’s most full-throated supporter on Twitter and America’s foremost Kool-Aid connoisseur ― a truly bottomless source of enthusiasm whose unbridled admiration for the president-elect would make Sean Hannity blanch. When Trump says, “Jump,” his supporters might ask, “How high?” Bill Mitchell, on the other hand, replies, “Brilliant!” “This guy has a way of winning,” Mitchell says, with all of the assuredness of a tween utterly convinced of Justin Bieber’s innate goodness despite his run-ins with the law. “Trump just wins. It’s remarkable.” To Mitchell, Trump is the Bobby Fischer of 11-dimensional chess, positioning both himself and his enemies in such a way that some kind of yuge checkmate ultimately results.“Donald Trump is a strategic thinker; most people aren’t,” says Mitchell. “Most people look at the object in front of them, and try to gain meaning from that in and of itself. When you have a strategic thinker, they don’t see that object in front of them. Some of the pieces don’t make sense by themselves. In his mind, he’s got goals for the various pieces.”Over the course of Trump’s presidential campaign, Mitchell went from having a few hundred Twitter followers to over 160,000 as of mid-December 2016. His tweets have been featured on late-night talk shows and he claims he’s been speaking with publishers about writing a book, though he’s not quite certain what shape that might take. “I may put together a coffee table book of some of my best tweets,” Mitchell said. “What was happening when I tweeted this, what I was thinking.”To say that Mitchell was emboldened by Trump’s victory on Nov. 8 would be incorrect. Like many of the president-elect’s most ardent supporters, Mitchell viewed Trump’s election as a foregone conclusion, an outcome as assured as global warming is false. “One of the things I was good at was looking at the polls and seeing the oversamples,” Mitchell says. Indeed, Mitchell’s views on polling are so comically untethered from science you might expect them to have been dreamed up by a guy called “Evil Nate Silver” who is just a clone of Nate Silver with a mustache. Looking ahead, Mitchell doesn’t expect to land an administration job, and though he claims to be happy to remain on the sidelines, it’s clear he is a little stung or ― to use a phrase employed by the president-elect’s supporters on social media ― “butthurt.” “I would be great at that job,” Mitchell said of the role of White House press secretary. “One of the things I’m good at is seeing the pattern in the chaos.” However, Mitchell is quick to add, “I don’t want to work in government.”To Mitchell’s credit, he wouldn’t be a half-bad White House press secretary. His unwavering commitment to the president-elect’s often contradictory actions and statements is unmatched, even by many of Trump’s closest aides, who have a very bad habit of trying to influence their boss in the press. Mitchell possesses a camera-ready face and a Trumpian ability to both dismiss and propagate unfounded conspiracy theories. Take his response to a question about the completely false story about Hillary Clinton running a child sex ring out of a pizza place in northwest Washington, D.C.“I don’t get involved in stuff like Pizzagate. The stuff that is conspiratorial, I don’t get involved in it,” Mitchell insisted, right before commenting that the arrest of a man who entered the restaurant with a loaded weapon was “too convenient by half.”“It feels to me like a setup to take away the legitimacy from the story,” Mitchell said. “Again, that’s more conspiracy, and that’s not my space.” To be clear, Mitchell is by no means a central player in Trumpland, and to call him peripheral might be overly generous. As BuzzFeed’s Charlie Warzel reported in October, Trump’s inner circle has had no contact with the online radio host, though Mitchell occasionally tweets that he has “inside” reads on what Trump’s transition team is up to. Still, Mitchell is more than happy to build upon his current role as shepherd of an ever-increasing flock of eggs and Pepes on Twitter.“In terms of keeping the grassroots pumped up, that’s my job,” he said. “There’d be election night parties with one person on their laptop and everyone asking, ‘What’s Bill Mitchell saying? What’s Bill Mitchell saying?’”“So many Trump supporters were first-time voters, so they were very fragile,” Mitchell continued. “So they would come to my feed to feel better about it. I was like the suicide prevention squad.”And so Bill Mitchell marches on, undeterred by Trump’s shortcomings, contradictions and missteps even as they lead other Trumpists to grow wary. Bill Mitchell has no patience for these people.“Ann Coulter put out a tweet about the establishment, and I’m like, ‘Ann, what are you doing?’” Mitchell recalls. “Listen, we hired Donald Trump for his judgment, for his instincts. He’s not even president yet. Trust his judgment, trust his instincts.” At this pace, Mitchell is fast becoming this decade’s Baghdad Bob ― the nickname given to former Iraqi Information Minister Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf, whose laughably optimistic reports about Saddam Hussein’s crumbling army during the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq remains the “Sgt. Pepper’s” of propaganda dissemination. Of course, Mitchell and Baghdad Bob differ in an important way: Mitchell’s guy won.“He’s just better at everything!” Mitchell exclaimed during the Dec. 8 edition of his program. “I almost feel bad that I’m not keeping up on Twitter with all the awesome stuff that is happening!” Huffington Post reporter Eliot Nelson’s book, The Beltway Bible: A Totally Serious A-Z Guide to Our No-Good, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrible, Depressing and Sometimes Hilarious Government, is out now."
31,POLITICS,Nancy Pelosi: Republicans Are 'Not Going To Repeal' Obamacare,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-obamacare-repeal_us_58507d17e4b092f086861351,She predicted they'll find out it's just too complicated.,2016-12-14,Rep. Nancy Pelosi suspects reality is going stymie the great Obamacare repeal.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585090f0120000dd00eef27c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) argued on Tuesday that Republicans are going to have trouble fulfilling one of their biggest campaign vows ― repealing the Affordable Care Act ― once they take control of the federal government next year. “They’re not going to repeal it,” Pelosi told a small group of reporters in her Capitol Hill office. “I don’t think they’re going to repeal the Affordable Care Act.”That’s not to say they aren’t going to try. Pelosi’s bold prediction is based on the fact that repealing and replacing Obamacare is a gargantuan task. In the end, she argued, Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump may find that they don’t want to repeal it because that would take away benefits people value, and they won’t be able to replace it because that would cost the government money they don’t want to spend.“Everybody, everybody benefits from ACA,” Pelosi said. “There are 127 million Americans with a pre-existing medical condition,” Pelosi explained. “Nearly half of them with a very severe ― really need care regularly ― pre-existing medical condition. For them, are we going to eliminate pre-existing condition provisions of the bill?”Trump has said he plans to keep some elements of President Barack Obama’s signature health care legislation, including no denial of coverage for those with pre-existing medical conditions and the option of covering children under their parents’ plans until they are 26 years old. Other Republicans have also said they want to keep the popular provisions, but Pelosi scoffed at the idea. “You can’t keep them,” she said. “You can’t afford them because the cost would be so astronomical.”The popular benefits of Obamacare that Republicans want to maintain are only financially possible because of the central policy mechanism (the mandate that all must have health care insurance) and the funding system (taxes on the wealthy to pay for subsidies) that Republicans despise. Numerous experts have pointed out that the components of the Affordable Care Act don’t work independently of each other.It’s the cost of an Obamacare replacement, Pelosi said, that may cause some Republican lawmakers to balk at undertaking the repeal at all. “The one thing that I think the Republicans are more interested in ... are costs,” she said. “What is the cost going to be to their constituents in the changes they want to make?”On top of that, there is a split within the GOP over how to go about the repeal process, which Republican leaders have said they will start in January. Party leaders have said it could take up to three years to produce a replacement ― something that’s angered other conservatives who want to make sure the issue is settled before the next election cycle.During her hourlong sit-down with reporters, Pelosi also expressed concern about the future of reproductive health care under Trump. “I think a lot of women who voted for Trump ... they don’t think that Roe v. Wade is at risk, but it is,” Pelosi said. “I’d be very, very afraid, very, very scared about what they might do to family planning. I would be very, very afraid not only of the president, but of the Congress, on that score.”Jonathan Cohn contributed reporting. "

Chris Christie and the local press have a testy relationship.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5851af8c120000ca0beef557.jpeg?cache=x0TPh3mpDt&ops=crop_0_172_1770_957%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) has long had an adversarial relationship with the press.Now, in what newspapers in his state are calling little more than an act of revenge, he’s trying to push through a bill that would cut a substantial portion of their revenue.New Jersey, like every other state, requires governments to post public notices to inform citizens about certain events. These ads ― also called legal notices ― vary from state to state, but typically cover matters like bidding for public contracts, hearings, sales of government property and foreclosures.Historically, public notices have appeared in print newspapers. As of 2000, they made up an average of 5 to 10 percent of newspaper revenues, according to a National Newspaper Association study. And with readership and ad revenue declines in recent years, public notices have remained a comparatively reliable source of income for many papers.But on Monday, the New Jersey legislature, encouraged by Gov. Christie, decided to fast-track a bill that would permit municipalities to cease running public notices in local papers and instead post them on their own websites.In theory, the legislation could save local governments a decent amount of cash. A 2012 Poynter study found that a midsized city spends about $20,000 a year running public notices; a larger city like Syracuse, New York, budgets around $200,000; and a state the size of Maine may spend some $500,000.In reality, the effects of the bill are a bit murkier.For starters, building, maintaining and constantly updating a secure website isn’t exactly cheap. The costs of a city going it alone could very well wipe out any savings.There may not be much benefit to local residents either. Many newspapers already publish the notices on their websites as well as printing them. And not everyone has internet access.“Given the extra personnel and cyber security responsibilities of hosting the ads on a municipal website this will entail, this effort could very well end up costing taxpayers more money, not saving them money,” Miriam Ascarelli, president of the New Jersey Society of Professional Journalists, told The Huffington Post. Ascarelli pointed to a financial estimate from the state’s Office of Legislative Services to back up her concerns. “I suspect small municipalities with limited staff will feel the most strain,” she said.From an accountability perspective, putting a government agency in sole charge of maintaining the transparency of such legal notices is a recipe for trouble.But as the New Jersey Star-Ledger tells it, the bill’s true threat is to a free press.“Statewide, 200 to 300 journalists would lose their jobs, and some papers would no doubt fold,” the paper wrote in a blistering editorial Wednesday. “That’s the evil genius behind this bill. It would wipe out hundreds of watchdogs, and give the worst politicians a new way to fight those left standing.”“This is the work of a bruised governor who is reviled by most citizens of the state,” the editorial warns. “He blames that on the press ― not on the scandals, the lies, and the undeniable failure of his leadership. This is his revenge.”"

Trump and many members of his potential Cabinet are noted climate change deniers, and recent appointments ― like Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson to lead the Department of State ― have led some environmental advocates to allege the government will soon be “of, by and for the oil and gas industry.”Scientists have begun frantically saving data, fearing much of their research could soon vanish. And others worry the incoming administration could retaliate against people working on climate change issues. Jewell, who has led the Interior Department under President Barack Obama since 2013, stressed that science should appeal to the business sense of any sound investor, especially when “we have a president-elect who likes to win.”“We cannot win without good science. If we start speaking in a new language of business, we will start helping this administration understand why this is important,” she said, pointing to the threat rising sea levels pose to American communities. “When you have a president-elect of the United States that has a background in the real estate business, your science matters.”During Obama’s presidency, the U.S. has racked up some significant environmental accomplishments ― establishing the largest ecologically protected area on the planet, creating the Clean Power Plan to limit emissions from power plants and signing the landmark Paris climate accord.Much of that legacy could be dismantled under Trump, but Jewell said she was still hopeful about the future and urged those gathered at the meeting to continue to hold leaders accountable “at every level.”“I am optimistic about your work. I am optimistic that my successor will quickly realize how important this work is,” she said. “I urge you to stay the course and keep up your commitment to the work. Make your voices heard and make them relevant to the people that you’re talking to.”"

Journalist Lidia Curanaj, who currently appears on air for Fox 5 in New York City, says that Ailes sexually harassed her during a job interview in 2011 and refused to hire her at Fox News after she rebuffed his unwelcome advances.The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, claimed that the chauvinistic culture led by Ailes trickled down to WNYW, the local Fox station whose news director allegedly denigrated Curanaj’s looks and ethnic background. The New York Times first reported on Tuesday about Curanaj’s lawsuit alleging she encountered discrimination and a hostile work environment at 21st Century Fox. Multiple women at Fox News, including former host Gretchen Carlson and current star anchor Megyn Kelly, have accused Ailes of workplace harassment.During a private job interview in May 2011, Ailes instructed Curanaj to stand up and turn around so he could “see [her] from behind,” according to the complaint. Though she felt uncomfortable, Curanaj said she twirled for Ailes. The two had first met at a February 2011 dinner that Curanaj attended with former New York state Sen. Gregory Ball, whom she had dated, according to the lawsuit.Sometime after Ailes had commented on Curanaj’s body during the interview, he contacted Ball and asked sexual questions about her, the lawsuit said. Ball indirectly told Ailes that Curanaj would not have sex with him.Soon after, Curanaj alleged that Ailes told her in a phone call that she wouldn’t be hired at the conservative cable news network, but suggested that she look for employment at one of Fox’s local stations.“Ms. Curanaj did not receive the position at [Fox News] because Ailes determined that she would not submit to him sexually,” the lawsuit contends.In November 2011, Curanaj accepted a freelance position as a reporter with Fox 5. A pattern of discrimination against her started soon after Byron Harmon became news director in 2012, the suit contends. Harmon allegedly told Curanaj that she was passed over for a full-time position because she was “not attractive enough to be an anchor,” according to the lawsuit. Curanaj, whose legal name is Lidija Ujkic, accused Harmon of making disparaging comments about her ethnic background too. He had referred to her as “Ms. Albania” repeatedly, for instance. She’s been treated worse at the station since announcing her pregnancy in July, the suit says.“We do not think the plaintiff’s claims have merit, and we intend to defend vigorously,” a Fox Television Stations spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. Curanaj’s description of Ailes’ comments is similar to those of several accusers who’ve said he openly assessed their physiques.Amid the growing accusations against him, Ailes resigned in July as part of a $40 million settlement and became an adviser to Donald Trump’s campaign. He’s denied seeking sexual favors from female employees and other allegations of inappropriate behavior. "

Johnson VA Medical Center in Charleston, South Carolina.For the study, published in Behaviour Research and Therapy, Acierno and colleagues recruited 132 veterans who had been diagnosed with PTSD, 127 of them men.All the participants were assessed with standard PTSD scales designed to measure symptom severity and depression. They were then randomly assigned to two groups – each would receive 10 to 12 prolonged exposure therapy sessions, but one group would attend sessions at a VA medical center while the other would have sessions at home by video conference.The participants who got treatment at home were provided with videoconferencing software to use on their own computers, tablets or smartphones. Videophones or tablets were provided to participants who didn’t own the proper equipment.The researchers repeated the PTSD scales after three months of treatment and again three months later. They found that at both time points, the vets who were treated at home showed similar improvements in PTSD symptom severity as those treated in the clinic. The at-home treatment scores for depression were not as good at three months, but by six months they were similar to the scores of the group treated in the clinic. “Our effects with PTSD were just as good in person vs. home based telehealth,” Acierno said, “however, people doing the treatment via home-based telehealth did report more difficulty.”About 33 percent of the at-home group did not complete the program compared to 19 percent of the clinic group.Acierno said participants who dropped out reported difficulties such as feeling worried about losing control during exposures, the feeling they couldn’t tolerate assignments to go out in public and that imagined exposures made them feel bad.Acierno said he and his collaborator Dr. Melba Hernandez-Tejada are exploring the idea of pairing peers who have been through prolonged exposure therapy and no longer meet criteria for PTSD with veterans currently receiving the treatment via telehealth to help them through the difficult parts of the therapy.Acierno said the Charleston VA currently offers the home-based therapy to patients. “We have had tremendous response combining home telehealth with peer support during exposure, which is new,” Acierno said, adding that in the past peers were involved only to encourage people to get into treatment, not actually helping to perform the treatment.Peter Kane, a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison said the study was able to show that, at least in the VA health system, effective PTSD treatments can be successfully delivered in multiple ways.“Patients with PTSD could be treated effectively in the clinic or by using home based telehealth,” Kane said. The findings are especially important given the common barriers that make it harder for those who need these services to access them, he noted.“Studies such as this one may change how mental health services are delivered in general, not just for PTSD or within the VA system,” Kane said. “It may be the case at some point in the future that mental health clinics may offer home based telehealth as an alternative to traditionally clinic-based care.”SOURCE: bit.ly/2h6TQfs Behaviour Research and Therapy, online November 22, 2016."

Mike Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for national security adviser, has quietly deleted a tweet that linked to a fake news story spreading baseless conspiracy theories about Trump’s presidential rival Hillary Clinton.On Nov. 2, Flynn tweeted a story referencing Clinton’s alleged “sex crimes.” The tweet gained renewed attention last week, as it resembled a different right-wing conspiracy theory that claimed Clinton and her campaign chairman John Podesta were running a child sex trafficking operation at a Washington, D.C., pizzeria.But CNN discovered Wednesday that the tweet was deleted. According to archived versions of the tweet, it appears that Flynn deleted the tweet sometime on Monday.Flynn, who advised Trump on national security during his campaign, frequently shares fake news on social media. He also uses Twitter to spread Islamophobia, saying that “fear of Muslims is rational.”In 2014, he was forced out of his job as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency for making controversial comments and clashing with the Obama administration on how to combat terrorism. Even then, he often disregarded facts. According to the New York Times, employees who worked with him at the Pentagon often referred to his ideas as “Flynn facts,” because he based them on falsehoods, like claiming that Sharia law was on the rise in the U.S.Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr., was fired from Trump’s transition team last week after continuing to peddle the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory, even after a gunman attacked the popular D.C. restaurant because he said he intended to “self-investigate” the baseless allegations.Flynn is not the first right-wing figure to scrub evidence of promoting conspiracy theories. Alex Jones, of the right-wing website InfoWars, which often promulgates such stories, has reportedly removed a video about Pizzagate from his site, after an FBI criminal complaint revealed that the gunman in last week’s incident learned of the conspiracy theory on the site and sent the video to a friend before the incident."

Last month, the World Health Organization declared that Zika no longer constitutes an international emergency, but stressed the need for a long-term effort to address the virus, which has been linked to thousands of birth defects and neurological complications.For the study, CDC researchers tested tissues from 52 patients with suspected Zika virus infection, including brain tissues from eight infants who had microcephaly and later died. They also tested placental tissues from 44 women ― 22 of whom delivered apparently healthy babies and 22 whose pregnancies ended in miscarriage, abortion, stillbirth or who delivered babies with microcephaly. Zika has been shown to cause microcephaly, a rare birth defect in which infants are born with undersized heads and brains, which can cause life-long disability.The researchers found Zika genetic material in fetal brain tissue and placentas more than seven months after the mothers contracted the virus. In one case, they also found evidence of the virus growing in an infant with microcephaly who died two months after birth.Of the eight infants who had microcephaly and later died, all tested positive for Zika. The mothers of all eight of these infants contracted Zika during the first trimester of pregnancy, adding to prior evidence that Zika is most dangerous early in pregnancy.“We don’t know how long the virus can persist, but its persistence could have implications for babies born with microcephaly and for apparently healthy infants whose mothers had Zika during their pregnancies,” said Bhatnagar, whose findings were published in CDC’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.There are no treatments or vaccines for Zika, which previously had been seen causing only mild disease.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"
38,POLITICS,Donald Trump Could Be In Violation Of The Lease On His D.C. Hotel The Day He Takes Office,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-hotel-contract_us_585164dbe4b092f086866e75,The General Services Administration says it has received no response from Trump.,2016-12-14,"President-elect Donald Trump speaking at the opening of his Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58516572120000ca0beef3ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump will be in violation of the lease on his Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., the day he takes office, according to House Democrats.In a letter Wednesday, lawmakers said Michael Gelber, the deputy commissioner of the General Services Administration’s Public Buildings Service, informed them Trump will be in breach of his lease as soon as he is sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. The hotel lease specifically states that “no … elected official of the Government of the United States … shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.”The GSA, however, pushed back on this conclusion Wednesday.“GSA does not have a position that the lease provision requires the President-elect to divest of his financial interests. We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature. In fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the President-elect’s business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office,” a spokesperson said, referring to the GSA-owned building that Trump’s D.C. hotel occupies. “GSA is committed to responsibly administering all of the leases to which it is a party.”A spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that there was no difference between “the agency’s latest statement and what the GSA had told the lawmakers.”House Oversight & Government Reform Committee ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) addressed the conflicting reports later Wednesday.“We understand GSA’s position that this breach has not yet occurred, will not occur until Donald Trump is sworn in as president, and is officially viewed as a ‘hypothetical’ issue until that time,” Cummings said in a statement. “We also share GSA’s hope that the agency will not have to address this issue if President-elect Trump divests his ownership in the lease before then. But the simple fact is that GSA informed our staffs that they interpret this lease provision as prohibiting any elected official from having any ownership interest in the lease, and we stand 100% behind our letter.”House Democrats had previously penned a letter to the GSA expressing concerns about Trump’s lease. They say Gelber responded to lawmakers, including Cummings, Transportation & Infrastructure Committee ranking member Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) and Rep. Andre Carson (D-Ind.), stating that the only way to avoid a violation of contract would be if Trump fully divests his ownership interest in the hotel. He would still be in breach, lawmakers said, if he simply transfers management control to his two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, as he has said he would do.The Trump International Hotel in D.C. is just one of the many conflicts of interest facing the president-elect before he takes office, but it is one of the most glaring. Beyond the issue of whether he will be in violation of his contract with the government, upon assuming office Trump would be able to appoint a new head of the GSA, which would have to renegotiate terms of his lease with his children every year. This would put any GSA employee in a terribly uncomfortable and compromised position.As Steve Schooner, a procurement law professor at George Washington University Law School and former government contracting official, previously told The Huffington Post: “There’s an imbalance of power. In a 60-year, complicated contract, we’re going to ask a civil servant at GSA to negotiate annually with the president’s children.”He called the situation “mind-boggling.”The hotel has already emerged as a hotspot for foreign governments who want to influence the new regime. The Embassy of Bahrain and the government of Azerbaijan rented out ballrooms for their annual end-of-year parties in the capital. Hotel staff held a briefing for foreign governments to sell them on renting the luxury rooms as a means of getting in the good graces of the incoming president. The conservative Heritage Foundation and the Republican National Committee have also booked space for their parties.According to Wednesday’s follow-up letter from House Democrats that details their communications with GSA on this issue, neither Trump nor his company contacted the GSA at any point during the campaign to discuss the terms of their lease and the possibility of a breach of contract if he won the White House.Further, the letter states, “the Deputy Commissioner stated that GSA informed the Trump transition team about concerns raised by us and others about the imminent breach, but that GSA heard nothing to date.”GSA stated that their main contact with the Trump Organization when the lease was agreed upon was Ivanka Trump, the president-elect’s eldest daughter. Ivanka Trump currently serves in multiple capacities across the Trump Organization and her father’s transition team, completely blurring the line between business and government.Trump was supposed to announce a plan Thursday for how, if at all, he will disentangle himself from his business, but canceled. He has set some undefined date in January, perhaps before he takes office, to inform the public about how he will avoid his many existing conflicts of interest. Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller said on a press call Wednesday morning that Trump will address the hotel lease next month.The president-elect stated on Twitter that he will hand his company off to his two oldest sons, but they are also on his transition team. In fact, Donald Trump Jr. helped select Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) as the nominee for interior secretary.Cummings has been leading the Democratic push for Congress to hold hearings on Trump’s business conflicts before he takes office. House Republicans have almost uniformly dismissed such concerns. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the Oversight & Government Reform Committee, says that Congress doesn’t need to hold hearings until after Trump is in office ― when he’ll already be in violation of his lease.This article has been updated to reflect that the GSA says House Democrats mischaracterized its assessment."

Ryan briefly introduced Trump at the rally. He thanked him for winning Wisconsin, the first GOP presidential victory since “before I had my driver’s license,” Ryan said.It was a turnabout from just two months ago, when Ryan disinvited Trump from a Wisconsin GOP event a day after The Washington Post published the infamous video of Trump bragging about grabbing women by their genitals.Ryan later declared he would no longer defend Trump — though he continued to endorse his candidacy. That followed several months of Ryan attempting to distance himself from Trump and repeatedly condemning Trump’s remarks.The GOP event in October went on without Trump, but Ryan was booed by Trump supporters after awkwardly tiptoeing around the subject of the GOP nominee. Ryan wouldn’t even mention Trump by name.Ryan was again scheduled to appear with Trump just days before the election. That rally also was canceled.Since the election, Ryan has thawed, meeting with Trump on Capitol Hill and at Trump Tower in New York. In an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” this month, Ryan shrugged off his past criticisms of Trump.“Let bygones be bygones,” he said.Trump on Tuesday called Ryan “terrific,” but warned he might change his mind. “If he ever goes against me, I’m not going to say that,” Trump said."

While it seemed fair game for comedians to comment on his hairstyle or Twitter rants when a Trump presidency seemed like a distant, dystopian reality, many are now struggling with how to approach their commentary.“Can comedians — can I — resist the temptation to treat Trump like just another politician we’re obliged to skewer? Comedy is about finding the absurdity in everything, and here we have a tantalizing target who is nothing but absurd,” Nancherla wrote in the article, which was subtitled “Forget Your Stupid Toupee Jokes.”The comedian later added, “These sorts of jokes about him fail to even begin countering the disastrous impact he’ll have upon the world. Because the problem isn’t that he’s unmockable; it’s that he’s too dangerous to simply mock.” The danger, Nancherla explains, lies in “his rhetoric ... grounded in hate,” the alarming way he’s been supported by the “alt-right,” and how he’s shown thus far to be someone who “supports free speech only so long as he isn’t the butt of it.” Nancherla’s article raises an important question about the craft of comedy: Is it a comedian’s mission to simply follow what’s funny and make people laugh in the name of ignoring more complex and difficult truths? Should anyone with a platform in 2016 use it to speak up for what he or she feels is an important message to spread?In her estimation, the answer to the latter is yes. Nancherla also invoked fellow comedian Samantha Bee’s words, delivered the day after the election. On her TBS show, Bee reminded all watching that a Trump win was not, contrary to popular thought, a “lucky break” for comedians and that jokes could, as the saying goes, write themselves. “No, no, no,” Bee said about that notion. “Jokes don’t write themselves, Jews write jokes, and they are scared shitless.”Instead of working off well-tread jabs about tiny hands or orange skin, comedians would do better to use their platforms for good, Nancherla concluded. “This work, my work, feels more active now, more important. I feel driven to express my strong opinions and to challenge people’s thinking, even when it’s scary or inconvenient,” she said.Read the full column over at The Village Voice."

Journalists shouldn’t be shocked by Trump’s willingness to break with precedent, considering he did so throughout the 2016 campaign, from blacklisting news organizations to routinely attacking the press to threatening lawsuits against media outlets. Trump has also broken with tradition during the transition period by not allowing for a fully “protective pool” or holding a news conference. Upon taking office, Trump isn’t obligated to hold daily press briefings or allow news organizations to set up on White House grounds, as HuffPost noted just before his victory. Given Trump’s use of social media to circumvent the press now, it seems he will try different ways of communicating than his predecessors. Priebus discussed the transition team’s view of long-standing press traditions after Hewitt suggested the president appear each Friday on a nationally syndicated show instead of doing the typical Saturday morning radio address. “Look, I think that many things have to change,” Priebus said. “And I think that it’s important that we look at all of those traditions that are great, but quite frankly, as you know, don’t really make news.”Priebus said the transition team is considering “different ways” of briefing the press and looking at the practice of news organizations having assigned seats at the White House. He also suggested the assigning of seats began during the Obama White House. In a statement, White House Correspondents Association President Jeff Mason said Priebus was incorrect and that there have been assigned seats since they were installed in 1981. “The WHCA assumed responsibility for assigning the seats in the briefing room over the last two decades at the request of both Republican and Democratic administrations, who were mindful of the potential appearance of playing favorites if they assigned the seats themselves,” said Mason, a Reuters correspondent. “The WHCA looks forward to meeting with the incoming administration to address questions and concerns on both sides about exactly this sort of issue.”Some journalists may welcome such change considering that the major TV networks and wire services dominate the front of the room and the pecking order hasn’t necessarily kept up with the changing media landscape. There are only 49 seats, and digital outlets such as The Huffington Post and Breitbart News, which is sure to be influential during the Trump years, don’t have their own.

44,POLITICS,Progressive Phone Company Discloses Legal Battle Over FBI's National Security Letters,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/credo-mobile-fbi_us_5851bb47e4b016e9c1187681,The announcement comes after a three-year effort to strike down a gag order on the case.,2016-12-14,"The FBI sent Credo Mobile two national security letters in 2013, demanding that the telecommunications company turn over information about some of its customers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5851bda51800002c00e42b06.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A federal court has granted permission to a progressive telecommunications company ― one at the center of a years-long battle over the constitutionality of national security letters ― to talk about the ongoing lawsuit it’s involved in. In 2013, Credo Mobile, a phone company headquartered in San Francisco that raises money for progressive groups, received two national security letters from an FBI special agent in San Antonio, Texas, demanding the names, addresses and billing records associated with three accounts. National security letters are a controversial tool the FBI uses to secretly compel companies to turn over information about their customers without a court order. Like most national security letters, the two that Credo received prohibited the company from telling anyone ― including its customers ― what the government was asking it to do.For the past three years, Credo, represented by the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, has been fighting in court both the constitutionality of the FBI’s request and the bureau’s demand that Credo stay silent. The fight over the legality of the request is ongoing, but earlier this year, the Federal District Court for Northern California said the FBI failed to show the need for the gag order. The government dropped its appeal of that decision, and Credo subsequently published redacted versions of the two national security letters. Being asked to turn over information about its customers to the FBI put Credo in an awkward situation. Headed by a group of progressive activists, the company prides itself on transparency and has fought against the laws that authorize the government’s use of national security letters. Credo was determined to fight the request, but being forced to stay quiet had a “chilling effect” on its advocacy work, said Becky Bond, who was Credo’s political director when the company received the letter.Last year, Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, a modified version of the expired Patriot Act, a bill that dramatically expanded government surveillance capabilities. Some civil liberties groups, including the EFF, said the bill was a step in the right direction. But Credo said the changes were superficial and that the new bill essentially reauthorized the most problematic provisions in the Patriot Act.After the bill was passed, Bond offered a quote for a press release that said Credo was a telecommunications company that was subject to government surveillance. She meant it in a broad sense, but her lawyers said it could be interpreted as an allusion to the ongoing lawsuit. They cut the quote.Michael Kieschnick, a co-founder of Credo, is confident that he and his colleagues made the right decision in fighting the FBI in court rather than going rogue and speaking publicly about being on the receiving end of a national security letter back in 2013.“If we violated the gag order, we really would have forfeited a lot of possible power achieved through the courts,” Kieschnick said. “We really wanted to use the issue to change policy through the courts as opposed to [having] a pleasant but short-term thrill over violating it. We wanted to protect our customers and change the rules.”Other telecommunications companies, like Yahoo and Google, have recently published some of the national security letters they received ― but their ability to do so stems from a provision of the USA Freedom Act that requires the FBI to periodically review its nondisclosure requirements and drop them when they’re no longer necessary.“It’s a totally one-off basis ― it’s the government deciding on its own, ‘OK, you can publish these,’” Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at EFF, said of the Yahoo and Google disclosures.“The government issues hundreds of thousands of national security letters and no court ever looks at them and decides, ‘This is proper and this is improper,’” Crocker continued. “You need a constitutional challenge making sure someone is watching what the government is doing.”Read the national security letters here:Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

China has already built military length airstrips on these islands.“It now seems that these structures are an evolution of point-defense fortifications already constructed at China’s smaller facilities on Gaven, Hughes, Johnson, and Cuarteron reefs,” it said citing images taken in November and made available to Reuters.“This model has gone through another evolution at (the) much-larger bases on Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief reefs.”Satellite images of Hughes and Gaven reefs showed what appeared to be anti-aircraft guns and what were likely to be close-in weapons systems (CIWS) to protect against cruise missile strikes, it said.Images from Fiery Cross Reef showed towers that likely contained targeting radar, it said.AMTI said covers had been installed on the towers at Fiery Cross, but the size of platforms on these and the covers suggested they concealed defense systems similar to those at the smaller reefs.“These gun and probable CIWS emplacements show that Beijing is serious about defense of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the South China Sea,” it said.“Among other things, they would be the last line of defense against cruise missiles launched by the United States or others against these soon-to-be-operational air bases.”AMTI director Greg Poling said AMTI had spent months trying to figure out what the purposes of the structures was.“This is the first time that we’re confident in saying they are anti-aircraft and CIWS emplacements. We did not know that they had systems this big and this advanced there,” he told Reuters.“This is militarization. The Chinese can argue that it’s only for defensive purposes, but if you are building giant anti-aircraft gun and CIWS emplacements, it means that you are prepping for a future conflict.“They keep saying they are not militarizing, but they could deploy fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles tomorrow if they wanted to,” he said. “Now they have all the infrastructure in place for these interlocking rings of defense and power projection.”The report said the installations would likely back up a defensive umbrella provided by a future deployment of mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) platforms like the HQ-9 system deployed to Woody Island in the Paracel Islands, farther to the north in the South China Sea.It forecast that such a deployment could happen “at any time,” noting a recent Fox News report that components for SAM systems have been spotted at the southeastern Chinese port of Jieyang, possibly destined for the South China Sea.China has said military construction on the islands will be limited to necessary defensive requirements.The United States has criticized what it called China’s militarization of its maritime outposts and stressed the need for freedom of navigation by conducting periodic air and naval patrols near them that have angered Beijing.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has also criticized Chinese behavior in the South China Sea while signaling he may adopt a tougher approach to China’s assertive behavior in the region than President Barack Obama.(Reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"

An offshoot of the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) claimed responsibility for the attacks on Saturday night.“We are always telling our counterparts that we are receiving this threat. And now, we see that the Besiktas bomber also came from Syria,” Cavusoglu told TGRT TV in an interview. He did not say which of the Besiktas bombers he meant.Turkish authorities consider the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its armed wing, the YPG, to be the Syrian offshoots of the PKK, which has waged a guerrilla war for autonomy in the mainly Kurdish southeast of Turkey for decades.Turkey is frustrated with international support for the YPG, which is fighting Islamic State militants in Syria.Members of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), parliament’s second-biggest opposition grouping, have been among those arrested since the attack, the Interior Ministry said.President Tayyip Erdogan has accused the HDP of links to the PKK. The HDP, which last year became the first Kurdish party to enter parliament, denies direct links to militants.The PKK, which took up arms in 1984, is deemed a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union, as well as by Turkey.

48,POLITICS,"The Short History Of Every Time Congress Tried, And Failed, To Prevent A Mass Shooting",David Covucci,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-guns-mass-shootings_us_5850547be4b04c8e2bb258a3,There's a lot of nothing accomplished in the face of people dying.,2016-12-14,"People and press gather at a memorial outside Columbine High School, the scene of a mass shooting on April 20, 1999.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5850a75e1200009509eef2cc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Four years ago Wednesday, 20-year-old Adam Lanza took a Bushmaster XM-15 to Sandy Hook Elementary School and unloaded 154 bullets in five minutes, killing six adults and 20 elementary school kids. At the time, the 26 victims made it the second worst shooting in American history.Two days later, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) appeared on “Meet the Press” to announce her intention to introduce a bill banning assault weapons ― a prohibition that was part of federal law from 1994 to 2004, but that Congress let expire. The Sandy Hook massacre was the third time in a little more than a year that someone had shot up a public place using a type of weapon that was previously banned.“We can’t ignore the common denominator in all of these deadly massacres: access to easy killing machines,” Feinstein told reporters several days later. “Sandy Hook is only the latest tragedy and more horrendous than anything I ever thought could happen in the United States of America. But these massacres are happening … and the only thing that’s consistent in all of them are the guns.”The Dec. 14, 2012, rampage in Newtown, Connecticut, was also the 28th mass shooting ― which the FBI has defined as the public killing of four or more people in a single incident ― since the assault weapons ban had expired eight years earlier. But unlike previous acts of indiscriminate mass murder that had failed to stir Congress, the Sandy Hook tragedy felt like it could inspire action.Which is to say, it felt like that moment 19 years earlier when Feinstein had first introduced an assault weapons ban, four months after a man armed with two TEC-9 semi-automatic pistols rode up the elevator of a skyscraper in San Francisco’s Financial District, got out on the 34th floor and opened fire, killing eight people and wounding six. The 101 California Street incident was the fourth mass shooting in California in less than a decade.In a speech on the Senate floor soon after, Feinstein argued that no civilian should have access to the kinds of guns used to mow down her constituents.“They are weapons of choice,” she said, for killers who want to take out their wrath “on anyone who happens to be around — children in a school yard or a swimming pool or walking down a street.”The 1994 assault weapons ban became only the third piece of gun control legislation approved since 1968, but massive resistance left the law riddled with so many exemptions it was basically useless. The director of federal affairs at the National Rifle Association, the country’s top lobbying group for gun owners, portrayed the bill as an effort to “disarm” the American public, arguing in congressional testimony that advocates of the ban were “merely interested in eliminating any type of firearm whenever presented with an emotionally charged opportunity to do so.”In an effort to appease the gun lobby and assure passage of the bill, Feinstein whittled down the list of firearms to be banned from 670 to 19. The TEC-9s used in the 1993 San Francisco shooting made the list, but the law exempted any weapon manufactured before the ban took effect from any restrictions.The company that made TEC-9s, Navegar, ramped up production as the bill moved through Congress, and in the first eight months of 1994, it produced three times as many guns as it had in 1992. The company was allowed to sell every single one of those, and anyone who had purchased one could legally resell it to whomever they wanted.That’s how Feinstein’s seemingly momentous assault weapons ban set the script for every other ineffectual attempt to implement gun laws in the United States. It unfolds the same way each time: A horrifying shooting happens and lawmakers pledge to prevent the next one. But often nothing comes out of Congress. On the rare occasions legislators do act, resistance from the gun lobby leaves the new law downright impotent. The massacre is soon relegated to a place on a list we recite after the next mass shooting, which starts the process anew. For more than two decades, it’s been America’s consistent cycle.That’s how a gun store in Illinois could sell a TEC-DC9 ― a weapon ostensibly illegal in the U.S. ― three years after the assault weapons ban took effect. And it’s how, two years after that, the same weapon was legally available at a gun show outside Denver to two students from Columbine High School.Even though they were only 17 in January 1999, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris didn’t face any real legal impediments to obtaining guns.The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a law first floated after President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981, didn’t pass until 1993. It granted the Justice Department five days to perform a background check before a handgun sale could go through. A law barring felons, juveniles and the mentally ill from buying weapons had been on the books since 1968, and the Brady bill was designed merely to give law enforcement a way to enforce it. Still, the NRA repeatedly attempted to sink the bill, arguing that it “violated Americans’ constitutional right” to have immediate access to firearms. To appease the gun lobby, Congress agreed to create the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS, which went into effect in November 1998, required licensed gun sellers to check a prospective firearm buyer against a government database. The promise was that they would receive a response within two minutes on 90 percent of those inquiries. The NICS was actually able to give an immediate response about 70 percent of the time in its first year of operation. On any sale that did not receive an immediate response, federal authorities still had three business days to complete the background check.But the Brady law explicitly excluded transactions between private citizens, including transactions between people at gun shows. The so-called gun show loophole means that Americans can buy guns with no background check whatsoever.That’s how the two Colorado teenagers purchased four weapons over the course of two months. On April 20, 1999, they brought those guns to Columbine High School and, in less than an hour, fired 181 shots, including 96 from the TEC-DC9. Klebold and Harris killed 13 and wounded 21, the fourth-highest victim total in a mass shooting at the time.Then-Rep. Rod Blagojevich (D-Ill.) had introduced a bill addressing the gun show loophole just 16 days before the duo purchased their most lethal firearm. Gun show participants, he said in a floor speech, had “little, if any, legal obligation to insure that they aren’t putting deadly weapons into the hands of violent criminals or juveniles.” He had introduced the same bill the previous year, with no success.The Columbine shooting might have given impetus to Blagojevich’s legislation. Instead, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, saw it as an opportunity to revive his own stalled bill aimed at harshly punishing teens repeatedly convicted of crimes. In asking that his measure be brought to a vote 21 days after the shooting, Hatch shifted the blame away from guns and onto the teens themselves.“In the face of a confounding problem like juvenile crime and school violence, it is tempting to look for easy answers,” Hatch said on the Senate floor. “It is at its core a problem of our nation’s values. ... We should not simply rush to enact more gun control ― some of which cannot even be remotely associated with the [Columbine] tragedy.”But the main gun control push was for a measure that actually focused on what had gone wrong at Columbine. The late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) proposed an amendment to Hatch’s legislation that was similar to Blagojevich’s bill. It would have required all firearm purchases at gun shows ― even those between private sellers ― to be run through the background check system and would have granted the government the same three days to conduct those checks for sales on which they could not give an immediate response. Hatch and other Republicans, expecting a fight, had already attached an amendment that would limit the time for gun show background checks to 24 hours. The Republicans were livid that Lautenberg and his fellow Democrats wanted to give authorities the same amount of time to conduct gun show background checks that was already prescribed for every other gun purchase. Hatch said their proposal would be tantamount to “doing away” with gun shows.The senators split 50-50 on Lautenberg’s amendment, leaving then-Vice President Al Gore to cast the deciding vote in favor. “We’re reminded again that until we get more controls in a sensible way on the easy availability of guns in our society to children, to criminals, to those who are mentally disturbed, then these tragedies will continue,” Gore said after the vote.A month later, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a version of Hatch’s bill that did not include any of the gun show language.The gun lobby cheered. “Nothing is better than anything,” said James J. Baker, the NRA’s chief lobbyist at the time.When the two chambers met that August to work out the differences between their juvenile justice bills ― a process known as reconciliation ― Hatch tried to keep the Senate version, the one with the gun show language, from becoming law. After one sitdown, House and Senate negotiators never met again.The bills languished for nearly a year, until the first anniversary of Columbine. Another shooting death, this time of a Michigan first-grader at the hands of a fellow student, prompted President Bill Clinton to admonish Congress. “I don’t want any future president to have to go to Columbine or to Springfield, Oregon, or to Jonesboro, Arkansas, or to any of the other places I have been,” he said at a gun safety rally in Denver. But the only legislation crafted in response to Columbine never went anywhere.Seven years later, President George W. Bush boarded Air Force One to fly to Blacksburg, Virginia, the day after Seung-Hui Cho, a 23-year-old Virginia Tech student, gunned down 32 teachers and students on campus. The April 16, 2007, mass shooting incident was then the worst in U.S. history.Cho had once been involuntarily institutionalized, and a judge had described him as a danger to himself. But because reporting such mental health records to the NICS was voluntary, Cho was able to pass two separate background checks in the winter of 2007 and purchase two handguns.Soon after the Virginia Tech massacre, Congress began debating whether anything could have been done to prevent such horrors. But lawmakers already knew the answer. Five identical bills introduced in the early 2000s could have prevented Cho from buying those guns. The legislation would have provided grant money to states to help them report their backlog of mental health records to the NICS. Many states were either unable or unwilling to comply with reporting requirements, which severely undermined the system’s usefulness. Indeed, in the NICS’s first year of operation, all 50 states combined sent in disqualifying mental health records for just 41 people.One bill providing those grants passed the House in 2002, but the Senate refused to take it up. Four identical efforts never made it to a vote. It was only after the massacre in Blacksburg that Congress passed the NICS Improvement Act of 2007, authorizing nearly a billion dollars in state grants.Yet most of that money never went anywhere. To make the bill more palatable to the NRA, congressional Democrats had added a provision, absent in the bill’s previous iterations, that forced states that took the funding to create a process allowing mentally ill people to regain their gun rights. Many states balked. Just 7 percent of the pledged $875 million was distributed over the next five years.The NICS Improvement Act also made it harder to disqualify mentally ill people from buying guns. Previous law had loosely stated that gun sellers could not sell a firearm to someone they had “reasonable cause” to believe had been “adjudicated as a mental defective” or “committed to a mental institution.” But the 2007 law explicitly barred the federal government from simply entering a diagnosis from a licensed mental health professional into the NICS; that diagnosis had to be backed up with a court ruling that someone posed a severe threat.In its final form, there was “far more bad in this bill than good,” Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center, told the Los Angeles Times. In a press release, she called it “now nothing more than a gun lobby wish list.”“The end product is a win,” said the NRA in its own press release.The heightened standard for being deemed too mentally unstable to have a gun is one reason why 24-year-old James Holmes ― who had repeatedly told his psychiatrist that he thought about killing people, that he thought about killing people multiple times a day, and that his desire to kill people was growing ― faced no federal legal barrier preventing him from buying a shotgun, a semi-automatic rifle, two handguns and 6,300 bullets.Holmes opened fire in an Aurora, Colorado, theater on July 20, 2012, killing 12 and wounding 58 people. The dead and the injured together constituted the highest victim total in a mass shooting incident in U.S. history at the time.After federal authorities revealed that Holmes’ bulk ammunition purchases had all been made through the internet, the legislative response to the tragedy targeted online ammunition purchases. Ten days after the shooting, Sen. Lautenberg introduced a bill requiring a photo ID to purchase bullets, which would have effectively ended online sales. But it was the middle of summer, and Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), then the majority leader, said there wasn’t enough time to take up the measure, or any of the others that were floated in response. “With the schedule we have, we’re not going to get into the debate on gun control,” Reid said.Three days later, the Senate took its annual month-long recess.It probably didn’t help that a presidential election was only months away. Even Feinstein spoke with restraint. She noted that one of the weapons Holmes used was a Smith & Wesson semi-automatic rifle introduced in 2006, after her assault weapons ban had expired, and said she supported the ban’s reintroduction. But she said, “I don’t believe it has a chance in this environment.”Feinstein’s new assault weapons legislation, proposed a month after the December 2012 Newtown shooting, focused on 157 specific types of semi-automatic rifles. The bill explicitly exempted 2,200 gun models, to give it any hope of passing.Her announcement on “Meet the Press” prompted NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre’s oft-quoted statement that “the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”Alongside Feinstein’s ban, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) introduced a bill that would have expanded background checks on most private sales of guns in the United States. It was essentially identical to a proposal President Barack Obama had just made. That measure incensed the NRA, which claimed the bill would ban loaning firearms to friends and gifting one’s kids with guns, despite the generous exemptions carved out for precisely those situations.“[Obama] wants to force parents to fill out forms to leave a family heirloom to a loved one — standing in line and filling out a bunch of bureaucratic paperwork, just so a grandfather can give a grandson a Christmas gift,” LaPierre said.Even in the immediate wake of a mass killing at an elementary school, getting a bill to the floor was a fight. The assault weapons ban passed a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, but when Democrats reached a compromise to bring Schumer’s background check measure to the floor, Reid left the ban behind. He assured Feinstein there would be a vote on the assault weapons ban as an amendment. Lautenberg was also going to introduce an amendment barring the type of high-capacity magazines used in both Aurora and Newtown.A mere title in the Democrats’ plan incensed Republicans: “Requiring a background check for every firearm sale.” But Democratic leadership allowed the bill to move forward with the understanding that a less aggressive, bipartisan compromise, which Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) were working on, would be introduced as an amendment replacing the bill’s central language. The Manchin-Toomey effort was meant to placate the vocal minority against expanding background checks, by focusing solely on internet purchases and gun show sales. The pair also gave their version a revised title: the Second Amendment Rights Protection Act.It was clear that any gun bill was going to face a tough vote. “In my opinion, adopting mandatory federal government background checks for purely private transactions between law-abiding citizens puts us inexorably on the path to a push for a federal registry,” said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).And even if there were background checks, Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) said on the floor, they “would not have prevented any of the recent atrocities that have affected families in our nation.”Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) argued against the proposed assault weapons ban by pointing to the impotence of the previous law, despite changes that would have made the new ban more robust. “It did not stop Columbine,” he said.The Manchin-Toomey measure and Feinstein’s amendment both came to the floor on April 17, 2013, one day after the anniversary of the Virginia Tech shooting and three days before the anniversary of the Columbine massacre.Manchin-Toomey was the first up, and it received 54 votes ― six short of the 60 needed to overcome a Senate filibuster. Of all the proposed measures, it had the best chance of passing, and its defeat set the others up for certain failure. Lautenberg’s high-capacity magazine ban got 46 votes. Feinstein’s amendment received only 40.A little less than two years after those votes, SIG Sauer released its new MCX semi-automatic rifle, which would have been illegal to manufacture under Feinstein’s ban. On June 4, 2016, 29-year-old Omar Mateen purchased one at a gun shop in Port St. Lucie, Florida. Seven days later he walked into the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and shot 102 people. Fifty of them died.It was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said that the Manchin-Toomey measure fell four votes short of overcoming a Senate filibuster. It was six votes short."

The director of federal affairs at the National Rifle Association, the country’s top lobbying group for gun owners, portrayed the bill as an effort to “disarm” the American public, arguing in congressional testimony that advocates of the ban were “merely interested in eliminating any type of firearm whenever presented with an emotionally charged opportunity to do so.”In an effort to appease the gun lobby and assure passage of the bill, Feinstein whittled down the list of firearms to be banned from 670 to 19. The TEC-9s used in the 1993 San Francisco shooting made the list, but the law exempted any weapon manufactured before the ban took effect from any restrictions.The company that made TEC-9s, Navegar, ramped up production as the bill moved through Congress, and in the first eight months of 1994, it produced three times as many guns as it had in 1992. The company was allowed to sell every single one of those, and anyone who had purchased one could legally resell it to whomever they wanted.That’s how Feinstein’s seemingly momentous assault weapons ban set the script for every other ineffectual attempt to implement gun laws in the United States. It unfolds the same way each time: A horrifying shooting happens and lawmakers pledge to prevent the next one. But often nothing comes out of Congress. On the rare occasions legislators do act, resistance from the gun lobby leaves the new law downright impotent. The massacre is soon relegated to a place on a list we recite after the next mass shooting, which starts the process anew. For more than two decades, it’s been America’s consistent cycle.That’s how a gun store in Illinois could sell a TEC-DC9 ― a weapon ostensibly illegal in the U.S. ― three years after the assault weapons ban took effect. And it’s how, two years after that, the same weapon was legally available at a gun show outside Denver to two students from Columbine High School.Even though they were only 17 in January 1999, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris didn’t face any real legal impediments to obtaining guns.The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a law first floated after President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981, didn’t pass until 1993. It granted the Justice Department five days to perform a background check before a handgun sale could go through. A law barring felons, juveniles and the mentally ill from buying weapons had been on the books since 1968, and the Brady bill was designed merely to give law enforcement a way to enforce it. Still, the NRA repeatedly attempted to sink the bill, arguing that it “violated Americans’ constitutional right” to have immediate access to firearms. To appease the gun lobby, Congress agreed to create the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS, which went into effect in November 1998, required licensed gun sellers to check a prospective firearm buyer against a government database. The promise was that they would receive a response within two minutes on 90 percent of those inquiries. The NICS was actually able to give an immediate response about 70 percent of the time in its first year of operation. On any sale that did not receive an immediate response, federal authorities still had three business days to complete the background check.But the Brady law explicitly excluded transactions between private citizens, including transactions between people at gun shows. The so-called gun show loophole means that Americans can buy guns with no background check whatsoever.That’s how the two Colorado teenagers purchased four weapons over the course of two months. On April 20, 1999, they brought those guns to Columbine High School and, in less than an hour, fired 181 shots, including 96 from the TEC-DC9. Klebold and Harris killed 13 and wounded 21, the fourth-highest victim total in a mass shooting at the time.Then-Rep. Rod Blagojevich (D-Ill.) had introduced a bill addressing the gun show loophole just 16 days before the duo purchased their most lethal firearm. Gun show participants, he said in a floor speech, had “little, if any, legal obligation to insure that they aren’t putting deadly weapons into the hands of violent criminals or juveniles.” He had introduced the same bill the previous year, with no success.The Columbine shooting might have given impetus to Blagojevich’s legislation. Instead, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, saw it as an opportunity to revive his own stalled bill aimed at harshly punishing teens repeatedly convicted of crimes. In asking that his measure be brought to a vote 21 days after the shooting, Hatch shifted the blame away from guns and onto the teens themselves.“In the face of a confounding problem like juvenile crime and school violence, it is tempting to look for easy answers,” Hatch said on the Senate floor. “It is at its core a problem of our nation’s values. ... We should not simply rush to enact more gun control ― some of which cannot even be remotely associated with the [Columbine] tragedy.”But the main gun control push was for a measure that actually focused on what had gone wrong at Columbine. The late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) proposed an amendment to Hatch’s legislation that was similar to Blagojevich’s bill. It would have required all firearm purchases at gun shows ― even those between private sellers ― to be run through the background check system and would have granted the government the same three days to conduct those checks for sales on which they could not give an immediate response. Hatch and other Republicans, expecting a fight, had already attached an amendment that would limit the time for gun show background checks to 24 hours. The Republicans were livid that Lautenberg and his fellow Democrats wanted to give authorities the same amount of time to conduct gun show background checks that was already prescribed for every other gun purchase. Hatch said their proposal would be tantamount to “doing away” with gun shows.The senators split 50-50 on Lautenberg’s amendment, leaving then-Vice President Al Gore to cast the deciding vote in favor. “We’re reminded again that until we get more controls in a sensible way on the easy availability of guns in our society to children, to criminals, to those who are mentally disturbed, then these tragedies will continue,” Gore said after the vote.A month later, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a version of Hatch’s bill that did not include any of the gun show language.The gun lobby cheered. “Nothing is better than anything,” said James J. Baker, the NRA’s chief lobbyist at the time.When the two chambers met that August to work out the differences between their juvenile justice bills ― a process known as reconciliation ― Hatch tried to keep the Senate version, the one with the gun show language, from becoming law. After one sitdown, House and Senate negotiators never met again.The bills languished for nearly a year, until the first anniversary of Columbine. Another shooting death, this time of a Michigan first-grader at the hands of a fellow student, prompted President Bill Clinton to admonish Congress. “I don’t want any future president to have to go to Columbine or to Springfield, Oregon, or to Jonesboro, Arkansas, or to any of the other places I have been,” he said at a gun safety rally in Denver. But the only legislation crafted in response to Columbine never went anywhere.Seven years later, President George W. Bush boarded Air Force One to fly to Blacksburg, Virginia, the day after Seung-Hui Cho, a 23-year-old Virginia Tech student, gunned down 32 teachers and students on campus. The April 16, 2007, mass shooting incident was then the worst in U.S. history.Cho had once been involuntarily institutionalized, and a judge had described him as a danger to himself. But because reporting such mental health records to the NICS was voluntary, Cho was able to pass two separate background checks in the winter of 2007 and purchase two handguns.Soon after the Virginia Tech massacre, Congress began debating whether anything could have been done to prevent such horrors. But lawmakers already knew the answer. Five identical bills introduced in the early 2000s could have prevented Cho from buying those guns. The legislation would have provided grant money to states to help them report their backlog of mental health records to the NICS. Many states were either unable or unwilling to comply with reporting requirements, which severely undermined the system’s usefulness. Indeed, in the NICS’s first year of operation, all 50 states combined sent in disqualifying mental health records for just 41 people.One bill providing those grants passed the House in 2002, but the Senate refused to take it up. Four identical efforts never made it to a vote. It was only after the massacre in Blacksburg that Congress passed the NICS Improvement Act of 2007, authorizing nearly a billion dollars in state grants.Yet most of that money never went anywhere. To make the bill more palatable to the NRA, congressional Democrats had added a provision, absent in the bill’s previous iterations, that forced states that took the funding to create a process allowing mentally ill people to regain their gun rights. Many states balked. Just 7 percent of the pledged $875 million was distributed over the next five years.The NICS Improvement Act also made it harder to disqualify mentally ill people from buying guns. Previous law had loosely stated that gun sellers could not sell a firearm to someone they had “reasonable cause” to believe had been “adjudicated as a mental defective” or “committed to a mental institution.” But the 2007 law explicitly barred the federal government from simply entering a diagnosis from a licensed mental health professional into the NICS; that diagnosis had to be backed up with a court ruling that someone posed a severe threat.In its final form, there was “far more bad in this bill than good,” Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center, told the Los Angeles Times. In a press release, she called it “now nothing more than a gun lobby wish list.”“The end product is a win,” said the NRA in its own press release.The heightened standard for being deemed too mentally unstable to have a gun is one reason why 24-year-old James Holmes ― who had repeatedly told his psychiatrist that he thought about killing people, that he thought about killing people multiple times a day, and that his desire to kill people was growing ― faced no federal legal barrier preventing him from buying a shotgun, a semi-automatic rifle, two handguns and 6,300 bullets.Holmes opened fire in an Aurora, Colorado, theater on July 20, 2012, killing 12 and wounding 58 people. The dead and the injured together constituted the highest victim total in a mass shooting incident in U.S. history at the time.After federal authorities revealed that Holmes’ bulk ammunition purchases had all been made through the internet, the legislative response to the tragedy targeted online ammunition purchases. Ten days after the shooting, Sen. Lautenberg introduced a bill requiring a photo ID to purchase bullets, which would have effectively ended online sales. But it was the middle of summer, and Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), then the majority leader, said there wasn’t enough time to take up the measure, or any of the others that were floated in response. “With the schedule we have, we’re not going to get into the debate on gun control,” Reid said.Three days later, the Senate took its annual month-long recess.It probably didn’t help that a presidential election was only months away. Even Feinstein spoke with restraint. She noted that one of the weapons Holmes used was a Smith & Wesson semi-automatic rifle introduced in 2006, after her assault weapons ban had expired, and said she supported the ban’s reintroduction. But she said, “I don’t believe it has a chance in this environment.”Feinstein’s new assault weapons legislation, proposed a month after the December 2012 Newtown shooting, focused on 157 specific types of semi-automatic rifles. The bill explicitly exempted 2,200 gun models, to give it any hope of passing.Her announcement on “Meet the Press” prompted NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre’s oft-quoted statement that “the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”Alongside Feinstein’s ban, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) introduced a bill that would have expanded background checks on most private sales of guns in the United States. It was essentially identical to a proposal President Barack Obama had just made. That measure incensed the NRA, which claimed the bill would ban loaning firearms to friends and gifting one’s kids with guns, despite the generous exemptions carved out for precisely those situations.“[Obama] wants to force parents to fill out forms to leave a family heirloom to a loved one — standing in line and filling out a bunch of bureaucratic paperwork, just so a grandfather can give a grandson a Christmas gift,” LaPierre said.Even in the immediate wake of a mass killing at an elementary school, getting a bill to the floor was a fight. The assault weapons ban passed a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, but when Democrats reached a compromise to bring Schumer’s background check measure to the floor, Reid left the ban behind. He assured Feinstein there would be a vote on the assault weapons ban as an amendment. Lautenberg was also going to introduce an amendment barring the type of high-capacity magazines used in both Aurora and Newtown.A mere title in the Democrats’ plan incensed Republicans: “Requiring a background check for every firearm sale.” But Democratic leadership allowed the bill to move forward with the understanding that a less aggressive, bipartisan compromise, which Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) were working on, would be introduced as an amendment replacing the bill’s central language. The Manchin-Toomey effort was meant to placate the vocal minority against expanding background checks, by focusing solely on internet purchases and gun show sales. The pair also gave their version a revised title: the Second Amendment Rights Protection Act.It was clear that any gun bill was going to face a tough vote. “In my opinion, adopting mandatory federal government background checks for purely private transactions between law-abiding citizens puts us inexorably on the path to a push for a federal registry,” said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).And even if there were background checks, Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) said on the floor, they “would not have prevented any of the recent atrocities that have affected families in our nation.”Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) argued against the proposed assault weapons ban by pointing to the impotence of the previous law, despite changes that would have made the new ban more robust. “It did not stop Columbine,” he said.The Manchin-Toomey measure and Feinstein’s amendment both came to the floor on April 17, 2013, one day after the anniversary of the Virginia Tech shooting and three days before the anniversary of the Columbine massacre.Manchin-Toomey was the first up, and it received 54 votes ― six short of the 60 needed to overcome a Senate filibuster. Of all the proposed measures, it had the best chance of passing, and its defeat set the others up for certain failure. Lautenberg’s high-capacity magazine ban got 46 votes. Feinstein’s amendment received only 40.A little less than two years after those votes, SIG Sauer released its new MCX semi-automatic rifle, which would have been illegal to manufacture under Feinstein’s ban. On June 4, 2016, 29-year-old Omar Mateen purchased one at a gun shop in Port St. Lucie, Florida. Seven days later he walked into the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and shot 102 people. Fifty of them died.It was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said that the Manchin-Toomey measure fell four votes short of overcoming a Senate filibuster. It was six votes short."

The group, which has already been up in arms this year about a Zales ad featuring two women exchanging vows and an American Girl ad starring two dads, wrote on its site that its members “disagree morally” with the magazine’s choice to begin featuring same-sex parents and their kids. The group’s announcement stems from a post on Highlights for Children’s Facebook page from October. Kristina Wertz wrote to the magazine that her daughter loves another publication from Highlights called Hello magazine. The mom also wrote that she and her same-sex partner were “consistently disappointed” by the lack of same-sex parents and their kids in its issues.Highlights replied to the post saying it believes “parents know best” when to discuss same-sex parenting with their kids, prompting many people to speak out against the publication and join in on the hashtag #HighlightLGBTFamilies.On Oct. 17, Highlights apologized on its site for the way it responded and wrote that it was dedicated to being “more reflective of all kinds of families” from here on out. And a few weeks later, the magazine wrote that it strives “to be diverse in every way” and announced that it had plans to include same-sex parents in its pages alongside other families.Whether incorporating families headed up by a grandparent or single parent, or including adoptive families, blended families, same-sex families, multi-generational families, and multi-racial families, our depiction of families is in support of our mission to help children become their best selves and understand that all families, including theirs, are important.That’s where “One Million Moms” comes in. The group is asking for parents to encourage Highlights to “not cave in” and reverse its decision to include these families in its magazines. “This would be a deal breaker for conservative families,” the site reads. “Parents are left with no other choice than to cancel their subscription.”Though some parents have left comments on Highlights’ Facebook page to share their disappointment about the decision, others are celebrating the inclusion of same-sex parents and their families. Many have written that they look forward to buying more subscriptions.Take that, “One Million Moms.” H/T Babble"

Beginning in 2019, eligible films need to demonstrate they’ve attempted to increase diversity behind or in front of the camera. That could include setting a film in a place that’s underrepresented in film, hiring a crew that’s at least 50 percent comprised of underrepresented groups (and bumping them up in the hierarchy), and strategically targeting the movie toward underrepresented groups. BAFTA has also announced that new members will be considered regardless of whether or not someone in the group sponsors them.“This widens the pool of potential members and ensures that it’s only talent, and not also who you know, that enables BAFTA membership,” according to a statement.Despite it being a problem that’s persisted for, you know, decades, social media has made inequality in on-screen representation a buzzy topic. BAFTA’s new standards show a desire to enact meaningful change within the industry. If it’s a successful one, that could help nudge the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to make bigger changes to its eligibility guidelines, as well.BAFTA’s eligibility guidelines are now much more specific than those enforced by the organization that hands out Oscars ― which have, notably, been #SoWhite as of late.Following that criticism, the Academy voted to lift lifetime Oscars voting rights for its 7,000-some member base in January, which will eventually weed out some who have been helping elect winners without having worked in the biz for years ― sometimes decades. At the same time, it pledged to more aggressively recruit members from underrepresented groups, and, over the summer, welcomed its most diverse class of members yet. Films nominated for Oscars, however, aren’t currently held to any criteria regarding representation behind the scenes or in their scripts.Proving their intent to promote diversity might be a difficult task for BAFTA hopefuls. But if they can work it out, they could help incentivize creators overseas to start pushing harder for more equal representation."

But Washington’s local marching bands are staying away. None of the region’s public school marching bands has applied for consideration to perform at Trump’s ceremony next month. The past five presidential inaugurations have included at least one D.C. student marching band.“I think everybody knows why and no one wants to say and lose their job,” Howard University band director John Newson told NBC’s Washington affiliate station WRC-TV. He said Howard’s “Showtime” marching band, which performed at Barack Obama’s first inauguration in 2009, did not apply for the inaugural parade because of budgetary constraints and a shortage of members.But Newson also said the political beliefs of many band leaders and school administrators could be influencing their decisions not to take part in the ceremony.Last month, more than 2,000 D.C. middle school and high school students staged a mass walk-out to protest Trump’s presidential election, leaving their classrooms in the middle of the school day to rally in front of Trump International Hotel.Officials organizing inauguration festivities extended the deadline for bands to apply to participate, but it didn’t make any difference with the D.C.-area performers. In addition to the marching bands in Washington that didn’t apply, no bands from Prince George’s County in Maryland or Arlington County in Virginia put their names in for a chance to perform. A spokesman for Fairfax County public schools was also not aware of any bands that applied, according to WRC-TV. So far, the only musician confirmed for Trump’s inauguration is Jackie Evancho, a 16-year-old classical singer who was the runner-up on “America’s Got Talent” in 2010. "

We have no formal chain of command,” he said.Trump added: “We’re going to make fair trade deals. We’re going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders.”Three of Trump’s adult children, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, sat at the head of a large rectangular table as the meeting began. Their attendance may fuel further concern about potential conflicts of interests for Trump, who has said he would hand over control of his business empire to his children while he occupies the White House.Vice President-elect Mike Pence was also in attendance. Guests sat in front of paper name plates and bottles of water sporting the Trump brand logo.The meeting between tech luminaries, including Apple Inc’s Tim Cook, Facebook Inc’s Sheryl Sandberg and Tesla Motors Inc’s Elon Musk, took place as Trump has alarmed some U.S. corporations with his rhetoric challenging long-established policy toward China, a main market for Silicon Valley.A senior Chinese state planning official told the China Daily newspaper Wednesday that Beijing could slap a penalty on a U.S. automaker for monopolistic behavior, a warning delivered days after Trump questioned acknowledging Taiwan as part of “one China.”The official did not identify the automaker.The tech summit is being billed as an introductory session, said sources briefed on the talks.Several company executives thanked Trump for hosting the meeting during introductions attended by reporters. Sandberg said she was most interested in discussing job creation.Other expected participants include Alphabet Inc’s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, Amazon.com’s Jeff Bezos, Microsoft Corp’s Satya Nadella, and Ginni Rometty from IBM, sources said.Twitter was not invited to the meeting because it was too small, a transition spokesman told Reuters.Cook and Musk will join Trump for a separate meeting after the other technology executives leave, a spokesman for Trump’s transition team said.The CEOs of Airbnb and Uber were invited but are not attending. Uber’s Travis Kalanick will instead be traveling in India all week, according to a person familiar with his plans.Bezos said in a statement the meeting was “very productive” and that he “shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech - agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing -everywhere.”’SOME HESITATION’Trump clashed with Silicon Valley on several issues during the election campaign, including immigration, government surveillance and encryption, and his surprise victory last month alarmed many companies that feared he might follow through on his pledges. He has said that many tech companies are overvalued by investors.“You look at some of these tech stocks that are so, so weak as a concept and a company and they’re selling for so much money,” he told Reuters in an interview in May.Those concerns have not been assuaged in recent weeks as Trump has threatened to upset trade relationships with China and appoint officials who favor expanded surveillance programs.“For some of the companies, there was some hesitation about whether to attend” because of sharp political and personal differences with Trump, one tech industry source said.More than 600 employees of technology companies pledged in an open letter on Tuesday to refuse to help Trump’s administration build a data registry to track people based on their religion or assist in mass deportations.Silicon Valley enjoyed a warm rapport with President Barack Obama and heavily supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign.Schmidt was photographed on election night at Clinton headquarters wearing a staff badge, and Musk said in interviews before the election that Trump’s character reflected poorly on the United States.Despite those tensions, Trump named Musk to a business advisory council that will give private-sector input to Trump after he takes office on Jan. 20. Uber’s Kalanick was also appointed to the council.From the employees of the 10 largest Fortune 500 tech companies, Trump raised just $179,400 from 982 campaign donors who contributed more than $200. Clinton raised $4.4 million from the employees of the same companies, with more than 20,400 donations, a Reuters review of contribution data found.Trump publicly bashed the industry during the campaign. He urged his supporters to boycott Apple products over the company’s refusal to help the FBI unlock an iPhone associated with last year’s San Bernardino, California, shootings, threatened antitrust action against Amazon and demanded that tech companies build their products in the United States.Trump has also been an opponent of the Obama administration’s “net neutrality” rules barring internet service providers from obstructing or slowing consumer access to web content. Two advisers to his Federal Communications Commission transition team are opponents of the rules, as are the two Republicans on the FCC.Last week, the two Republicans on the panel urged a quick reversal of many Obama policies and one, Commissioner Ajit Pai, said he believed that net neutrality’s “days are numbered.”(Additional reporting by David Shepardson, Andy Sullivan, Grant Smith, Heather Somerville, Steve Holland, Jim Finkle and Jeffrey Dastin; Editing by Alistair Bell and Grant McCool)"

We’re going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders.”Three of Trump’s adult children, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, sat at the head of a large rectangular table as the meeting began. Their attendance may fuel further concern about potential conflicts of interests for Trump, who has said he would hand over control of his business empire to his children while he occupies the White House.Vice President-elect Mike Pence was also in attendance. Guests sat in front of paper name plates and bottles of water sporting the Trump brand logo.The meeting between tech luminaries, including Apple Inc’s Tim Cook, Facebook Inc’s Sheryl Sandberg and Tesla Motors Inc’s Elon Musk, took place as Trump has alarmed some U.S. corporations with his rhetoric challenging long-established policy toward China, a main market for Silicon Valley.A senior Chinese state planning official told the China Daily newspaper Wednesday that Beijing could slap a penalty on a U.S. automaker for monopolistic behavior, a warning delivered days after Trump questioned acknowledging Taiwan as part of “one China.”The official did not identify the automaker.The tech summit is being billed as an introductory session, said sources briefed on the talks.Several company executives thanked Trump for hosting the meeting during introductions attended by reporters. Sandberg said she was most interested in discussing job creation.Other expected participants include Alphabet Inc’s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, Amazon.com’s Jeff Bezos, Microsoft Corp’s Satya Nadella, and Ginni Rometty from IBM, sources said.Twitter was not invited to the meeting because it was too small, a transition spokesman told Reuters.Cook and Musk will join Trump for a separate meeting after the other technology executives leave, a spokesman for Trump’s transition team said.The CEOs of Airbnb and Uber were invited but are not attending. Uber’s Travis Kalanick will instead be traveling in India all week, according to a person familiar with his plans.Bezos said in a statement the meeting was “very productive” and that he “shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech - agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing -everywhere.”’SOME HESITATION’Trump clashed with Silicon Valley on several issues during the election campaign, including immigration, government surveillance and encryption, and his surprise victory last month alarmed many companies that feared he might follow through on his pledges. He has said that many tech companies are overvalued by investors.“You look at some of these tech stocks that are so, so weak as a concept and a company and they’re selling for so much money,” he told Reuters in an interview in May.Those concerns have not been assuaged in recent weeks as Trump has threatened to upset trade relationships with China and appoint officials who favor expanded surveillance programs.“For some of the companies, there was some hesitation about whether to attend” because of sharp political and personal differences with Trump, one tech industry source said.More than 600 employees of technology companies pledged in an open letter on Tuesday to refuse to help Trump’s administration build a data registry to track people based on their religion or assist in mass deportations.Silicon Valley enjoyed a warm rapport with President Barack Obama and heavily supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign.Schmidt was photographed on election night at Clinton headquarters wearing a staff badge, and Musk said in interviews before the election that Trump’s character reflected poorly on the United States.Despite those tensions, Trump named Musk to a business advisory council that will give private-sector input to Trump after he takes office on Jan. 20. Uber’s Kalanick was also appointed to the council.From the employees of the 10 largest Fortune 500 tech companies, Trump raised just $179,400 from 982 campaign donors who contributed more than $200. Clinton raised $4.4 million from the employees of the same companies, with more than 20,400 donations, a Reuters review of contribution data found.Trump publicly bashed the industry during the campaign. He urged his supporters to boycott Apple products over the company’s refusal to help the FBI unlock an iPhone associated with last year’s San Bernardino, California, shootings, threatened antitrust action against Amazon and demanded that tech companies build their products in the United States.Trump has also been an opponent of the Obama administration’s “net neutrality” rules barring internet service providers from obstructing or slowing consumer access to web content. Two advisers to his Federal Communications Commission transition team are opponents of the rules, as are the two Republicans on the FCC.Last week, the two Republicans on the panel urged a quick reversal of many Obama policies and one, Commissioner Ajit Pai, said he believed that net neutrality’s “days are numbered.”(Additional reporting by David Shepardson, Andy Sullivan, Grant Smith, Heather Somerville, Steve Holland, Jim Finkle and Jeffrey Dastin; Editing by Alistair Bell and Grant McCool)"

In fact it’s one of the reasons she’s dedicated her life to turning others’ hate into self-love and positivity. The Mexican-American motivational speaker and author is one of only a few people in the world who have neonatal progeroid syndrome. The rare condition makes it impossible for Velasquez to weigh more than 64 pounds and has left her blind in one eye. But all her work spreading love hasn’t stopped bullies from targeting the 27-year-old online for her appearance. Velasquez recently found a photo of her being used in a cruel meme. And on Sunday, she spoke out against it in a Facebook post.“I’ve seen a ton of memes like this all over Facebook recently,” Velasquez wrote. “I’m writing this post not as someone who is a victim but as someone who is using their voice. Yes, it’s very late at night as I type this but I do so as a reminder that the innocent people that are being put in these memes are probably up just as late scrolling through Facebook and feeling something that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.”Velasquez also took time in her message to remind others that they should focus on love not hate when posting or sharing memes on the Internet. “No matter what we look like or what size we are, at the end of the day we are all human,” she wrote. “I ask that you keep that in mind the next time you see a viral meme of a random stranger. At the time you might find it hilarious but the human in the photo is probably feeling the exact opposite. Spread love not hurtful words via a screen.” In March, Valasquez spoke to The Huffington Post about how she’d “never ever forget” the day she found a video online labeling her as “The World’s Ugliest Woman.” She was 17 at the time.

57,POLITICS,It's Hard To Overstate How Anti-Environment Donald Trump's Cabinet Picks Are,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-anti-environment_us_58507c5ae4b0ee009eb44512,"""President-elect Trump is creating a government of, by, and for the oil and gas industry,"" one advocate said.",2016-12-14,Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson was Trump's choice for secretary of state.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58507d3d1800002d00e4278c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rex Tillerson at the State Department. Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency. Rick Perry at the Department of Energy. Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice.If environmentalists found themselves in some kind of paralyzing hypnagogia on Nov. 9, the day they realized that there was no waking up from this was Dec. 13.Tillerson is the CEO of Exxon Mobil, a company that spent decades and millions of dollars supporting climate change denial and is currently under investigation for doing so. Tillerson has personally argued that climate change is no biggie because “we will adapt to this.” If he’s confirmed as secretary of state, he will be in the position of deciding whether the U.S. stays involved in the Paris climate agreement and whether to approve massive international oil pipelines like Keystone XL.Pruitt is the attorney general of Oklahoma and has described himself as “a leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda.” He is currently suing the EPA ― the agency he could lead ― to stop the Obama administration’s regulatory effort to curb emissions from power plants, and he was caught letting oil industry lawyers draft letters to regulators on his behalf.Perry, the former Republican governor of Texas, is expected to be nominated to lead a department whose name he once famously forgot while pledging to eliminate it. He has said that climate change is just a “theory that remains unproven” and that climate scientists have “manipulated data to keep the money rolling in.” A few years ago, Perry’s top environmental officials in Texas removed all mentions of climate change from a report on rising sea levels in Galveston Bay. There are already signs that the Trump team wants to undertake a climate purge at the Energy Department; transition officials sent a questionnaire to the department last week, asking for the names of employees who had worked on the issue.There’s also Sessions, who as the country’s top law enforcement official, would oversee both enforcement of environmental regulations and the government’s defense against legal challenges to those rules. The Alabama senator regularly recites the talking points of climate change deniers, dismisses the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists that global warming is caused by human activity, and once suggested that addressing climate change is a conspiracy against the world’s poor.The Washington Post and Politico reported Tuesday evening that Trump will pick Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) to lead the Department of Interior, another important slot for environmental issues. Interior’s purview includes public lands, such as national parks, wildlife refuges and the outer continental shelf, as well as endangered species and tribal affairs. The freshman member has said that selling off public lands is a “non-starter,” but he also thinks that climate change is “not proven science.”Environmental groups are, understandably, not psyched about these picks.“With these nominations, it’s clearer than ever that Donald Trump is hoping to install the most anti-environmental cabinet in our nation’s history,” said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, in a statement. Trump’s Cabinet picks would promote “a polluter paradise that is completely at odds with public support for protecting our air, water, lands and wildlife,” Karpinski said.“President-elect Trump is creating a government of, by, and for the oil and gas industry,” stated Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Never before have we seen such a concentration of extreme wealth and privilege in a single cabinet.”Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, called Trump’s Cabinet “a nightmare for the planet, and the fossil fuel industry’s dream come true.”“Trump’s picks represent a who’s who of climate-deniers and fossil fuel hacks with devastatingly long records of assaulting our environment, proving that his head fakes to keep our air and water clean are nothing but cons,” said Brune.

58,POLITICS,Vladimir Putin's Popularity Is Skyrocketing Among Republicans,Nick Bayer,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vladimir-putin-popularity-republicans_us_58518a3ce4b092f08686bd6e,"The guy is accused of manipulating U.S. politics and enabling the killing in Aleppo, and his favorability rating goes up.

Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and many other high-profile politicians.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58518b74120000c40beef485.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s net favorable rating among Republicans has climbed by an astonishing 56 percentage points since July 2014, according to a new YouGov/Economist poll. Thirty-seven percent of Republicans polled hold a very or somewhat favorable opinion of Putin, while 47 percent hold a very or somewhat unfavorable opinion of him. Though still negative overall, that -10 percentage point net approval rating represents a drastic increase from 2014, when Putin’s net favorable rating stood at -66 points among Republicans, according to YouGov Elections Editor Will Jordan. Democrats’ attitudes toward Putin, on the other hand, have grown even more negative since 2014. His net favorable rating among Democrats sits at -62 points in the new YouGov/Economist poll, down from -54 points in 2014.Overall, 21 percent of Americans polled report a favorable opinion of the Russian president, while 56 percent hold an unfavorable opinion. Much like President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, 9 in 10 Republicans describe Putin as a strong leader. Nonetheless, about 7 in 10 say they’re confident in Trump’s ability to “handle Russia.” By contrast, only 28 percent of Republicans say they have confidence in the CIA.Despite this, 58 percent of Americans overall believe Russia is unfriendly or an enemy to the U.S. That number drops slightly to 52 percent among Republicans and 56 percent among declared Trump voters. As Syria’s bloody civil war grinds on, Putin has supported Syrian leader Bashar Assad and the pro-government forces that are reportedly slaughtering civilians in the battle for the city of Aleppo. Speculations over Putin’s involvement in U.S. politics and the 2016 election have been in the spotlight as well.A CIA assessment released this week found evidence that Russia did in fact interfere with the U.S. presidential election to help Trump win. Back in July, the Democratic National Committee email leaks were attributed to Russian hackers.Among Americans who believe the Russian government is responsible for hacking into the DNC, 68 percent believe the motive was to help elect Trump, according to the YouGov/Economist poll. Another 25 percent believe the purpose was to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system."

Assad’s government is cautiously optimistic that the incoming Trump administration will reduce its international isolation and aid it in its efforts to reclaim all of Syria from armed groups that include relative moderates known as the Free Syrian Army, the brutal Islamic State organization and a local offshoot of al Qaeda, according to sources in frequent contact with officials in Damascus. The U.S. and Europe have imposed heavy sanctions on the Assad regime since 2011, when it violently responded to peaceful protests against the leader’s repressive rule. Though Assad’s tactics have only become more vicious since, with the latest assault on Aleppo threatening thousands of civilians, it would be possible for a new U.S. administration to reverse the policy President Barack Obama laid out — and Donald Trump has made it clear that he does not see Assad as his chief worry in Syria.“Damascus is optimistic on the incoming Trump cabinet,” Kamal Alam, a fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London and Levant consultant for the analysis firm Hoplite Group, told HuffPost in an email. “It does not guide their policy ― as they know the main policy shift will not change the battleground ― however, abolishing support to the FSA by the Americans will make it far easier for Damascus.”The Assad regime is interested in high-level communications with Trump’s White House once it launches a review of overt and covert U.S. policy toward Syria, a nongovernmental U.S.-based source with long-standing relationships with the regime told HuffPost. “They have no issues dealing with anyone so long as that person is authorized to really get this thing done,” he said.“Building trust with Damascus will not be easy given the minimal amount of direct contact between D.C. and Damascus over the last five years,” Alam said. “The first step would be reaching out to Damascus directly rather than going through Russia or Iran or other regional allies. There needs to be direct communication.” Alam cited recently published articles in The National Interest and The New Yorker as “encouraging signs” that the prospect of dealing with Assad is becoming less controversial in the U.S. However, the source denied rumors that Trump’s team and figures close to Assad are already in touch. In November, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump’s son, Donald Jr., had met with Syrians close to Moscow and discussed ways to end the war while keeping Assad in power. The Trump team did not respond to a request for comment for this story.Trump has repeatedly said he believes he can fully defeat the Islamic State group; accomplishing that rapidly is understood to be a top priority for him. He has also said he believes Assad and his primary allies, Russia and Iran, are battling the the militant group, also known as ISIS (despite evidence they have focused their attention elsewhere).“Any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission,” Trump said in September.Combined with the president-elect’s talk of strengthened ties with Moscow, his criticism of the humanitarian norms the Syrian regime regularly violates and his fascination with undemocratic strongmen, this kind of thinking suggests a rosier future for Assad. The Syrian ruler has long disliked Washington’s talk of promoting democracy and human rights abroad, noted Joshua Landis, a Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma. With Trump’s election, “Assad is hopeful, more hopeful than he has been in the past, because he can see that that ideology … its due date seems to be arriving,” Landis said. There’s added evidence for this shift in the fact that Trump often speaks admiringly of authoritarian Russia without inspiring much backlash. It’s a sign, Peter Beinart wrote for The Atlantic, that ideological conservatives committed to spreading liberal democracy and capitalism are losing ground in the ruling Republican Party to civilizational conservatives who are more interested in what they see as a battle between the Judeo-Christian world and Islam. Assad is well-liked in these conservative circles because of his narrative that he is standing up to radical Islamists and his courting of Syrian Christians wary of Islam. In an interview released Wednesday on Russian state television, the Syrian ruler said Trump could be “a natural ally.” But there’s one big problem.“At the beginning, of course, they were happy,” the source said. “Since the new names have been filling up the posts in the administration, there’s an anti-Iran stand and that’s a really interesting new twist.”Trump’s chosen national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and his Pentagon pick, Gen. Jim Mattis, are both skeptical of Iran, which has seen its power in Syria grow significantly during the civil war. Disavowing Tehran is not an option for Assad.“If Syria were to renounce military aid from Iran, which is what the West wants them to do, the regime would be changed overnight,” Landis said. “Why would Russia want to pay for the whole thing?” Iran’s influence has been clear in the battle for Aleppo, with cease-fire efforts Tuesday and Wednesday stalling because Iran’s rulers want any agreement to take place on their terms ― not just those of Russia and Assad.The hope in Assad’s circle is that the U.S. can see its approaches to Syria and to Iran as separate issues, the source said, the way Russia is able to balance relationships with both Syria and Israel despite their animosity for each other. For all Trump’s criticism of Obama, that approach would echo the outgoing administration. It insisted for years that its nuclear diplomacy with Iran was completely separate from its policy on Syria. Just as Trump has pledged to, Obama also spent significant time seeking a Syria bargain with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin ― one reason, The New York Times recently reported, that the president’s team did not want to go public with intelligence findings showing Russian involvement in the 2016 election. Obama “allowed Russia to win, which is more or less the Trump policy. Trump was only being honest about a policy that Obama had already put in place,” Landis said. A proponent of the idea that Assad’s army is the key force in the ISIS fight, Alam thinks the Trump administration should remember the limits of Iran’s power in Syria. “Moscow and Tehran do not directly interfere in domestic Syrian politics, and whilst they have provided considerable battlefield support, it does not translate into a strategy on what to do with local politics,” he wrote.Still, the Iran news has dampened dreams in Damascus.“They understand that the incoming administration is a little unpredictable and could be quite dramatically opposite to their rosy scenario,” the source said. “I don’t think they have any misplaced hope.” This explains the regime’s commitment to retaking Aleppo and making further gains as soon as it can, before the Obama policy ― a major gift to Assad’s hopes ― potentially dies. “The decision has been made to proceed as if nothing really has changed,” the source told HuffPost. For those in Damascus and in Trump’s circles who do seek a real shift, including potentially the president-elect himself, history offers an example ― albeit a troubling one. Syria was a linchpin of the torture and rendition program run by the Bush administration following 9/11. At a time when civil rights and liberties were disregarded in favor of a largely ineffective counter-terror strategy, Washington chose to ignore Damascus’ excesses because it was convenient.“It was always ludicrous to accept assurances from the Syrian regime that no one was tortured,” Katherine Hawkins, senior counsel at The Constitution Project, told HuffPost. The U.S. has yet to acknowledge its role in sending terror suspects to Assad’s notorious jails, Hawkins continued, but Assad has spoken of it publicly ― thus strategically embarrassing his former partners. That level of cooperation is unlikely to be re-established, the analysts said. They believe a more realistic goal for Assad is to simply hope that the U.S. stays out of his way and eventually becomes willing to forge deals of limited scope with him, as it did with his father in the 1990s.“Assad believes that he can rebuild Syria without the United States,” Landis said. “As long as the United States does not block him.”This post has been updated with Assad’s comment released Wednesday that Trump could be “a natural ally.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Circuit Court of Appeals.Just as the Senate Republican leadership promised immediately upon Scalia’s death, there has been no action on filling the Supreme Court vacancy: no hearing or vote in committee; no floor debate in the full Senate; and no final confirmation vote. In short, it was a total blockade of the constitutionally mandated process to ensure a full complement of nine justices on the highest court.There’s been less publicity about the other vacancies that have languished in federal district and circuit courts across the country. When the Senate adjourned, there were 98 other unfilled vacancies on courts that hear cases and render decisions that impact every aspect of our lives including where we can go to school, the quality of our air and water, our access to a decent job, whom we can marry, and our ability to choose if and when to become parents. Truth be told, the Supreme Court hears fewer than 100 cases while the lower federal courts are the last word on hundreds of thousands of cases.Some vacancies have been officially classified as judicial emergencies because they’ve resulted in extreme backlogs in cases. When the 114th Congress began there were 12 such emergencies. That number has grown to 38.Let’s back up a bit and look at the process. When a federal court vacancy occurs, the two U.S. senators from the state with the vacancy traditionally cooperate on recommending nominees to the sitting president. That’s pretty much how the process has worked during the Obama administration.The Senate Judiciary Committee has another way to ensure that nominees have home-state senators’ support—it’s called the blue slip. Honored by judiciary committee chairs from both parties, this practice requires each home-state senator to return a blue paper slip, indicating that they are ok with the confirmation process going forward—whether or not they will ultimately vote for or against the nominee.This is the case with the 25 judicial nominees who have had a hearing and been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee—some more than half a year ago. These non-controversial, well qualified men and women were blockaded by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who played politics with the judiciary at the expense of many thousands of people awaiting their day in court. As a point of reference, after the 2008 election there were no nominees named by President George W. Bush left over. Today, after the 2016 election, the Senate left with 25 nominees in limbo.Now that the Senate has adjourned and gone home without acting on filling these vacancies, it is up to the next president to fill all the judicial vacancies including those held open by unprecedented and brazen partisan scheming.There are scenarios circulating by which the Senate could act on filling these vacancies before the new president is sworn in—unlikely but intriguing. But It’s not too early to let our senators know that we want them to insist that these 25 nominees be re-nominated by the next president. These vacancies have languished far too long already. Why not fill them expeditiously with qualified, consensus nominees who have already gone through the vetting process?"

Five days with the Rohingya, who some call the most persecuted people on earth. Five days of attempted witness. Five days of peeling back the veil of a slow genocide. Five days of descent into their horror. Five days of seeing, even so briefly, what it is like to be stripped of birthplace, nationality, freedom, opportunity, land, education, jobs, food, health care, and finally, the right to your own name. Five days of warmth from a people who are told by their government that they do not deserve to be alive.I wrote the above on the day I left Sittwe, Myanmar, after wrapping production on Behind The Fence, a virtual reality documentary that I directed with my colleague Jonathan Olinger. This is my first virtual reality film, Executive Produced by The Nexus Fund. We chose VR because the situation facing the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar is so dire and little known, that we hoped this nascent technology could amplify their entrapment to a world that has the power to prevent their annihilation. I could talk about the challenges of making a 360 film, what cameras we used or how we even got access to the camps, but I hope all of that disappears when you watch Behind The Fence. Be transported to the camps the Rohingya are forced to live in; and not to be a voyeur of their suffering, but to let your witness become solidarity. They do not need spectators.What you will see in this film is the story of a group of people called the Rohingya, a Muslim minority in Myanmar, who are surviving a Buddhist-led campaign to eliminate them.You will see Abul rubbing his wife’s shoulders and spending his entire income, 50 cents, on three apples, because she asked. You will see Abul arranging the sticks under his wife’s chair so that it is level, giving her some small comfort despite her pain, for which there is no hospital to take her to, nor medicine to buy. You will see Abul asking to be recognized by his ancient name, Rohingya. You will see a religious leader digging small graves for small bodies. You will see a young girl collapsed in tears over her dead father. You will see what life is like for people who live in confinement. This is not just another refugee camp ― this is systematic and calculated elimination.When I left the concentration camps the Rohingya live in, I penned these words as a feeble effort to express what should not exist.I am born thus.Must it condemn me to die?Landless, stateless,banished behind barbed wire.I do not breathe your air,mine is constricted and I chokewith the death of the young.The boats go out to sea at midnight,carrying all those who will try to buy their freedom.They know not the waters will become their grave.I see smoke on the horizon,I feel the pulse of rain.I hear the call to prayer.Gaunt and shadowed bodies,move like powder in the morning light.They dig their own graves,clinging at least to the right to choose their resting place.Grant us at least this.Penned in to die,a low hum vibration stillrises up from this corner of the earth.A frequency only a few hear.And if you are one, it is a siren.I invite you to experience Behind The Fence and learn about this group of people who have a name. Speak it out loud, and respond to this siren, which can not be forgotten once heard."
63,THE WORLDPOST,Why Putin and the Populists Love Each Other Deeply,"Julian Baggini, ContributorFounding editor, The Philosophers’ Magazine; Academic board me...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/putin-trump-populists_us_58506581e4b0ee009eb41e14,Populism's strength is homegrown. Putin is merely fanning the flames.,2016-12-14,"Le Pen visits a horse show in Villepinte, France, on Dec. 2.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58506fe91c00002f000eb5e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LONDON ― All over the West, populists have an unusual poster boy: Russian President Vladimir Putin. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far-right National Front party, has praised his model “of reasoned protectionism, looking after the interests of his own country, defending his identity.” U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has been repeatedly effusive in his admiration for the Russian president. Even Greece’s left-wing party, Syriza, has defended Russian actions in Ukraine and opposed sanctions.To everyone else, this seems bizarre. Putin is a man who, according to the Guardian, “has startled and worried the world with his bold and willful policies” and who The New York Times says is undermining both NATO and European democracy and whose “aggressive behavior ... could result in the kind of dangerous miscalculations that often lead to armed conflict.”It’s easy to view the populists as foolish innocents who have fallen for a scheming scoundrel. After all, we have reason to think that Putin’s Russia is engaged in wholesale political manipulation, in part from its interference in the U.S. presidential election, its establishment of an “army” of internet trolls and its ramping up of Russia-sponsored media in European languages. Its next target appears to be the 2017 elections in Germany and France.But to see the populists as hapless victims of Kremlin manipulation is to underestimate the genuine admiration they have for the qualities Putin represents. It may well end in tears, but this is no marriage of convenience: this is true love. If we want to know why so many voters have fallen for the populists, we need to understand why the populists have fallen for Putin.The answers are not so difficult to find. Pick virtually any defining feature of populism, and you’ll find it reflected in Putin. This might sound perverse, given that one of the only things populists agree on is their disdain for elites, and as an ex-KGB man with almost absolute power at home, Putin is hardly an outsider. But populist resentment has never been directed at all elites ― just at the wrong kind, those who comprise the political mainstream, who have led Western democracies for the decades since World War II. That is why the rich and powerful Donald Trump can be seen as anti-elitist: he belongs to an elite, but not the Washington or Brussels one. Putin similarly belongs to a Russian elite, but not to the Western liberal establishment.Populism is fueled mainly by anger directed at this political class, and Putin is fighting the same power. To see this merely as the cold realpolitik opportunism that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” underestimates how strongly people can be bound by what they oppose: a shared hatred can form the basis of a mutual love.Putin’s other characteristics also appeal to populist sentiment. Strong leadership is admired by populists because it is seen as necessary to counter the equally strong vested interests that stand between the people and the exercise of their will. Putin shares their debased view of what democracy really means: tapping into the simple, unified will of the people and executing it. For populists, majority support mandates absolute rule, and even Putin’s strongest critics accept that he has, for most of his tenure at least, commanded the support of the majority in Russia.Liberal democracy, in contrast, believes that the will of the people is not simple, and it must be mediated through democratic institutions that ameliorate extremes and protect minorities from majorities. For populists, this is just code for the liberal elite not getting on with what the people want but diluting the popular will to suit their own agendas.That is one of the main reasons why populism is such a threat to democracy as we know it. Populism doesn’t have any real respect for the rule of law. It believes that sovereignty does not lie in Parliament or stable democratic institutions but simply in the most recent electoral mandate given by the majority of the people. Institutions that liberals view as protecting the fundamental values of democracy are seen as obstacles to democracy by populists. Hence, Trump’s dismissal of the electoral process as “rigged” (until he won, of course) and the accusation that judges ruling on the need for the U.K. Parliament to vote on withdrawal from the EU are “enemies of the people.” We should not be surprised that such people do not see Putin’s disregard for the rule of law in Russia as a problem. If the law doesn’t suit, just change it. This is what William Partlett of the Brookings Institution calls “rule by law.”Then, of course, we have Putin’s nationalism. Populists on the left and right are united in their desire to return power from faceless and unaccountable international institutions and trade agreements to sovereign nations. This turn inward makes no sense without a strong sense of nationhood, whether it is based on pure ethnicity or not. In this respect, Putin is marching in lock step with nationalists and has shown in Crimea and Ukraine that he is willing to use force to (as he sees it) protect Russians inside or outside national borders, as well as to protect the territorial integrity of the nation. The final point of compatibility is a broader rejection of liberal values. Many populists are religiously conservative and opposed to multiculturalism. Putin’s facilitation of the regrowth of the Russian Orthodox Church’s influence has endeared him to those who want to see a greater role for the church in their own countries. Even those who are not religious like the sense of a return to “traditional” values that such moves represent. At the very least, the assertion of the national religion is also an assertion of the value of the dominant, heterogeneous, indigenous culture.Of course, it is true that Putin is interested in supporting nationalists for his own ends. Populism undermines European unity and so provides an opportunity for Russia to increase its sphere of influence and interference. But to focus too much on the Kremlin’s political meddling is to fall for just the kind of paranoid global conspiracy theories that so many populists play on and deflects attention from the homegrown causes of populism and its threat.To take the affair between Putin and the populists seriously requires us to understand why true love has a role to play. Liberals underestimate the attractions of nationalism, tradition and strong leadership. Populists believe in Putin-style authoritarian democracy that plays by the rules of elections but has little or no regard for the essentially pluralistic nature of Western democracies in which negotiation, compromise and rule of law all matter as much as the decision of the majority on any given day. For those who reassure themselves that Putin is a peculiarly Soviet revanchist, the likes of which Europeans would never fall for, the populists provide a sobering wake-up call. "
64,THE WORLDPOST,What's Happening In Aleppo Is the West's Failure,"Thomas Lahey, ContributorJ.D.

CNN International ran several videos posted on Periscope and Facebook of people recording what they may well have believed would be their final testament to the world and their followers.Millions expressed outrage at Assad’s regime, which seems to be murdering people in cold blood as forces go house to house in their effort to capture the rebel’s last main stronghold.There are reports of men, women and children being shot in their beds, in the streets and their bodies lay prostrate where they fell.Here’s the thing though: these are not new images. Assad did not just suddenly start killing his own people in cold blood this week and in Aleppo only. This has been going on for years, since the rebellion began and, let’s be honest, before the Arab Spring occurred. He has been a murderous, sociopathic thug for decades.Only now, after a several year long hiatus, the Western public seems to notice, again. Never mind the airstrikes led by Russia that deliberately target schools and hospitals. Never mind the Assad regime’s clear record of torture, mass murder, the use of illegal biological weapons against its own people, and a war that has claimed the lives of close to 300,000 innocent Syrians.We had the chance to intervene and save lives. We chose to do nothing.The images you see in Aleppo are disturbing. That is why, in 2013, President Obama asked Congress to authorize the use of force against the Assad regime for the crimes he had already committed up until that point. Congress refused.That is why former Prime Minister David Cameron asked Parliament to approve airstrikes against regime targets and allow for the British military to directly intervene where humanitarian concerns were of the utmost significance. Parliament refused in 2013 and finally acceded in 2015. Too little, too late.Hindsight is indeed 20/20. Those of us who have been urging Western governments to get serious and intervene on behalf of the Syrian people, not just the rebels, feel like only now that it’s too late, our voices are being heard.The West has had a difficult go at interventionism in the last two decades. No one is denying that. The battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan continue to cost the US and allies the lives of its servicemen and women, and the scars of those wars are still fresh on the minds of Americans, and indeed the world.The public is war-weary, and skeptical of politicians telling us that intervening is in our national interest and for the good of the world order.We know that interventionism can be messy. Even if done properly, outcomes cannot be guaranteed and the transition to peace can be long and frail.But we have also seen what not intervening can lead to. Genocide, starvation, mass-displacement. The effective destruction of a people by their own rulers.The Syrian tragedy is not just measured in fatalities, either. Millions of Syrians have been displaced and forced to flee their homeland to seek peace and shelter. Instead, they are treated with hostility in our nations, and fascism has risen in eastern and central Europe, extremist parties are on the rise in western Europe, and anti-Muslim populism and fear-mongering (as well as just general xenophobia) is as prominent as it was in the 1960’s in America.Strategic partners in the Middle East have become destabilised, with Lebanon and Jordan having to accept millions of Syrians, while dealing with their own domestic issues as well.Turkey has become unpredictable, with political upheaval, a domestic insurgency among the Kurdish population, and 2.7 million Syrians living in camps along its southern border. Turkey has the most displaced Syrians of any nation in the world.And to think that we could have prevented this. Three years is an eternity when it comes to armed conflict. Three years ago, we could have acted to topple the Assad regime and prevent the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings. We could have avoided the refugee crisis altogether. We could have kept Russia away from Middle East politics.We could have stopped it.So, while you tweet about Donald Trump meeting with Kanye West today in Manhattan, don’t let your guilty conscience get in the way of the false reality you have constructed for yourself. It’s not enough to share images of the victims of genocide. One must act.We, the collective Western world, having claimed moral superiority since the defeat of fascism in 1945 and of communism in 1991, have utterly and completely failed to live up to our own standards. We heard the please for help, and we chose to do nothing. The isolationism of the likes of Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders convinced us that what’s happening in Syria isn’t our problem.If we really are to claim the title of the last superpower, defender of freedom and liberty, then we should act like it.So for all of you who now are claiming moral outrage about what’s happening in Aleppo, save it.Think on your sins."

While some scientists of the time were expecting a world much like our own, one filled with rivers, oceans, and maybe even life, Mariner’s images instead unveiled a heavily-cratered surface, not unlike the Moon’s. That’s why it was such a surprise when later NASA missions, such as Viking, benefiting from improved technology, revealed a martian landscape more like our Earth’s. These newer images showed large fluvial features in ancient terrains, including the ancient river valley networks, inferred to have formed nearly 4 billion years ago. Therefore, many have argued that Mars may have once possessed a warmer climate, perhaps with a thicker atmosphere that could have supported potentially habitable conditions. Such a warmer early Mars may have been more “Earth-like” in many ways. So, it may be natural to wonder: How Earth-like does a planet need to be to host life? Did Mars ever have life? Does Mars have life now? Scientists operating on Mars could address these and similar questions that ultimately stem from one overriding question: Are we alone in the universe?The size and scope of the ancient martian valley networks are impressive. Often hundreds of meters deep, and extending for hundreds of kilometers, these immense fluvial features likely required a climate that was warm enough, at least transiently, to have produced enough rain (or snow) to carve them. These valleys would have been difficult to form in a cold climate because much of the water would have been present as ice instead. To be fair, salty water ― known as brines ― perhaps flowing from underground sources, could remain in liquid form at below freezing temperatures. However, it is difficult to envision how a sufficient volume of briny flows to form these massive features could be produced in a cold climate with little precipitation. If the atmosphere was also significantly thinner than the Earth’s, even if surface life had arisen in such a cold climate, that life would have had to contend with less protection from harmful radiation.Likewise, life has yet to be found on today’s martian surface. The average surface temperatures are well below the freezing point of water. Furthermore, the combination of a tenuous atmosphere and lack of a magnetic field allow harmful solar and cosmic rays to pass through and impact the surface. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that microbial life may currently be living in the planet’s subsurface, shielded from the worst of the radiation. And even if no life exists today, extinct organisms from earlier times may be preserved underground as fossils, waiting to be unearthed by explorers from Earth.Moreover, Mars lends itself better to manned scientific exploration than does our other neighbors. For example, modern spacecraft cannot withstand the crushing atmospheric pressures and infernal surface temperatures of Venus. The surface of Venus also appears to have undergone periodic gigantic volcanic eruptions that have engulfed the entire planet in lava numerous times, destroying any potential evidence of fluvial features from an earlier period. Mercury is too hot and close to the Sun. The atmospheres of both the Moon and Mercury are too thin to have ever sustained substantial amounts of liquid water on their surfaces for a significant amount of time, even if both worlds may have some water ice residing in permanently shadowed regions. Thus, Mars presents a unique opportunity as the only neighboring world that exhibits clear observational evidence of a climate that was once warm and wet enough to create extensive fluvial features across its surface, often similar to ones seen on our Earth.If we imagine that explorers from Earth find fossils proving that life had existed on Mars during this hypothetical early warm period (assuming that scientists rule out possible microbial contamination from the Earth), it may suggest that life has a high probability of emerging under atmospheric conditions not unlike those on our planet. However, even on Earth, we know that certain organisms thrive in extreme conditions very unlike those you or I experience daily on the surface. These extremophiles can withstand extreme heat, cold, acidity, pressures, and even salt content, all at levels that would be deadly to most other Earth life. What if similar hardy micro-organisms are thriving today on Mars’ cold, dry, and irradiated surface? We can only definitively answer such questions by sending scientists to Mars who are dedicated to finding evidence of past or present life. The results of such an endeavor would clarify our perspective as to what is possible even as we speculate about life on the more distant targets of Europa, Enceladus, Titan, and (ultimately) exoplanets.Humans on Mars is not a capricious whim, but rather is an imperative to scientific progress.

He said he shared the president-elect’s “vision for restoring the credibility of the United States’ foreign relations and advancing our country’s national security.”Trump picked Tillerson, 64, after the Texan was backed by several Republican establishment figures, including former Secretary of State James Baker, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a senior transition official said.Rice and Gates, who have worked for Exxon as consultants, both issued statements of support on Tuesday.Their support is seen as crucial to helping Tillerson get past a possibly contentious Senate confirmation battle likely to focus on his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, who also was under consideration for the secretary of state job, said in a statement that he would hold a nomination hearing in early January. He called Tillerson “a very impressive individual” with “an extraordinary working knowledge of the world.”RUSSIAN TIESLawmakers from both major parties raised concerns about the oilman’s relationship with Moscow. Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, in a statement, said he had “serious concerns” about Tillerson’s nomination.In 2013, Putin bestowed a Russian state honor, the Order of Friendship, on Tillerson, citing his work “strengthening cooperation in the energy sector.”“Mr. Tillerson’s cozy ties to Vladimir Putin and Russia would represent an untenable conflict at the State Department,” Representative Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said in a statement.Trump is confident that Tillerson can get past questions about his ties to Russia, the transition official said.“His relationships with leaders all over the world are second to none,” Trump’s statement said.There also are concerns among lawmakers about former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, who has been mentioned as a possible No. 2 State Department official and who has voiced hawkish views on Iraq and Iran.Republicans and Democrats said they would ask Tillerson, who has met Putin several times, about his contacts with Russia. He won fresh praise from Moscow on Monday.Senator John McCain, a leading foreign policy voice and the 2008 Republican candidate for president, told Reuters: “I have concerns. It’s very well-known that he has a very close relationship with Vladimir Putin.”There has been controversy over the role alleged Russian cyber hacking may have had on the outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.The business community welcomed Trump’s choice of Tillerson.“We are pleased that Rex will bring a business perspective to the State Department,” the National Association of Manufacturers said.BUSINESS INTERESTSWhile busily filling out his Cabinet, Trump is seeking to answer questions about how he will separate himself from his far-flung business empire before taking office on Jan. 20.He had planned a news conference on Thursday to lay out the details but delayed it until Tuesday due to what aides said was the crush of picking people to serve in his administration.In a series of late-night tweets on Monday, Trump said he would be leaving his business before his Jan. 20 inauguration so he can focus full-time on the presidency and that he would leave his two sons, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, to manage it.He did not mention his daughter Ivanka, who has been a central player in his business affairs, as well as his campaign, and who is said to be considering a move to Washington to help her father.“No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office,” Trump said.He said he would hold a news conference “in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times!”Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman who will serve as Trump’s chief of staff come January, said in several television interviews on Tuesday that efforts were underway to sort out Trump’s complicated businesses.“It takes a lot of time,” he told MSNBC. “We know this is something that we’ve got to deal with.”Meanwhile, Trump has continued to build his administration.A source close to the transition said Trump had chosen former Texas Governor Rick Perry as his nominee for energy secretary, with an announcement expected soon. Perry met Trump on Monday at Trump Tower in New York.In choosing Tillerson, Trump passed over 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who had famously criticized the president-elect during the campaign this year.“It was an honor to have been considered for secretary of state of our great country,” Romney said in a Facebook posting on Monday night.(Reporting by Steve Holland; Additional reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Phil Stewart; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Bill Trott)"

The rules would also require the issuance of a “certificate of fetal death” if the fetus meets certain weight and age criteria.According to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Austin, the regulation “burdens women seeking pregnancy-related medical care” and “imposes a funeral ritual on women who have a miscarriage management procedure, ectopic pregnancy surgery, or an abortion.” Led by the clinic that prevailed earlier this year when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a different set of abortion-related regulations in Texas, this case seeks a declaration that the new rules are unconstitutional and thus can’t be enforced. Similar restrictions have popped up in other parts of the country.In defending the rules, enacted after tens of thousands of public comments, Texas said their purpose was to protect health and safety as well as “the dignity of the unborn in a manner consistent with Texas laws.”But the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is leading the lawsuit, said in its complaint that the state “enshrines into law an exceedingly narrow set of beliefs” and that they “do not reflect the diversity of views people hold about when human life begins and about the proper disposition of bodies.”Nancy Northup, the center’s president, said in a statement that the regulations represent a “new low” for Texas.“These regulations are an insult to Texas women, the rule of law and the U.S. Supreme Court, which declared less than six months ago that medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion access are unconstitutional,” Northup said.In the June decision that invalidated a pair of Texas laws that imposed onerous regulatory barriers on abortion clinics, the Supreme Court upheld the principle that “unnecessary health regulations” which create an impediment to abortion rights may be struck down by the courts.“Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion, each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, and each violates the Federal Constitution,” wrote Justice Stephen Breyer of the laws in that case, Whole Woman’s Health vs. Hellerstedt.Days after that ruling, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott wrote in a fundraising email that one of the aims of the new regulations was to “turn the tides against the soulless abortion industry in Texas.”"

He is putting his entire future and possibly his life on the line for those beliefs,” they said in the statement. “As his parents, it pains us to read articles and tweets saying that his family does not support him; this could not be further from the truth. We want people to know that we are very proud of our son and admire his strength and courage in kneeling for the rights of others.”The couple, who adopted Colin at 5 weeks old, admitted that, initially, they were “surprised as anyone” at Colin’s decision. But after Colin began receiving racist backlash — in the media, on Twitter and at his parent’s home — they said they gained a better understanding of America’s racial climate.“We were truly shocked at the amount of racist hatred out there! Until this had occurred, we had naively believed that the racial atmosphere in this country was far better than it actually is. Prayer and talks with our son gave us a much better understanding of the reason for his protest and how we should view it.”Teresa and Rick told The Undefeated that they were hesitant about speaking out and gaining public attention. But after three months of Colin’s protest, they wanted to clear up any falsehoods that they didn’t support their son.Since he began his protest, a few NFL executives, a police union, a former presidential candidate and many others have criticized Colin for his protest. Colin’s parents said the critics “do not understand his point.”To read their full interview, head over to The Undefeated."

Exxon Mobil is facing numerous investigations, including probes by the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts, into whether its executives lied to investors and committed fraud by covering up the risks of climate change. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also begun investigating how Exxon Mobil values future projects amid climate change and declining oil prices.“It will be a moment for some serious on-the-record questioning ... and to begin to get out into the light the kind of things that the attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts seem to have been asking for and not getting from Exxon,” said Bill McKibben, co-founder of the environmental advocacy group 350.org, during the call. 350.org and Greenpeace are among a number of groups engaged in #ExxonKnew, a campaign that seeks to hold Exxon accountable for its role in climate change.“At the very least, there will be some serious tension brought to bear,” McKibben said.In June, Exxon Mobil filed a lawsuit against Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey in an effort to block her office’s investigation.Kathy Mulvey, the climate accountability campaign manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said it’s “highly ironic” that while Massachusetts’ top law enforcement official was being ordered to appear in Texas federal court for a deposition in the Exxon Mobil case, the oil company’s CEO was interviewing for a job as the future president’s chief foreign affairs adviser.A day before Trump officially announced Tillerson as his pick, Mulvey said that nominating the Exxon Mobil CEO as secretary of state “would signal a lack of concern by president-elect Trump for enforcement of laws against fraud and misleading consumers and shareholders.” Exxon Mobil and its Republican allies in Washington, namely Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, claim that the New York and Massachusetts probes are politically motivated and “a “blatant effort to silence free speech.”The corporation says it has publicly recognized the risk of climate change for more than a decade. Yet industry documents exposed by news outlets and advocacy groups point to a long history of denial and deception.Last year, InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times found that Exxon Mobil executives were aware of the climate risks associated with carbon dioxide emissions and funded research to cover up those risks and block solutions.A separate investigation by the Washington-based Center for International Environmental Law uncovered documents showing that the oil industry, including Humble Oil (now Exxon Mobil Corp.), was aware of the potential link between fossil fuels and carbon emissions no later than 1957. Big Oil was “shaping science to shape public opinion” as early as the 1940s, the report found.Ultimately, Tillerson’s confirmation as secretary of state would not make the Exxon Mobil probes disappear, according to Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA. “These investigations are definitely bigger than Tillerson,” she said on Monday. “He’s a big part of it, but the investigations are into Exxon and those must continue regardless of the secretary of state appointment.”Although environmental groups are eyeing Tillerson’s upcoming confirmation hearing as an opportunity to find out what Exxon Mobil knew about climate change and when, they have not minced words about the threat he poses ― along with Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Trump’s choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency ― to the environment and efforts to combat global warming.There’s a “real concern” Trump is “creating a government of, by and for the oil and gas industry,” Mulvey said.

By a slim margin of 30 percent to 26 percent, Americans say that Trump’s policies will help rather than hurt them personally. Another 45 percent aren’t sure or doubt his efforts will have much of an effect on them.Sixty-three percent of Trump voters say they think his policies will help their own financial situations.As he prepares to take office, the president-elect’s high-profile administration picks from the financial industry have belied his populist rhetoric about the need to “drain the swamp” in Washington. The “populist” label, however, means little to many Americans. More than 6 in 10 respondents say that they’re not sure whether it’s good or bad for a politician to be a populist, dwarfing both the 24 percent who consider it to be a good thing and the 15 percent who consider it a bad thing.While 27 percent of Americans consider Trump a populist and 22 percent don’t believe that he is, the majority, 51 percent, say they aren’t sure.Hillary Clinton and Trump supporters alike fall into the “unsure” category, but Trump voters are both more likely to embrace populism and to see the president-elect as a representative of the movement. Trump voters say by a 30-point margin, 39 percent to 9 percent, that populism is a positive quality, and by a 25-point margin, 43 percent to 18 percent, that Trump is a populist. Clinton voters say by a 5-point margin, 26 percent to 21 percent, that it’s a bad thing for politicians to be populists, and by an 8-point margin, 35 percent to 27 percent, that Trump isn’t a populist.During the election, neither Trump nor Clinton were able to define themselves as champions of the middle class. A June HuffPost/YouGov survey found that 36 percent of voters thought Clinton would benefit the rich, and nearly half of voters said the same of Trump.By contrast, fewer think that President Barack Obama’s tenure benefited the rich. In the latest survey, a quarter of Americans say his economic policies favored the wealthy, 17 percent say they mostly benefited the middle class, 17 percent that they mostly favored the poor, and 20 percent that they treated all groups equally.Most respondents also don’t think that the last eight years benefited them personally. Just 17 percent say that Obama’s policies helped their own finances, while 33 percent say his policies hurt them and 50 percent are unsure or say his policies didn’t make much of a difference.As in past surveys, opinions appear driven largely by politics. Seventy percent of Trump voters say that Obama’s policies hurt them financially, with just 3 percent saying they helped. Among Clinton voters, 34 percent say Obama’s economic policies helped them, 9 percent that they hurt, and 51 percent that they didn’t make much difference. The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 2-5 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Tom Carper (D-Del.), the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.“We understand that the Office of Government Ethics, an independent, non-partisan ethics agency created in the wake of the scandals of Watergate, has recently advised you that the only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is through divestiture of your businesses,” the letter says.The senators noted that while Trump has argued that the president is not limited by conflict of interest laws, the OGE has observed that past presidents have nevertheless abided by such laws.The senators also pointed to the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which bars presidents and other federal officials from taking payments or gifts from foreign governments. Trump does business with foreign governments.Beyond selling his businesses, the senators also argue that Trump should dump the proceeds from those sales into a true blind trust not run by his family.“Whether the President of the United States makes decisions about potential trade agreements or sending troops into war, the American people need to know that their President is acting in their best interest,” the letter says. “Divestiture of your businesses and the establishment of a qualified blind trust controlled by an independent party would provide assurances that you will put the interests of the American people first and are fully committed to the success of your presidency.”The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

The untitled project, which will air on the premium cable network as a multi-part documentary, will chronicle Ali’s “greatest triumphs and comebacks, painting an intimate portrait of a man who, against all odds, dreamed and achieved the impossible, over and over again,” according to an HBO press release. “It’s tough to put into words how much it means to me to be a part of this project honoring the legacy and telling the extremely important story of the great Muhammad Ali,” James said in the press release. “He transcended sports and used his platform to empower people, which paved the way for all athletes and people of every race and gender that came after him, myself included,” he added about the boxing legend and social activist who passed away on June 3.Lonnie Ali, wife of the late sports icon, went on to state that the film will reflect Ali’s multi-faceted life ― an inspiring story with national and global appeal.“I’m hopeful this documentary will engage the audience in a similar way Muhammad engaged his audience and fans,” she said in the release. “Without a doubt, Muhammad’s life journey provides simple yet extraordinary lessons for all of us, with perhaps the most important one being, to see and embrace the humanity in all people.”The documentary adds James’ commitment to social activism. Last month, the NBA star pledged a $2.5 million donation to an exhibit honoring Ali at the new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.No premiere date has been set for the developing project."
78,POLITICS,Energy Department Denies Donald Trump's Request To Single Out Staff Working On Climate Change,Max Greenwood,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/energy-rejects-trump-questions_us_58502371e4b0e05aded5fb7e,"The workers' union chief says employees are ""shocked"" and ""concerned"" over the plan.",2016-12-13,Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is tipped to be picked as the new secretary of energy -- a department he once vowed to abolish.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585024341c00002d000eb4a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Department of Energy has rejected a request from President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team to name employees and contractors who worked on climate change policies.“We are going to respect the professional and scientific integrity and independence of our employees at our labs and across our department,” Energy Department spokesman Eben Burnham-Snyder said in an email to The Washington Post. “We will be forthcoming with all publicly available information with the transition team. We will not be providing any individual names to the transition team.”Trump has long expressed doubts on whether climate change is real, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus on the issue. He even suggested during the campaign that it’s “bullshit” and a hoax China created to make U.S. manufacturing less competitive. He’s also pledged to withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris climate agreement.The exact motives for his transition team’s request that the department identify personnel involved in projects concerning climate change remain unclear, though federal employees are concerned it could mean they would face retaliation under a Trump Administration.“There is major concern amongst my members,” Jeff Eagan, the president of the National Treasury Employees Union chapter and a longtime employee for the energy department, told the Post. “I have received lots of calls, emails, messages expressing shock and dismay.”Trump has spoken out against President Barack Obama’s climate strategies, and nominated several high-profile climate change deniers to head government agencies. Last week, the transition team announced that Trump would nominate Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt has previously sued the EPA to stop the implementation of emission-curbing regulations.The president-elect will reportedly nominate former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) to head the Department of Energy. Perry had memorably fumbled the name of the department during a Republican presidential debate in 2011 ― as he included it in a list federal agencies he wanted to abolish.It’s unlikely that the Trump administration would be able to legally fire all Energy Department employees who worked on climate change policies, but his advisers have also called for looser protections for federal employees and increased government layoffs."
79,BUSINESS,Report: Exxon Has Understood Climate Risks Of Oil Sands For Decades,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/inside-climate-exxon-tar-sands_us_584ef701e4b0e05aded4fe57,The InsideClimate News investigation comes amid news that President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.,2016-12-13,"Mining trucks carry loads of oil laden sand at an oils sands project in Alberta, Canada.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Exxon Mobil has understood the environmental risks of extracting oil from the Canadian tar sands for more than 20 years, yet continued to invest heavily in the dirty resource while lobbying against efforts aimed at limiting further development, according to a new investigation by InsideClimate News.In combing through company documents and speaking with former Exxon employees, InsideClimate found that Exxon and its Canadian affiliate Imperial Oil “placed a risky bet” on tar sands production.In October, Exxon disclosed that as a result of declining oil prices, it could be forced to eliminate 4.6 billion barrels of oil ― almost 20 percent of its future prospects, much of it from the tar sands ― from its reserves, the Wall Street Journal reported. At the time, a company representative said the move was not expected to alter Exxon’s future oil production. Company documents, however, show Exxon “has known for decades that international efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions could threaten its deepening reliance on the resource,” InsideClimate reported Tuesday.And although Exxon and Imperial are not the only companies developing the tar sands, “they have stood apart from their peers in the strength of their opposition to emissions limits and continued determination to fully exploit the resource,” the report continues. The lengthy investigation comes a little over a year after InsideClimate revealed that top executives at Exxon knew about the role of fossil fuels in global warming as early as 1977, then lobbied against efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.Producing oil from the tar sands of Alberta’s boreal forests is a dirty, destructive endeavor, requiring massive amounts of water and often involving bulldozing giant swaths of land. The end products also release between 18 to 21 percent more carbon than those from conventional crude oils. The controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to see built, would carry oil from the tar sands to the U.S. On its website, Exxon says the oil sands are a “key resource for global energy security” that will account for 25 percent of the North and South American oil supply by 2040.The InsideClimate investigation comes at a particularly interesting time for the U.S. oil giant.On Tuesday, Trump officially named Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as his pick for secretary of state, describing his career as “the embodiment of the American dream.”Tillerson’s nomination adds to environmentalists’ growing fears about what a Trump presidency will mean for the fight against climate change. Trump has dismissed climate change as “bullshit” and a “hoax,” and has vowed to withdraw from global actions to combat it. He has also pledged to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris climate agreement and increase fossil fuel production.Meanwhile, the oil company continues to face mounting legal troubles, including an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into how it values future projects amid climate change and plunging oil prices.

The group, which pulled in $13.6 million in revenue last year, regularly releases consumer guides on food, makeup and sunscreen, and publishes an annual list of the “dirty dozen” fruits and vegetables with the highest amounts of pesticide residue.“Like millions of parents, I’ve relied on EWG research for many years to help my family avoid toxic chemicals and lead a healthier life,” Pfeiffer, 58, said in a statement. “And now more than ever, we need EWG to lead the fight for a clean environment in Washington.”EWG certainly has its work cut out for it. President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed cabinet picks so far seem set to roll back years of progress on environmental policy. His pick for commerce secretary is a billionaire coal baron. His pick for transportation secretary has longstanding links to the coal industry. His pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency is a climate science denier with deep ties to oil and gas companies. And his pick for secretary of state is the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, which is under investigation by state attorneys general for covering up evidence of global warming for decades.Trump, for his part, has repeatedly dismissed climate change as a “hoax” and vowed to shred President Barack Obama’s signature legislation for cutting carbon emissions. “Donald Trump has made it clear that he intends to wage war on clean air and clean water,” Benjamin Schreiber, climate and energy program director at the nonprofit Friends of the Earth, said in a statement last week. “Trump has also put our climate in peril and shown he is out of step with the American people.”"
