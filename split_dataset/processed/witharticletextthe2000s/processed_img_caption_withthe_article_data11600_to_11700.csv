0,POLITICS,"Michael Slager, The Cop Who Killed Walter Scott, Wasn't Convicted Because Black Lives Don’t Matter",Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-slager-black-lives-matter_us_58420019e4b017f37fe4c266,"“I fired until the threat was stopped, like I’m trained to do,”  he said.",2016-12-05,"Slager, center, sits in the courtroom during his murder trial on Dec. 2, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584204111200002b00eed468.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On April 4, 2015, former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager fired eight rounds at Walter Scott as the 50-year-old black man ran away.On Monday, Slager walked out of the courtroom after a judge declared a mistrial because one of the 12 jurors could not “with good conscience consider a guilty verdict.” Later, the prosecutor reportedly told Scott’s family that Slager will quickly be retried.If Slager were a civilian, he would likely spend the rest of his life in prison for shooting an unarmed person who was fleeing an encounter. But Slager is a police officer, and they often walk free after they’ve used lethal force on a subject ― regardless of whether it was justified.We’ve seen this before. In 2015, the number of police officers charged with murder or manslaughter was three times the decade average, but zero officers have been convicted. The officers who killed Freddie Gray, 25, in Baltimore, Tamir Rice, 12, in Cleveland, Eric Garner, 43, in New York and Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Missouri, all went free for various reasons. Some weren’t even charged.But Slager was charged, and there’s clear video of what happened. Still, his trial stands out in the most perplexing and infuriating way: The officer’s testimony does not correlate with video evidence of the shooting.Warning: This video contains graphic content. Police dash camera footage shows that Slager pulled Scott over for a broken tail light. Scott gave Slager his license and explained that he didn’t have a registration or insurance information with him because he was in the process of buying the car. In the police footage, Slager walks back to the squad car with Scott’s license in hand as Scott and his passenger wait for the officer to return. Scott tries to get out of his car, but Slager orders him to get back in. A few seconds later, Scott opens the door and runs away. Slager pursues Scott on foot.A cell phone video, recorded by bystander Feidin Santana, picks up where the dash camera left off. In Santana’s video, Scott is running away from Slager as the officer fires eight rounds, striking Scott five times. Scott died from gunshot wounds to the back.Slager said during his trial that he felt “total fear” as Scott charged toward him. He also claimed that Scott had grabbed his Taser and intended to fire it. “I see him with a Taser in his hand as I see him spinning around,” Slager said. “That’s the only thing I see: that Taser in his hand.”In fact, the video evidence does not show Scott with a Taser when he is killed ― it shows Slager dropping a Taser near Scott’s body after he is shot.When pressed by the prosecutor to explain, Slager said, “I don’t remember everything that happened.” He says he was concerned that Scott was “running for some reason” and that he was “going to lose” in a struggle with Scott. “I pulled my firearm, and I pulled the trigger,” said Slager. “I fired until the threat was stopped, like I’m trained to do.”Slager’s allusion to the black man’s supposed physical strength and insistence that he was threatening him ― disputed by the video evidence ― demonstrates the officer’s fear of black masculinity and his perception that black people are inherently criminal.This is also evident in Slager’s interview with South Carolina Law Enforcement Division agents soon after the shooting. Because Scott was on the phone, shouting out his location to someone on the other end, Slager said he worried that he would never see his family again. So he decided to take another man away from his.  The person on the line with Scott was his mother. Scott, a father of four, was likely running away to avoid being arrested for not paying child support. He owed more than $18,000 and there was a bench warrant out for his arrest when the shooting occurred.None of that matters. Running away from an officer and being behind in child support payments are not crimes punishable by death. Unless you’re black.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Scott’s age as 53."

But the state case arises out of ongoing federal litigation, which has put Immigration and Customs Enforcement on notice that these facilities are not acceptable places to house kids.“This may not be the end of our legal battles,” said Bob Libal, executive director of Grassroots Leadership, which brought the state lawsuit. “But for now, if these facilities want to apply to operate as child care facilities, they have to do it like any other child care facility ― rather than the state designing a rule that fits prisons.”Mothers and kids, most of them from Central American countries, can languish at the detention centers for months while their cases move forward in immigration court. The lucky ones are released to sponsors, often family members, so ICE knows where they are.But they usually trickle out just a few at a time.The next stop for many is RAICES, a San Antonio nonprofit about an hour away from the facilities. RAICES feeds the families, helps them arrange travel and gets them to the bus station or airport. ICE will normally call or email to say that it’s planning to drop off people later that day, said Amy Fischer, policy director at RAICES. A typical daily caseload would be three families. This past weekend, however, the families began arriving by the busload ― more than 460 on Saturday and Sunday alone, according to RAICES. The situation exploded “times a million,” said Fischer.She told HuffPost that the numbers arriving this past weekend alone surpass the shelter’s average monthly caseload for the year so far.The final busload of the weekend rolled in not long after midnight Monday morning, she said. Since the sun has risen, Fischer added, about 40 more people have arrived, and ICE warned them to expect another three buses.For its part, ICE denied that the releases had anything to do with Friday’s court ruling and said they were previously scheduled. Spokesman Carl Rusnok said the agency “is currently reviewing the court’s ruling on the matter of the operating license for the South Texas Family Residential Center. Operational activities continue without interruption at this time.”Meanwhile, the folks at Casa RAICES in San Antonio are pressed. Their operation isn’t designed to deal with hundreds of people at once. The main house has 27 beds, plus there are air mattresses and floor space in another house nearby. The record for people going through the facility in a single day was 101 mothers and children, staffers said during a tour just before Thanksgiving. With the flood of newcomers this weekend, people are sleeping in the hallways at Casa, Fischer said. A local church and a convent took many in as well. But RAICES is still helping the families with travel plans and providing them with backpacks of donated supplies, including warm clothes, bottled water, snacks and diapers.The release mothers and children is welcome, even if the numbers are a challenge, Fischer said.“No matter what type of stress this puts on our resources, we have been pushing for the end of family detention ..., so we are immensely happy that these families are being released,” she said. “We hope that they continue to be released until the family detention centers are empty.”The Obama administration rapidly expanded family detention ― a policy it had all but abandoned shortly after President Barack Obama took office ― to act as a disincentive to the tens of thousands of Central American families crossing into the United States since the summer of 2014. These families routinely apply for asylum or other forms of humanitarian relief. But given immigration court backlogs, they can be stuck for months in detention centers.Last year U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee ruled that the family detention policy violated a 1997 court settlement requiring that undocumented children be housed in the least restrictive setting possible and generally favoring their release from detention. In response, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services issued new rules defining “child care facility” to make it possible for the two detention centers to qualify.Texas issued a temporary license to one of those sites, the Karnes Family Residential Center, to act as a child care facility in May. Grassroots Leadership filed the state lawsuit before the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley could likewise obtain a license. But Friday’s ruling in favor of Grassroots Leadership invalidated the state’s attempt to bend the rules. Without those licenses, the two family detention centers once again run the risk of running afoul of Judge Gee’s federal ruling.Lawyers from the Texas attorney general’s office and the Department of Family and Protective Services were still reviewing the state court’s decision on Monday and had not yet decided whether to appeal, according to department spokesman Patrick Crimmins.Luis Zayas, a professor of social work at the University of Texas at Austin who testified in the state case as an expert witness, applauded the ruling.“This really affirms the fact that the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services had erred in changing their own rules that protect children in the interest of private prisons, who are there to make money,” Zayas told HuffPost. “These are not, by any means of the imagination, child care facilities. Whether you have nice furniture, colorful walls and happy suns, it doesn’t mitigate the fact that these are prisons for children.”The GEO Group, the private company that runs the Karnes detention center for ICE, downplayed the significance of Friday’s ruling, saying the facility would continue to operate. The center “has always been in compliance with ICE’s Family Residential standards,” said GEO Group spokesman Pablo Paez in an email.“As an added oversight step, our company and ICE pursued the licensing of the Center by the State of Texas,” Paez said. CoreCivic (formerly the Corrections Corporation of America), which runs the Dilley detention center, “stand[s] ready to support the needs of our government partner, while providing a safe, humane and appropriate environment for those entrusted to our care,” spokesman Jonathan Burns said in an email. The Karnes and Dilley detention centers would need to make significant changes to qualify as child care facilities under previously established Texas law. One problem is that the centers hold multiple families together in a single unit, meaning children have been housed with unrelated adults ― a generally prohibited practice for child care facilities because of the risk of abuse.Another key issue is that children’s presence at licensed child care facilities is essentially optional and they can leave. By contrast, kids can’t leave the detention centers at Karnes or Dilley unless ICE or an immigration judge releases them.Despite the ongoing litigation, ICE extended CoreCivic’s contract to run the Dilley detention center in October.Update: On Tuesday, an ICE spokeswoman confirmed that the agency had released 470 mothers and children on Saturday ― 61 individuals from the Karnes facility and 409 from the Dilley facility. There were still 2,479 mothers and children in family immigrant detention centers as of Monday, according to the spokeswoman. Dilley held 1,787 people; Karnes held 606; and a third facility, the Berks County Residential Center in Pennsylvania, held 86. "

3,POLITICS,Paul Ryan On Donald Trump Tweeting Lies: 'Who Cares?',Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-donald-trump-tweets_us_5844b2f2e4b0c68e04818206,"The House speaker can't prove Trump's allegations of voter fraud, but he doesn't think the lies are a problem.",2016-12-05,House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud: Meh.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5844b318120000dd00eed6f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has no problem with President-elect Donald Trump tweeting lies and conspiracy theories, including dangerous allegations of mass voter fraud in the recent presidential election.In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS’ “60 Minutes,” Ryan said he could not prove Trump’s baseless claim that “millions of people voted illegally,” which the president-elect tweeted to his millions of followers last Sunday.“I don’t know. I’m not really focused on these things,” Ryan said when anchor Scott Pelley asked him about Trump’s blatant lie.“I have no way of backing that up. I have no knowledge of such things,” he said.When Pelley continued to press him, Ryan said that the fact that the president-elect of the United States circulates false information on social media is not a concern to him.“It doesn’t matter to me. He won the election,” he said. “The way I see the tweets you’re talking about, he’s basically giving voice to a lot of people who have felt that they were voiceless. He’s communicating with people in this country who’ve felt like they have not been listened to. He’s going to be an unconventional president.”“Who cares what he tweeted, you know, on some Thursday night, if we fix this country’s big problems?” he added. “That’s just the way I look at this.”On Sunday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and several of Trump’s top advisers similarly would not condemn Trump’s lie and attempted to defend it, despite not being able to present any evidence of illegal voting.Pence said it’s Trump’s “right to express his opinion,” calling it “refreshing,” and incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said that “it’s possible” that Trump’s claim was true.Ryan, who spent much of the last year distancing himself from Trump, said he is not concerned about Trump’s incendiary comments because his private conversations with Trump have been “productive.”“I think there is a bit of a difference between the private person and the public person. In the private person, there’s a conversation like this, and it’s all about how to get things done,” he said Sunday. “So every conversation I have almost always revolves around, you know, personnel and policy focused on producing results.”"

His legs cut out from under him, King got to his feet to do sort of a hand jive number.The punter was penalized for the celebration but the Raiders had retained possession on the initial roughing call and were able to preserve a 38-24 victory in Oakland.King, one of the league’s more entertaining players, went on Twitter to hilariously call out a possible tattletale. The so-called No Fun League, which has already crushed twerking and other gestures of joy, wasn’t going to spoil King’s day. "

No wonder some air travelers could use a little “PLC” ― that’s pig loving care.And that’s what they’re getting at the San Francisco International Airport, in the form of LiLou, a therapy pig who turns two on Dec. 15.LiLou is the newest member of the airport’s “Wag Brigade,” an elite force of therapy animals trained to cheer up grumpy airport visitors.Most of the current brigade members are dogs, but past members have included cats and rabbits. LiLou is the first pig.LiLou is known for her stylish outfits and painted nails, but she’s not a one-trick pony, er, pig.She can stand up on her back hooves (the better to show off those painted nails), wave at people with her snout and play a toy piano, according to USA Today.LiLou is also a bit of a ham, as her Instagram page shows.Typically, as many as three “Wag Brigade” members hang out in each of the airport’s terminals, usually sporting a sign that says “Pet Me!”LiLou usually appears about once a week, according to SFist.com.But LiLou isn’t just sitting around between airport gigs. She is also a regular visitor to San Francisco senior centers and hospitals, according to the San Jose Mercury News.It was obvious LiLou was a star when her owner, Tatyana Danilova, brought her in for training earlier this year, said San Francisco SPCA Animal Assisted Therapy employee Dianne Bates.“Most people have never had the opportunity to meet a pig, and literally everyone wanted to interact with her,” she said in a department newsletter."

As of Monday the letter had garnered over 300 signatures.“Based on what has happened during the campaign and since the elections, my biggest concern is the safety, security and well-being of Americans who are Muslim as well as women, Latino, African Americans and members of other minority communities,” Abdelkader told The Huffington Post. The election left many marginalized communities fearful of what a Trump presidency would mean for their civil rights, as well as what kind of hate and aggression it might unleash. Their fears have proven to be entirely justified. The Southern Poverty Law Center recorded 867 reported hate incidents in the 10 days following the election. Muslim communities have been directly targeted. Over the Thanksgiving weekend, several California mosques received identical letters praising Trump and calling Muslims “vile and filthy people.” On Sunday, a man in New York City violently harassed an off-duty Muslim NYPD officer, threatening to cut her throat.Even prior to the election, the number of reported assaults against Muslim Americans has reached a record high since right after Sept. 11. The Huffington Post has tracked over 300 acts of violence, discrimination and anti-Muslim rhetoric in the U.S. in 2016 alone.Many felt that Trump stoked Islamophobia throughout his campaign with calls to ban Muslims from entering the country and claims like “Islam hates us.”“It behooves President-elect Trump to recognize the impact of his words, let alone potential policies that single out Americans on account of their religion, race or ethnicity,” Abdelkader said.The letter’s signatories will hold Trump accountable in the coming months, she added, through grassroots organizing and advocacy.“Like other Americans, we love our country and are committed to preserving religious freedom, equal opportunity and equal protection under the law for all,” the letter states. “As our President-Elect, one of your duties is to ensure our collective safety and security. This includes protecting the First Amendment rights of all Americans to freely practice their faith, without fear, intimidation or reprisal.”Read the full letter here."

During the trial, they had described Harris as a flawed but God-fearing man who loved his only child. They said he simply forgot to take the boy to his daycare center after a father-and-son breakfast.The defense lawyers left court without comment after the sentencing. They have said they will appeal Harris’s conviction, but have not yet said on what grounds.Prosecutor Chuck Boring told the session that Harris committed “an unspeakable act” against his own flesh and blood, and that he should be given the maximum sentence allowed.“There’s only one sentence for this act of evil,” he said. “We ask a term of life in prison without parole.”Sentencing Harris to life with no parole plus 32 years, Clark said the defendant had deliberately caused his own child “unimaginable, severe physical and mental agony.”Harris, the judge added, had “callously walked away and left that child ... to swelter and die.”Prosecutors had argued he left the child to die so he could enjoy a child-free lifestyle and pursue other women, including teenagers and prostitutes.

During the trial, they had described Harris as a flawed but God-fearing man who loved his only child. They said he simply forgot to take the boy to his daycare center after a father-and-son breakfast.The defense lawyers left court without comment after the sentencing. They have said they will appeal Harris’s conviction, but have not yet said on what grounds.Prosecutor Chuck Boring told the session that Harris committed “an unspeakable act” against his own flesh and blood, and that he should be given the maximum sentence allowed.“There’s only one sentence for this act of evil,” he said. “We ask a term of life in prison without parole.”Sentencing Harris to life with no parole plus 32 years, Clark said the defendant had deliberately caused his own child “unimaginable, severe physical and mental agony.”Harris, the judge added, had “callously walked away and left that child ... to swelter and die.”Prosecutors had argued he left the child to die so he could enjoy a child-free lifestyle and pursue other women, including teenagers and prostitutes.

9,POLITICS,Massive Bill Targeting Opioid Crisis Is Headed To The White House,Ryan Grim and Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/21st-century-cures-act_us_5845ec79e4b02f60b024924b,The bill also allocates billions to medical research and Vice President Joe Biden's cancer moonshot.,2016-12-05,Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) speaks about the opioid epidemic during a news conference on May 19. Legislators held the event to discuss their support for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5845ed68120000dd00eeda57.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As Congress headed toward its summer recess in late June, the fate of a bill that would dramatically reform the opioid treatment industry was in doubt. Despite a lopsided 94 to 1 win in the Senate earlier that year, House Republicans had moved at their own pace, having only passed their version in May. Meanwhile, the White House and Senate Democrats were making renewed demands that any policy improvements come with the federal funds to make a real dent.The White House wanted just over $1 billion, while Senate Democrats were calling for $600 million. The bill’s lead co-sponsor, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), worried that either amount would have made the bill untenable in the Republican-controlled House.So he asked for a meeting of Republican leaders to hash out a way forward. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) agreed to convene it, hosting the previously unreported gathering in his conference room with Portman and Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). Portman laid out the predicament for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, arguing that it would likely be fatal for the bill to slip past the recess. It would be nearly impossible to get it taken care of in the short time the Senate came back in September, before breaking again for the election. It was now or never, but there was no way he could get enough Republican votes to attach money to it. Alexander volunteered a solution. He had been working for months on a massive bill to fund medical research, including Vice President Joe Biden’s moonshot bid to cure cancer. It was a multibillion-dollar package. Why not add $1 billion more to it for opioids? Portman and the other senators in the room gave a thumbs up, and McConnell told Alexander to try to make it happen. While Alexander worked, Portman and his Democratic co-sponsor, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, pushed forward. The bill cleared the House on July 8 and the Senate on July 13. It was signed into law nine days later. The Alexander bill, the 21st Century Cures Act, never made it before recess and, as predicted, couldn’t get through in the fall. But it came back to life in the lame duck, breezing through the House last week and cruising through the Senate ― despite a late effort by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to derail it for Big Pharma giveaways. The Cures Act moved forward in the Senate by a vote of 85 to 13 on Monday. Read HuffPost’s reporting on how it all came together here. The vote itself was an emotional one, with Biden manning the chair and watching as the Senate moved to change a portion of the bill to name it after his late son, Beau Biden. What may be the most remarkable about the money appropriated by Cures is not what it funds, but what it doesn’t. None of it is directed toward the traditional drug war preoccupations of enforcement or imprisonment. Instead, the money goes toward expanding treatment and prevention, beefing up drug monitoring programs and training for health care providers. “There’s a widespread bipartisan recognition that we’re not out of the woods on the overdose epidemic ― you look at Massachusetts, Ohio, many other states that are now dealing with illicitly manufactured fentanyl, and things keep getting worse,” explained Daniel Raymond, policy director with the Harm Reduction Coalition. The question now is whether the White House can get the first half of the money out the door before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Drug Czar Michael Botticelli is confident he can get it distributed, according to two Democratic senators. The timing is critical. The bill actually requires that the Health and Human Services secretary makes sure to prioritize funding to the states hit hardest by the epidemic. “I’m relieved that this bill ensures that funding will be directed to the areas of the country with the most need,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “Those on the frontlines of this epidemic have waited long enough for Congress to take this epidemic seriously.” "

Without Trump, your average GOP platform consists of policy that supports gay conversion therapy, stripping women of their right to choose, voter suppression laws, gerrymandering that compresses black and brown votes into small districts to dilute their political power, undermining the power of collective bargaining to weaken or break unions, and supporting tax cuts for the rich that crippled working- and middle-class families. They have been able to get away with it for so long because they are amazing at messaging.Check out the Republican Parties Problematic Platform for 2016Put it like this: Republicans are the friend that borrows money from you to cover a bill, then posts vacation pics on Instagram and accuses you of being a hater when you ask for your money back. They’re the “f*ck boy” who spends their day on Facebook making fun of “people who don’t wanna hustle” when they live with their mother and don’t pay their own bills. They’re the uncle who comes to your cookout without a dish, but packs two plates to go and complains about the seasoning. I could continue the slander for days, but let’s take a fact-based look at this foolishness.Trickle Down Economics:GOP Theory- You cut taxes for businesses and the rich, in turn, they will take that money and create jobs to stimulate the economy.Reality- The super rich and big businesses get this money and hoard it for themselves. Republicans will sit here and straight up tell you how much they care about putting money in people’s pockets, but they’re about as reliable as your ex who started working with Herbalife.Their economic policies are straight up trash. In 2010, Kansas elected a Tea Party Republican by the name of Sam Brownback, to be their governor. He promised that by cutting taxes for businesses and the rich, everyone in the state would benefit. After being elected into office and then having a Republican assembly and senate, the Governor signed off on the biggest tax cut in the state’s history. Ninety percent of the cuts benefited the top 10 percent of earners, or in other words, the super-rich. The plan failed, and since the cuts, Kansas has faced almost yearly budget deficits and was sued for its lack of funding for public education. The New Republic does a great job of detailing the damage:By June of 2014, the results of Brownback’s economic reforms began to come in, and they weren’t pretty. During the first fiscal year that his plan was in operation, which ended in June, the tax cuts had produced a staggering loss in revenue—$687.9 million, or 10.84 percent. According to the nonpartisan Kansas Legislative Research Department, the state risks running deficits through fiscal year 2019. Moody’s downgraded the state’s credit rating from AA1 to AA2; Standard & Poor’s followed suit, which will increase the state’s borrowing costs and further enlarge its deficit.I’m not calling them racist, but they tend to do racist ass stuff.GOP Theory- ”We can’t be racist, we’re the party of Lincoln. Just look over there, we have one N***** black Republican.Reality- Republican policies are so racially focused that the actual policy acknowledges success by the number of People of color it disenfranchises.Listen, I’m not saying that the entire Republican party is racist. Hell, I’m not even saying that 75 percent of the Republican Party is racist. However, they support policies that are fucking racist problematic. For example, look at North Carolina, where the GOP-controlled legislature passed a bill aimed at addressing “voter fraud” even though there is almost no voter fraud in the entire state. As a result, this bill grossly disenfranchised the growing black electorate in the state. Think I’m joking? Even some white people thought the laws were problematic. Vox did an article on the Fourth Circuit US Court of Appeals’, decision to overturn the law, and here is what they said:The federal appeals court pointed out that in the process of constructing the voter identification law, the state legislature not only requested data on the voter practices, which included race, but the changes to voting practices also seemed to use that information to target voters based on race.“In particular, African Americans disproportionately used the first seven days of early voting,” Motz wrote. “After the receipt of this racial data, the General Assembly amended the bill to eliminate the first week of early voting, shortening the total early voting period from seventeen to ten days.”They have purposely refused to work with President Obama, just to make him look bad.GOP theory- Barack Jaquan Hussain Obama is a socialist and refuses to work with us.Reality- The video doesn’t lie.OK, so we discussed their economic policies, as well as their racist voter policies. Now it’s time to point out their overall refusal to put our country first. When President Obama was elected in 2008, the top leaders of the Republican Party created a strategy aimed at making him look bad and a one-term president. How did they do that? Well, they refused to govern, criticized Obama for anything he did, trashed common sense policies like the Jobs Bill, and finally created an atmosphere that led to the Republican nomination of Trump for president.Like I said, they’re f*ck boys.I’m sure there is a random black Republican in your ear right now telling you that the Republican Party “’isn’t that bad” or “Hillary is worse.” Don’t listen to them. Yes, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party have problems and need to be checked. We may even need to take our support away from them. But the Republican party is not the answer. You wouldn’t break up with someone who kept lying to you for someone that’s going to cheat and steal your credit card info, right? That would not make sense. So before you grab a registration form to “lean right,” remember, your current bae (the Dems) might be acting up, but the GOP is not a real option."
11,POLITICS,How A Tennessee Agency Is Failing People With Disabilities,"MEREDITH KOLODNER, The Hechinger Report",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tennessee-disabilities_us_584593abe4b017f37fe5b47e,State officials relinquish millions of dollars that could fix the problems,2016-12-05,Tennessee VR staffers deemed Robert Wells unable to succeed in college but he has a GPA of 3.6 at Nashville State Community College.

He took honors physics in 11th grade and earned a general education diploma, even though his cerebral palsy classified him as a special education student. So he and his mother were shocked when a counselor from a state agency that is supposed to assist people with disabilities determined during his senior year that he didn’t have the intelligence necessary to succeed in college or in a career.“I expect people in general to look at Robert and see his disability and what he can’t do,” said Robert’s mom, Cynthia Leatherwood, “but I expect VR to see what he can do.”“VR” is shorthand for Tennessee’s vocational rehabilitation office. Each state has VR offices, which are supposed to help people with disabilities get into the workforce. Assistance can include transportation to college for people who use wheelchairs, computer screen readers for people with visual impairments or career advice.In Tennessee, however, half of the residents found eligible for VR services in 2015 didn’t get any, according to federal data.More than 40 percent of counselor positions are vacant. Yet the state left $14 million in federal VR dollars on the table in 2015 and again in 2016, even as the agency temporarily shut its doors to new clients. Caseloads have ballooned to 200 clients per counselor, according to advocates, twice the recommended number. The agency cannot show state auditors how millions in federal dollars have been spent.State officials at the highest levels have been aware of these problems for years and have repeatedly failed to fix them, according to internal documents.Indeed in 2016 the federal government designated Tennessee’s VR grant “high risk” for most of the year, due to the state’s repeated inability to track how much money was being spent and on what. No other state VR grant received that designation.The impact is felt throughout the state, as aging parents struggle to help their adult children with disabilities become independent before they can no longer care for them. In Tennessee, 12 percent of people with disabilities have a bachelor’s degree, 21 percent are employed and close to a quarter live below the poverty line.“It’s disheartening to families, and it fosters the ‘check mentality,’ ” said Carrie Guiden, executive director of The Arc of Tennessee, a nonprofit disability advocacy group, referring to government checks. “They need more counselors to efficiently meet the demand for services.”Cynthia Leatherwood knew enough not to accept her son’s misdiagnosis by VR. She had spent 12 years as a senior education advocate at the Disability Law & Advocacy Center of Tennessee, advising other parents on how to get through the system. She tracked down the necessary paperwork for Robert, appealed his case and managed to get the evaluation reversed. It took several months, however, so even though she opened a case with VR in the fall of Robert’s senior year in high school, he started college in the fall of 2013 with none of the supports he needed, and she took out loans to cover all the costs.“I could never have made this happen if I was working a full-time job,” she said, pointing to the hours of paperwork and constant emailing and phone calls the appeal required. “I understand why people just give up.”Now a student at Nashville State Community College, Robert has made the dean’s list twice and has a GPA of 3.6 in his undergraduate courses.Related: Eligible but got nothing: Hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities blocked from college aidTennessee’s VR office has long struggled to serve its clients effectively, federal documents show. In November 2015, the federal agency that oversees and provides funding to state VR offices noted that many of the problems that led to Tennessee’s high-risk designation for 2016 were identical to those spelled out in an audit issued in December 2011, “establishing a long history of material non-compliance.”Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam took office in January 2011, and that year brought in Raquel Hatter to lead the Department of Human Services, which oversees the state’s VR agency. Two years later, the agency was awarded more than $73 million in federal funds, but because of penalties and the state’s refusal to put up sufficient matching funds, the agency ended up with just $36 million to spend.Officials would not say whether the state would again fail to match and thus lose federal funds in 2017. The Department of Human Services spokesperson, Stephanie Jarnagin, wrote in an email, “The state is in the process of developing and implementing a plan to ensure full alignment with WIOA [the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, a federal law passed in 2014]. This will inform how the state will pursue additional federal dollars.”Meanwhile, current and former VR clients in Tennessee tell stories of leaving many messages for counselors and getting no response, only to be told months later that the counselors had quit. The high caseloads and rapid staff turnover have resulted in many inexperienced, overloaded counselors in some offices.“I really wanted the job, but I only lasted three months,” said one former counselor who quit in the spring of 2016 and asked to remain anonymous because of ongoing work with VR. “The number of cases, the backlog of people who hadn’t heard from anyone for months. I was tired of being yelled at for things I couldn’t do anything about.”Last year, Brandon Brown became the executive director of the nonprofit disability group Empower Tennessee, in Nashville. He knew the subject: In the late 1990s, when he lived in Alabama, Brown had gotten prompt help from Alabama’s VR office when he was losing his eyesight. He credits that agency with supporting him while he got his degree at the University of North Alabama. “It helped to change my life,” he said. Yet, he added, “when I started working here, right off the bat I started hearing nightmare VR stories.”Cara Wilson lived one of those stories. Her daughter, Hannah, is on the autism spectrum and graduated from high school in 2012. Wilson, 50, was hoping to get help connecting Hannah, now 25, with a suitable job or perhaps some college courses (Hannah was speaking three languages by the time she was two years old). She and Hannah began meeting with a counselor in the Franklin city office in 2014 and one day found out, after waiting for an hour, that the counselor wasn’t there due to illness. The supervisor took them into her office and asked Wilson and her daughter if they understood the power of prayer.“That was it. I was dumbfounded,” said Wilson, who is a single mother and also has a 13-year-old son on the spectrum. “She sent us home to pray. I didn’t know if I was supposed to pray for my counselor to get better or for services for Hannah.”Related: Students on the autism spectrum are often as smart as their peers — so why do so few go to college?In March 2016, the office of Tennessee’s comptroller of the Treasury issued an audit of dozens of the state’s federally funded programs and gave its harshest criticism to VR, issuing what’s known as an “adverse opinion.”“This is the first time our office has actually had to issue an adverse opinion in our state in auditing federal programs,” said Kandi Thomas, assistant director of performance and compliance. (The state first began this kind of audit in 1985.) “That to me speaks volumes.”Among other financial issues, the audit found that VR could not provide documentation for nearly $18 million in reported expenditures and had over-reported labor hours by 27,300 in fiscal year 2015. It also found that VR spent $22 million that should have been returned to the federal government because the state was not authorized to spend the funds.State officials said that they were addressing errors that dated back “at least 20 years.” “It is important to note that the errors were procedural in nature and the Department has not misused or otherwise misappropriated federal funds,” stated Jarnagin.Clients and advocates emphasize that they don’t believe the problem lies with individual counselors or their supervisors. They point to ballooning caseloads, high counselor turnover, poor training and an overall “mindset” that doesn’t prioritize meaningful employment for people with disabilities.In January 2015, the state’s VR office stopped serving new clients for more than a month. Officials say they were “aligning internal procedures” to make sure they were in compliance with federal law, but sources inside the agency say there was a budget crisis, with a shortfall of funds. State officials contend that no existing or prospective clients felt any impact from the move, and that they continued to process new applications, but several clients and former VR counselors dispute this. They say, for example, that the number of residential clients at a training center in Smyrna dropped to about 50 from 150. Some clients’ transportation and childcare benefits were suspended, and waiting times to get appointments and to get through the process shot up. (This was the same year that Tennessee VR gave up $14 million in federal funding.)Throughout 2015, more than 40 percent of the counselor positions at VR were vacant. This was still the case as of Sept. 30, 2016, according to Jarnagin (75 of 180 counselor positions were unfilled). She suggested that they may never be filled.“The other vacancies are in the process of being filled,” Jarnagin wrote, “however, it should be noted that pending assessment of the new WIOA requirements all of the vacancies may or may not be filled.”Leisa Hammett, whose daughter, Grace, is on the autism spectrum, had done a lot of research before entering the VR system. She had heard that many people felt they were being set up for failure. They would try several times with VR and then give up in frustration, “and end up sitting on the sofa, and that’s not what I wanted for my daughter.”Grace, now 22, had been on a waiting list for 13 years at another state agency designed to give long-term assistance to people with disabilities when Hammett opened a case with VR.“I had heard the horror stories and I thought, ‘I’ll make my own story,’ ” said Hammett, 56. “I’ll bring the honey instead of the vinegar.”Related: ‘I spend half my days in accelerated classes and the other half in special ed’After several months of paperwork, meetings and evaluations, VR helped Grace get a trial work experience at a retail store in July. It went well: Grace enjoyed it; the store was a two-minute drive from her house; and the manager asked Grace to come in for an interview for a regular job. But two days before the interview, a VR counselor told Hammett that VR could not continue to support Grace and her employer unless Grace received long-term job coaching, which VR couldn’t provide (that’s what the agency where Grace had been on the waiting list for 13 years was for).The red tape, delays and unreturned phone calls continued for weeks until finally, in October, VR reversed itself and said that they would support Grace giving the job a try. After getting back in touch with the store manager, Hammett received a message on Oct. 26 that the job was no longer available.“Many of the systems that are set up to help us end up hurting us,” said Hammett.She went back to the drawing board, making more phone calls to supervisors. She brought an outside advocate and Grace’s father to the next meeting, and Grace was offered an interview at another store, 30 minutes away from her home. Grace interviewed and was hired to work three-hour shifts three days a week for a total of nine hours a week.“It’s a start,” said Hammett. “She needed to be engaged without further ado. I will work out transportation … more time. More paperwork. More calls. More advocacy.”Advocates for those with disabilities say they hope that Tennessee’s VR agency will take steps to improve how it functions so that it can better serve their clients.“There’s a stigma that people with disabilities are consumers of resources — takers, not contributors,” said Brown, of Empower Tennessee. “But if you support people with disabilities in jobs that they want to do, they will actually be much less dependent on government services.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

Her daughter, Hannah, is on the autism spectrum and graduated from high school in 2012. Wilson, 50, was hoping to get help connecting Hannah, now 25, with a suitable job or perhaps some college courses (Hannah was speaking three languages by the time she was two years old). She and Hannah began meeting with a counselor in the Franklin city office in 2014 and one day found out, after waiting for an hour, that the counselor wasn’t there due to illness. The supervisor took them into her office and asked Wilson and her daughter if they understood the power of prayer.“That was it. I was dumbfounded,” said Wilson, who is a single mother and also has a 13-year-old son on the spectrum. “She sent us home to pray. I didn’t know if I was supposed to pray for my counselor to get better or for services for Hannah.”Related: Students on the autism spectrum are often as smart as their peers — so why do so few go to college?In March 2016, the office of Tennessee’s comptroller of the Treasury issued an audit of dozens of the state’s federally funded programs and gave its harshest criticism to VR, issuing what’s known as an “adverse opinion.”“This is the first time our office has actually had to issue an adverse opinion in our state in auditing federal programs,” said Kandi Thomas, assistant director of performance and compliance. (The state first began this kind of audit in 1985.) “That to me speaks volumes.”Among other financial issues, the audit found that VR could not provide documentation for nearly $18 million in reported expenditures and had over-reported labor hours by 27,300 in fiscal year 2015. It also found that VR spent $22 million that should have been returned to the federal government because the state was not authorized to spend the funds.State officials said that they were addressing errors that dated back “at least 20 years.” “It is important to note that the errors were procedural in nature and the Department has not misused or otherwise misappropriated federal funds,” stated Jarnagin.Clients and advocates emphasize that they don’t believe the problem lies with individual counselors or their supervisors. They point to ballooning caseloads, high counselor turnover, poor training and an overall “mindset” that doesn’t prioritize meaningful employment for people with disabilities.In January 2015, the state’s VR office stopped serving new clients for more than a month. Officials say they were “aligning internal procedures” to make sure they were in compliance with federal law, but sources inside the agency say there was a budget crisis, with a shortfall of funds. State officials contend that no existing or prospective clients felt any impact from the move, and that they continued to process new applications, but several clients and former VR counselors dispute this. They say, for example, that the number of residential clients at a training center in Smyrna dropped to about 50 from 150. Some clients’ transportation and childcare benefits were suspended, and waiting times to get appointments and to get through the process shot up. (This was the same year that Tennessee VR gave up $14 million in federal funding.)Throughout 2015, more than 40 percent of the counselor positions at VR were vacant. This was still the case as of Sept. 30, 2016, according to Jarnagin (75 of 180 counselor positions were unfilled). She suggested that they may never be filled.“The other vacancies are in the process of being filled,” Jarnagin wrote, “however, it should be noted that pending assessment of the new WIOA requirements all of the vacancies may or may not be filled.”Leisa Hammett, whose daughter, Grace, is on the autism spectrum, had done a lot of research before entering the VR system. She had heard that many people felt they were being set up for failure. They would try several times with VR and then give up in frustration, “and end up sitting on the sofa, and that’s not what I wanted for my daughter.”Grace, now 22, had been on a waiting list for 13 years at another state agency designed to give long-term assistance to people with disabilities when Hammett opened a case with VR.“I had heard the horror stories and I thought, ‘I’ll make my own story,’ ” said Hammett, 56. “I’ll bring the honey instead of the vinegar.”Related: ‘I spend half my days in accelerated classes and the other half in special ed’After several months of paperwork, meetings and evaluations, VR helped Grace get a trial work experience at a retail store in July. It went well: Grace enjoyed it; the store was a two-minute drive from her house; and the manager asked Grace to come in for an interview for a regular job. But two days before the interview, a VR counselor told Hammett that VR could not continue to support Grace and her employer unless Grace received long-term job coaching, which VR couldn’t provide (that’s what the agency where Grace had been on the waiting list for 13 years was for).The red tape, delays and unreturned phone calls continued for weeks until finally, in October, VR reversed itself and said that they would support Grace giving the job a try. After getting back in touch with the store manager, Hammett received a message on Oct. 26 that the job was no longer available.“Many of the systems that are set up to help us end up hurting us,” said Hammett.She went back to the drawing board, making more phone calls to supervisors. She brought an outside advocate and Grace’s father to the next meeting, and Grace was offered an interview at another store, 30 minutes away from her home. Grace interviewed and was hired to work three-hour shifts three days a week for a total of nine hours a week.“It’s a start,” said Hammett. “She needed to be engaged without further ado. I will work out transportation … more time. More paperwork. More calls. More advocacy.”Advocates for those with disabilities say they hope that Tennessee’s VR agency will take steps to improve how it functions so that it can better serve their clients.“There’s a stigma that people with disabilities are consumers of resources — takers, not contributors,” said Brown, of Empower Tennessee. “But if you support people with disabilities in jobs that they want to do, they will actually be much less dependent on government services.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

That’s what I experienced on election",2016-12-05,"Supporters of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton watch and wait at her election night rally in New York, U.S., November 8, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5845f9381800002c00e41092.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Maybe you’ve heard of the “Five Stages of Grief.”First, there’s shock and denial. That’s what I experienced on election night. “This isn’t happening. This can’t be happening.”After that comes anger.And next—well, I don’t know what comes next. I haven’t moved past the anger phase personally.Let me tell you why I’m angry.I’m angry at FBI Director Jim Comey. There was a wide consensus among pollsters that on October 26 Hillary Clinton had an electoral majority. While Hillary aimed to turn out the Obama coalition, she had also made impressive inroads with college-educated whites, a cohort Democrats historically lose. And she was running strong with them, up by 12 points, until Comey’s reckless and unprecedented intrusion into the election.The email story followed a familiar pattern. Hillary’s support dipped whenever the email controversy was in the news. As soon as the story faded from the headlines, people dismissed it, and she recovered.We built up a strong immune system to the email nothingburger, but, in the end, Hillary was unable to fight off the Comey virus, given all the other pathogens of the cycle. There was simply no time to recover, especially among late-deciding college-educated women. The Comey letter also depressed turnout with the Demoratic base.In short, the late-stage release of the Comey letter cost Hillary the election. Independent analysts from Nate Silver to Mike Podhorzer of the AFL-CIO have reached the same conclusion.Yes. It’s that simple. Numbers don’t lie.So, I’m angry at Jim Comey, and I’m even angrier at the Clinton-haters in the FBI, egged on by Trump sycophant Rudy Giuliani, who forced Comey’s hand.I’m angry at the media for their inexcusably awful coverage of the email story. How many consumers of news know that, despite his personal disagreement over the use of a personal email server, Comey testified under oath that Hillary Clinton did not lie about her emails?The New York Times, The Washington Post and the rest of the media old guard turned a minor story into a central issue of the campaign. Each time we thought the zombie story was dead, it would rise again in all caps above the fold, burying the truly consequential stories.And speaking of buried consequential stories, I’m also angry at Russia, a hostile foreign power that engaged in a criminal conspiracy to hack Democratic computers and employed ruthlessly effective KGB-style propaganda tactics to sway the election to their candidate, a Putin puppet.Let’s be clear about how much trouble we’re in: The FBI and the Russian government allied with the Republican Party to elect a president who is an enemy of our small-‘d’ democratic system of government, whose methods and instincts are those of a dictator in the developing world. The NSA failed to stop the Russian interference—in fact, the NSA itself got hacked. Now Trump controls the NSA.It’s not yet accurate to call this a coup d’etat, but it’s important to recognize the similarities.I’m angry at the purveyors of fake news. I’m even angrier at companies like Facebook that caved to organized right-wing pressure and enabled a wave of misinformation. An analysis by BuzzFeed found that fake election stories generated more total engagement on Facebook than top election stories from 19 major news outlets combined.Fake news is an existential threat to our democracy. And now, for the first time in our history, we have a minister of disinformation, Steve Bannon, who commanded a vast proto-fascist media empire, operating from a plum perch in the West Wing.I’m angry at the mainstream media, which framed the election as a choice between two detestable people – one an aspiring banana republican ― and the other, one of the most qualified, dedicated, forward-thinking and honorable candidates ever to seek the office of the presidency.Abdicating their vital public mission, the media built Donald Trump up for money and ratings. They tipped the scales by, for example, sweeping the sham Trump Foundation and its illegal donations under the rug while smearing the Clinton Foundation, which has saved millions of lives in the developing world.In the closing weeks of the campaign, faced with having to cover video footage of Donald Trump bragging about routinely groping women, I know of news editors demanding more coverage of how Hillary used her own email address. They didn’t have truth or fairness foremost in mind; they were desperate to satisfy some perverted notion of “parity,” the virtuous-sounding news term for false equivalence.The only hint of self-reflection I’ve seen in the media are a few articles suggesting they don’t understand Appalachian whites as well as they ought to. As if their only sin was not reading J.D. Vance’s “Hillbilly Elegy” soon enough. Nothing about their news judgment, nothing approaching former New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan’s gently-presented piece after the Times erroneously reported that Hillary was about to be indicted.The bottom line is this: The press helped install in the White House a “ringside revolutionary,” a racist demagogue who doesn’t even believe in a free press. Good luck with that.I’m also angry at Republican suppression of the vote. For years, Republicans have stealthily advanced laws that unconstitutionally restrict the franchise in states like North Carolina, Wisconsin, Florida, Ohio and Texas. By requiring specific forms of ID, limiting early voting, and even applying literacy tests, these states erased the African-American and Latino firewall that could have thwarted a Trump presidency.I’m angry at those who voted for Green party candidate Jill Stein, the Ralph Nader of 2016. Stein’s vote exceeded Trump’s margin of victory in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and, nearly 5-to-1, in Michigan.Dr. Stein midwifed the birth of a national crisis that will be a nightmare for the causes she professes to care most about, from the Supreme Court to healthcare for all.So much for the revolution.I’m really angry at those in America who still refuse to give a woman a shot in the top job.And I’m angry at the millions of disaffected millennials who sat on their hands in the most consequential election of our lives and didn’t even bother to vote. From gay rights to college affordability to the threat of global climate change, the Trump administration will be a disaster on the issues that matter most to millennials.But most of all, I’m angry at Donald Trump and his campaign. I’m angry that he openly encouraged and capitalized on Russian criminal espionage. I’m angry that we have a president-elect whose path to power ran straight through the Kremlin.And I’m angry at Trump for running an overtly anti-Semitic campaign. I was outraged when he slapped a Jewish star on a photo of Hillary, with cash raining down above her. Even his closing argument—the television ad he ran in the final days of the campaign—put anti-Semitic tropes front-and-center, casting prominent Jews like Janet Yellen and George Soros as villains who control global finance, an anti-Semitic slur right out of the pages of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.I’m angry about the misogyny that permeated Trump’s campaign. I’m angry about the nativism. I’m angry about the racism. The list goes on and on.Have I mentioned that I’m still not past the anger stage of grief? I don’t plan to move past it anytime soon.The fifth and final stage of grief is acceptance.Those of us who care about progressive values, those of us who are for respect and unity, not discrimination and division, must never accept the Trump presidency.The work of the opposition party begins now."
17,THE WORLDPOST,A “One Taiwan” Policy? Let’s Take Out the Chinese?,"Howard Barbanel, ContributorWriter, Editor, GOP Political Consultant, Winemaker",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-one-taiwan-policy-lets-take-out-the-chinese_us_5845f3bee4b0707e4c8171c4,Much brouhaha has been made over the weekend phone call between President-Elect Donald Trump and Taiwan’s President Tsai,2016-12-05,<p><strong>The late Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong</strong></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5845f3e81800001b00e41088.jpg?ops=crop_189_2_973_645%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale," Much brouhaha has been made over the weekend phone call between President-Elect Donald Trump and Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen. On the surface you’d think that calling out for Chinese would be no big deal, but this conversation wasn’t about Moo Goo Gai Pan and by merely having any conversation at all, a lot of mainland Chinese bile has hit the wok.Taiwanese Presidents have been untouchable by top U.S. leaders for nearly four decades owing to the “One China Policy” created back in the 70s by former President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. This policy in a nutshell says that the U.S. and most of the West recognize that China is one integral, indivisible country and that the Communists in Beijing by dint of controlling over 90 percent of it are the legitimate government of this one country.Conventional thinking is that partition is OK for Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, for Palestinians and Israelis, Indians and Pakistanis but not for China. This is a big burr under the posteriors of the Beijing Politburo because any deviation from this position implies the Communist regime perhaps isn’t as legitimate as they’d like the world and their own people to regard it and that the Chinese civil war hasn’t been resolved. It infuriates the Communists that any remnant of non-Communist China exists because that existence means there must be another political point of view and in monolithic mainland China, that’s an anathema because the people of China aren’t meant to have any say as to who their leaders are and how their country is run.For nearly four decades, the U.S. and the West have been cravenly kowtowing to the Communists by dint of their strategic (and now economic) importance in the world. Nuclear missiles, millions of soldiers and really cheap consumer goods speak louder than the principles of freedom, democracy and human rights.The Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan are the heirs to the popular revolution more than a century ago to overthrow the millennia-old Chinese monarchy and create a republic. Seeing an opportunity to further international Communism owing to the instability within China as a result of that revolution, the Soviets poured money and materiél into the fledgling Communist guerrilla insurgency led by Mao Zedong. Mao made life miserable for Chiang Kai-Shek and the Nationalists who were concurrently battling breakaway warlords, the Communists and then by the late 1930s, the Japanese who were trying to conquer the country.During World War II the Soviets instructed Mao to take a break from beating on the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, but after 1945 the civil war resumed in full earnest. From the late 1920s until the Communists conquered the entire mainland in 1949, Mao slaughtered and starved hundreds of thousands of opponents and after 1949 the Communists killed millions more of their own citizens through their Stalin-esque Gulag system, endless purges and forced collectivization.Chiang’s troops, driven from the mainland, fled to the island of Taiwan along with a couple of million mainlanders and declared that the Republic of China was now situated there and they hoped to use that island as a base to eventually invade the mainland, resume the civil war and overthrow the Communists. For about 30 years the U.S.-backed the Nationalists on Taiwan as the legitimate government of all China. In the 70s former President Nixon “opened up” Communist China as a way to create a strategic wedge between and the Soviet Union and China thereby weakening global Communist forces. In this Nixon succeeded. While switching recognition from the Nationalists to the Communists, the U.S. also ambiguously pledged to ensure that Taiwan wasn’t forcibly integrated into the mainland and could defend itself and maintain its de-facto independence.Over the last few decades the government in Taiwan has evolved from an essentially pro-West fascist dictatorship led by the Kuomintang (KMT, or Chinese Nationalist Party, founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1912) to a multi-party pluralistic free democracy where there have been peaceful transfers of power between the KMT and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Taiwan’s current President is from the DPP. Taiwan today is a free-enterprise economic powerhouse with the rule of law, freedoms of speech, press, assembly, religion, travel, livelihood, etc.Meanwhile, on the mainland, the Communists still have an iron grip on any political expression. Basic freedoms are still repressed. The people are made quiescent by a potent mixture of intimidation through force and the injection of state-sponsored capitalism which allows folks to make money and buy creature comforts. Ironically, the Communist Party has transmogrified into a fascist dictatorship themselves which enables them to stay in power. But the people are given no other options. It’s kind of like both Saudi Arabia where silence is also bought with money and ancient Rome where the masses were quelled with bread and circuses.There are many on Taiwan who would like to put a formal end to the Chinese civil war, give up any claims to the mainland and rejoin the family of nations – essentially get on with their lives and have their own freedom and self-determination on Taiwan for Taiwan and leave the mainland to its own devices. The problem is that the Communists won’t hear of it. It’s an all or nothing, my way or the highway deal with them – no Chinese (except maybe in New York’s Chinatown) can be under their own umbrella – it has the be the Beijing parasol or you’re flat out of luck.So, back to Mr. Trump and Ms. Tsai. By even implicitly or by slight inference recognizing that Taiwan has a President and that this President might possibly be legitimate, it opens the specter of a brave new world vis-à-vis China that could have geo-strategic and economic implications of a potentially frightening nature.Should the 23.5 million people of Taiwan have the right to self-determination free from threats of coercion and annihilation? Should the US stand firm for human rights and for what’s right around the world irrespective of existing political orthodoxies? A lot of folks didn’t think the Iron Curtain in Europe could ever be shattered, but it was. What about Asia’s “bamboo curtain?” (China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and North Korea).

Let’s Take Out the Chinese?,"Howard Barbanel, ContributorWriter, Editor, GOP Political Consultant, Winemaker",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-one-taiwan-policy-lets-take-out-the-chinese_us_5845f3bee4b0707e4c8171c4,Much brouhaha has been made over the weekend phone call between President-Elect Donald Trump and Taiwan’s President Tsai,2016-12-05,<p><strong>The late Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-Shek</strong></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5845f4461200001500eeda79.jpg?ops=crop_0_0_339_300%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale," Much brouhaha has been made over the weekend phone call between President-Elect Donald Trump and Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen. On the surface you’d think that calling out for Chinese would be no big deal, but this conversation wasn’t about Moo Goo Gai Pan and by merely having any conversation at all, a lot of mainland Chinese bile has hit the wok.Taiwanese Presidents have been untouchable by top U.S. leaders for nearly four decades owing to the “One China Policy” created back in the 70s by former President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. This policy in a nutshell says that the U.S. and most of the West recognize that China is one integral, indivisible country and that the Communists in Beijing by dint of controlling over 90 percent of it are the legitimate government of this one country.Conventional thinking is that partition is OK for Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, for Palestinians and Israelis, Indians and Pakistanis but not for China. This is a big burr under the posteriors of the Beijing Politburo because any deviation from this position implies the Communist regime perhaps isn’t as legitimate as they’d like the world and their own people to regard it and that the Chinese civil war hasn’t been resolved. It infuriates the Communists that any remnant of non-Communist China exists because that existence means there must be another political point of view and in monolithic mainland China, that’s an anathema because the people of China aren’t meant to have any say as to who their leaders are and how their country is run.For nearly four decades, the U.S. and the West have been cravenly kowtowing to the Communists by dint of their strategic (and now economic) importance in the world. Nuclear missiles, millions of soldiers and really cheap consumer goods speak louder than the principles of freedom, democracy and human rights.The Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan are the heirs to the popular revolution more than a century ago to overthrow the millennia-old Chinese monarchy and create a republic. Seeing an opportunity to further international Communism owing to the instability within China as a result of that revolution, the Soviets poured money and materiél into the fledgling Communist guerrilla insurgency led by Mao Zedong. Mao made life miserable for Chiang Kai-Shek and the Nationalists who were concurrently battling breakaway warlords, the Communists and then by the late 1930s, the Japanese who were trying to conquer the country.During World War II the Soviets instructed Mao to take a break from beating on the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, but after 1945 the civil war resumed in full earnest. From the late 1920s until the Communists conquered the entire mainland in 1949, Mao slaughtered and starved hundreds of thousands of opponents and after 1949 the Communists killed millions more of their own citizens through their Stalin-esque Gulag system, endless purges and forced collectivization.Chiang’s troops, driven from the mainland, fled to the island of Taiwan along with a couple of million mainlanders and declared that the Republic of China was now situated there and they hoped to use that island as a base to eventually invade the mainland, resume the civil war and overthrow the Communists. For about 30 years the U.S.-backed the Nationalists on Taiwan as the legitimate government of all China. In the 70s former President Nixon “opened up” Communist China as a way to create a strategic wedge between and the Soviet Union and China thereby weakening global Communist forces. In this Nixon succeeded. While switching recognition from the Nationalists to the Communists, the U.S. also ambiguously pledged to ensure that Taiwan wasn’t forcibly integrated into the mainland and could defend itself and maintain its de-facto independence.Over the last few decades the government in Taiwan has evolved from an essentially pro-West fascist dictatorship led by the Kuomintang (KMT, or Chinese Nationalist Party, founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1912) to a multi-party pluralistic free democracy where there have been peaceful transfers of power between the KMT and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Taiwan’s current President is from the DPP. Taiwan today is a free-enterprise economic powerhouse with the rule of law, freedoms of speech, press, assembly, religion, travel, livelihood, etc.Meanwhile, on the mainland, the Communists still have an iron grip on any political expression. Basic freedoms are still repressed. The people are made quiescent by a potent mixture of intimidation through force and the injection of state-sponsored capitalism which allows folks to make money and buy creature comforts. Ironically, the Communist Party has transmogrified into a fascist dictatorship themselves which enables them to stay in power. But the people are given no other options. It’s kind of like both Saudi Arabia where silence is also bought with money and ancient Rome where the masses were quelled with bread and circuses.There are many on Taiwan who would like to put a formal end to the Chinese civil war, give up any claims to the mainland and rejoin the family of nations – essentially get on with their lives and have their own freedom and self-determination on Taiwan for Taiwan and leave the mainland to its own devices. The problem is that the Communists won’t hear of it. It’s an all or nothing, my way or the highway deal with them – no Chinese (except maybe in New York’s Chinatown) can be under their own umbrella – it has the be the Beijing parasol or you’re flat out of luck.So, back to Mr. Trump and Ms. Tsai. By even implicitly or by slight inference recognizing that Taiwan has a President and that this President might possibly be legitimate, it opens the specter of a brave new world vis-à-vis China that could have geo-strategic and economic implications of a potentially frightening nature.Should the 23.5 million people of Taiwan have the right to self-determination free from threats of coercion and annihilation? Should the US stand firm for human rights and for what’s right around the world irrespective of existing political orthodoxies? A lot of folks didn’t think the Iron Curtain in Europe could ever be shattered, but it was. What about Asia’s “bamboo curtain?” (China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and North Korea). Donald Trump could certainly make it an interesting ride to say the least if resetting China policy is on his mind.(�5��7�"

Instead, Stein’s campaign withdrew.“Petitioners are regular citizens of ordinary means. They cannot afford to post the $1,000,000 bond required by the court,” wrote attorney Lawrence Otter, informing the court of the decision to withdraw.Stein, who garnered about 1 percent of the presidential vote on Nov. 8, has also sought recounts in Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump won narrow victories over Democrat Hillary Clinton in all three states, part of the industrial heartland of the country until manufacturers started leaving for Mexico and other low-wage countries.Trump and his allies have attempted to stop the initiatives in the states, calling the recount effort a “scam.” Clinton’s campaign has said it would take part in the recounts.“The judge’s outrageous demand that voters pay such an exorbitant figure is a shameful, unacceptable barrier to democratic participation,” Stein said in a statement. “No voter in America should be forced to pay thousands of dollars to know if her or his vote was counted.”Stein said she planned to announce “the next step” in the recount effort on Monday at a previously scheduled news conference at Trump Tower in New York City.She said recounts already under way in some Pennsylvania counties would continue. The state’s election commission had approved recounts in 75 precincts where voters requested one, but refused to allow a full forensic audit of voting machines.Even if all the recounts were to take place, the overall election outcome would not likely change. The race is decided by the Electoral College, or a tally of wins from the state-by-state contests, rather than by the popular national vote.Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win, with 306. Recounts would have to flip the result to Clinton in all three states to change the result.In the popular vote, Clinton had more than 2.5 million votes over Trump, the independent Cook Political Report said.(Additional reporting by Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles and Chris Michaud in New York; Writing by Frank McGurty; Editing by Bill Rigby, Tom Brown and Nick Macfie)"

He is already a statesman, he is the head of the United States of America, one of the world’s leading countries,” NTV quoted Putin as saying in the interview on www.ntv.ru on Sunday.“Because he achieved success in business, it suggests that he is a clever man.

We assume that he will be acting from these positions,” Putin said.Putin’s comments appeared to address criticism from Trump’s opponents who say his unconventional actions since the election - including railing at the cast of a Broadway show and early-morning invective on Twitter - show Trump is out of his depth.China lodged a diplomatic protest on Saturday after Trump spoke by phone with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, the first by a U.S. president-elect or president since Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, acknowledging Taiwan as part of “one China”.Speaking about Russia’s relations with the West, Putin said attempts to create a unipolar world had failed: “The situation is changing.

The deal curbs Tehran’s nuclear program in return for the lifting of international financial sanctions.“America’s president is obliged to exercise his authority by preventing its approval and particularly its implementation ... and if this gross violation is carried out we will firmly respond,” Rouhani said in the speech, carried live by state television.President Obama is expected to sign the legislation into law, the White House said on Friday.The U.S. Congress move was a blow to Rouhani, a pragmatist who engineered the diplomatic opening to the West that led to the nuclear deal.U.S. officials have said the ISA renewal would not infringe the nuclear agreement. U.S. lawmakers have also said the ISA extension would make it easier for sanctions to be quickly reimposed if Iran contravened the nuclear deal.On Sunday, 264 lawmakers in Iran’s 290-seat parliament issued a statement calling on the government to implement counter measures, including relaunching nuclear enrichment halted under the atomic deal, the official news agency IRNA reported.The diplomatic thaw between Washington and Tehran over the past two years looks in jeopardy with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump taking office next month. He said during his election campaign that he would scrap the nuclear agreement.Last month, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that the extension would be viewed in Tehran as a breach of the nuclear accord and threatened retaliation.Khamenei and his hardline loyalists have criticized the deal and blamed Rouhani for his government’s failure to deliver swift improvements in living standards since sanctions were lifted in January."

Private polls have continued to be conducted in the last two weeks and bookmakers say ‘No’ remains the clear favorite to win.However, in the final days of frenetic campaigning Renzi insisted the public mood was changing, focusing his attention on the millions of Italians who said they were undecided.Pippo Nicosia, a stall-holder at Campo dei Fiori market in central Rome, said he would vote ‘Yes’ but had no doubt about the result. “’No’ will win, everything will collapse so we might as well all go on holiday,” he said.TURNOUTTurnout, expected at between 50 and 60 percent, could be crucial. Pollsters say lower participation could favor Renzi, as hostility to his reform is strongest among young voters and those in the poor south, segments of the population that often don’t bother to vote.A turnout above 60 percent could also make the result more unpredictable, as it would suggest many voters who said they planned to abstain ended up going to the polls.With bookmakers’ odds suggesting a roughly 75 percent chance of a win for ‘No’, speculation is rife on what Renzi will do in the event of defeat.He is widely expected to resign and has said he will play no role in any unelected, “technical” government, which President Sergio Mattarella may try to put in place. Some of his allies have urged him to stay in power regardless of the result.The result of exit polls will be announced as soon as voting ends and the count begins at 11 p.m. After around 30 minutes, the first projections of the result will be announced on the basis of actual votes counted.If the result is not close, the winner could be clear after the second projection, some time between midnight and 1 a.m. (0000 GMT). In a very close race, the winner may not be known until the count is completed, probably between 2 and 3 a.m.Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan sought to calm nervous markets on Friday, saying there was “no risk of a financial earthquake” if ‘No’ wins, though there may be “48 hours of turbulence”.Market jitters have concentrated on Italy’s banks, saddled with 360 billion euros ($380 billion) of bad loans, and most specifically on Monte Dei Paschi di Siena, its oldest and third largest lender.The bank needs to raise 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) by the end of the year to plug a capital shortfall or risk being wound down. Government officials say potential investors may be deterred by political instability if ‘No’ should win.(Additional reporting by Gabriele Pileri; Editing by Janet Lawrence and Giulia Segreti)"

A total of 181 workers were initially trapped underground and 149 of them were rescued, Xinhua said.This was the second major coal mine accident in the past week, coming at a time when the government told miners to resume production to tame high coal prices and meet winter demand.In the first disaster, authorities confirmed on Friday that 21 people died after a coal mine blast in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.

Raul Castro saluted the rock, which was flanked by two honor guards in white uniform.WAR AND PEACEFidel Castro had been out of power for a decade but never far from the center of public life. In his final years he wrote a periodic column on world and local matters and received foreign dignitaries at his home on the outskirts of Havana.Castro gave Cuba an outsized influence in world affairs. He was feted by Nelson Mandela for helping to end apartheid at a time when the West supported the racist system, but helped take the world to the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis.Forced to step down due to an intestinal ailment, he ceded power to his brother, at first provisionally in 2006, then definitively in 2008.His send off reflected a man who had a vast public career but was intensely private about his health and family.Dominating Cuban life for almost 50 years as president, Castro angrily rejected suggestions he was a dictator, denying any personal enrichment or personality cult around him.In keeping with his wishes, Castro’s image will not be immortalized with statues and public places will not be named after him, his brother said on Saturday.Cubans still do not know the cause of his death, or where he was cremated. After a three-day caravan in which Cubans lined streets and packed squares to bid him farewell, the last ceremony was not broadcast on Cuban media.Instead, in Havana, military cannons unleashed a 21-gun salute that thundered across the capital city as the ceremony began hundreds of miles to the south east.Castro’s naturalistic memorial was dwarfed by Marti’s mausoleum and other elaborate edifices at the cemetery. The stone is a few steps from a monument to rebels who died fighting in the Moncada attack in Santiago, which started the revolution.Seeing greatness in himself long before taking power, Castro created his own, enduring persona, and played the role with a flourish throughout his long public life.He was at various times a triumphant revolutionary, an indefatigable speaker, and a military strategist. His larger-than-life character instilled Cuba with pride and national identity, while also generating acute hatred among his enemies.It even came with its own wardrobe and props: olive green fatigues and military hat, boots and a beard, and, until he quit smoking in the 1980s, a long lancero cigar.He ruled for 49 years, longer than any contemporary except for Queen Elizabeth of England. He aligned Cuba with the Soviet Union and sustained a near-permanent confrontation with the United States, sending both doctors and soldiers overseas to burnish Cuba’s revolutionary character.In recent years, Cuban doctors have been praised for quick deployment in international health crises, including the Ebola outbreak and the aftermath of Haiti’s 2010 earthquake.Even after ceding power to Raul, now 85, Fidel was a guiding light to leftists and anti-imperialists around world and a lightning rod for the barbs of his critics, who loathed him for confiscating private property, jailing opponents, and shutting down almost all dissent.U.S. FOEThe impact of his long clash with the United States is still being felt. Cuban-Americans in Miami celebrated his death, and Washington maintains a trade embargo that Castro long used as the reason for Cuba’s economic troubles.U.S. Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Sunday called Raul Castro “a murdering dictator,” in the latest sign the new Washington administration will be adversarial with Cuba, rhetorically at least.President Barack Obama changed course on U.S. policy toward Cuba in December 2014, agreeing on a prisoner exchange, declaring his intent to restore diplomatic ties and asking the U.S. Congress to end the embargo.Fidel Castro gave grudging approval to the detente brokered by his brother. He did not meet Obama during his historic visit to the island, instead penning a column that warned Cubans not to trust the president’s “honey-coated” words.President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to reverse Obama’s rapprochement after he assumes the White House on Jan. 20 unless Cuba enacts internal changes, the kind of pressure both Castro brothers have vehemently rejected.(Writing by Daniel Trotta and Frank Jack Daniel; Editing by Mary Milliken, Jeffrey Benkoe and Chris Reese)"

He spent a quarter of a century in academia and held a professorship in economics.In the 1970s, he was a member of Austria’s Social Democrats, and he has acknowledged voting for the Communist party as a young man. He eventually joined the environmentalist Greens, a party he went on to lead for 11 years, until 2008.A fan of American crime novels who sports a three-day beard, Van der Bellen campaigned for the largely ceremonial role of president on his support for the European Union. His strategy pushed Hofer, a leader of the Freedom Party (FPO), to accuse him of wanting to degrade Austria to a province of the EU.“I would think it a big mistake to promote the drifting apart of the European Union,” Van der Bellen has said.Arguing that Austria’s staying in the EU helps economic growth in the export-dependent country of 8.7 million people, Van der Bellen won over conservative voters who might not have naturally gravitated towards a former Greens politician.“I want to be a president of the center,” Van der Bellen has said. “Some wanted to assert that the presidential election (was) a vote between two extremes. I must object to this: I stand in the middle of society.”(Editing by Larry King)"
28,SPORTS,Jets Running Back Has Creative Plan To Bring Attention To The Horrors Of Gun Violence,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bilal-powell-anti-gun-violence-cleats-jets_us_5841aed5e4b017f37fe44757,Keep an eye on Bilal Powell's cleats during Monday Night Football.,2016-12-04,Jets running back Bilal Powell has lost a cousin and multiple friends to gun violence.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584343eb1800002c00e40bbc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the NFL told players this season that they could dedicate a piece of their uniforms to a cause or charity they wanted to highlight, Bilal Powell knew right away what he wanted to do.So on Monday night, the soft-spoken New York Jets running back plans to use his cleats to send a loud message to the world: It’s time to put an end to the gun violence plaguing American communities. Gun violence is an issue that hits close to home for Powell, whether that’s in his native Lakeland, Florida; in Louisville, Kentucky, where he went to college and still has a home; or in New Jersey, where he lives during the NFL season. “I lost a lot of friends and a family member to gun violence,” Powell told The Huffington Post by phone Saturday. “My best friend lost a bunch of family members to gun violence in the city of Louisville, and it’s pretty bad up here in New Jersey too. ... You just want to do something about it.”The NFL has long fined players, like Powell’s teammate Brandon Marshall, for using their cleats as a billboard for issues that aren’t league-sanctioned. But after years of criticism, it announced earlier this year that it would relax the policy for Week 13 of the 2016 season. As it happens, the Jets will play the Indianapolis Colts during Monday Night Football, giving Powell’s message against gun violence a national audience. “It being a Monday night game, it was a chance to bring awareness,” he said. “We have to see what we can do to, one day, get everybody at peace and live together.”Once he landed on gun violence prevention as the issue he wanted to highlight, Powell still had to figure out the best way to do it. For that, he turned to Scedric Moss, his former University of Louisville teammate who is now an artist based in the city. Moss was busy with his own projects. But he had also lost friends to gun violence, and he couldn’t pass up the opportunity to design Powell’s cleats.Moss went to work, fast. The result was a pair of tricolor cleats that will be impossible to miss under the stadium’s bright lights. Each of the three colors Moss selected ― green, neon yellow and red ― symbolizes gun violence. The green, Powell said, stands for money, often a source of conflict that leads to fatal gun disputes. The yellow is for police caution tape. And the red speckles represent the blood shed in each of America’s thousands of annual gun deaths.“He lost friends and family to the same thing, so it meant that much more to him to be a part of this,” Powell said of choosing Moss to design the shoes. “It was good timing and the right thing to do.”On the side of each shoe, Moss also painted the outlines of two raised hands. They represent the charity Hands Across Louisville, an anti-gun violence organization in Powell’s adopted hometown. The shoes will go to auction after the game, and the proceeds will be put toward the group’s work to address the root causes of gun violence. Among other priorities, the organization wants to train local citizens in anger management and social interaction, and bolster job creation and career-training efforts, Powell chose the Louisville charity because of the time he spent there in college. He was a standout running back for the Cardinals, amassing more than 2,600 total yards and 22 touchdowns during his four years at the university. To get there, he’d left behind a past that included, he said, a stint in a gang in Florida.But even in in Kentucky, gun violence remained close to his life. During Powell’s sophomore year in 2008, Louisville wide receiver Trent Guy was injured in a shooting in the city. Two years later, another one of Powell’s teammates ― former Cardinals linebacker Daniel Covington ― was shot and killed in a dispute downtown.The city where Powell now lives in the offseason and plans to retire once his career is over is still struggling with gun violence: a double homicide shooting in Louisville’s Shawnee Park on Thanksgiving Day made national news ― and pushed the city’s total number of homicides for the year to a five-decade high.“The city of Louisville will always be in my heart,” Powell said. “You have people losing innocent lives in this. This hit home for me. I wanted to choose something that I had a connection to.”And although he already had the cleats in the works, the issue of gun violence touched Powell’s life again this week. Former Jets running back Joe McKnight was shot and killed during an apparent traffic altercation outside of New Orleans on Thursday afternoon. Powell and McKnight were teammates for two years in New York, and the two had kept in touch, even though McKnight left the NFL and spent this past season in the Canadian Football League.Powell’s call for an end to gun violence, then, will carry a particularly poignant and timely message Monday night. “Joe was an amazing person. A great teammate, and an even better person,” Powell said. “That right there, it’s sad to say, that another person’s life is gone over something that probably could have been prevented. ... It puts a lot of things in perspective.”The cleats aren’t Powell’s only form of action on gun violence. After he made it to the NFL, he started The Bilal Powell Foundation to help keep children out of trouble and away from the type of violence has has experienced up close too often. It’s geared toward expanding community and education opportunities for at-risk children in the cities he’s called home.But for a running back who usually prefers to let his performance on the field speak for him, this week, and this pair of cleats, offers a chance to broadcast his message publicly in a way he hasn’t necessarily before. Powell is excited about that opportunity, so much so that he’s even planning to make his teammates wait to see the final product in person.“Hopefully this is something that will wake a lot of people up,” Powell said. “What I’m trying to do Monday night is get people to open their eyes, man, and try to bring peace.” "

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) enjoys the support of over 100 Democratic lawmakers in his quest to chair the Democratic National Committee ― more than any other candidate.But virtually from the moment Ellison announced his bid, there has been a steady campaign to undermine his candidacy to head the Democratic Party leadership body, mainly focused on his past ties to the Nation of Islam.Ellison helped organize a Minneapolis delegation to the Million Man March, a rally for black men organized by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Years earlier, while Ellison was in law school, he defended Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam in a few newspaper columns. The congressman has expressed regret for not speaking out more forcefully at the time against Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism and bigotry. And his law school columns reveal an idealist committed to redressing the wrongs of slavery and institutional racism, not a radical.On Thursday, however, newly unearthed comments Ellison made in 2010, where he questioned the outsize influence of concern for Israel on U.S. Middle East policy, drew the condemnation of the Anti-Defamation League, an influential Jewish anti-racism organization with hawkish Middle East views.The ADL’s criticism deserves to be assessed on its merits. But some members of the media have gotten a little premature in their pronouncements that it doomed Ellison’s candidacy.Consider a conversation on NBC’s “Meet the Press Daily” on Friday evening:CHUCK TODD, host: Keith Ellison ― is his candidacy toast? The ADL came out noting some remarks he made about Israel six years ago. He struggled to explain them. There has been some other folks and they are very upset at Schumer for supporting him. Is pressure building to suddenly stop ― a stop Ellison movement?Ellison enjoys the endorsement of Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming Senate minority leader, outgoing leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and the two most important progressive senators in the Democratic caucus ― Massachusetts’ Elizabeth Warren and Vermont’s Bernie Sanders. But according to Todd and Marcus, a press release from the Anti-Defamation League means that Ellison is just about finished.Rather than provide measured, reporting-based commentary, Todd and Marcus exemplify how journalists are capable of doing politicians’ bidding. Intentionally or not, they are boosting the conservative forces in the Democratic Party who want to block Ellison because of his strong stance against the Israeli occupation, for the Iran nuclear deal and other progressive Middle East policies.This is how pessimistic analysis becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. A handful of reporters warn that a lawmaker’s chances are in danger for a reason they consider important, other commentators repeat it and it becomes conventional wisdom. Then people who still like the lawmaker start to think he’ll lose, and since no one wants to back a loser, they too withdraw their backing.Of course, it’s fine if people object to Ellison’s heading the DNC because of comments he made about Israel. But it’s important to read the actual comments and decide for yourself, rather than relying on journalists who muse about whether he is already “toast.”The particular comment that made waves was excerpted from remarks at a 2010 fundraiser dug up by the right-wing organization, the Investigative Project on Terrorism. The group is headed by ex-journalist Steven Emerson, who the Southern Poverty Law Center includes on its list of “anti-Muslim extremists.”“The United States foreign policy in the Middle East is governed by what is good or bad through a country of 7 million people,” Ellison said at the event, which was held by Essam Omeish, a Muslim supporter of his. “A region of 350 million all turns on a country of 7 million. Does that make sense? Is that logic? Right? When the Americans who trace their roots back to those 350 million get involved, everything changes.”Ellison is alluding to the influence of Israel, whose population is now over 8 million, on U.S. policy in the Middle East.Here’s how the ADL responded:Rep. Ellison’s remarks are both deeply disturbing and disqualifying. His words imply that U.S. foreign policy is based on religiously or national origin-based special interests rather than simply on America’s best interests. Additionally, whether intentional or not, his words raise the specter of age-old stereotypes about Jewish control of our government, a poisonous myth that may persist in parts of the world where intolerance thrives, but that has no place in open societies like the U.S. These comments sharply contrast with the Democratic National Committee platform position, which states: “A strong and secure Israel is vital to the United States because we share overarching strategic interests and the common values of democracy, equality, tolerance, and pluralism.”The group’s condemnation has emboldened people and groups wary of Ellison for entirely different reasons, like the International Association of Fire Fighters, a labor union whose membership is so conservative, it declined to endorse a candidate in the presidential election. (The union historically endorses the Democratic nominee, but this year it said its membership was too conflicted.) The IAFF, and some other unions skeptical of Ellison’s candidacy, are concerned that the congressman, who endorsed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, is too liberal to lead the party.After the clip of his 2010 remarks was released, Ellison clarified his comments in an open letter to ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt. “My advice was simply to get involved. I believe that Israel and the U.S.-Israel relationship are, and should be, key considerations in shaping U.S. policy in the Middle East,” he wrote.Josh Marshall, editor of the progressive news site Talking Points Memo, wrote in a column that Ellison’s quote made him “wince a bit.” “But the quote is also true to a significant degree,” he went on. “Do we really think US policy on Israel isn’t significantly impacted by the activism of American Jews and even more in recent years by that of Christian evangelicals? Do we also think the Cuban embargo has nothing to do with the power of the Cuban emigre community?”“I think the ADL is wrong to call the comments ‘disqualifying’ and wrong about how it’s treating this entire issue,” Marshall added. A number of prominent, liberal Jewish community figures have also come forward in support of Ellison, or to say that his comments were not anti-Israel. J Street, a progressive pro-Israel group that has positions much closer to those of most Democrats on Israel and the Middle East, offered a glowing defense of Ellison on Friday. (The group enthusiastically backed the Obama administration deal to stop Iran’s nuclear program, unlike the ADL, which opposed it.) “Attempts to paint Rep. Ellison as anti-Israel or anti-Semitic aid a concerted and transparent smear campaign driven by those whose true objections may be to the Congressman’s religion, strong support for the two-state solution and/or concern for Palestinian rights,” J Street said in a press release. The communiqué featured a photo of Ellison placing a wreath of flowers at the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem while on a J Street-sponsored visit to Israel. “These opponents seek to unearth the slightest inartful statements from decades in public life, take them out of context and use them as a weapon to silence responsible and important voices like Rep. Ellison’s.”And J Street’s statement came before the Investigative Project on Terrorism, the right-wing group that first exceprted Ellison’s comments, posted the full 22-minute audio and transcript of his remarks.At the event, Ellison spoke fondly of Israel as a friend of the United States, even as he was firm in his insistence that the U.S. should use its influence with the country to pressure it not to build settlements, including in East Jerusalem. The United States government and much of the international community does not recognize Israel’s annexation of areas of the city it captured in 1967 and has encouraged peace agreements that would allow for the creation of a Palestinian capital there alongside the Israeli one.“This effort to stop settlements throughout East Jerusalem and throughout the rest of Palestine cannot be something that only the President carries on his shoulders,” he said, referring to a 2009 temporary freeze on building in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that the Obama administration had sought to apply to East Jerusalem as well. “The American people have got to stand up and say something. And who’s going to say something if you don’t say something?”The full context of Ellison’s comments ― as well as his statements afterward ― confirm that he does, indeed, just want the Muslim Americans he is addressing to become as active in support of Palestinian rights as American Jews are of Israel. At the 2010 fundraiser, he acknowledged the high level of organization shown by the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, whose dinner he attends, implying that Muslim Americans would do well to follow their Jewish counterparts’ example of well-coordinated activism.Israel, Ellison argued, “has mobilized its Diaspora in America to do its bidding in America. The question is, with all of us here, we ought to be able to do at least as much.”"

At the 2010 fundraiser, he acknowledged the high level of organization shown by the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, whose dinner he attends, implying that Muslim Americans would do well to follow their Jewish counterparts’ example of well-coordinated activism.Israel, Ellison argued, “has mobilized its Diaspora in America to do its bidding in America. The question is, with all of us here, we ought to be able to do at least as much.”"

Several other lenders also need a cash injection to stay afloat, raising fears of a domino effect.Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, seen as a possible candidate to replace Renzi, sought to calm nervous markets on Friday, saying there was “no risk of a financial earthquake” if ‘No’ wins, though there may be “48 hours of turbulence”.A Nov. 25 Reuters poll suggested investors would expect to demand an extra 25 basis points in yield to hold Italian debt over its German equivalent if the reform is rejected, with the euro dipping 1.25 percent.The risk to stability, meanwhile, is enough to have the European Central Bank preparing to step in if needed.(Reporting by Crispian Balmer; Editing by Mark Bendeich)"

When returning to",2016-12-04,"Singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen poses during a meet-and-greet in support of his new book 'Born to Run' at BookPeople on December 1, 2016 in Austin, Texas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5845a30a120000dc00eed8eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Once again, as our nation deals with Trumpism, Bruce Springsteen's poetry and prose can bring courage. When returning to the United States in 1982, I was stunned by the way the Reagan administration had sped up deindustrialization, expanded the arms race, escalated the dirty wars in Central America, and ignored the first signs of AIDS. My best friend had just bought Springsteen's newly-released Nebraska but he had been waiting for just the right time to ceremoniously open the album and share the first-listen. Reassurance was found in his words, ""Man turns his back on his brother, he's no friend of mine."" And, yes, the ""Boss"" continued to provide the wisdom and inspiration that helped guide us through Supply Side Economics, Iran-Contra, the crack and gang years, followed by the War on Drugs and, in general, Americans retreating from the values that had made our democracy great. Years later, we were challenged and comforted by Springsteen's ""The Streets of Philadelphia,"" ""American Skin,"" ""The Rising,"" and his recent incorporation of music that drew from Pete Seeger to Irish balladeers and New Orleans jazz to help us grapple with bigotry, the Iraq War, and Hurricane Katrina. As we come to grips with the Trump election, Springsteen's autobiography, Born to Run, may contain more insight into the roots of our political crisis than anything I’ve read. Springsteen starts with the ""Pax Americana"" of the 1950s. Speaking for so many Baby Boomers, he begins his life story, ""Here we live in the shadow of the steeple, where the holy rubber meets the road, all crookedly blessed in God's mercy, in the heart-stopping, pants-dropping, race-riot-creating, oddball-hating, soul-shaking, love-and-fear-making town of Freehold, New Jersey."" Working class kids (or, at least, white youth) during ""the American Century"" were ""destined to live the decent hardworking lives of their parents ... if they could scoot through these years of wild pounding hormones without getting hurt or hurting someone else."" Bruce was acculturated into a value system where you ""remain true to your crew, your blood, your family, your turf, your greaser brothers and sisters and your country. This was the shit that would get you by when all of the rest came tumbling down."" However, Springsteen doesn't romanticize the so-called ""Greatest Generation."" Despite all of his family's and neighbors' strengths and the cross-cultural fertilization that he experienced, when his family migrated to California, his mom's first words were testimony to the segregation that also pervaded American life. She asked at the gas station, ""Where do people like us live?"" Fans who parsed Springsteen's lyrics for insights into his relationship with his father will not be disappointed. As Bruce would explain before singing ""The River,"" Douglas Springsteen had his son's hair cut while hospitalized in the wake of a motorcycle accident. A veteran of the Battle of the Bulge, his dad taunted him saying that the army will make a man out of him. When Bruce came home from a secret trip to the draft board, however, and said that he had failed his physical, his father was typically tight-lipped when revealing his true emotion, ""good.""Springsteen would then sing, ""I come from down in the valley, where mister when you're young, they raise you up to do what your daddy done."" Not surprisingly, given the number of references to radios in his lyrics, Springsteen finds multiple meanings in the ""radio days"" of his youth. The radio was more than a ""CB-cult cross-cultural outreach"" allowing hungry hearts to come together across hundreds of miles of the night sky. It was a hands-on tool for experimentation. Just as Bruce's grandfather wired and soldered electric wires and filament, and sold rebuilt radios to poor black harvest workers, his mentor, ""Tinker,"" could redesign ""anything at all, patch it up, jury-rig or jimmy it back into working order."" When ""the Apocalypse rolls back the clock to year zero, you'll want and need only Tinker at your side.""The radio stories are more than nostalgia about ""Yankee ingenuity."" They were grounds for frontier-style experimentation and the improvisation which is an essential component of the education needed for self-rule and for reinventing ourselves for the 21st century. Between the lines, Bruce is recalling the need for a post-modern means of self-expression to replace the hands-on inventiveness of the industrial era. By the time Springsteen found his ""adult voice"" in Darkness at the End of Town, he clearly was wrestling with the way that deindustrialization was undermining hope. I had not realized, however, that his previous album, Born to Run, was not about teen spirit but about the threatened spirit of our democracy in a post-frontier, pre-globalization era. Springsteen describes the reasons for both of those transitional albums: I was a child of Vietnam-era America, of the Kennedy, King, and Malcolm X assassinations. ... Dread - the sense that things might not work out, that the moral high ground had been swept out from underneath us, that the dream we had of ourselves had somehow been tainted and the future would forever be uninsured - was in the air.  With Born in the USA, Springsteen became the poet of the people at a time the extreme segregation by economics replaced de jure segregation, and became joined with de facto segregation as the original sin of our new post-industrial world. The Boss knew he was now a ""fortunate son,"" but he felt accountable to the people he'd grown up with. His discovery of Hank Williams and Woody Guthrie, combined with travels west into the new frontier where Hispanics followed in the path of the ""Okies,"" inspired a new series of masterpieces. ""The Ghost of Tom Joad"" helped crystalize the issues of the 1990s multicultural frontiers. Springsteen started with his personal need ""to know where my family, my grandparents, my mom, dad and sisters - fell in the American experience."" He told the tales of folks who felt ""weathered, wiser but not beaten."" Springsteen ""traced the stories out slowly and carefully."" He ""thought hard about who these people were and the choices they were presented with."" Even as the hope of working people declines, his lyrics insisted that they and we must shun escapism. Appropriately, the hope he sought was found in the writing of ""Across the Border."" We are now paying the price of too many people in America and other nations failing to face up to ""the weight of our unsorted baggage."" It became ""heavier ... much heavier,"" and ""with each passing year, the price of our refusal to do that sorting rises higher and higher."" As Springsteen wraps up his story, he explores his battles with depression, as well as his relationship with his father. His dad taught him the ""blue-collar narcissism of 'manhood' 1950s-style. An inner yearning for isolation, for the world on your terms or not at all. ... The distorted idea that the beautiful things in your life, the love itself you struggled to win, to create, will turn and possess you, robbing you of your imagined, long-fought-for freedoms."" But, his father was more than ""another chaos-sowing schmuck."" Bruce was determined that ""the sum of our troubles would not be the summation of our lives together."" Springsteen's genius is the way he shares these quests with his audiences. ""I work to be an ancestor,"" he affirms. He pursues a story with no end that ""is simply told to your own blood until it is passed along to be told in the blood of those you love, who inherit it."" As his story is told, it is altered, creating ""the rebirthing seed of renewal, a different destiny ..."""

If attacked by a kangaroo, authorities recommend curling up in a ball on the ground.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58443bd01700002500e7dacd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It may be one of the most bizarre battles fought in the animal kingdom. A video uploaded to Facebook on Saturday appears to show a man punching a kangaroo in its face after coming across the marsupial attacking a dog. The video, which has been viewed more than 3.6 million times as of Sunday afternoon, shows the man running up to the canine-kangaroo skirmish.“Well, we’re not sure what’s going on here but the roo has the dog, not the other way around,” a man narrating the video says.Upon seeing the man, the kangaroo pauses. The distraction allows the wriggling dog to break free, sparking a near eye-to-eye boxing match between the man and the kangaroo. The man throws a punch at the kangaroo after it gives a few intimidating hops, sending the animal recoiling backward. The kangaroo then appears to stand motionless before eventually hopping away. It’s not clear exactly when or where the video was shot. The American man who first posted it to his Facebook page told The Huffington Post that his friend in Australia had sent it to him and that the incident had occurred during a hog-hunting trip. The dog is now OK, he added. The man who apparently owns the video did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Although often portrayed as cuddly creatures, kangaroos are known to be extremely powerful and dangerous to both humans and animals.In October, a kangaroo hopped into a Melbourne family’s backyard and killed a small dog before turning on a man and leaving him badly clawed and needing medical attention, 9News reported.And in May, a kangaroo attacked two cyclists in southern Australia, leaving one woman with three cracked ribs and the other with a concussion, The Telegraph reported at the time.Anyone who has been attacked by a kangaroo should roll themselves into a ball on the ground and cover their neck, suggests Queensland’s Department of Environment and Heritage Protection.Because the animals are known to attack by kicking and scratching, the department advises finding a stick, branch or tree to use as protection.“Turning your back on it and running could be dangerous as a large male can easily outrun you and still kick at the same time,” the department says. “Turn side-on and protect the front of your body with your arms and keep your head as far away from the animal as possible to minimise the risk of being scratched on the face.”"
35,POLITICS,The Buck Stops With Trump – But Starts With All Americans Too,"Gil Troy, ContributorAmerican presidential historian, McGill professor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-buck-stops-with-trump-but-starts-with-all-americans_us_58441bc8e4b0b93e10f8e306,"Hopefully, Trump will give a Jeffersonian inaugural address, healing and inspiring the nation. But all Americans should take",2016-12-04,"<p><a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"">Donald Trump</a></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58441bfd170000eb01e7dab2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hopefully, Trump will give a Jeffersonian inaugural address, healing and inspiring the nation. But all Americans should take responsibility for realizing that fantasy.Sometimes, a little detail tells a big story. The Thompson Reuters Foundation reports that the Lower East Side’s Tenement Museum is experiencing such an “unprecedented number” of negative comments by visitors about immigrants it is retraining its docents to handle the onslaught. This report is disturbing, especially when paired with reports of a spike in hate crimes in America.It confirms fears that Donald Trump’s election has unleashed Americans’ inner demons, legitimizing once-illegitimate belches of bigotry.Obviously, one man cannot conjure up negative feelings that never existed. Moreover, as I argued last week structural and cultural forces are also at work thanks to the Internet, the media, and social breakdown. (For the record, my column was misprinted in some editions – due to an aggressive autocorrect – as “Bernies’ ‘antisemitish’ bullying” when it should have been “Berniacs’ ‘antisemitish’ bullying”). Still, leaders can shape cultural moments, and populists like Trump specialize in uncorking genies they sense are bursting to get out.The “Who Me?” bob and weave candidate Trump used when challenged about the fanatics he inspired during the campaign does not suit a president-elect. He wanted the job, now he must grow into it. The presidency comes with the White House, Air Force One, the Secret Service, a host of goodies. But it also comes with massive responsibilities he cannot shirk. Among these is the moral health of the nation. Yelling “the Left does it too” doesn’t work as president. Dodging responsibility doesn’t suit 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue’s occupant. When Theodore Roosevelt called the presidency the “bully pulpit,” he didn’t mean it was open season on weaklings; he meant the presidency was a platform for leadership. And Harry Truman turned this unspoken understanding into a cliché: “the buck stops here.”So, yes, President-elect Trump, the buck now stops with you when it comes to fighting hate on our streets, in the media, and via the Internet; the buck now stops with you when it comes to having zero tolerance for any forms of bigotry at any time; and the buck now stops with you when it comes to educating a new generation to handle politics with more grace, dignity and mutual respect than your own Baby Boomer generation has – from Right to Left.Fortunately, American history offers examples for Trump to follow during this transition. When Thomas Jefferson unseated John Adams in 1800, this first constitutional transfer of power in American history appalled the losing party. The Federalists mourned “the general ascendancy of the worthless, the dishonest, the rapacious, the vile, the merciless, and the ungodly.” They claimed the winning Republican party represented a “brutal menace” to public order. Sulking, Adams saddled the new administration with “midnight judges” (much as President Barack Obama is doing with last-minute executive orders).These lame-duck appointments ultimately triggered what became the landmark decision asserting the Supreme Court’s right of judicial review, Marbury v. Madison.One mischievous Adams partisan removed the clapper from a church bell to prevent any pro-Jefferson Inauguration Day pealing. Jefferson’s ally Albert Gallatin was shocked by the “meanness, indecency, almost insanity” of Adams’ “conduct.” The former president left town at 4 a.m., hours before Jefferson’s inauguration.Refusing to meet his predecessor’s pettiness with his own, Thomas Jefferson delivered a magnanimous inaugural address. “We have called by different names brethren of the same principle,” Jefferson declared. “We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.”Hopefully, Trump will give a Jeffersonian inaugural address, healing and inspiring the nation. But all Americans should take responsibility for realizing that fantasy.Over the past few weeks, too many American Jews, from Right to Left, have preferred advancing their particular agenda to building the bridges the nation needs now.Looking Left, I say stop sulking and start reengaging with those with whom you disagree. Stop treating Trump and his voters as “deplorables” – or worse (and stop using Nazi analogies!). Stop feeling victimized. Start acting with the maturity you demanded of Trump and his supporters back in October when you expected to win.Looking Right, I say stop gloating and start acting magnanimously.The election is over. Stop denying your candidate used ugly tactics that stirred poisonous emotions that help explain why so many feel terrified, not just bruised. And, as the winners, start reaching out, seeking common ground, perhaps, first with fellow Jews, then with fellow Americans.The psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk says “our capacity to destroy one another is matched by our capacity to heal one another. Restoring relationships and community is central to restoring well-being.” For a long time, support for Israel was a bipartisan issue, a gift enabling Democrats and Republicans to find something important on which they could agree. Rather than treating Israel as yet another wedge issue, let’s use our shared support for Israel’s right to exist in a world of hostiles as balm, as the first step reminding us, as Jefferson taught, that we may emphasize different principles, but we are indeed all brothers and sisters.We are indeed all Republicans, all Democrats – all committed to the enduring American, Western and Jewish ideals of liberty and equality, forged in the Bible, consecrated by the Constitution, and despite all our tensions, divisions and faults still flourishing in the streets of Israel, and the streets of the (still) United States of America.Read original article on The Jerusalem Post.

Roman civilisation, 2nd century AD.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5845a5f01800002d00e40f22.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With all these generals being called out of retirement to serve as Donald Trump’s “civilian” advisers, whether it’s General James “Mad Dog” Mattis as Secretary of Defense or General Mike Flynn (the real mad dog) as National Security Adviser, it’s difficult to envision the American empire being shrunk anytime soon. The U.S. military is overcommitted around the world, attenuating its strength even as the American taxpayer foots the bill to the tune of over $600 billion a year, not including nuclear weapons, veterans affairs, interest on the national debt related to war and defense spending, and so on.With its endless wars and global adventurism, the U.S. is slowly bankrupting itself, even as President-elect Trump promises higher military spending and more toughness abroad. Imperial over-commitment, for the historically-minded, recalls the fate of the Roman empire. Many moons ago, the classicist Steven Willett wrote the following words to me, words that America’s militarists and imperialists would be wise to read – and heed:My personal concern is the misallocation of our resources in futile wars and global military hegemony. We are acting under the false belief that the military can and should be used as a foreign policy tool. The end of US militarism is bankruptcy. I agree with [Andrew] Bacevich’s recommendation that the US cut military spending 6% a year for 10 years. The result would be a robust defensive military with more freed-up resources for infrastructure, education, research and alternative energy. Our so-called defense budget is a massive example of what economists call an opportunity cost.General Mattis, described as a “warrior-monk” with a reputation for a close study of military history, perhaps understands some of this. But can he rein in the American empire and decrease U.S. military spending? The prospects seem grim.Trying to be strong everywhere is a recipe for being weak when and where it counts. Under the five good emperors, Rome was able to balance imperial ambition with domestic vitality. Any chance Donald Trump is going to be a “good” emperor, a Marcus Aurelius, a man of wisdom? Early signs are unpromising.Of course, America is supposed to be a democracy. We’re supposed to look back to the Roman Republic, not its empire. We’re supposed to be committed to a limited military of citizen-soldiers who are eager to shed their armor and weapons and return to the plow, like Cincinnatus ― or George Washington. We’re not supposed to worship warriors and violence.Imperial decline and cultural decadence march together in step. Under Trump, it appears they’ll soon be marching in lockstep at double-time. Grim times, indeed."

On the website, students can “Submit a Tip” to “expose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.” As of this article, 144 professors were included on the Watchlist though that number and the names of those listed are dynamic.Since the Watchlist was made public last month, numerous news outlets have published pieces discussing the list including the New York Times,  New York Magazine, the Washington Post, Time Magazine, and  Slate, though none that we are aware of, have sought to describe the professors and universities included. Therefore, to better understand the demographics of those being reported, we performed a descriptive analysis of the publicly available data from the Watchlist website between November 25 — December 3, 2016. One hundred and fifty-five professors were identified, although some have subsequently been removed from the website. Additionally, a single professor is twice included in the analysis to account for incidents that occurred in non-consecutive years.Variables were extracted directly from the Watchlist Directory (Search by Name) on the Professor Watchlist website, as well as the sources linked to each professor’s Watchlist page. When needed, we searched the world wide web for clarity and/or confirmation of the information provided on the site. Gender and race were determined by the photographs included on the individual professor’s Watchlist page, with the understanding that not everyone views gender as a binary concept and race is not always visually representative. That being said, assumptions were made in the best interest of describing the professors being reported.Of the 156 incidents included on the Watchlist, 100 (64%) were classified as male and 108 (69%) were classified as white. The majority were Professors, 71 (46%), Associate Professors, 34 (22%) or Assistant Professors, 20 (13%) (Table 1) from 97 Universities (Figure 1), with a median of 1 individual per university and a range of 1—9. The largest number of individuals were from the University of California (9) and the University of North Carolina (7). The reported individuals taught in 59 different departments with a median of 3 individuals per department and a range of 1–15 including History (15), English (14), Political Science (12), and Communications (11) (Figure 2). Professors on the Watchlist were from 37 different states throughout the United States (Figure 3) with a median of 3 per state and a range of 1–21. California (21), Illinois (14), New York (14), North Carolina (10) and Texas (10) were the most represented states (Figure 4).The majority of professors who were submitted to the Watchlist were attached to incidents that had occurred in either the classroom setting, 60 (38%) or on a university campus, 27 (17%). Most of these incidents occurred in the years 2014 (34), 2015 (36), or 2016 (34) (Table 1).Our analysis showed that the majority of those included on the Watchlist were classified as white males. It may be somewhat counter-intuitive that white males represent the majority of reported persons until one considers the underrepresentation of women and people of color that has been reported in academia. Additionally, we found that incidents occurred by individuals housed in a wide range of university departments, with the majority occurring in the political science and liberal arts fields. Incidents represent individuals from 97 colleges and universities, which is a relatively small number given that there are over 7,000 secondary institutions in the US.Further, our results indicated that the states with the most reported incidences were California, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, and Texas, with clustering of universities in the Midwest, South and Northeast regions (Figure 3). It is unclear if this is related to the high number of students at these universities, or possibly coordinated actions of specific student groups. There are a number of limitations inherent in our analysis including the quality of the data input into the Professor Watchlist database. Upon deeper investigation, we found instances of misrepresentation, such as describing reported individuals as a professor when they may have been a guest lecturer or a graduate student. Additionally, some of the reported persons had more administrative roles and do not appear to have been teaching faculty at the time of the incident.Though we did not report on the specific incidences included on the Watchlist, a concerning component of our findings is related to the fact that most did not occur on campus and do not appear to be related to the person’s professional function. This topic is not new to people in academia as the legality of academic freedom and the First Amendment rights of faculty members in public higher education institutions has long been debated. As we move into a new political era it will be illuminating to a) track the number of submissions in the coming years, b) observe geographical hotspots, and c) track the number of incidents that occur outside of the academic setting. We call on all students and academics alike to continue to watch the Watchlist.Note: The authors published this article independently without academic, industrial, or federal affiliation."

Gender and race were determined by the photographs included on the individual professor’s Watchlist page, with the understanding that not everyone views gender as a binary concept and race is not always visually representative. That being said, assumptions were made in the best interest of describing the professors being reported.Of the 156 incidents included on the Watchlist, 100 (64%) were classified as male and 108 (69%) were classified as white. The majority were Professors, 71 (46%), Associate Professors, 34 (22%) or Assistant Professors, 20 (13%) (Table 1) from 97 Universities (Figure 1), with a median of 1 individual per university and a range of 1—9. The largest number of individuals were from the University of California (9) and the University of North Carolina (7). The reported individuals taught in 59 different departments with a median of 3 individuals per department and a range of 1–15 including History (15), English (14), Political Science (12), and Communications (11) (Figure 2). Professors on the Watchlist were from 37 different states throughout the United States (Figure 3) with a median of 3 per state and a range of 1–21. California (21), Illinois (14), New York (14), North Carolina (10) and Texas (10) were the most represented states (Figure 4).The majority of professors who were submitted to the Watchlist were attached to incidents that had occurred in either the classroom setting, 60 (38%) or on a university campus, 27 (17%). Most of these incidents occurred in the years 2014 (34), 2015 (36), or 2016 (34) (Table 1).Our analysis showed that the majority of those included on the Watchlist were classified as white males. It may be somewhat counter-intuitive that white males represent the majority of reported persons until one considers the underrepresentation of women and people of color that has been reported in academia. Additionally, we found that incidents occurred by individuals housed in a wide range of university departments, with the majority occurring in the political science and liberal arts fields. Incidents represent individuals from 97 colleges and universities, which is a relatively small number given that there are over 7,000 secondary institutions in the US.Further, our results indicated that the states with the most reported incidences were California, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, and Texas, with clustering of universities in the Midwest, South and Northeast regions (Figure 3). It is unclear if this is related to the high number of students at these universities, or possibly coordinated actions of specific student groups. There are a number of limitations inherent in our analysis including the quality of the data input into the Professor Watchlist database. Upon deeper investigation, we found instances of misrepresentation, such as describing reported individuals as a professor when they may have been a guest lecturer or a graduate student. Additionally, some of the reported persons had more administrative roles and do not appear to have been teaching faculty at the time of the incident.Though we did not report on the specific incidences included on the Watchlist, a concerning component of our findings is related to the fact that most did not occur on campus and do not appear to be related to the person’s professional function. This topic is not new to people in academia as the legality of academic freedom and the First Amendment rights of faculty members in public higher education institutions has long been debated. As we move into a new political era it will be illuminating to a) track the number of submissions in the coming years, b) observe geographical hotspots, and c) track the number of incidents that occur outside of the academic setting. We call on all students and academics alike to continue to watch the Watchlist.Note: The authors published this article independently without academic, industrial, or federal affiliation."

She goes to such extremes to avoid it, from promo materials to music videos, the mysterious musician wears a mask. In fact, until she debuted live at Chicago’s LGBTQ Market Days this summer, it was even unclear (and still remains a bit iffy!) whether the emerging pop act behind radio-friendly hit “Regular” was a solo act or group. “It’s all for good reason,” the singer promises with a giggle, “I really want to focus on the music and be free.” Though it takes tremendous effort to conceal her identity — even from those at the record label, FHB said – the fashion-oriented singer says doing so serves a bigger purpose. During a recent on-air interview with Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl, Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBT podcast, she explained why it is such a “big deal.”“By managing my identity, I'm able to get the raw reaction to the music -- and get people to appreciate the art for what it is,” FHB said. “We are very secret – for right now – but we will reveal who I am in time. I want to be free and be able to do what I want to do. Right now, this is how I’m introducing myself.”Meanwhile, rather than promotional efforts based on appearance or public image, the clandestine diva is building a following through her music. It’s “an incredible feeling,” she admits, to attract in listeners who have no real knowledge of the person behind the track.BELOW: A HuffPost Exclusive Video of FHB’s Market Days Performance for the LGBTQ Community“That's been especially so important to me, because they don't know anything about me,” she shared. “There is no pre-history of who FHB is. [Fans] can’t search anywhere online and see who the face under the mask is. They are just accepting me for me and the music; it means the world to me.”The queer community, FHB stated, has been especially welcoming. After releasing “Regular” on YouTube earlier this year, this summer she performed live for the first time at the Chicago Market Days Festival. Drawing over 180,000 people, the Midwest’s largest annual street fair benefits an assortment of LGBTQ charities.“The LGBT community was there at our very first performance, they embraced who I am and my creativity, and they have been following my journey since,” said FHB. “I don't really get a lot of questions from the LGBT community. I don't want to be labeled; I just want to be free. We connect in that way -- and through fashion.” As FHB continues to enjoy the success of “Regular,” which received both radio and club attention, promised follow-up single “BAGS” further teases a full-length album in 2017. Though presently “very urban-inspired, very rhythmic-based with a pop appeal,” she sees “no limit” to either her look or music as her artistic evolution continues. “It takes a lot of bravery to go against the grain,” said FHB about her unusual approach to the recording industry. “My hope is to inspire others who want to go against who people want them to be to come out and be themselves. I'm really just being me, and I want to inspire other people to feel they can do anything.”According to FHB, blazing an unconventional path speaks to her vision as an artist – a vision she thinks many other musicians share. “We just want to do what we love, and we love music,” she stated. “I love fashion, and creating, and I want – especially coming out – for everyone to appreciate that for what it is. “I want to strip down everything else, so it’s just about the music and the art,” FHB concluded, “Because that’s what’s most important.”Follow FHB on Twitter.Listen: FHB on “Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl” "

It was two white individuals, one boy and one girl. She was complaining to her counterpart about the shit-show of her living circumstances ― she had just moved into a new place with less than a month left in the semester, she had to pay to have all of her belongings moved, and the university had charged her for terminating her on-campus housing contract.When the boy asked why she had even gone through with the move in the first place, her response began with something along the lines of, “I just had to leave. I didn’t feel comfortable there.”My ears immediately perked up―I had a hunch concerning where she was talking about. While I told myself I shouldn’t make assumptions, her further comments proved my suspicions to be correct; she was referring to a themed residence housing that proclaims itself as a place that “celebrates the rich and diverse history of Black people”.From what she was saying, she just didn’t “fit in”, and had a hard time making friends. She also was put off by the programs they hosted; they were held “specifically for minorities”―which is “great”, she made sure to reiterate―but she felt, how can she feel comfortable attending such events that essentially outwardly excluded her? (12/04/16 Edit: The dorm actually does not bar non-minorities from attending their programs, and extent invitations for all members of the greater community to partake in their events.)Now, it’s very easy to dismiss the girl’s complaints to “white tears”―a term used to refer to undue woes expressed by whites. And I won’t defend her entirely, because to some extent, it is. I mean, poor white girl who is used to being in the majority and feeling represented and being surrounded by people who look (and think) just like herself, right? Perhaps she forgot that those very circumstances that made her feel so unwelcome are the same ones that simply make up the reality called life for over one-third of our nation’s population.But at the same time, I wanted to hear her out, and empathize with her. Because my freshman year, I lived in that same dorm, and despite being of the same skin color as many of the occupants, I too felt out of place. But even more than that, I thought it was unfortunate that she shied away from the programs, since they tend to be very raw and informative, and would probably provide her with insight concerning the struggles of being black in America.If they had not gotten off at the stop before mine, I surely would have engaged in conversation with her. Because what she was saying got me thinking―should we start making room for the privileged white groups that caused the inception of such spaces in the first place?I can imagine a response to my question that could be given: “Those spaces are not meant for her to feel comfortable. If she wants to be comfortable, she can stay in the public space that marginalized and refused to accept us. This space is our space, and if she doesn’t like it she can easily exit.”And don’t get me wrong―this is a very valid point.But to me, something about that mindset rings amiss. Never mind that we are doing the same thing to them that they did to us (I personally don’t think reciprocating negative actions is the answer to any issue―and perhaps FLOTUS Michelle Obama would agree). What needs to be considered is how such thinking can result in a stalemate for progress―because it excludes a vital counterpart needed to propelling us towards the institutional and social changes we strive for.It’s a bitter truth that we may not want to look at, but must be acknowledged: change doesn’t happen without participation of the majority group. We can have our MLK, our Rosa Parks, our Malcom X―who are all vital and necessary figures―but without our Lyndon B. Johnson (and not to forget JFK, who advocated for a civil rights bill before his assassination), we don’t get our legislative change. Similarly, we can create opportunities for those of us experiencing the same societal and structural injustices to gather and talk about it, but until we invite the group in power into our conversations to hear and understand them, we can never recruit them as allies and thus exclude ourselves from moving toward grander, wide-sweeping improvements to our condition.Further, without inviting the privileged group into our spaces, it is likely easy for them to not even be aware that there is a problem. It’s like planning an intervention, and not inviting the person with the substance habit―it doesn’t make the source of the problem acknowledge that there is indeed a problem. Yeah, they may hear that meth is bad for their health, but until being made to accept the identification as a meth addict and exposed to the implications of their habit, there are no merits for change. Similarly, while whites may hear of social inequalities, there is likely a disconnect since they feel that, a.) They feel that hey are not affected by it, so it either does not exist or is not “as big of a deal” as everyone says it is, and b.) They do not personally discriminate, so they are not part of the problem (besides, didn’t you see the safety pins on their shirts?). Including the majority group provides to opportunity to change their understanding―to let them know that racism is systematic; to tell them that they are affected by social injustices, that they just get the much longer end of the stick; and to encourage them to find ways in their own life to raise awareness in their communities and take a stand against the injustices inflicted on people solely because of the color of their skin.As Gunnar Myrdal states in his book The American Dilemma, the issues faced by the black communities in the nation are “moral issues[s] both to Negros and the whites in America”. Besides the outdated terminology, this is a concept that applies to all non-white minority groups of the United States, and needs to be emphasized more. So let’s release ourselves of all the burden, and shift some responsibility to the group historically responsible for our woes in the first place. And this, I believe, starts with opening up our spaces to them.I don’t want to underscore another aspect of the problem: how whites do tend to avoid such spaces in which they become the minority (because who wants to be that?) Because it is a problem, and probably an aspect that chased the girl I mentioned earlier away from the themed living community. But as a member of a colored minority group, I also know very well how we can be very exclusive―even amongst ourselves. That’s why I’m advocating more white inclusiveness in our spaces. Since racial injustices impact all Americans, it’s important to include whites in our spaces and our conversations. It’s only through these means that we can gain an understanding of their perspectives, as well as provide them with a nuanced insight on our condition, and recruit whites in fighting for causes towards institutional and social equality for all Americans."

He will be tried as an adult in the case, Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said at a press conference.The arrest came two days after the body of 16-year-old Lee Manuel Viloria-Paulino, who was last seen Nov. 18, was found along the Merrimack River in Lawrence, authorities said. Police told the Boston Herald that the victim’s arms had been cut off near the elbows and that his head was discovered near his body, police told the Boston Herald.The teens are believed to have been classmates, Blodgett said Saturday. However, it’s unclear whether Borges attended their high school regularly, the Eagle Tribune reported.“I will not speculate as to a motive at this time, that would be wrong,” Blodgett told reporters, according to Fox 25 News. “I will not speculate if it was gang related.”The slain teen’s family did not seem to be consoled to learn that an arrest had been made. Speaking outside their Lawrence home on Saturday, family members told the Tribune that they no longer feel safe, even though authorities have said they believe the teen’s death to be an isolated incident.“It is our family today but it could be any other,” the victim’s grandfather, Gustavo Paulino, told the publication. The teen’s official cause of death is pending the results of an autopsy, the North Andover Patch reported.Borges is scheduled to appear in court Monday. The Essex County district attorney’s office did not immediately return a request for comment. "

She declined to speculate on why inspectors did not return but said city employees are investigating further.Alameda Coroner’s Bureau captain Melanie Ditzenberger asked that families of people still unaccounted for preserve the missing person’s DNA by putting hairbrushes, combs or toothbrushes in a sealed bag in case the coroner’s office requests them.President Barack Obama issued a statement Monday morning.“Today our prayers go out to the people of Oakland, California in the aftermath of this weekend’s deadly warehouse fire ― one of the worst fires in the state’s history,” he said. “Oakland is one of the most diverse and creative cities in our country,” he continued, “and as families and residents pull together in the wake of this awful tragedy, they will have the unwavering support of the American people.”This is a developing story.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58431d961700002500e7da09.jpeg?cache=YTOGfOxCTD&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina ― Just four weeks since Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, a number of states have become increasingly more hostile to abortion rights. Texas will soon mandate the burial or cremation of aborted or miscarried fetuses, and the state’s politicians have also introduced legislation that would ban abortion after 20 weeks, even in the case of severe fetal abnormalities. An Indiana politician announced in November that he plans to propose a total abortion ban in the state next month. Pennsylvania Republicans tried to pass legislation to ban abortions after 20 weeks.A Trump/Pence administration is looking bad for women. The president-elect once said that women ought to be “punished” for having abortions, and the incoming vice president has advocated for the same fetal tissue burial or cremation procedure as the one that Texas will enact on Dec. 19. But the women and men on the ground who are protecting reproductive health care access have not been deterred ― even in the face of tremendous obstacles.On Saturday, employees and volunteers at A Preferred Women’s Health Center Charlotte demonstrated the unwavering strength of the pro-choice movement. The presence of nationally known anti-abortion protesters like the Flip Benham cohort is a common occurrence at APWHC Charlotte, as are the mobile crisis pregnancy centers that park up the road from the clinic. But on this particular day, there were also upward of 2,000 people marching and praying in front of the clinic with Love Life Charlotte, an organization made up of over 40 local churches.Still, the clinic administrators and local volunteers managed to make their patients a priority, despite being at the center of a chaotic anti-abortion protest.The prayer march ― marking the culmination of Love Life Charlotte’s 40-Week Journey of Hope prayer march events ― was expected to include 4,000 people. About half that number showed up.“We definitely have had instances of [big] protester turnout in the past, but 4,000 is definitely the largest we’ve ever heard of,” APWHC administrator Calla Hales told The Huffington Post.While she is accustomed to seeing 100 or so protesters on the street, the 2,000 who turned out on Saturday was unheard of, she said.“As much as I hate to admit it, their presence will impact patients,” Hales said. And while the event was advertised as a “peaceful” one, meaning church members were not meant to protest or speak to anyone at the clinic, it did not turn out as such.The sheer volume of marchers resulted in an overflow of participants on the street, blocking and slowing down traffic into the clinic. Some members also yelled aggressively within earshot of the center’s waiting room, and anti-abortion protesters of the Flip Benham variety ― many of whom are also members of some of the churches represented in the march ― were emboldened by the new audience, as evident from video of the event.Just up the street from the clinic entrance sat two family-size RVs ― portable crisis pregnancy centers ― offering free services like sonograms and pre- or post-abortion counseling. Erin Forsythe, the executive director of Pregnancy Resource Center of Charlotte, told HuffPost that her center’s services, including the mobile CPCs which are parked outside APWHC six days a week, are “all about acknowledging that this is about [a woman’s] choice.” PRC is its own nonprofit organization, existing separately from the churches that protest, though Forsythe did say it was a Christian organization and “appreciative of other Christian pro-life groups.”Another PRC staff member, Jill, shared the same sentiments. Jill said the group was “not here to take away a woman’s choice.”In a brief tour of the mobile center, she called it a “condemnation- and judgement-free” space. The PRC staff is remarkably friendly and the mobile clinic is clean, warm and welcoming, with a small waiting area, a restroom, and a sonogram station in the back of the trailer. Staff members follow federal HIPAA privacy standards and offer confidential services ― and all sonograms are performed by licensed professionals, she said. The PRC trailer is especially welcoming considering the shouting protesters down the road ― but volunteer clinic escorts and pro-choice protesters claim the center engages in some unethical behavior to manipulate women into declining an abortion. “Patients have been told that their pregnancy wasn’t ‘attached properly’ and that they would miscarry, so they should cancel their [abortion] appointment,” one volunteer clinic escort, who asked to remain anonymous, told HuffPost. “Another was told that her pregnancy was too far along for an abortion, and that she should cancel, too, even though it wasn’t” the person said. Some clinic escorts have also said that PRC staff members have falsely offered to check women into their APWHC appointments ― which causes the women to miss their appointments altogether and have to wait a week or so to reschedule. Forsythe told HuffPost on Monday that “each client served is given honest, accurate, and truthful information.” “In the instance of a suspected miscarriage,” she said, “a client is referred to her doctor for confirmation, diagnosis and recommended next steps.” Forsythe also said that gestation “is dated via repeated measurements per industry standards,” and that all of her staff are trained to practice honest and open methods of communication. While there is no evidence to back up claims on the specific practices at PRC Charlotte, crisis pregnancy centers overall have a well-documented history of misleading behavior.In January, a NARAL study reported that CPCs purposefully present themselves as health care providers to obtain new clients and push their own anti-abortion agenda (something that states like California are beginning to pick up on). “Their misleading practices may include questionable advertising tactics, providing dishonest or evasive answers when women call to inquire about their services or even selecting confusing locations or names that obscure their true agenda,” the NARAL report found. This includes false promises of miscarriage, lies about the abortion procedure and its effects and lies about how far along in her pregnancy a patient is. The trailers are strategically placed on the way to the clinic entrance, which clinic staff says causes immense confusion for the patients. Because of this, pro-choice protesters and volunteer clinic escorts often arrive early, around 6:45am on Saturdays, to station themselves on the street and direct drivers to the actual clinic. The physical obstacles seem to be lined up in every direction ― in addition to North Carolina’s already restrictive abortion laws.Women must receive discouraging abortion counseling and wait 72 hours after their initial consultation before they can have the procedure. If a patient is under the age of 18, a parent must consent to the abortion ― plus, there is only public funding in the case of rape or incest, and all women must have a sonogram whether they want one or not. Despite the thousands of people ― church members and nonprofits ― working against it, APWHC Charlotte has managed to maintain its quality services, with the help of members of the Charlotte community volunteering their time to support the clinic. On Saturday afternoon, there were two dozen pro-choice protesters on site, up from the usual three or four. There were also a significant number of new clinic escorts. Shelley, one of the clinic escort leaders, said that close to 20 volunteers signed up specifically to serve on Saturday. “With these large-scale events,” Hales said, “you really feel like you’re under siege. I can’t tell you the last time I actually felt safe.”Hales also acknowledged the added hostility from the anti-abortion rhetoric of the presidential election and impending Trump/Pence Administration. She told HuffPost that the clinic has seen a higher volume of protesters over the last year, and that their behavior and rhetoric has become more hostile.“I’ve even seen a man pace the sidewalk with rope while screaming about sinners hanging like strange fruit,’” she said. “A friend compared it once to constantly feeling like you’re under siege ― I’m finding that comparison to be scarily accurate.”But ultimately, pro-choice staff and volunteers held their own against the protesters.When one anti-abortion protester called clinic escorts “bullies,” they began offering hugs and showering each other with affection. When one anti-abortion man took the microphone to call members of the pro-choice movement “swine,” a chorus of car alarms went off to muffle the sound of his voice. All of the volunteers who’d parked outside the clinic had turned on their car alarms simultaneously, winking at one another. There were cupcakes and kazoos, witty posters and McMuffins, hugs and high-fives. After all, this is a fight that women are used to fighting.One protester with Pro-Choice Charlotte said that she’d been protesting since before the 1973 ruling of Roe v. Wade.“I’m 54 years old,” said another. “I’m sick of this shit.”And yet there she stood. Catherine Pearson contributed reporting.

Forsythe told HuffPost on Monday that “each client served is given honest, accurate, and truthful information.” “In the instance of a suspected miscarriage,” she said, “a client is referred to her doctor for confirmation, diagnosis and recommended next steps.” Forsythe also said that gestation “is dated via repeated measurements per industry standards,” and that all of her staff are trained to practice honest and open methods of communication. While there is no evidence to back up claims on the specific practices at PRC Charlotte, crisis pregnancy centers overall have a well-documented history of misleading behavior.In January, a NARAL study reported that CPCs purposefully present themselves as health care providers to obtain new clients and push their own anti-abortion agenda (something that states like California are beginning to pick up on). “Their misleading practices may include questionable advertising tactics, providing dishonest or evasive answers when women call to inquire about their services or even selecting confusing locations or names that obscure their true agenda,” the NARAL report found. This includes false promises of miscarriage, lies about the abortion procedure and its effects and lies about how far along in her pregnancy a patient is. The trailers are strategically placed on the way to the clinic entrance, which clinic staff says causes immense confusion for the patients. Because of this, pro-choice protesters and volunteer clinic escorts often arrive early, around 6:45am on Saturdays, to station themselves on the street and direct drivers to the actual clinic. The physical obstacles seem to be lined up in every direction ― in addition to North Carolina’s already restrictive abortion laws.Women must receive discouraging abortion counseling and wait 72 hours after their initial consultation before they can have the procedure. If a patient is under the age of 18, a parent must consent to the abortion ― plus, there is only public funding in the case of rape or incest, and all women must have a sonogram whether they want one or not. Despite the thousands of people ― church members and nonprofits ― working against it, APWHC Charlotte has managed to maintain its quality services, with the help of members of the Charlotte community volunteering their time to support the clinic. On Saturday afternoon, there were two dozen pro-choice protesters on site, up from the usual three or four. There were also a significant number of new clinic escorts. Shelley, one of the clinic escort leaders, said that close to 20 volunteers signed up specifically to serve on Saturday. “With these large-scale events,” Hales said, “you really feel like you’re under siege. I can’t tell you the last time I actually felt safe.”Hales also acknowledged the added hostility from the anti-abortion rhetoric of the presidential election and impending Trump/Pence Administration. She told HuffPost that the clinic has seen a higher volume of protesters over the last year, and that their behavior and rhetoric has become more hostile.“I’ve even seen a man pace the sidewalk with rope while screaming about sinners hanging like strange fruit,’” she said. “A friend compared it once to constantly feeling like you’re under siege ― I’m finding that comparison to be scarily accurate.”But ultimately, pro-choice staff and volunteers held their own against the protesters.When one anti-abortion protester called clinic escorts “bullies,” they began offering hugs and showering each other with affection. When one anti-abortion man took the microphone to call members of the pro-choice movement “swine,” a chorus of car alarms went off to muffle the sound of his voice. All of the volunteers who’d parked outside the clinic had turned on their car alarms simultaneously, winking at one another. There were cupcakes and kazoos, witty posters and McMuffins, hugs and high-fives. After all, this is a fight that women are used to fighting.One protester with Pro-Choice Charlotte said that she’d been protesting since before the 1973 ruling of Roe v. Wade.“I’m 54 years old,” said another. “I’m sick of this shit.”And yet there she stood. Catherine Pearson contributed reporting.

Texas will soon mandate the burial or cremation of aborted or miscarried fetuses, and the state’s politicians have also introduced legislation that would ban abortion after 20 weeks, even in the case of severe fetal abnormalities. An Indiana politician announced in November that he plans to propose a total abortion ban in the state next month. Pennsylvania Republicans tried to pass legislation to ban abortions after 20 weeks.A Trump/Pence administration is looking bad for women. The president-elect once said that women ought to be “punished” for having abortions, and the incoming vice president has advocated for the same fetal tissue burial or cremation procedure as the one that Texas will enact on Dec. 19. But the women and men on the ground who are protecting reproductive health care access have not been deterred ― even in the face of tremendous obstacles.On Saturday, employees and volunteers at A Preferred Women’s Health Center Charlotte demonstrated the unwavering strength of the pro-choice movement. The presence of nationally known anti-abortion protesters like the Flip Benham cohort is a common occurrence at APWHC Charlotte, as are the mobile crisis pregnancy centers that park up the road from the clinic. But on this particular day, there were also upward of 2,000 people marching and praying in front of the clinic with Love Life Charlotte, an organization made up of over 40 local churches.Still, the clinic administrators and local volunteers managed to make their patients a priority, despite being at the center of a chaotic anti-abortion protest.The prayer march ― marking the culmination of Love Life Charlotte’s 40-Week Journey of Hope prayer march events ― was expected to include 4,000 people. About half that number showed up.“We definitely have had instances of [big] protester turnout in the past, but 4,000 is definitely the largest we’ve ever heard of,” APWHC administrator Calla Hales told The Huffington Post.While she is accustomed to seeing 100 or so protesters on the street, the 2,000 who turned out on Saturday was unheard of, she said.“As much as I hate to admit it, their presence will impact patients,” Hales said. And while the event was advertised as a “peaceful” one, meaning church members were not meant to protest or speak to anyone at the clinic, it did not turn out as such.The sheer volume of marchers resulted in an overflow of participants on the street, blocking and slowing down traffic into the clinic. Some members also yelled aggressively within earshot of the center’s waiting room, and anti-abortion protesters of the Flip Benham variety ― many of whom are also members of some of the churches represented in the march ― were emboldened by the new audience, as evident from video of the event.Just up the street from the clinic entrance sat two family-size RVs ― portable crisis pregnancy centers ― offering free services like sonograms and pre- or post-abortion counseling. Erin Forsythe, the executive director of Pregnancy Resource Center of Charlotte, told HuffPost that her center’s services, including the mobile CPCs which are parked outside APWHC six days a week, are “all about acknowledging that this is about [a woman’s] choice.” PRC is its own nonprofit organization, existing separately from the churches that protest, though Forsythe did say it was a Christian organization and “appreciative of other Christian pro-life groups.”Another PRC staff member, Jill, shared the same sentiments. Jill said the group was “not here to take away a woman’s choice.”In a brief tour of the mobile center, she called it a “condemnation- and judgement-free” space. The PRC staff is remarkably friendly and the mobile clinic is clean, warm and welcoming, with a small waiting area, a restroom, and a sonogram station in the back of the trailer. Staff members follow federal HIPAA privacy standards and offer confidential services ― and all sonograms are performed by licensed professionals, she said. The PRC trailer is especially welcoming considering the shouting protesters down the road ― but volunteer clinic escorts and pro-choice protesters claim the center engages in some unethical behavior to manipulate women into declining an abortion. “Patients have been told that their pregnancy wasn’t ‘attached properly’ and that they would miscarry, so they should cancel their [abortion] appointment,” one volunteer clinic escort, who asked to remain anonymous, told HuffPost. “Another was told that her pregnancy was too far along for an abortion, and that she should cancel, too, even though it wasn’t” the person said.

(The entire disturbing scene is available on YouTube, but we’re not going to link to it.)Brando and Bertolucci both went on to receive nominations for the film, while Schneider, who was only 19 years old at the time she filmed the scene with a 48-year-old Brando, was traumatized by the experience.In a recently surfaced video, Bertolucci indicates the film is even more disturbing than previously thought. The director admits that he and Brando planned to film the rape scene without telling Schneider the full details of it.“The sequence of the butter is an idea that I had with Marlon in the morning before shooting it,” Bertolucci said during the 2013 interview at La Cinémathèque Française in Paris.“I’d been, in a way, horrible to Maria, because I didn’t tell her what was going on,” he said, because “I wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress.”“I wanted her to react humiliated,” Bertolucci said. “I think she hated me and also Marlon because we didn’t tell her.”The director continued that he felt “very guilty” but ultimately did not regret his decision.“To obtain something I think you have to be completely free,” he said. “I didn’t want Maria to act her humiliation, her rage, I wanted Maria to feel ... the rage and humiliation. Then she hated me for all [of her] life.”Before Schneider died in 2011, the French actress revealed that the scene made her feel “humiliated” and “a little raped.” It wasn’t in the script, she claimed, and neither Bertolucci nor Brando apologized after filming.“But during the scene, even though what Marlon was doing wasn’t real, I was crying real tears. I felt humiliated and, to be honest, I felt a little raped, both by Marlon and Bertolucci,” she said in a 2007 Daily Mail interview. “After the scene, Marlon didn’t console me or apologize. Thankfully, there was just one take.”“I was so young and relatively inexperienced and I didn’t understand all of the film’s sexual content,” she continued. “I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can’t force someone to do something that isn’t in the script, but at the time, I didn’t know that.”Watch a clip from Bertolucci’s interview below: Need help?

56,HEALTHY LIVING,How To Break A Bad Habit -- For Good,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-break-a-bad-habit_b_13232244.html,"Have you ever tried to break a bad habit, only to give up in frustration? The problem isn't that you're weak or that the bad habit is too ingrained; in all likelihood, you just gave up too soon.",2016-12-04,2016-11-25-1480102142-4997972-HowToBreakABadHabitForGoodHP,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-11-25-1480102142-4997972-HowToBreakABadHabitForGoodHP-thumb,"Have you ever tried to break a bad habit, only to give up in frustration? The problem isn't that you're weak or that the bad habit is too ingrained; in all likelihood, you just gave up too soon.Researchers at University College, London, found that it takes 66 days for a new habit to form. Likewise, as long as there is no physical addiction involved, it takes 66 days for you to shake a bad habit. But before you can develop the motivation to stick it out for that long, you need to understand how bad habits form in the first place.Bad habits are formed and reinforced via the habit loop. First, something triggers you to initiate an undesired behavior. Maybe you're feeling stressed, so you decide to numb out on Facebook for an hour or eat a whole bag of Flamin' Cheetos. The trigger event is whatever puts this idea in your head. The second step is the behavior itself. Your brain says, ""Sure, you deserve some Flamin' Cheetos,"" so you dig in.The third step -- and this part is crucial -- is the reward. The behavior has to reward you in some way. That doesn't mean it's good for you or that it's smart, just that it does something that your brain likes. Numbing out on Facebook might help you forget your problems for a while or to put off something that you don't want to do, and we all know, all too well, the reward that comes from eating a bag of junk food. For better or worse, these rewards increase the likelihood that you'll repeat the behavior.Once you repeat a behavior enough times, the habit loop becomes so automated that you don't even think about it anymore. Instead of making a conscious decision to procrastinate, you just automatically pull up Facebook as soon as you sit down at your desk or you're digging into the Cheetos before you even realize that you're feeling stressed.Once a habit becomes automatic, it's a lot harder to break--and that's why you're probably failing if you're not giving yourself 66 days to wean yourself off it.Sixty-six days might seem like a long time, but there are specific stages you have to go through that will make the process feel much shorter. Let's take a look at these.Days 1-10: Look InwardIt's usually pretty obvious which bad habits are causing the most problems in your life--the ones that keep coming up in performance appraisals or sparking arguments with your spouse. Once you've identified a habit to change, the real challenge lies in understanding your triggers, and that can be harder than it sounds, especially if the habit has become so ingrained that you do it subconsciously. If you give it enough thought, you'll get to the bottom of it. Maybe you keep getting tickets for speeding, and you realize that you drive too fast when you leave work in a bad mood, or maybe you snack when you're stressed. Looking inward to explore the source of the habit you're trying to break makes breaking that habit possible. The first 10 days of trying to break the habit will provide substantial insight into the source of the habit, should you choose to look. Building self-awareness is critical to emotional intelligence, and your act of introspection will serve you in many ways beyond breaking your bad habit.Days 11-40: Spread the WordAccountability is crucial in breaking bad habits. In this stage, you create a very vocal accountability network by telling everybody you can about the habit you're trying to break, and the more vocal you are about it, the more likely people are to call you out when you slip up. Let them know that you really want them to say something. Just remember that you might have to keep reminding them--it's just as easy for them to forget and backslide as it is for you to do so.  Days 41-66: Mind Your Relapse TriggersAs you head for the home stretch, be ready to make some mistakes -- it happens to everybody. Just be on the lookout for common threads running through those mistakes. If you tend to relapse in a certain situation, you'd be smart to avoid that trigger completely until you feel that your bad habit is really extinguished. Keeping your triggers from surprising you when it feels like you've kicked the habit is typically the difference between success and failure this late in the process.Day 67: Reward YourselfSure, you could say that breaking the habit is its own reward, but why pass up an opportunity to celebrate?

57,HEALTHY LIVING,How To Break A Bad Habit -- For Good,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-break-a-bad-habit_b_13232244.html,"Have you ever tried to break a bad habit, only to give up in frustration? The problem isn't that you're weak or that the bad habit is too ingrained; in all likelihood, you just gave up too soon.",2016-12-04,2016-11-25-1480102339-1324426-HowToBreakABadHabitForGoodHP2,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-11-25-1480102339-1324426-HowToBreakABadHabitForGoodHP2-thumb,"Have you ever tried to break a bad habit, only to give up in frustration? The problem isn't that you're weak or that the bad habit is too ingrained; in all likelihood, you just gave up too soon.Researchers at University College, London, found that it takes 66 days for a new habit to form. Likewise, as long as there is no physical addiction involved, it takes 66 days for you to shake a bad habit. But before you can develop the motivation to stick it out for that long, you need to understand how bad habits form in the first place.Bad habits are formed and reinforced via the habit loop. First, something triggers you to initiate an undesired behavior. Maybe you're feeling stressed, so you decide to numb out on Facebook for an hour or eat a whole bag of Flamin' Cheetos. The trigger event is whatever puts this idea in your head. The second step is the behavior itself. Your brain says, ""Sure, you deserve some Flamin' Cheetos,"" so you dig in.The third step -- and this part is crucial -- is the reward. The behavior has to reward you in some way. That doesn't mean it's good for you or that it's smart, just that it does something that your brain likes. Numbing out on Facebook might help you forget your problems for a while or to put off something that you don't want to do, and we all know, all too well, the reward that comes from eating a bag of junk food. For better or worse, these rewards increase the likelihood that you'll repeat the behavior.Once you repeat a behavior enough times, the habit loop becomes so automated that you don't even think about it anymore. Instead of making a conscious decision to procrastinate, you just automatically pull up Facebook as soon as you sit down at your desk or you're digging into the Cheetos before you even realize that you're feeling stressed.Once a habit becomes automatic, it's a lot harder to break--and that's why you're probably failing if you're not giving yourself 66 days to wean yourself off it.Sixty-six days might seem like a long time, but there are specific stages you have to go through that will make the process feel much shorter. Let's take a look at these.Days 1-10: Look InwardIt's usually pretty obvious which bad habits are causing the most problems in your life--the ones that keep coming up in performance appraisals or sparking arguments with your spouse. Once you've identified a habit to change, the real challenge lies in understanding your triggers, and that can be harder than it sounds, especially if the habit has become so ingrained that you do it subconsciously. If you give it enough thought, you'll get to the bottom of it. Maybe you keep getting tickets for speeding, and you realize that you drive too fast when you leave work in a bad mood, or maybe you snack when you're stressed. Looking inward to explore the source of the habit you're trying to break makes breaking that habit possible. The first 10 days of trying to break the habit will provide substantial insight into the source of the habit, should you choose to look. Building self-awareness is critical to emotional intelligence, and your act of introspection will serve you in many ways beyond breaking your bad habit.Days 11-40: Spread the WordAccountability is crucial in breaking bad habits. In this stage, you create a very vocal accountability network by telling everybody you can about the habit you're trying to break, and the more vocal you are about it, the more likely people are to call you out when you slip up. Let them know that you really want them to say something. Just remember that you might have to keep reminding them--it's just as easy for them to forget and backslide as it is for you to do so.  Days 41-66: Mind Your Relapse TriggersAs you head for the home stretch, be ready to make some mistakes -- it happens to everybody. Just be on the lookout for common threads running through those mistakes. If you tend to relapse in a certain situation, you'd be smart to avoid that trigger completely until you feel that your bad habit is really extinguished. Keeping your triggers from surprising you when it feels like you've kicked the habit is typically the difference between success and failure this late in the process.Day 67: Reward YourselfSure, you could say that breaking the habit is its own reward, but why pass up an opportunity to celebrate? Just don't celebrate by indulging in the habit you worked so hard to break! You should also use this opportunity to reflect and select the next habit you're going to break.Bringing It All TogetherYou're not weak, stupid, or lazy if you have a hard time breaking bad habits.

58,HEALTHY LIVING,PTSD: Can Genetics Affect Your Risk?,"McLean Hospital, ContributorThe #1 freestanding psychiatric hospital in the U.S., dedicate...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ptsd-how-does-genetics-af_b_13411350.html,,2016-12-04,2016-12-04-1480861107-6238065-KlengelHeadshot198Dec815.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-04-1480861107-6238065-KlengelHeadshot198Dec815-thumb.jpg,"McLean Hospital Guest Blogger Torsten Klengel, MD, PhDA majority of the US population is exposed to a psychological trauma during their life. For certain people, such as police officers, firefighters, or soldiers, the risk of experiencing trauma is even greater. However, only a fraction of those who experience such events will develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other trauma-related psychiatric disorders.The diagnostic criteria for PTSD, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, define a qualifying trauma as exposure to ""actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation."" Exposure may include directly experiencing the trauma, witnessing the trauma in person, learning about a traumatic event happening to a loved one, or ""first-hand repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details"" of a traumatic event.Yet, if two individuals were to experience the exact same trauma, one might develop PTSD while the other remains unaffected by long-term psychiatric symptoms. Why might they experience these different outcomes?Aside from trauma, a critical factor in developing PTSD is genetics. We're already confident that genetic variations play an instrumental role in determining individual risk. However, we still need to pinpoint which genes are involved, how they may interact to affect risk, and what are the exact molecular mechanisms behind this. Similarly, we also need to isolate genetic factors that may be responsible for increasing one's resilience to trauma--which is why some individuals do not develop PTSD or other disorders despite considerable exposure to trauma.The gene known as FKBP5 is probably the best example we have thus far of a gene that interacts with the environment to promote the development of PTSD. We've learned a lot about this gene, including how it reacts when exposed to childhood trauma to increase the risk of developing depression or PTSD.FKBP5 is essentially a regulator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, our central stress response system, which is responsible for the release of cortisol, colloquially known as ""the stress hormone."" Our biological response to stress is to release cortisol--in concert with several other factors--to prepare us to cope with stressful situations. However, a dysfunction in this process, resulting in an excessive or insufficient activation of this system, is likely to predispose one to developing PTSD, depression, and other psychiatric disorders.We need to activate the release of cortisol when we are stressed, and shut it down once the threat is over. This enables us to calm down. Conversely, what we see in some patients with trauma-related disorders is that their cortisol release is stronger than normal, and they also have difficulty turning it off--keeping these patients in an unhealthy state of constant and heightened awareness, of always being ""on guard.""FKBP5 is only one gene in a complex system of genetic and environmental factors influencing disease risk. We believe that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other genes are involved. For example, it's more likely that changes within many genes, combined with how these genes interact with one another and the environment, are collectively responsible for an increased risk of developing PTSD.A central biological concept that can explain how genes interact with environmental factors such as trauma on the molecular level is environmental epigenetics, the idea that we are not simply a product of our genes but also our experience. Our DNA sequence, inherited by our parents, is certainly important, but epigenetics--how this sequence is impacted by external factors such as the environment and how it is used--is just as important.As we learn more about the epigenetics of PTSD, we can then focus on prevention and treatment strategies. Recruitment for the military, police, and other professions where psychological trauma is a potential hazard of duty already includes psychological screening. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that genetic and epigenetic risk analysis could soon become part of the recruitment equation to protect vulnerable individuals from future exposure or provide those individuals with adequate immediate help in the case of a traumatic event.Understanding risk also has implications for early intervention. We know when PTSD starts--immediately after trauma--which gives us the opportunity to predict its development before symptoms evolve. Developing such predictive models can help us to identify who would benefit most from immediate care following trauma and which type of care would be best.We now have the necessary tools to develop these predictive models and improve the treatment of PTSD, which offers great hope for patients. However, we still have much more to learn.- - -Torsten Klengel, MD, PhD, is an assistant neuroscientist at McLean Hospital in the Neurobiology of Fear Laboratory led by Kerry J.

59,POLITICS,Obama Administration Tries To Smooth Path Back To School For Jailed Students,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/juvenile-justice-education-obama_us_5841ec23e4b0c68e0480d622,"“It comes down to what the president has said many times before: Simply, some people make mistakes.”",2016-12-03,"Secretary of Education John King, left, and former Education Secretary Arne Duncan are both working on ways to help students transition back to school.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5841fb8d1200002a00eed446.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you’re young and caught up in the justice system, most likely you’re stuck with subpar educational opportunities too.Students in prison, jail, detention centers or correctional facilities often receive fewer days of instruction than their peers, less access to math and science classes, and more teacher absenteeism, according to federal data released Friday. In one of the last moves of the Obama administration’s Department of Education, it drew attention to these disparities with the new data about youth in the justice system, as well as two new guides and resources to help these students return to traditional schools. One resource is a packet called “You Got This” for young detainees with tips and suggestions about going back to school. The other is a “Transition Toolkit 3.0” for educators, community stakeholders and family members. And a new website for educators is specifically designed to help youth with disabilities who are in the correctional system. The idea behind these resources, according to the Education Department, is to help reduce recidivism by ensuring a successful transition back to school. As noted in the Education Department data, students in the juvenile justice system are disproportionately black and male, a pattern closely linked to the school-to-prison pipeline, in which overly harsh discipline practices help push students out of school and into the juvenile justice system. Students of color are disproportionately subjected to these practices. More than 50,000 people younger than 21 are confined in juvenile justice facilities, according to the Education Department. It has been a priority of President Barack Obama to try and make sure these youths, despite their mistakes, get a fair shot at life, said senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett on a call with reporters.“It comes down to what the president has said many times before: Simply, some people make mistakes,” said Jarrett. This has also been a crucial issue for former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who stepped down at the end of 2015. Since then, as a managing partner with the philanthropy Emerson Collective, he has been working with young men who are out of school and jobless to try to provide job training and employment opportunities. Duncan joined the call with reporters. “The work I’m doing now, I’m working with young men, 17 to 24, who frankly every system has failed, and the cost to society of that failure is pretty extraordinary,” said Duncan. “And as we try and get them back on track and move them from a life on the street to a life of being productive citizens, educational opportunities are a huge, huge piece of this.” When asked if the next administration will continue to emphasize this issue, current Education Secretary John King said, “I can’t speculate on the priorities of the next administration and wouldn’t want to.” Instead the White House has been trying to provide “good information” to the incoming administration about their policy efforts and initiatives. “My hope would be that any administration at the federal level and any state would be focused on the students who aren’t making it through to high school graduation,” said King. “We know how dim the life prospects are for students who don’t have even a high school diploma, and one of the ways to tackle that challenge is to make sure we have a smooth transition for young people back from juvenile justice into education.” "

They lost the presidential election, failed to take back the Senate and barely made a dent in their minority status in the House. Now what are they supposed to do?Fresh on the heels of being re-elected House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi’s strategy for preventing Republicans from erasing President Barack Obama’s accomplishments over the next two to four years ― at a time when her party has next to no leverage ― is coming into focus. It looks a lot like 2006.“When people told us it was time for a permanent Republican majority … around now, in 2004 as we got ready for 2005, we had our plan,” she told The Huffington Post in a Monday interview. “We stuck together. We were unified, strategic, and really it was a beautiful sight to behold.”“And we won.”She’s referring to the Democratic wave that came in 2006, when her party reclaimed the House and the Senate. That was the year then-President George W. Bush conceded his party “took a thumping,” and when Pelosi was vaulted into the job of House speaker. Two years later, Obama became president, elevating Democrats to the same position of power Republicans are in now. There were different circumstances then. Bush was an unpopular president and so was his war in Iraq ― two issues Democrats could seize on in making the case to Americans for their proposals. There also wasn’t a wildcard like Donald Trump in the picture, preparing to move into the White House after a campaign fueled by hateful rhetoric and with an agenda that nobody really knows.The political landscape has changed since then, too, and in a devastating way for Democrats. Since Obama became president, the party has lost more than 900 state legislature seats, 12 governorships, 69 House seats and 13 Senate seats. Some Democrats are clamoring for an internal shakeup, and that includes replacing people like Pelosi. More than 60 members of her caucus voted against her as leader this week, the most opposition she’s ever faced.But Pelosi still pulled off a decisive win, and she’s convinced the most effective way to counter the GOP of 2017 is to repeat the effort she led in 2006. It relies on Democrats presenting a united front, hammering in the message that they are fighting for working families ― something Pelosi sees as the core of the party, even if they failed to communicate it widely enough in 2016 ― and differentiating themselves from the kinds of GOP policies that benefit the rich and powerful.“Running against Washington is tried and true,” she said. “It isn’t easy. You have to have a plan and you have to be unified and you have to be strategic. And we’re prepared to do that.”Republicans miscalculated in 2004 when, emboldened by their control of Congress and the White House, they tried to privatize Social Security. Bush barnstormed around the country selling the idea to the public. But within months, fractures were forming in the GOP coalition as Democrats held firm in their opposition. Pelosi and other Democrats worked with advocacy groups to help stop the effort, including the powerful AARP. By the time the Senate held a test vote in March 2005, five Republican senators had pulled out, fearful they would be cast as trying to dismantle a popular program like Social Security.It was a disaster for Bush and the GOP. Yet it’s the kind of effort some top Republicans are eager to try again. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has long wanted to privatize Medicare, the popular health insurance program for tens of millions of seniors. And Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), who Trump just tapped as his Health and Human Services secretary, is a huge advocate of overhauling Medicare and Medicaid and repealing the Affordable Care Act.It’s unclear whether Trump will embrace Ryan’s vision of entitlement reform; he’s suggested budget and tax reform can be done without touching Medicare or Social Security benefits. Some Senate Republicans don’t seem to want to go anywhere near the subject for now. But if Trump signs on with Ryan’s plan, Pelosi sees a huge opportunity for Democrats to side with public outcry and fire up supporters already outraged that Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. “We have a sense of urgency that is much greater than 2004,” she said. “We don’t have to drum anything up. ... I think the Republican leadership will find people are interested in what the Republican president has to say and what the opposition has to say more than what the Republicans in Congress have to say. So our voice is much more enhanced than theirs.”Throughout the interview, Pelosi exuded the kind of hope and optimism one would expect in a party leader girding for a fight. But even so, there were moments when the woman known for her focus and strategic approach to Washington politics showed flashes of pain at Clinton’s loss. Talking about what her Christmas cards would say this year, she choked up.“May we have hope that has faith in America ― no, we have spirits that have faith in America, hope for our future ― I can’t say it. I just can’t say it. I’m just really sorry,” Pelosi said.“It is, for those of us who care, who dedicate our lives to making the future better, and to see something happen with such ― elections are elections. Some people win, some people lose. That’s just the way it is. We accept the results of it,” she continued, visibly upset. “But to see something so drastic as this, and for Hillary not to win when we had such expectation … I’m still not, kind of, to the next step of, ‘OK, let’s just move on.’”Asked if it was particularly disappointing seeing Clinton lose as someone who has broken barriers for women in politics, Pelosi listed off the things Democrats could have passed if Clinton had won and Democrats retook the Senate: the Equality Act, a bill banning LGBTQ discrimination in employment and housing, an infrastructure investment bill, immigration reform and gun safety bills.“I just don’t like missed opportunities,” she finally said. “I just thought that was such a missed opportunity for our country.”And just like that, she was back in strategist mode.“Having said that, we don’t agonize, we organize. We get moving to make sure the public knows what’s at stake in the policy decisions and then go to the next step, which is hopefully try to do some things together,” Pelosi said. “I mean, who knows. Do you know how [Trump] is going to be?”"

62,POLITICS,Here's One Progressive Cause That Might Not Wither In The Trump Era,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heres-one-progressive-cause-that-might-not-wither-in-the-trump-era_us_5841b484e4b09e21702e506e,There’s still hope and momentum behind paid parental and sick leave.,2016-12-03,"Since 2006, paid sick leave laws have passed in 40 jurisdictions, as this chart from the advocacy group Family Values@Work reveals.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5841b9841200002b00eed328.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and the sudden real possibility of a registry for Muslims scares Jacob Feinspan. He’s executive director of Jews United for Justice, a local advocacy group. Jewish people have seen this before, he said at an event here earlier this week. He didn’t need to explain further. Yet for all the uncertainty and fear Trump is bringing to town, Feinspan was feeling kind of upbeat. With pushing from his group, part of the DC Paid Family Leave Coalition, the District is poised to pass one of the most generous paid leave laws in the country. The measure would give desperately needed paid time off to new parents and those who need to care for sick relatives ― and it stands to benefit the city’s lowest-income workers more than any other group. “It feels like everything is at risk and the sky is falling,” Feinspan said at an event where advocates for paid parental and sick leave gathered. “But we have huge opportunities to do something game changing.”At a time when so many progressive causes ― climate change, LGBTQ rights, civil rights, abortion rights ― seem at risk, paid parental leave and its sibling benefit, the even more popular paid sick leave, are turning out to be somewhat bright spots in the new Trump era. In 2016 alone, 14 states, cities and counties passed paid sick leave laws that allow workers to take time off when they’re ill and still get paid. Many of those laws include paid time off for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault to access services related to their abuse, a benefit dubbed “paid safe leave.”Also this year, New York state passed a generous measure that gives 12 weeks off, partially paid, to new parents or workers who need to care for ill family members. And San Francisco passed the first fully paid parental leave measure in the country. The U.S. is the only advanced economy that doesn’t guarantee any paid sick or maternity leave to workers. That’s been devastating. While about 60 percent of workers in the private sector get paid sick leave, only 39 percent at the bottom quarter of the income scale have access to leave, according to data from the Labor Department.The numbers on paid parental leave are worse. Just 12 percent of private sector workers get paid parental leave. The U.S. does have a law, the Family Medical Leave Act, that guarantees 12 unpaid weeks off to new parents. But because it’s limited to larger companies it leaves out 40 percent of the workforce.One-quarter of mothers are back to work less than two weeks after having a baby, according to one study. At a time when 40 percent of families rely on a female breadwinner and in many more households both parents work, the lack of a policy has terrible economic consequences for families and children.And while a growing number of companies now realize paid leave is good policy ― many increased the amount offered to employees over the past few years ― these companies typically employ well-paid white collar workers.That’s where the leave laws come in. Typically funded by a small payroll tax, paid leave laws spread the cost of leave out and let more diverse workers reap the benefits.These local laws are huge wins for working people ― and they’re far more popular than, say, this year’s crop of presidential candidates.In Arizona on Election Day, a paid sick leave and minimum wage increase ballot measure got 165,000 more votes than Donald Trump and a quarter-million more votes than Hillary Clinton. (The state went for Trump.) National polls show that an overwhelming majority of Americans support paid leave. Even conservative intellectuals, who have long argued against paid leave for various reasons ― it’s bad for business, people shouldn’t have kids if they can’t afford it, and so on ― are coming around. Donald Trump, with prodding from his daughter Ivanka, floated a maternity leave proposal during the runup to the election. A sure sign of the issue’s growing popularity. Unfortunately, Trump’s idea falls far short of acceptable, offering just six weeks paid time off and only providing it to married women who give birth. Trump’s proposal offers “too little to too few people and pits people against each other,” Ellen Bravo said. Bravo is the director of Family Values @ Work, a nonprofit coalition of groups pushing for paid parental and sick leave in the U.S., which hosted the event this week.Giving leave only to women puts them at a clear disadvantage in the workplace where an employer might go with a male candidate knowing he wouldn’t get any paid time off. It also entirely leaves out gay dads. Advocates also don’t like Trump’s idea to fund maternity leave by using money set aside for unemployment insurance.“Babies don’t just have mothers and biological parents, and it’s not just newborns that need care,” Bravo said. “We are concerned about an approach that would leave out so many; and also the particulars of his proposal would shift money others need for unemployment. That money is already too scarce.”Bravo and other family leave supporters here made clear that they’d fight against Trump’s proposal as it currently stands.The D.C. measure is far more palatable, offering 11 weeks paid time off to new parents (regardless of gender, including adoptive parents) and providing workers with eight weeks off to look after sick family members. It’s funded through a payroll tax paid solely by employers, and it’s most generous to those making the least money. Those earning up to $45,000 a year get 90 percent of their pay. Above that, employees get 50 percent replacement up to a maximum of $1,000 a week.The city council is set for a preliminary vote on Tuesday and a final vote is scheduled for just before Christmas. The measure is expected to ultimately pass.New York’s similarly generous law goes into effect in 2018. California and New Jersey have laws that provide six weeks off and are funded through payroll taxes paid by workers and employers. These states offer lower pay reimbursement than the D.C. proposal.More states and cities are looking to pass measures, too.It’s important to note that a lot of the momentum on leave came from the Obama administration. The Department of Labor funded small grants to states so they could study paid leave, for example. That’s all going away. Still, the public demand for change isn’t.“Our work continues,” Bravo said."

Taiwan was not mentioned in that call, according to an official Chinese transcript.China’s Taiwan Affairs Office also called the conversation a “petty” move by Taiwan that does not change the island’s status as part of China. Beijing is resolute in opposing independence for Taiwan, it added.Trump said on Twitter that Tsai had initiated the call he had with the Taiwan president. “The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!” he said.Alex Huang, a spokesman for Tsai, said: “Of course both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact.”WAYWARD PROVINCETrump and Tsai noted that “close economic, political and security ties exist between Taiwan and the United States”, the Trump transition team said in a statement. Taiwan’s presidential office said the two discussed strengthening bilateral interactions and establishing closer cooperation.China considers Taiwan a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. Relations between the two sides have worsened since Tsai, who heads the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, was elected president in January.Chinese state media downplayed the possibility of a major blow-up in Beijing’s relations with Washington as Trump prepares to assume office.Influential state-run tabloid the Global Times said in an online editorial that if Trump really overturned the “one China” principle upon assuming office it would create such a crisis with China he’d have little time to do anything else.“We believe this is not something the shrewd Trump wants to do.”China’s official Xinhua news agency said Trump needed to know Beijing can be a “cooperative partner” as long as Washington respects China’s core interests, including the issue of Taiwan.“China and the United States are not destined rivals,” it said in an English-language commentary.Washington remains Taiwan’s most important political ally and sole arms supplier, despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, the irony of which was not lost on Trump.“Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,” Trump said in another tweet.Trump has eschewed tradition in other calls with foreign leaders since he won the U.S. election, prompting the White House to encourage him to make use of the diplomatic expertise and counsel of the State Department.Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said on CNN that Trump was “well aware of what U.S. policy has been” on Taiwan.Administration officials said Trump’s team did not alert the White House about the call ahead of time. The White House also said after Trump’s call that “longstanding policy” on China and Taiwan had not changed.Advisers to the Republican president-elect have indicated that he is likely to take a more robust policy toward China than Obama, a Democrat, and that Trump plans to boost the U.S. military in part in response to China’s increasing power in Asia. However, details of his plans remain scant.Trump lambasted China throughout the U.S. election campaign, drumming up headlines with pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and label the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office.Earlier this week, Trump spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and praised him, according to the Pakistani leader’s office, as a “terrific guy”.Islamabad and Washington have seen relations sour in recent years over U.S. accusations that Pakistan shelters Islamist militants who kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, a charge denied by the South Asian nation.Trump also invited Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte to the White House next year during what a Duterte aide said was a “very engaging, animated” phone conversation. Duterte has openly insulted Obama, who canceled a planned meeting with him in September.A statement issued by Trump’s transition team made no mention of the invitation.(Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici, David Alexander, Yara Bayoumy, John Walcott, Arshad Mohammed, Eric Beech, Jeff Mason and JR Wu; Writing by Jeff Mason and Raju Gopalakrishnan; Editing by Nick Macfie)"

He and Vice President-elect, Mike Pence, who is also governor of Indiana until inauguration, negotiated a deal with Carrier this week that included $7 million in tax breaks to keep in state 800 of the 2,100 jobs Carrier’s parent company was planning to offshore.Trump did not include representatives of the local chapter of the United Steelworkers, the union representing the workers at both the Carrier and Rexnord plants, in the talks with the company over the factory jobs. Chuck Jones, head of the Steelworkers local, told The Huffington Post’s Arthur Delaney that if Trump had consulted him, he would have asked for the president-elect’s help saving the jobs at Rexnord as well.In a Wednesday letter to Trump praising the Carrier deal, Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) asked the president-elect for help saving jobs slated to be offshored at the Rexnord factory, as well as a CTS Corporation facility in Elkhart.In light of his Friday tweet, Trump seems to have gotten the message about Rexnord.The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether the president-elect would broker a deal with the ball-bearings maker similar to the agreement he struck with Carrier.Trump made Carrier the poster child for his campaign promises to stop the offshoring of manufacturing jobs after a video of a Carrier executive informing distraught factory workers that the company was moving their jobs to Monterrey, Mexico went viral in February.But the Rexnord factory, whose closing the company announced in June, has its own viral video. In October, Rexnord worker Draper Alumbaugh unloaded on his employer’s “greed” in an interview with Indiana news station RTV6. “It’s pretty simple what these corporate people want,” Alumbaugh said. “They want to pay people nothing and they want to profit everything.”Alumbaugh told HuffPost at the time that he was “probably” going to vote for Trump, since the then-Republican nominee was “trying to save my job.”"

In addition, Trump threatened to impose a stiff tariff on Carrier products if they sent all of the work across the border.“Republicans oppose this, remember?” Palin wrote in an op-ed Friday on the Young Conservatives website. “Instead, we support competition on a level playing field, remember? Because we know special interest crony capitalism is one big fail.“A business must have freedom to locate where it wishes,” the piece continued. “In a free market, if a business makes a mistake (including a marketing mistake that perhaps Carrier executives made), threatening to move elsewhere claiming efficiency’s sake, then the market’s invisible hand punishes. Thankfully, that same hand rewards, based on good business decisions.”She warned that “picking and choosing” which company darlings receive “corporate welfare” is a “hallmark of corruption” and “socialism.”A “$20 trillion debt-ridden country can’t afford this sinfully stupid practice, so vigilantly guard against its continuance, or we’re doomed,” she urged.Palin left wiggle room in the piece for Trump to redeem himself. “Gotta have faith that the Trump team knows all of this,” she wrote hopefully, and promised to be the first to dismiss concerns if details of the deal prove her wrong once they’re publicly released.In a bit of cognitive dissonance, Palin also said she was “ecstatic” for Carrier workers. “What a relief for hundreds of workers. Merry Christmas Indiana!” she gushed.Palin is hardly the only “free market” Republican disturbed by the deal. The Wall Street Journal issued its own op-ed Thursday called “Trump’s Carrier Shakedown” noting that real job security depends on a company’s strength in the marketplace.“If the extra costs of staying in Indianapolis erode that business, those workers will lose their jobs eventually in any case,” the Journal warned, adding: “Workers don’t prosper when politicians force companies to make noneconomic decisions.”Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has also attacked Trump’s deal, saying it signals to corporations that they can get significant tax breaks as long as they threaten to export jobs.Despite the deal, Carrier is still shifting some production to Mexico, and at least 600 Carrier positions will be cut. Carrier’s parent company, United Technologies, will also move ahead with closing a separate Indiana plant and laying off 700 workers.The union at the Carrier factory was cut out of negotiations to save their jobs, Chuck Jones, president of the local chapter of the United Steelworkers union that represents the plant, told The Huffington Post.There was no immediate reaction from Trump on the criticisms from Palin or the Journal.He has touted the deal and this week did a victory tour of the Indianapolis factory."

I’m not much of a TV watcher, but I do love the news. NBC Nightly News was my drug of choice. As the dramatic music played in the introduction, Lester Holt’s authoritative voice told me what I needed to know for the day.But, I soon found myself in a news bubble. My opinions of the world were vastly different than my conservative family. My online go-to sources weren’t much help either: The Huffington Post, New York Times, the Atlantic. Clearly, my family and I weren’t seeing things the same way.After the election, like most liberals, I was devastated by the results. Like most liberals, this wasn’t about Republicans vs. Democrats, this was about stopping a mentally ill man from becoming our nation’s president. I couldn’t, for the life of me, figure out how a reasonable person could vote someone like this into the highest office of the land. My family is reasonable. Smart in fact. What was I missing?It turns out we all share the same five core values, according to social psychologist, Jonathan Haidt: caring, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity. But the emphasis we place on these values is different. Liberals value caring and fairness over the other moral foundations, while conservatives value sanctity first, and authority second.Additionally, new research suggests that the brain structures of liberals and conservatives are also different. Liberals have an area of the brain, called the anterior cingulate gyrus, which takes in new information, as well as the impact of that information on decision-making and choices. Conservatives have an area in the brain, the right amygdala, which processes more emotional information, which tends to be fear-based. In other words, while liberals tend to follow the science and welcome new information about where society should go, conservatives tend to react to more “what if” scenarios, avoiding risks. (Think allowing refugees to enter the country).So I decided to find out what my conservative family was hearing, and see how I would feel if I was in their place. Stories about “crooked Hillary,” Benghazi, and Clinton’s email scandal were the talk of conservatives prior to the election. Conspiracy theories ran wild. Misinformation and fake news abounded. How could they so easily accept this information without verifying if it was true?We all believe we are right and we look for information that confirms it. Verifying the source, or even if the information is true, is irrelevant as long as it supports our point of view. Harvard Professor, David Ropeik said, “…we cling to our views because the walls of our opinions are like battlements that keep the good guys inside (us) safe from the enemy without (all those dopes with different opinions than ours). Quite literally, our views and opinions may help protect us, keep us safe, literally help us survive.”Fox News, Brietbart, and other conservative news organizations tell stories the way conservatives want to hear them. Democrats, Muslims, Liberals, and particularly President Obama, are enemies to their way of life. Headlines like the one on Fox News Saturday, December 3, 2016, “Democrats slams Trump’s deal that saved jobs in Indiana” confirm to conservatives that liberals are out to get them. Coincidentally, Sarah Palin also slammed Trump’s deal, calling it “crony capitalism.”I started watching Fox News and other conservative news outlets to learn how to bridge the gap between my conservative friends and family. I want to know what these news organizations are saying, and how they are saying it. I’m not looking for a fight, but as a way to share their concerns. If I felt my way of life was under attack, as many of us did with the pronouncement of Trump’s and Pence’s election to the White House, I would feel angry, resentful and frightened. And I do.It’s easy for us to see people with opposing points of view as less than human. I was appalled to hear Trump supporters were attacked before and after the election. It is the antithesis of the message of social acceptance from the progressive left. But it shows the extent to which people, all people, will go when they feel threatened.I no longer allow a single news outlet to form my opinions. If I find a topic of interest, I search other sources to find out if it is reported there. If so, in what ways is it being reported? I’m solely responsible for the take away of news information and how I choose to use it. True to my, perhaps overly idealistic progressive views, I want to know how to help move society into a more cohesive direction, and pay attention to the values we all share."

One striking example of the country’s unique health footprint: For a nation with only 11 million people, Cuba sent an unparalleled number of medical personnel to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2014.When Ebola spread through West Africa in 2014, Cuba announced that it would send more than 460 doctors and nurses to West Africa. The epidemic ultimately killed 11,310 people, more than any previous outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ultimately Cuba deployed approximately 265 medical personnel to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, according to the World Health Organization.For comparison’s sake, in November 2014, President Obama promised just 65 health professionals, supported by 4,000 U.S. troops. (WHO said it’s difficult to track actual personnel deployed from the U.S. because they weren’t a unified group like the Cubans were. Americans may have volunteered with nongovernmental organizations, for example.)“[Cuba] has become something like the world’s first responder to international crises in recent years,” Jon Lee Anderson wrote in The New Yorker in 2014. Indeed, Cuba’s 50,000 roving medical professionals stationed in more than 60 countries are often the first foreign health workers at catastrophes around the world. Cuban doctors, for example cared for almost 40 percent of victims during Haiti’s devastating 2010 earthquake, according to The Guardian. The deployments are the result of a longtime Cuban program to send health care workers abroad as a way to boost its image and to trade services for goods for the embargoed island.The Cuban medical response is built on a larger culture of population health. Cuban doctors practice prevention-oriented primary care and are responsible for improving the overall health of their patient populations. Cuba also has one of the best doctor-to-population ratios in the world, meaning the country spends far less money per person on health care costs than does the United States, but it boasts a better child mortality rate and similar life expectancy. According to the World Bank, in 2010 Cuba had 6.7 doctors per 1,000 people, compared with the United States’ 2.5 doctors per 1,000 people.“Unlike students trained in the U.S. or Western Europe, Cuban students are trained to improve population health status,” Dr. C. William Keck, professor emeritus at Northeast Ohio Medical University, previously told The Huffington Post. “We certainly aren’t here. When I went to medical school, I was taught to do battle with disease one patient at a time. You dealt with what came in the door. You didn’t focus much on the community. It’s a much different approach,” said Keck, who is a member of the Medical Education Cooperation with Cuba, a nonprofit that promotes U.S.-Cuba health collaborations.That dedication to community health extends beyond Cuba’s borders. “We know what can happen. We know we’re going to a hostile environment,” Cuban doctor Leonardo Fernandez told Reuters before he left to fight Ebola in West Africa in 2014.“But it is our duty. That’s how we’ve been educated. This little bit that we have, when people need it, we are capable of sharing. It’s a basic concept.”"

Originally known as the Department of War, it was renamed Department of Defense in 1949. But war is precisely what Mattis, known as “Mad Dog,” has enthusiastically done throughout his career.In 2005, Mattis declared, “It’s fun to shoot some people.” That was one year after he oversaw the Battle of Fallujah in Iraq, which began in April 2004, after four Blackwater Security Consulting mercenaries were killed and their bodies mutilated. In retaliation, U.S. forces attacked the city and killed 736 people. At least 60 percent of them were women and children, according to independent journalist Dahr Jamail, who interviewed doctors at Fallujah General Hospital and at other small clinics inside the city both during and after the April siege.In November 2004 NBC News correspondent Kevin Sites, embedded with the U.S. Marines, heard Staff Sgt. Sam Mortimer radio that “everything to the west is weapons free.” Weapons Free, explained Sites, “means the Marines can shoot whatever they see ― it’s all considered hostile.” The rules of engagement come from the top, and Mattis was in charge.Collective punishment against an occupied population constitutes a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Yet, according to the Study Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, the US attack on Fallujah in November 2004 killed between 4,000 and 6,000 civilians. Targeting civilians is a war crime.Mattis’ enthusiasm for battle may lead us into a war with Iran. A vigorous critic of the nuclear deal with Iran, Mattis said in an April 2016 speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies that the Iranian regime is “the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East.” He added, however, “there’s no going back” on the deal and it would be an issue for the next president.CIA Director John Brennan recently warned of the dangers of canceling the Iran deal, saying it would be “disastrous” and “the height of folly.” In a BBC interview, Brennan explained that dismantling the deal would set off an arms race in the Middle East and embolden the hard-liners in the Iranian government.To his credit, Mattis has been clear-eyed about blowback from U.S. policy on Israel. He noted the United States is paying a “security price” in the Middle East because the U.S. is considered biased in favor of Israel, and Israel is in danger of becoming an “apartheid” state.“I paid a military security price every day as a commander of CENTCOM because the Americans were seen as biased in support of Israel,” Mattis said at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado in 2013, adding that this perception undercuts support from “all the moderate Arabs who want to be with us, because they can’t come out publicly in support of people who don’t show respect for the Arab Palestinians.”Mattis criticized Israel for building settlements in the occupied West Bank, saying they “are going to make it impossible to maintain the two-state option.” He added that the settlements might weaken Israel as a Jewish and Democratic state and could lead to apartheid.“If I’m in Jerusalem and I put 500 Jewish settlers out here to the east and there’s 10,000 Arab settlers in here, if we draw the border to include them, either it ceases to be a Jewish state or you say the Arabs don’t get to vote ― apartheid,” Mattis said.Also to his credit, Mattis opposes torture ― because it doesn’t work. During the presidential campaign, Trump pledged to reinstitute waterboarding, saying he would “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding” because suspected terrorists “deserve it anyway, for what they’re doing.”Waterboarding has long been considered torture, which is a war crime. Indeed, after World War II, the United States tried, convicted and hanged Japanese military leaders for waterboarding.Trump may have changed his mind about torture after conferring with Mattis. Trump told The New York Times that when he asked Mattis what the general thought of waterboarding, Mattis replied, “I’ve never found it to be useful. I’ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.” Trump said he was “very impressed by that answer. I was surprised, because [Mattis is] known as being like the toughest guy.”Indeed, former high-level FBI interrogators, including Ali Soufan and Dan Coleman, maintain that a person being tortured will say anything to get the torture to stop ― even providing false information. The best results, interrogators add, are obtained with humane methods.Moreover, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded, “the use of the CIA’s enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of obtaining accurate information or gaining detainee cooperation.”“If there’s any concern at all [about Mattis], it’s the principle of civilian control over the military. This role was never intended to be a kind of Joint Chiefs of Staff on steroids, and that’s the biggest single risk tied to Mattis,” a former senior Pentagon official told The Washington Post. The framers of the Constitution were wary of putting the military in charge of making foreign policy, which explicitly resides in the executive branch; that is, the president as commander-in-chief and his secretary of defense.Trump has also chosen notorious hawks Michael Flynn for National Security Advisor and Mike Pompeo for CIA Director.But the president-elect has stated, “We will use military force only in cases of vital necessity to the national security of the United States. We will put an end to attempts of imposing democracy and overthrowing regimes abroad, as well as involving ourselves in situations in which we have no right to intervene.”Let’s hope Trump can maintain that position in the face of inevitable militaristic advice from Mattis, Flynn and Pompeo. Trump frequently makes contradictory statements about foreign policy. During the campaign, he insisted that he opposed the Iraq War and Libya regime change, when in fact he supported both. In fact, Trump called for all US troops in the Middle East to overthrow Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi.It is our challenge to hold Trump’s feet to the fire in every way we can ― speaking out, writing, demonstrating, and pressuring Congress and the White House.

71,POLITICS,Bill Nye Has A Message For Whoever Leads Trump's Interior Department,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-nye-national-parks_us_5841e9f7e4b017f37fe4a1b7,The science guy wants to keep drilling and mining out of the national parks.,2016-12-03,"Yosemite Falls, a mainstay of Yosemite National Park.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5841eab11200002b00eed400.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― President-elect Donald Trump has yet to name his pick to lead the Department of the Interior, the agency that oversees the National Park System. But Bill Nye, the science guy, wants whomever Trump chooses to keep oil, gas and mining companies from drilling in any more of the 83 million acres of land set aside for the nature preserves. Oil and gas companies operate in about a dozen sites in national parks. “When you go extracting coal, oil and minerals from national parks, you just degrade them,” Nye told The Huffington Post during an event in Manhattan on Tuesday for the nonpartisan National Parks Foundation, which was celebrating the park system’s centennial. “That’s why they’re national parks ― they’re set aside.” The possibilities for interior secretary thus far don’t inspire a lot of confidence. Among the names that have emerged are oil executive Forrest Lucas, oil and natural gas magnate Harold Hamm and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R), whose calls to extract fossil fuels from protected lands popularized the phrase “drill, baby, drill.” The next interior secretary could reopen Arctic waters or the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling ― something environmental groups prevented President George W. Bush from doing in 2001. Nye, who has become a high-profile advocate against the climate science denialism that grips the Republican Party, said Trump’s proposed $1 trillion infrastructure plan should include support for renewable energy projects. “If you want to invest in infrastructure, if you want energy independence, [which] I think we all do, renewable energy sources ― wind, solar, a little bit of geothermal and a little bit of tidal energy ― is how the United States could be the world leader,” Nye said. “Exporting these ideas, and not being dependent on oil and other fossil fuels from other nations.”Trump, who has called climate change “a hoax” and “a bunch of bunk,” has staked out dubious positions on renewable energy. He has railed against solar for being too costly and decried wind turbines for killing “too many eagles.” Last month, he even renewed his long-simmering fight against an offshore wind farm in Scotland, where he owns a luxury golf resort.“What a legacy it would be for any administration to promote renewable energy and get away from extractive energies,” Nye said. “What a fantastic legacy that would be.” The Republican Party platform called for turning over some public lands to states. However, Trump told Field & Stream magazine in January that he wants “to keep the lands great,” suggesting he may not be committed to that particular plank.“If you interview anybody, any citizen in the U.S., they want Yellowstone National Park to always be there,” Nye said. “Everybody does.” One possible way to achieve that is to earmark some infrastructure spending to help the parks dig out of their $12 billion maintenance backlog. But that could be a tough sell. The cost of fixing all the roads, bridges, public transit, railroads, energy systems, schools ports, airports, dams and other facilities could climb to $3.6 trillion, according to new estimates from the American Society of Civil Engineers ― nearly four times the amount Trump has already proposed. As an alternative, Nye suggested taking the money being spent to keep U.S. troops protecting overseas oil fields, and using it instead to rebuild the parks. “If we did not have to have an army or military on the other side of the world preserving our extractive industries and fossil fuel burning, that would free up billions of U.S. dollars for other purposes,” Nye said. “The national parks could certainly be first in line if you went that route.”This article has been updated about current mining operations that are already conducted inside national parks."

Kelly declined to give her last name, and answered questions about the Papini case when HuffPost requested to speak to a communications officer.However, Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko later disputed that characterization of the case, telling The Record Searchlight on Friday evening that, “Since speaking to Papini, based on information we’ve received, we believe her. We believe that this was an abduction.”A request to Bosenko for clarification on the discrepancy was not immediately returned.Police said Papini, a 34-year-old mother of two, was “heavily battered” and “bound with restraints” when she was found near I-5, just north of Woodland, on Nov. 24. The spot was about 150 miles from Papini’s small community near Redding, where she disappeared Nov. 2 while running.Papini was treated for her injuries at a hospital, where she was reunited with her husband, Keith Papini.“My first sight was my wife in a hospital bed, her face covered in bruises ranging from yellow to black because of repeated beatings, the bridge of her nose broken,” Keith Papini said in a statement to ABC’s “Good Morning America” Tuesday. “Her now emaciated body of 87 pounds was covered in multicolored bruises, severe burns, red rashes and chain markings. Her signature long blond hair had been chopped off. She has been branded, and I could feel the rise of her scabs under my fingers.”During a Wednesday press conference, Bosenko said he was unaware Keith Papini was going to release a statement.“I do think … some of the details that he has provided could affect the integrity of the investigation,” Bosenko said, without elaborating.According to the sheriff, Papini said her abductors were two armed Hispanic women in a dark sport utility vehicle. Papini described one of the suspects as having a thick accent, pierced ears and thin eyebrows. The other suspect, she told police, was older, with thick eyebrows and straight black hair. Authorities have yet to release a composite sketch of the suspects.“We do not have any further description on the SUV or with the Hispanic females ― that is information we got directly from Ms. Papini,” Bosenko said. “These Hispanic females are armed, considered dangerous and they have a handgun.”Sherri Papini’s husband reported her missing on the evening of Nov. 2, when he returned to their Mountain Gate home from work and discovered she had not picked up their children from day care. He used the “Find my iPhone” app to track his wife’s cellphone to an area near Sunrise Drive and Old Oregon Trail, where he found the device with earbuds with strands of hair attached to them.In a Wednesday interview with NBC’s “Today” show, Bosenko said it appeared Papini’s cellphone and earbuds had been “neatly placed.”“They had been set in some grass with the screen facing up, and then the earbuds to the phone were loosely coiled and appeared to be placed on the screen,” he said. “It did somewhat appear to be that it was placed there purposely.”At Wednesday’s press conference, Bosenko addressed speculation that a 2003 blog post attributed to Papini’s maiden name of Graeff and posted to the now-defunct website “SKINHEADZ” could be connected to her alleged abduction.“We are familiar with that blog ... we do not know if it has any relevance to this case or not,” he said.The blog post reportedly detailed racial abuse the author claimed to suffer at the hands of Latinos.“Being white is more than just being aware of my skin, but of standing behind Skinheads ― who are always around, in spirit, as well ― and having pride for my country,” the post read.Keith Papini appeared to indirectly address the posting in his statement to “Good Morning America.”“I understand people want … proof that this was not some sort of hoax, plan to gain money or some fabricated race war,” he said. “I do not see a purpose in addressing each preposterous lie.”Sherri Papini’s ex-husband David Dreyfus, who divorced Papini in 2007, told The Daily Mail that Sherri is not the author of the post.“That post isn’t true,” he said. “It was a prank by someone at high school. She never found out who did it. Sherri isn’t racist.”Keith Papini’s statement to “Good Morning America” touched upon the increasing scrutiny surrounding his wife’s abduction.“Rumors, assumptions, lies and hate have been both exhausting and disgusting,” Keith Papini said. “Those people should be ashamed of their malicious, subhuman behavior.”Speaking with San Francisco’s KRON-TV on Thursday, Cody Salfen, a private investigator hired by Keith Papini after his wife’s disappearance, acknowledged female criminal duos are not common in abductions and said the circumstances of Sherri Papini’s release are unusual.“The fact that she was recovered alive such a long period of time after her initial disappearance, that really defies my experience with abduction cases,” Salfen said.Despite the peculiarity of the case, Salfen told KRON-TV it is clear to him that this is “a legitimate case of abduction and the other scenarios that people have talked about are improbable.”The sheriff’s office on Friday said they were unable to provide additional details about the investigation to HuffPost. “There isn’t anything as of yet to report,” the spokeswoman said.It also remains unclear what will happen to the nearly $50,000 the Papini family raised to cover search expenses. However, some new details might come out Friday, when Keith Papini’s first on-camera interview since his wife’s return airs on ABC’s “20/20.” Papini, according to a press release issued by the network, will describe the search for his wife and what it was like for him to reunite with her.

74,THE WORLDPOST,The Border Between Bangladesh And India Has Become A Death Trap,"Rokeya Lita, Contributorwriter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-border-between-bangladesh-and-india-has-become_us_5842ade4e4b04587de5dea38,"India is not only a neighboring country of Bangladesh, but also the people of both countries are connected like a baby connected",2016-12-03,"<p>A 15 years old Bangladeshi girl was shot and killed by India’s Border Security Force (BSF) on 7th January 2011, at India-Bangladesh border. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5842b77b1200001200eed4da.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"India is not only a neighboring country of Bangladesh, but also the people of both countries are connected like a baby connected to its mother with an umbilical cord. There are many Indians whose relatives or ancestors’ lands are in Bangladesh. At the same time, many Bangladeshis have relatives in India. Besides, the border between Bangladesh and India is so critical that the civilians cannot abide by the border laws properly. For example, out of two brothers, one brother’s residence is inside the Bangladesh border, another brother’s residence is inside the Indian border and the distance between two brothers’ residences is so small that they can meet each other just crossing the border line. There are many residents and their relatives residing in this way surrounding the Indo-Bangla border. They are very close relatives, and it is very difficult to apply for a visa each time they feel to see their closest ones.This situation was kind of obvious, and was foreseen by the people of the two countries, after the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, when Bangladesh was part of Pakistan. Even after the partition the culture and language between Bangladesh and one part of India remained the same. The people of West Bengal, a state of India, still call their currency as Taka which is the name of Bangladeshi currency. Nevertheless, India is as like as other foreign countries to Bangladesh. Bangladeshis require visas to visit India and vice-versa.There are no visa requirements for the people of the countries of European Union. People of these countries can visit the countries of European Union without any visa. There is nothing like EU between Bangladesh and India. It means there is no way to cross the border between Bangladesh and India without visa. However, the border is being crossed regularly by local people for trade and commerce. It is also being crossed by relatives and friends separated by a line arbitrarily drawn by the British during the partition in 1947. In these cases, if anyone crosses the border illegally, the person must be stopped.Now, let’s come to the point. Does anybody consider preventing illegal cross-border activities and killing people the same? I believe everyone would say NO. Unfortunately, the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) has killed a record number of Bangladeshis in the name of preventing illegal cross-border activities. The Home Minister of Bangladesh Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal told the parliament on 7th June 2016, “A total of 591 Bangladeshi citizens were killed by Indian Border Security Force and Indian citizens in last 10 years”.A question may arise, are the Bangladeshis only crossing the border illegally? The answer is NO. According to a Bangla daily newspaper in Bangladesh, between 1st august 2015 and 31st March 2016, 24 citizens of Bangladesh have been killed in India-Bangladesh border. Most of them were killed by the Indian Border Security Force. At the same time, 122 Indian civilians illegally entered to Bangladesh across the border. Among them, 73 persons were handed over to BSF in healthy condition. The Bangladesh police arrested 49 people, with specific charges. Imagine, if Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) soldiers were as much trigger-happy as BSF, then how many dead bodies of Indian civilians would have been found! This is not like Border Guard Bangladesh is afraid of Indian Border Security Force. Border Guard Bangladesh showed their strength and defeated the BSF in two different unrest places named Padua and Rowmari across the border in 2001. However, in terms of intruders and guarding the border, the Border Guard Bangladesh always remained cool headed. I feel honored to say that there is no such allegation against Bangladesh Border Guard of killing unarmed civilians in the border.To prevent the infiltrators while guarding the border does not empower anyone to kill them. Undoubtedly, these kinds of murders are barbaric murders. The BSF can choose the alternative options that can prevent intruders, but they choose to kill people. This is why the BSF is called as Trigger-happy by different human rights groups. Even the India-based rights groups are also criticizing the trigger-happy nature of BSF. On the other hand, those Bangladeshis who are killed in the Indo-Bangla border are mostly accused as cattle smugglers. Interestingly, the cattle come from different states of India. So, why the BSF cannot stop transporting cattle in the border area? They should be aware of the cattle smuggling route in the first place when they head towards the border.There were several meetings between BGB and BSF. Every time they promise not to kill Bangladeshi nationals in border, nevertheless Border Killing has not stopped yet! According to a Bangladesh based human rights organization Ain o Shalish Kendro, a total number of 46 people were killed by Indian security force BSF in 2015 and a total number of 28 people were killed by BSF this year from January to October. This is not a situation of war, the way people are being killed each year, I do not know if there are any such killings in any other border in the world!We know India is many times bigger than Bangladesh. Therefore, to guard such a bigger border, India needs many people. India has disputes with their other neighboring countries such as Pakistan and China. If they cannot maintain a good relationship with such a small country like Bangladesh, then which country they will stand by? India must understand, a friend can be changed, but a neighbor cannot be changed. They need to maintain a good relation for their own need. At the same time, Bangladesh is very grateful to India for their greatest contribution in the liberation war of Bangladesh. However, it does not mean that India has earned the right to kill Bangladeshis in the border without any trial!We assume, the BSF is instructed to kill Bangladeshis in the border from their decision making authority, otherwise how they are continuing to kill Bangladeshis in the border! Or, may be the Indian security forces do not have proper training how to protect border and arrest intruders without killing anyone. If they need training, they can ask for training. May be the international border guard forces along with Bangladesh can help them get proper training to guard their border. Anyhow, stop border killings!"
75,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Education Secretary Pick Wants To Make Christianity A Bigger Part Of Schooling,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/betsy-devos-religion-in-schools_us_583f04d1e4b04fcaa4d61c88,Religion plays a major role in the way Betsy DeVos thinks about education.,2016-12-03,"President-elect Donald Trump stands with Betsy DeVos after a meeting in Bedminster Township, New Jersey, on Nov. 19.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583f288f1800007b14310a71.jpeg?cache=dCd6eCBXA5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, spoke at a 2001 conference with her husband, Dick, about using educational philanthropy to promote their conservative Christian worldview to children.The conference was hosted by The Gathering, a group of elite Christian philanthropists. Researcher Bruce Wilson, co-founder of the website Talk To Action, unearthed the audio after going through archives on The Gathering’s website. The recordings have since become unavailable, but a cached version of the website lists the DeVoses as “general session speakers” at the conference, which carried a $1,200 per person registration fee.This week, The Huffington Post had contacted spokespeople for DeVos, the Trump transition team and The Gathering to confirm that it was the president-elect’s education secretary pick speaking on the audio. No one responded. However, a summer 2001 newsletter that The Gathering published, and which Wilson obtained, also confirms that they were set to speak at the group’s upcoming conference.During the question-and-answer portion of the recording, Dick DeVos can be heard lamenting that the “church, which ought to be, in our view, far more central to the life of the community, has been displaced by the public school as the center for activity,” Politico also reported on Friday.He goes on to say that he hopes churches get more involved in education, whether through school voucher programs or other mechanisms. Churches, schools and families should become more tightly built around a “consistent worldview,” he adds. During the panel, Betsy DeVos insists she and Dick aren’t enemies of traditional public schools, but are rather “for good education and for every child having an opportunity for a good education.” Yet the comments she and her husband appear to have made at the event suggest this could come at the price of blurring the separation of church and state.Hear comments from the full panel here. While public schools are allowed to teach about religion, Heather Weaver, senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, says they are not allowed to “proselytize, promote or disparage religion. They cannot teach it as truth.”“Schools cannot impose a religion or religious beliefs on students in any way,” Weaver explained. “Certainly, school officials and others might be motivated by their religious values and beliefs to teach, but when they cross the line from using those as a source of their purpose to actually imposing faith on students, that becomes a huge problem.”Like other Trump Cabinet nominees, Betsy DeVos is incredibly wealthy, as is her husband. Dick is heir to the marketing company Amway, and Betsy’s brother, Erik Prince, founded the private security company Blackwater. The couple have long been major players in the Christian philanthropy world.At one point in the 2001 recording, Betsy remarks: “Having grown up in families that are in the business world, we both believe that competition and choices make everyone better. Ultimately, if the system that prevailed in the United States today had more competition, if there were other choices for people to make freely, all of the schools would become better as a result.”Dick DeVos also once served on the Michigan state board of education, and he and Betsy are deeply involved in education giving and advocacy, working for decades to promote school voucher programs and expanded school choice options. School voucher programs use taxpayer money to send kids to private schools, which are often religious. During the 2001 panel, Dick explained why he and his wife chose education as one of their major causes, even though it is a controversial, high-visibility issue ― something he learned during his unsuccessful run for governor of Michigan in 2006, when he came under fire after saying schools should have the option of teaching intelligent design.“The Lord did lead us there, quietly by the heart,” he said, adding that he and Betsy hope “someday, for all parents to be able to educate their children in a school that reflects their worldview and not each day sending their child to a school that may be reflecting a worldview quite antithetical ― which, unfortunately, is the case in some places ― to the worldview that they hold in their family.” Voucher programs have come under fire from groups like the ACLU, which says they infringe on religious freedom by using public money for private, religious schools. However, advocates for school choice programs like the DeVoses say they provide low-income families with the better options that more affluent families can typically afford.In 2000, the couple helped put an initiative on the Michigan ballot to push school vouchers in the state, but the effort failed. While speaking to members of The Gathering, Betsy DeVos said that their goal is to ensure that every child has the opportunity to attend the school that meets their individual and unique needs, no matter their socioeconomic background. In 2014, Mother Jones called the DeVos clan the “new Kochs” because of their massive donations to conservative causes.Asked at the 2001 panel why they didn’t use their money to build Christian schools directly, Betsy described their recent trip to Israel, where they learned about how the ancient Israelites shared their culture with other groups. Through doing that, the Israelites had a larger impact on the area than they would have otherwise, she said. The couple has decided “to impact our culture in ways that are not the traditional funding-the-Christian-organization route, but that really may have greater Kingdom gain in the long run by changing the way we approach things, in this case the system of education in the country.”――Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

Kardashian has yet to make a public appearance since the incident, which reportedly took a serious toll on West’s mental health. “He’s been shaken up ever since the robbery in Paris. It did a number on him as much as Kim,” a source told Us Weekly. “The mere thought that anything could happen to her sent him in a tailspin.”West has often mentioned experiences with depression and anxiety in his music, giving his fans a window into some of the demons he’s been battling for years.

Yes, according to the various articles that tumble into my social media feeds every morning, The Daily Show, Last Week Tonight, Full Frontal, and both Seth Meyers’ and Stephen Colbert’s respective late-night gigs are veritable killing fields for right-wing hypocrisy ― to such a degree, in fact, that, going by the news from Facebook, I find it difficult to believe there still is an American Right, or that Donald Trump’s official presidential portrait will be anything more than a photo of some dental records.Perhaps this is a cheap point to belabor: that internet headlines are maybe a wee bit excitable when it comes to talking about anything politically confrontational. That our praise for any given John Oliver segment or our anticipation of its ultimate social effect can get a bit hyperactive is an issue even Oliver himself has addressed. It’s an issue that is brought up time and time again in discussions about the sort of political and rhetorical bubbles the way in which we consume media facilitate.So, to call attention to it once more might seem hackneyed. Perhaps it is. But as I scrolled through Facebook and Twitter over the past couple days, my mind couldn’t help but drift to this tried and true criticism of online news. Because, in case you hadn’t heard, there’s been yet another evisceration. They’re saying it’s a big one, too. Just this Wednesday, see, The Daily Show host Trevor Noah is rumored to, not only, have slaughtered 24-year-old Tomi Lahren ― host of The Blaze’s Tomi and racist prodigy; it also seems as though he may have committed an act of journalistic bravery that is wholly unprecedented (for someone who’s not white and named Jon Stewart, at least), and rescued American political discourse from the brink of destruction.It’s all self-congratulatory bullshit, of course ― a toxic and dangerous rewriting of reality. I might even go so far as to say that my experience since Wednesday sums up nearly everything that’s wrong with how the white liberal establishment has dealt with the fallout from this presidential election.Now, I don’t have too many issues with Noah’s Daily Show interview, or with Noah, himself. What’s rankled me so intensely over the past few days has very little do with the actual conversation between Noah and Lahren, which exists in both 14- and 26-minute versions for those who have not yet encountered it. It’s a perfectly serviceable (above average, even) piece of content for The Daily Show. It might even, as many have been saying, signal an evolution for Noah as a commentator of American politics.No, what bothers me is how worshipful of this 26 minutes of footage many online have managed to be. What bothers me is how deeply ignorant of its content many of those who have distributed it and sang its praises seem to be. What bothers me is how fantastically many young white liberals have missed the point.When you scroll through the majority of hot takes regarding this Thunderdome of preaching-to-the-choir, you see two main genres of analysis. The first is predominantly interested in Trevor Noah, and his evolution as a late night host. These articles discuss the comedian’s unwillingness to let Lahren’s bullshit go unquestioned; they cite specific jokes; they revel in the frustrating inability to not kow tow to Jon Stewart’s Daily Show legacy (remember Jim Kramer? Remember Crossfire? Remember ‘Papa Bear’?!). The second is more interested in that favorite fetish of white liberalism: discourse. These articles go out of their way to talk about how brave and how important it is that Trevor Noah faced off against Tomi Lahren, and rebelled against his program’s privileged position in the “echo chamber” pantheon (as though Tomi fans are desperately clamoring to watch the video). These articles point to the YouTube link embedded in their header, and say, “Do you not see the power of debate and discussion? Do you not see how important it is for us to talk to one another?”And, honestly, I really don’t. In fact, I would go so far as to say that, if you watched Trevor Noah’s conversation with Tomi Lahren and came away renewed in your conviction that people like Lahren deserve our breath and our ear, your headphones must have popped out in the first fifteen seconds. If anything, The Daily Show’s Lahren interview was proof positive that it’s time that white people with the privilege of engaging in conversations with the conservative right that don’t involve the questioning of their very worth pipe down about how important discourse is. It was pretty ironclad evidence that not every argument deserves the time it takes to cut it down.I have watched that full interview. I have watched it multiple times. And if you can direct me to the timestamp on the video where the discourse starts, I would be deeply grateful. Because, I can’t find it. Trust me, I’ve looked. What I have been able to find is a whole lot of a white supremacist questioning a black man’s worth with phony statistics and virulently racist misdirection, while he tries to prove to her that she doesn’t get to ignore systemic violence against people of color.In what world is that a debate? In what ways are these two positions equally valid?This is, perhaps, the fundamental blind spot of white liberalism: the inability to understand that debating racism is not a political or academic pursuit for people of color. It’s a matter of life and death. As a white man, I have the luxury of sitting across from an individual who thinks that police should have the right to murder innocent black men, and, while I may be fundamentally revolted by these views, I never have to contend with the thought that this person not only thinks my opinions are less right―they think my life is less valuable.That’s a fucking privilege if ever there was one.We white Americans are insulated from certain ugly realities of racial violence, even if we think we intellectually understand them perfectly. We can see police violence as a moral and political threat, without having to contend with it as a physical threat. We can see openly racist criticisms of the BLM movement as ugly and ignorant, but we’ve never had to hear the implication of each such criticism―that our suffering is not a worthy concern, that it’s our own fault.So, when we fetishize “discourse,” we are fetishizing a fiction. Because the issues that most need to be fixed do not revolve around questions that have multiple valid answers, like whether or not we should consider bailing out a corporation. The issues that a Trump presidency will most aggressively bring to the fore are questions about equality of life and experience, about which Americans matter, and whether there are Americans who matter less.These are not questions the answers to which are up for debate. There are opinions on these issues that we should fight with everything we have against normalizing, against making space for, as though they are the stuff of mere intellectual disagreement. Discourse is powerful because it validates. White supremacy should not be validated. And there is no excuse for, in blind worship of the open flow of ugly ideas, demanding that the most vulnerable of Americans be the ones who have to validate these things, that people of color make space to let white nationalists in outdated Forever 21 attire tell them that their lives are unimportant.If your takeaway from this presidential campaign and its wellspring of bigotry is that discourse is a viable answer, you must have been living a different 2016.This is a campaign during which a former Speaker of the House defended a fraudulent statistic under the pretense that, when it comes to numbers, feelings and facts are equally valid.This is a campaign that brought to power a president-elect who has recently spouted blatant lies about voter fraud, which one of his surrogates defended by saying, “There’s no such thing...as facts.”This is also a campaign defined by a media that claimed that fact-checking was an act of bias, and that refused to question gleeful falsehoods or barely concealed racism, because commitment to objective truth sometimes involves ignoring what’s true.All of this was on display in Trevor Noah’s interview with Lahren, and I’m not alone in saying so. In many ways, Noah’s sparring partner was a perfect miniature of the movement she represents. She liberally invented statistics to support her bigotry. She openly mocked victims of violence, and ignored Noah’s attempts to force her to face up to these problems, however dogged he was. Tomi Lahren outright compared Black Lives Matter to the Ku Klux Klan. She painted a picture of black men as a threat to law enforcement. She demanded that Trevor Noah not just contend with her falsehoods, but defend his value as a human being, defend his right (and the right of all people of color) to life and dignity.And I doubt Noah’s valiant willingness to engage her in the ugly mire of white supremacy with facts and humor and openness did a thing to change her mind.This is what “discourse” entails: not an intellectual duel about political theory, but a chance for white supremacists to enact open rhetorical violence and encourage blatant actual violence in the name of giving everybody a chance to speak. That so many were able to ignore this reality in the wake of the Noah/Lahren “debate” is shocking, if not horrifying. That so many have consistently been willing to―as they claim allyship―trade the physical and emotional safety of threatened Americans for some intellectual high ground is disgusting. Because that’s what this amounts to, when the dust begins to settle: the childish fantasy that bigotry can be talked away, the strange delusion that racism is a rational and reasoned position that might yield to the right kind of logic, the fetid lie that the illusion of civility among the racial majority is worth preserving at the expense of the security of everyone else.Perhaps, given the right circumstances, it’s a good thing that this clip is being so widely circulated. Free from the self-serving liberal commentary about how when we sit down over coffee with a white supremacist everything turns out alright, The Daily Show’s latest is a jarring demonstration of what we are demanding of people of color when we push the “discourse” fantasy, when we pretend that treating racism like a valid position is a model for democracy, when we would rather throw our fellow Americans to the sharks then rock the boat.And if you’re unsure whether that’s the trade-off, please re-watch that interview, and then re-read the excuses being made left and right to normalize and sanitize the hideousness of what Lahren is given the opportunity to say. Watch how eager white liberals are to equate Lahren’s facsimile of professionalism with legitimacy for her beliefs.Because, apparently, as long as white supremacists dress nice and go light on the slurs, we should give them the time of day. We should invite them in. We should act as though lack of outright violence is somehow the same thing as benevolence. We should continue the great white project of confusing decorum with decency.In an example of herculean erasure, David Sims of The Atlantic wrote of Noah’s Lahren interview: “In the wake of the 2016 election even a bare minimum of respectful discourse stands out.”Mr. Sims and others like him might have to excuse my unadorned rebuttal, but: oh, go right to Hell."

Listening to this wonderful recording brought back many memories of this great violinist and her astonishing career, which in turn inspired me to tell a story. (photo by Simon Fowler)  In 1967 an extraordinary political event occurred. The Leventritt International Violin Competition in the US announced after the final round that they were awarding two first prizes--to Pinchas Zukerman, who everyone expected to win outright, and a young unknown 19-year-old girl from South Korea, Kyung-wha Chung, a Juilliard student studying with Ivan Galamian. The judges had, in fact, decided that this young unknown was the only winner and it took the intervention of Zukerman's mentor and champion, the violinist Isaac Stern, to argue for the compromise that was eventually announced. Kyung-wha's historic win, the first ever for a non-western musician, launched a legendary career. It also laid the foundation and inspiration for the astonishing talent from this part of Asia, including Kyung-wha's brother, the conductor Myung-whun Chung, and her sister the cellist, Myung-wha Chung. Then in 1970, another major event occurred that was perhaps even more significant. The young violinist stood in for an indisposed Itzhak Perlman at the Royal Festival Hall in London with the LSO and Andre Previn, playing the Tchaikovsky Concerto. This came at such short notice that there was no rehearsal time with the orchestra so Kyung-wha just got up there and played as if her life depended upon it. My wife, Virginia, was at the concert and she still talks about it as one of the most exciting performances of the Tchaikovsky she has ever heard. The critics that night were certainly in agreement and Heifetz and Oistrakh, the then accepted gods of the violin, were invoked with very favorable comparisons, and the evening was seen as the beginning of a major career in Europe. It was also the start of a new relationship for Kyung-wha, and the LSO and Previn who took the young violinist to their hearts. Plans were quickly made to record the Tchaikovsky paired with the Sibelius Concerto. The latter was a work the violinist knew but had not performed for a long time and in flying back to London from Seoul for the recording she had to beg the use of an office at her layover airport, just to get in as much practice of the work as possible. If you listen to these two recordings today they remain as fresh, musical and extraordinary as the amazing events surrounding her of 1970.I heard her play live for the first time in Cardiff in 1971 with the virtuoso showpiece Lalo's Symphonie Espagnole. I was totally smitten. This was a truly great violinist but also much more than that, a communicator, whose physicality when playing was unprecedented in my experience. She played with unbridled passion, making every note, every phrase something special, imbued with a type of energy and commitment that I had seldom heard. I have listened to her many times since in most of the great concertos and in one or two recitals including one devoted to the works of Kreisler celebrating his centennial in 1974. I remember the Elgar Concerto in Liverpool where she played this most demanding of concertos for the first time, exploring its vast emotional range in a reading full of musical eloquence. (You can hear this in her recording for DECCA.) Having conquered the heights of this massive work she left the stage to huge applause and was then heard to give a vast scream in the wings, not from frustration or anger, but just to release the tension of making it through this marathon work. This seemed to make the evening even more personal and special. Then there was the Brahms Concerto, which I heard her play many times and each time it grew in intensity. A friend of mine commented after one performance that she played from the depths of the soles of her feet connected to the inner earth, and I have always found this a very accurate description of her music making. It's the duende that the Spanish apply to the most special artists. In September 10, 2001, I heard her in the Sibelius Concerto with the Oregon Symphony in Portland, which I was then running. She played with the same passionate commitment you find in her recording from 1970. The next morning, September 11, I had to call her at her hotel with the news of the attack on the Twin Towers. It was early and she didn't know about the tragic events and pain and anxiety were suddenly there in her voice. But that night she played the concerto again with the orchestra for a bereft public contending with its own grief and needing music more than ever before. She gave the performance everything and then wanted to know if she could do more to help.In 2005, she suffered an injury to her hand and announced that she would be retiring from the concert platform. Even though she had recorded extensively including all the major concertos, losing her live presence on the concert stage was the saddest deprivation.

These works represent something so special in the life of a performer. Perhaps they are the zenith of any career but without doubt to record them is something of a unique challenge and privilege.

In May 2015 at New England Conservatory of Music in Boston I had the great pleasure of awarding Kyung-wha an Honorary Degree for her services to music, an award that she received with charm and humility. But it was the response from the Korean students in seeing her at NEC and having her on the stage of Jordan Hall, that was truly remarkable. She was greeted as their hero, their inspiration, a legend, a shining example of violinistic talent, and most notably the first from their country to conquer the world and find a place on the international stage. Many of these Korean students have talked with me about the gender and racial prejudices that they still encounter in the music world. Their stories fill me full of disappointment at the behavior of others. I do not know if Kyung-wha experienced this as well when she forged her early career, but as the first, she remains the inspiration for this new younger generation of wonderfully gifted artists who have hopes similar to hers in 1967. After receiving her Honorary Doctorate she sat on stage with the other recipients and members of faculty demonstrably enjoying the positive energy that makes any Commencement Day so very special.

Listening to this wonderful recording brought back many memories of this great violinist and her astonishing career, which in turn inspired me to tell a story. (photo by Simon Fowler)  In 1967 an extraordinary political event occurred. The Leventritt International Violin Competition in the US announced after the final round that they were awarding two first prizes--to Pinchas Zukerman, who everyone expected to win outright, and a young unknown 19-year-old girl from South Korea, Kyung-wha Chung, a Juilliard student studying with Ivan Galamian. The judges had, in fact, decided that this young unknown was the only winner and it took the intervention of Zukerman's mentor and champion, the violinist Isaac Stern, to argue for the compromise that was eventually announced. Kyung-wha's historic win, the first ever for a non-western musician, launched a legendary career. It also laid the foundation and inspiration for the astonishing talent from this part of Asia, including Kyung-wha's brother, the conductor Myung-whun Chung, and her sister the cellist, Myung-wha Chung. Then in 1970, another major event occurred that was perhaps even more significant. The young violinist stood in for an indisposed Itzhak Perlman at the Royal Festival Hall in London with the LSO and Andre Previn, playing the Tchaikovsky Concerto. This came at such short notice that there was no rehearsal time with the orchestra so Kyung-wha just got up there and played as if her life depended upon it. My wife, Virginia, was at the concert and she still talks about it as one of the most exciting performances of the Tchaikovsky she has ever heard. The critics that night were certainly in agreement and Heifetz and Oistrakh, the then accepted gods of the violin, were invoked with very favorable comparisons, and the evening was seen as the beginning of a major career in Europe. It was also the start of a new relationship for Kyung-wha, and the LSO and Previn who took the young violinist to their hearts. Plans were quickly made to record the Tchaikovsky paired with the Sibelius Concerto. The latter was a work the violinist knew but had not performed for a long time and in flying back to London from Seoul for the recording she had to beg the use of an office at her layover airport, just to get in as much practice of the work as possible. If you listen to these two recordings today they remain as fresh, musical and extraordinary as the amazing events surrounding her of 1970.I heard her play live for the first time in Cardiff in 1971 with the virtuoso showpiece Lalo's Symphonie Espagnole. I was totally smitten. This was a truly great violinist but also much more than that, a communicator, whose physicality when playing was unprecedented in my experience. She played with unbridled passion, making every note, every phrase something special, imbued with a type of energy and commitment that I had seldom heard. I have listened to her many times since in most of the great concertos and in one or two recitals including one devoted to the works of Kreisler celebrating his centennial in 1974. I remember the Elgar Concerto in Liverpool where she played this most demanding of concertos for the first time, exploring its vast emotional range in a reading full of musical eloquence. (You can hear this in her recording for DECCA.) Having conquered the heights of this massive work she left the stage to huge applause and was then heard to give a vast scream in the wings, not from frustration or anger, but just to release the tension of making it through this marathon work. This seemed to make the evening even more personal and special. Then there was the Brahms Concerto, which I heard her play many times and each time it grew in intensity. A friend of mine commented after one performance that she played from the depths of the soles of her feet connected to the inner earth, and I have always found this a very accurate description of her music making. It's the duende that the Spanish apply to the most special artists. In September 10, 2001, I heard her in the Sibelius Concerto with the Oregon Symphony in Portland, which I was then running. She played with the same passionate commitment you find in her recording from 1970. The next morning, September 11, I had to call her at her hotel with the news of the attack on the Twin Towers. It was early and she didn't know about the tragic events and pain and anxiety were suddenly there in her voice. But that night she played the concerto again with the orchestra for a bereft public contending with its own grief and needing music more than ever before. She gave the performance everything and then wanted to know if she could do more to help.In 2005, she suffered an injury to her hand and announced that she would be retiring from the concert platform. Even though she had recorded extensively including all the major concertos, losing her live presence on the concert stage was the saddest deprivation. But then in 2010, Kyung-wha reemerged and since then has been making a comeback. This has led to the above mentioned project and recording, the complete Bach Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin. These works represent something so special in the life of a performer. Perhaps they are the zenith of any career but without doubt to record them is something of a unique challenge and privilege.

At business meetings, dinner parties, and coffee dates, people keep talking to me about their childhood abuse. It makes sense: my story of abuse motivates my work, and I don't stop talking about my mission to end violence in every home (TEDTalk). Because I share my vulnerable story, people open up to me; some tell of severe cases, others of the occasional slap or scream. It must be human nature to diffuse pain and suffering because most say that they deserved the abuse.Let me tell you this... I did not deserve it.I did not deserve to be beaten because the baby pooped in his diaper and smeared it on the wall. The baby was one year old and I was five. I was told to watch the baby, and I was watching the baby. Regardless, I did not deserve to be hit. Nothing a child does merits physical pain and emotional suffering - even if it's to ""teach a lesson.""This is but one incident of parental anger and rage that was not right. My life of violence was a big deal to me as a child, but it became even bigger when it reared its ugly head after I became a mother. In my TEDxTalk , I describe how I had to fight the beast inside me for the sake of my own innocent child. I believed, and still do, that ""if we do not claim our abuse, we will repeat it."" It was a big deal to my son that I never beat him. It was a big deal to me that I saved a new generation from violence.We all have a Moral Imperative to end violence in the world, the majority of which is done towards women and children. November 25 is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and we must all use our voices to make the issue of Gender-Based Violence a big deal. I will be using my voice in my home country, Trinidad, during the 16 days of Gender Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, to ensure that the issue of violence is not ignored as part of my work with Maverick Collective and Population Services International (PSI). I am Trinidadian and am proud to be. I am, however, not proud that violence is so pervasive and normalized. Many Trinidadians are of the opinion that violence is needed to ""discipline."" This is not so.There is much research that shows children who receive violence suffer not only in the present moment but also long into the future. According to the Centers of Disease Control, abused children are plagued with a long list of repercussions from depression and suicides, to inability to maintain healthy intimate relationships, to becoming abusers themselves. So if childhood abuse is so common in Trinidad, no wonder 1 in 3 Trinidadians have experienced physical violence from their most recent intimate partner, according to a PSI-Caribbean study.Reports of crimes related to sexual assault and domestic violence increased by nearly 50% between 2013 and 2014 according to the UN in the Universal Periodic Review of Trinidad and Tobago. But it doesn't have to be this way. Abuse doesn't have to keep happening to children. Relationships don't have to be plagued with violence. It starts with you. Determine your Adverse Childhood Experiences Score to understand how your childhood may have affected your physical and emotional growth. If violence happened to you, it is a big deal. But you also have the power to end it, in your own home, starting today.Let's #orangetheworld together, because TOGETHER WE ARE MIGHTY!Indrani is a member of Maverick Collective, an initiative of Population Services International, a global health non-profit with operations in 65 countries and 9000 staff.

As it turns out, Jobs was onto something, and the scientific community backs him up. It seems that we've been giving intuition far too little respect.  ""Intuition will tell the thinking mind where to look next."" - Jonas Salk In a Salk Institute study, participants were asked to play a card game where they pulled cards from two different decks. The decks were rigged so that one would ""win"" more often than the other, but the participants didn't know that--at least, not overtly. It took about 50 cards for participants to consciously realize that the decks were different and about 80 to figure out what that difference was. However, what was really interesting was that it only took about 10 cards for their palms to start sweating slightly every time they reached for a card from the ""losing"" deck. It was about that same time that they started subconsciously favoring the ""winning"" deck.While that's all very interesting in a clinical setting, you have to ask yourself if it holds true in real life. Apparently, it does. When it comes to making major decisions, your intuition can matter just as much as your intellect.In one study, car buyers who relied on careful analysis of all of the available information were happy with their purchases about 25% of the time, while buyers who made quicker, more intuitive purchases were happy with their purchases about 60% of the time.Intuition comes from the primitive brain; it's an artifact of the early days of man when the brain's ability to detect hidden dangers ensured our survival. These days, we use this capability so little that we don't know how to listen to it properly (hint: it requires emotional intelligence).Whether you listen to it or not, your intuition is healthy and functioning. If you want to make better decisions in life, you'd do well to brush up on your intuition skills. You can start by emulating some of the habits of highly intuitive people.1. They slow down enough to hear their inner voice. Before you can pay attention to your intuition, you first have to be able to hear it amid the cacophony of your busy life. You have to slow down and listen, which often requires solitude. Taking some time away from the everyday, even something as brief as going for a walk, is a great way to turn up the volume of your intuition.2. They follow their inner voice. One of the primary reasons that some people are more intuitive than others is that they actually listen to their gut feeling instead of dismissing or doubting it. And that doesn't mean that they ignore their analytical mind and their critical thinking skills; there's a difference between using reason as a system of checks and balances and using it to talk yourself out of what your intuition knows to be true.3. They practice empathic accuracy. I'd probably lose you if I said that highly intuitive people read minds, so I'll use the scientific term: empathic accuracy. It's not magic; it's an intuitive awareness of what other people are thinking and feeling, using cues such as body language and tone of voice. It's an extremely powerful form of empathy that helps foster deep connections with other people.4. They practice mindfulness. ""Mindfulness"" sounds even more New-Agey than trusting your intuition, but it's really just a fancy term for focusing on being in the moment. Mindfulness is a great technique to filter out all of the distractions in your environment--and your brain. When you do that, you can hear your intuition loud and clear.5. They nurture their creativity. Did you ever have one of those paint-by-number kits when you were a kid? Talk about turning art into a science--all you have to do is put the right color in the right little space. You may end up with a pretty painting, but the only intuition involved is guessing what colors you're supposed to use in those really tiny spaces. No paint-by-numbers kit in the world can make a skilled artist create something as novel and monumental as the Sistine Chapel or the Mona Lisa. The missing ingredient is intuition. And, just as intuition is the secret ingredient in creativity, being intentionally creative strengthens your use of intuition.  6. They trust their gut. Have you ever made a decision and immediately started to feel sick, maybe even kind of clammy? Well, that affective experience is the body's way of informing you that the decision your analytic mind came to is at odds with your instinct.7. They analyze their dreams. If you accept the science that demonstrates the power of intuition, it's not much of a leap to accept that our dreams are often manifestations of intuition. Sure, sometimes dreams are nonsense, but they often try to tell us something. Intuitive people don't just think, ""Wow, that was a weird dream!""; they ask themselves, ""Where did that come from, and what can I take away from it?""Bringing It All TogetherThe science is clear: intuition is a powerful force of the mind that can help us to make better decisions. Fortunately, intuition is a skill that you can hone by practicing the habits of highly intuitive people.  How would you rate your intuition? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

Natalie ElleCan you tell me about the night that you bought dinner for the table you were seated next to?I had gone with a girl to look at a puppy that was up for adoption at Operation Kindness and then we stopped off at Snuffers due to its convenience before heading back to Denton. We were speaking and laughing until the gentleman in direct ear shot behind me began speaking. He spoke about how he was disgusted with his nephew who just came out as gay, that he was liberal, and went on to share more information about this kid's personal life. I set down my fork and listened. I wasn't eavesdropping, this man just happened to almost be touching heads with me and was speaking at a volume that made him impossible to ignore. He was sitting with three other individuals, and they said they would pray for him and his cure. ""His cure,"" I thought to myself. With Mike Pence now a part of our administration and the clown of a president elect we have, talking about ""cures"" is terrifying. Listening to this conversation the feelings of my past resurfaced for a moment. Shame, doubt, and fear. I then became enraged. I wanted to stand up and belittle this man or find ways to insult him. I wanted to make him feel like I felt, or better yet how his nephew would feel had he been there. I thought about Michelle Obama. I thought about her class and radiance. I thought about her words, ""When they go low, we go high."" I did just that. I asked for their ticket, paid it, asked if I could write on it, and did. The manager of the establishment came by and said he was impressed and fist bumped me. I took a photo of the receipt, but then thought maybe I shouldn't share it to social media. I left shortly after handing the receipt to the waitress. My family said when you give, you give anonymously and quietly. Be humble. I then realized that this was a way to impact others with the real message of love. To love when others don't, to not back down, to hold your ground, and live it out! Live out love than complain behind a keyboard. A friend asked me to share it publicly so I did, and it exploded. What I want people to take away from this, is that sometimes love looks like picking up a tab, sometimes it's protesting in the streets, lobbying, volunteering, or running for a local office. Love is sometimes silent but still always active. I am a white, cisgender, privileged woman and I march with #blacklivesmatter. I fight for women's equality. I fight against Islamophobia. I was a small part of helping pass marriage equality. I am not a hero. I am simply doing what everyone should be doing who is passionate about change. Get off your phones and keyboards and go feed someone who is homeless or make dinner for your Republican neighbors. Be nice to the cashier at your grocery store, who has had a long day. We never, ever know people's stories or what they are going through. Life is hard, and why would we make it harder on each other when things like death, war, and pain exist? We speak about love. We wear t-shirts. We dance when Ellen comes on television. But it's time, now more than ever, to get truly active. Get involved with an organization that is local. GIVE to the Human Rights Campaign so laws aren't passed to destroy the LGBQT community. If you are passionate about anything -- anything at all! -- pursue it. Make it breathe, live, and continue on.My buying these people dinner was so small. It was tiny. I never, ever expected this much attention. And, the truth is, it isn't even about me. It's about shutting up and showing love. Putting our pride away, making bold moves, and living what we preach. The white people of this country have got to start defending minorities, people of different ethnic backgrounds, people of different religions. Have you seen the photo of our new government administration? There is one black man. One. What have we become? This country is divided, and we've all got to lay down our weapons, reach out with our arms and love on one another. Impact is larger than intent.   I understand that trans activism is very near and dear to your heart. Is there any particular reason why?This year we have lost more trans lives than any year before. I know that the people we lost, who are literally just being who they are, were scared and important to this world. It's imperative that the gay community accept trans lives, all across the board.The tragedy at Pulse was a devastating moment in the LGBTQ community. What effect did that event have on you and your thinking?When the shooting at Pulse happened, it felt like my family had been murdered. Our community is grand and beautiful. We are the sparkle and the force behind true love in this country at times. We walk hand in hand through streets and dance to music about freedom and being united. ""Born This Way"" is the prime example. I was taught how to two step by two men in a gay bar. Our community is the most embracing, life altering, astounding safe space and home I have ever known. Everyone deserves that. Why can't that be what America is? Why can't that be what this world is? Why do our beliefs and Gods cause us to destroy each other when in reality, the message is always to love one another? How do you feel about all of the attention you've received for your not so random act of kindness?I'm not a hero, I am not different, I merely did what I believe to be an example of love. I doubt I changed their minds but a tiny seed, a tiny morsel of love was planted. And, Woods says, she hopes that the gesture will inspire more people to perform simple acts of kindness and post about their own gestures, tagging them with #LoveLives. She also hopes they will put their money where the fight is by donating to the Human Rights Campaign. Like it or not, money still makes the world go round. And now, more than ever, we need to keep this big blue marble spinning, embracing our differences, exterminating the hate, and letting love live."

92,RELIGION,An American Brand Of DIY Spirituality,"Shayne Looper, ContributorMy goal is to live in love and not go out of it.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-american-brand-of-diy-_b_13396504.html,This is not DIY spirituality. It's a fallacy for people to think they can encounter God on their own terms. It's more than a fallacy; it's idolatry.,2016-12-03,Wooden planks forming the letters DIY for 'Do It Yourself',https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7b3ff2400003000989c9e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For decades pollsters consistently reported that 40 percent of Americans were in church on any given Sunday. But a long-term count of actual attendance in real churches suggests that good Christian people weren't telling pollsters the truth, and actual church attendance was only half of what was being reported.So are fewer people going to church today than in the past? No, there are about the same number of people attending church today as were attending in 1990. But the population in the U.S. has grown by more than 25 percent since then, which means there are not fewer people going to church but there are more people not going to church. The overall percentage of worshipers has dropped significantly.And according to some experts, the people who do attend church regularly are attending less often than they did in the past. One church denominational executive told me that it is now necessary for a church to grow by ten percent a year in order to maintain last year's average attendance.People who once attended church weekly are now attending every other week. People who went twice a month are now attending once a month. This change in behavior indicates more than a lifestyle change. It reveals a theological shift. In the past these people saw church attendance as essential but they now see it as optional.It needs to be said that this theological shift may not be all bad. If people thought of church attendance as a kind of extortion money paid to God to stay on his good side, losing that belief was a step in the right direction. Likewise if church attendance was merely a means to an end like social acceptance. Nevertheless, the idea that gathering with the church is merely one option among many is theologically unsupportable.There are undoubtedly many factors driving this change in church attendance. One of those factors may be the rise of a new kind of spirituality in America, influenced by the spread of Eastern religions and New Age mysticism, and coupled with a robust American individualism. This rise in Eastern philosophies has coincided with a decrease in denominational identity and influence, and has manifested itself in a particularly American brand of do-it-yourself spirituality.In do-it-yourself spirituality, church attendance is entirely optional. Such thinking betrays a serious theological confusion. Of course God's acceptance is not conditioned upon whether a person sits in a pew every week, but then sitting in a pew was never about God's acceptance in the first place. Christians don't gather with the church to raise their credit rating with God.Theologically speaking, church is not something people do once a week or once a month, depending on preference. Church is something people are, or at least something people are a part of. The idea that a Christian can have Christ without the church disregards the biblical witness. Christ and his church are a package deal.That's not to say that attendance is the sole mark of membership in the church. It is not. Some who are the church cannot attend its meetings. Some who attend its meetings are not the church. But when those who are the church do not want to gather with the church, something has gone seriously wrong.The church - not the building or the organization, but the people united to Christ by faith and in consequence are united to each other - are being fashioned into the perfect instrument through which God can make himself known. This is what St. Paul was talking about when he wrote, ""We are carefully joined together in him, becoming a holy temple for the Lord ... a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.""This is not DIY spirituality. It's a fallacy for people to think they can encounter God on their own terms. It's more than a fallacy; it's idolatry. If they want to meet God, they would be wise to go where he has chosen to meet them. True, that does not mean a church building or church service, but it does mean the community of children, women, and men who are united to Christ and to each other by God's Spirit. It means the church."
