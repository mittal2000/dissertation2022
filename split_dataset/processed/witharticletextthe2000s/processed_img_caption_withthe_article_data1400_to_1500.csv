Throwing coins on the back of turtles is an old Thai superstition that’s believed to give the person longevity, according to the AP.Vets said they expected her to take about a month to recover from the surgery before undergoing physical therapy. But on Sunday, she was rushed into intensive care when found to be breathing too slowly. During an emergency operation on Monday, she fell into a coma that she didn’t wake up from, Reuters reported.Video and photos posted to a Facebook page belonging to Chansue showed doctors working to save the turtle.“At 10:10 a.m. she went with peace,” Chansue later told reporters, according to Agence France-Presse. “She is my friend, teacher, and patient.”Chansue hopes the turtle’s loss will serve as a wake-up call to end the superstitious practice."
1,ARTS & CULTURE,Pussy Riot Offers Advice On How To Defy ‘Stupid Ape’ Donald Trump,Elyse Wanshel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pussy-riot-advice-donald-trump-putin_us_58d01dc1e4b00705db51953a,"""We must not give [him] our fear.""",2017-03-21,Tolokonnikova gestures before a court hearing in Moscow in 2012.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d053581d0000cf3b7cf75d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When it comes to defiance, Nadya Tolokonnikova of Russian punk band Pussy Riot could be considered a pro.In 2012, Pussy Riot staged a guerilla performance at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow. The show mocked Vladimir Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church, which led to Tolokonnikova and fellow bandmate Maria Alekhina receiving a two-year prison sentence.In a March 20 opinion piece that Tolokonnikova wrote for Foreign Policy, she calls President Donald Trump a “stupid ape” and says that at the moment, he should be easy to resist — at least in comparison to Putin.In her column, Tolokonnikova discusses how the U.S. commander-in-chief and Putin are alike, writing that both operate with the same “caveman psychology” and have gained power by harping on people’s fears and anger to make themselves more powerful. But she also argues that Trump is the lesser of two evils because he lacks Putin’s tyrannical force.“When they are angry, they lash out,” she wrote. “For Trump, it is with tweets. Putin has more power, so he puts his enemies in jail. These are just the knee-jerk reactions of children acting out when they feel rejected or scared.”She continues by putting things in perspective.“[Trump] is not a great revolutionary or an arbiter of a movement. He can’t change the country in one day,” she wrote. “He’s just a stupid ape.”But Tolokonnikova doesn’t think we should underestimate Trump, either.“It’s important to remember that, for example, in Russia, for the first year of when Vladimir Putin came to power, everybody was thinking that it will be O.K.,” Tolokonnikova told The New York Times shortly after the Trump won the election.In her Foreign Policy column, Tolokonnikova also stresses that those who resist Trump have to be a “pain in the ass” and “prepare to fight for [change] much longer than you think,” citing how while in jail with Alyokhina, the women would protest whenever possible and went on hunger strikes. Tolokonnikova admits that these acts of resistance were not easy, but felt her defiance would eventually improve the lives of others and found solace in that. “Men like Putin and Trump think they can smash people. Putin thought that he could break us,” she wrote in Foreign Policy. “But even in jail we still had our minds, our souls, and our happiness. In the end, we never gave up. And that is how you push back against Trump, Putin, and all those other assholes just like them. We must not give them our fear.”"

The assertion follows FBI Director James Comey’s confirmation Monday that that the bureau is investigating ties between Trump’s presidential campaign and the Kremlin.Trump’s counselor said Tuesday that Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser for the campaign, and J.D. Gordon, a former national security adviser for the campaign, were little more than “fringe players.”“In the case of Mr. Page, Mr. Gordon, some others, they really have very attenuated contacts to the campaign that I managed for the last three months,” Conway said on “Fox & Friends.” “I have spoken directly to the president and other senior officials about this. He doesn’t know these gentlemen. He didn’t work with them.”Both Page and Gordon have admitted to meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the Republican National Convention in July. Page was fired from the Trump campaign in September following reports he had discussed sanctions relief with Russian officials.Conway’s attempt to distance Trump from surrogates linked to Russia mirrors White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s comments during a press briefing Monday. Paul Manafort, who once managed Trump’s presidential campaign, has also been linked to Russia. But Spicer claimed Manafort played only a small part in the political operation.“There’s been a discussion of Paul Manafort, who played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time,” Spicer said.Manafort became Trump’s campaign manager in March 2016 before resigning in August amid scrutiny over his ties to pro-Russian forces.Spicer also attempted to weaken the link between Trump and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who resigned as Trump’s national security adviser last month after reports surfaced that he had met with Kislyak and mischaracterized the nature of those conversations to Vice President Mike Pence.“Even Gen. Flynn was a volunteer,” Spicer said.While Flynn served in that capacity throughout the campaign, his final meetings with the Russian ambassador came after Trump had named him as national security adviser.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

In previous years and previous elections ..., it was the same. Some of it was in front of people’s eyes and they became aware of it. And some of it they were not aware of but I was informed about it,” he said in Iranian New Year remarks carried live on state television.“It was revealed in 2009 - they came out and drew battle lines. And in other years in other ways, but in all these years I stood against them and said whatever the results of the election are, they must be carried out.”Two of the candidates from the 2009 presidential election, which put hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad into office for a second term despite large protests over alleged vote fraud that shook the Islamic Republic, have been under house arrest since 2011.Mir Hussein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi were detained for calling for street protests at the same time that pro-democracy uprisings were convulsing Tunisia and Egypt. In recent weeks, the hardline and moderate political camps in Iran have been gearing up for a showdown in the May 19 vote.Rouhani has called for greater individual freedoms and highlighted the 2015 diplomatic breakthrough reached with world powers, in which Iran curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions, as a signature achievement.Conservatives hope to stop Rouhani winning a second four-year term but have yet to name their presidential candidate.They have denounced the nuclear pact as a form of capitulation, fearing it could open up Iran to Western political and corporate influence. They have also criticized Rouhani’s economic record, including difficulties in rebuilding foreign trade and investment despite the lifting of sanctions.Khamenei has also faulted Iran’s economic performance under Rouhani. He said on Tuesday the government could have achieved more in stimulating the economy and cited unemployment as one of Iran’s biggest problems.Iran’s jobless rate is 12.4 percent, according to state statistics, with about 3.2 million Iranians unemployed out of a total population of 80 million.

4,POLITICS,Neil Gorsuch Doesn't Give Any Hints On How He'd Rule On Donald Trump's Travel Ban,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neil-gorsuch-travel-ban_us_58d12e46e4b00705db52a78e,He stuck to general constitutional principles.,2017-03-21,"Judge Neil Gorsuch testifies on Tuesday, the second day of his Supreme Court confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d189541400008806070c47.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) on Tuesday pressed Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch about his views on discrimination against certain religious groups, using President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban as an example of a government policy that may do just that.“Does the First Amendment allow the use of a religious litmus test for entry into the United States?” asked Leahy, the No. 2 Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is considering the president’s nominee to fill the seat left empty by the late Justice Antonin Scalia.Gorsuch resisted the question, noting that there is litigation now attempting to resolve the legality of Trump’s executive order restricting travel and refugee resettlement from certain Muslim-majority countries. When Leahy pushed back, noting he’s not referring to any particular case, Gorsuch gave a broad constitutional standard for religious freedom.“Senator, we have a free exercise clause that protects the free exercise of religious liberties by all persons in this country,” he said. “If you’re asking me how I apply it to a specific case, I can’t talk about that, for understandable reasons.”Notably, the rulings that so far have touched on the legality of Trump’s travel restrictions ― in Virginia, Maryland and Hawaii ― have looked to a different part of the First Amendment: the one that prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring one religion over others. But there’s debate about which part of the Constitution applies, and later rulings may clarify the exact scope of these alleged constitutional violations. Leahy then got explicit about Trump and his stated desire, during the presidential campaign, to institute “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” And he pointed out that a Republican congressman has suggested that Gorsuch needed to be confirmed so that he could help uphold one of the president’s key executive orders.“Senator, a lot of people say a lot of silly things,” Gorsuch responded, noting that the congressman “has no idea how I’d rule in that case.”“It would be grossly improper of a judge” to make commitments during a confirmation hearing about a particular result he’d reach about a case, he added. The federal government is presently facing at least two dozen lawsuits across the country. They all seek to invalidate Trump’s executive orders affecting travel, which brought chaos, protests and headaches on the new administration. For now, a number of court orders have kept the restrictions from being enforced.Sooner or later, at least one of these orders is expected to reach the Supreme Court, where Gorsuch could play a pivotal role.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

5,POLITICS,"Airline Electronics Ban Probably Based On Legitimate Threats, Experts Say",Willa Frej,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/electronics-ban-threats_us_58d1608ae4b0ec9d29dfcd4e,"Threats to aviation have been around for a long time, but the Trump administration's claim of fresh intelligence appears credible.",2017-03-21,"Some airports, like Istanbul's Ataturk airport, require several security screenings before boarding the plane.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d197811d0000f42c7cfb0f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The ban on electronics larger than a cellphone on incoming flights to the United States and the United Kingdom from a handful of airports in the Middle East and North Africa was announced Tuesday without much information to back it up.But the action was probably based on credible terrorist threats against air travel, experts said.The link between terror and aviation isn’t new, and the fact that other countries are implementing versions of an electronics ban points to the legitimacy of the threats. Still, the rollout of the ban in the U.S. lacked transparency and will likely cause confusion and apprehension on the part of many travelers.The Department of Homeland Security released a fact sheet on Tuesday that leaves unanswered many questions about the ban ― like why laptops or tablets are any more dangerous than cellphones. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, didn’t bother answering any of the lingering questions, either. “As you can imagine, I can’t talk about the intelligence we have,” Spicer said during Tuesday’s news briefing. “I can just tell you that the steps we are taking are commensurate with the intelligence we have.” Experts agreed there’s probably a tangible threat, most likely emanating from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has a history of targeting aviation.“There’s been repeated AQAP and Islamic State attempts to build explosives into electronic devices,” said Clinton Watts, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. The threats date to a foiled 2009 plot to fill a printer cartridge with explosives.Enhanced aviation security measures were put in place three or four times during the Obama administration, said Christian Beckner, deputy director of George Washington University’s Center for Cyber and Homeland Security. “At this point, this looks more to me like something that’s generally consistent with prior action that’s been taken,” he said of Tuesday’s order.If the AQAP threat has loomed over the U.S. for years, it raises the question of why the ban is just now going into effect. Either there is credible intelligence of a threat coming from countries the ban affects, or the administration believes “security is weak in those parts,” Watts said.But security at many of the affected airports, like those in Doha and Dubai, is on par with or better than in the U.S. That means the explanation probably is new intelligence or a threat, Watts said.“Now is the best time in a long time to launch an international terrorist attack just because America will be forced by the administration to respond hard,” he said.The U.K. government imposed its own ban following the U.S. action on Tuesday. Canada also is considering one. Moves by multiple countries lend credence to the threats, Beckner and Watts said.“I think it confirms that it’s less like the travel executive orders and more consistent with the longstanding way we’ve treated impending urgent information on aviation threats,” Beckner said.“If other countries go along with it, to me it suggests that there’s something to it,” Watts added.Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee’s ranking Democrat, supported the ban after receiving an updated intelligence briefing over the weekend.“These steps are both necessary and proportional to the threat,” Schiff said in a statement Tuesday. “The global aviation system remains a top target.”"
6,POLITICS,Trump Fails To Close Deal On Health Care Repeal,Michael McAuliff and Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-health-care-bill-republicans_us_58d13dc3e4b0be71dcf81a63,"The president told the House GOP there will be primaries if his repeal fails, but conservatives said they ""do not have the votes.""",2017-03-21,President Donald Trump made a pitch for his health care legislation to Republicans on the Hill Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d13f1c1400002000070abb.jpeg?cache=C3matSWyD7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump made a personal pitch for his Affordable Care Act repeal bid Tuesday, promising that Republicans who vote against the bill will face political consequences.With a House vote on the Republican plan set for Thursday, both more moderate and more conservative lawmakers are raising serious objections and questions about whether the bill can pass.Trump argued that the party’s future ― and by extension, his legacy ― is on the line. And if members did not fall in line, especially the conservatives of the House Freedom Caucus, Republicans would pay a price.“If the Freedom Caucus kills this bill, which they could, then they will have voted to continue Obamacare, which, as the president pointed out, in 2018 probably means we would lose the House and the Senate,” said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.).“This is do or die on Thursday for the Republicans in the midterm election,” Collins said.Indeed, the legislative stakes are high for a new president who brings with him no experience shepherding major bills through Congress, having never served in government. Both his political capital and much of his remaining domestic legislative agenda rests on passage of this, lawmakers said. Trump seems to recognize that, and his 45-minute pitch to House Republicans came as members on both sides of the Capitol were weighing revisions to make the bill more palatable to all.But even with these moves and the stakes Trump laid out Tuesday, the president ― at least so far ― appeared to have swayed only a few votes.“I moved from a lean no to a no,” said Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.), a former Trump surrogate who said he is worried undocumented immigrants would take advantage of the GOP plan.More troubling for Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), however, was that they do not appear to have won over Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.“They do not have the votes right now,” Meadows said, adding that he doubted his colleagues would get on board if leaders delay the vote.“I’ve had no indication that any of my Freedom Caucus colleagues have switched their vote,” Meadows said. “I’m not giving numbers. There’s still more than enough to make sure that we need to continue the discussion.”Still, other Republicans were all in with Trump, largely because of the political implications if the GOP fails.“He said look, if you don’t get behind this, you all ran on repealing Obamacare. It looks like you’d be ripe for a primary if you don’t keep your promise,” said Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas).Even that was not sufficient for some of the GOP’s more maverick conservatives.“I think if we do do this, we lose the majority,” said Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.).Some members did change their minds. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) had said he was leaning against the legislation because many of his constituents depend on Medicaid. A personal touch on Tuesday appeared to sway the Long Island Republican away from his concerns for his district:King told reporters later that he was still undecided.Trump also singled out Meadows in the closed-door meeting, noting that Meadows was for Trump before Trump was even a candidate, several members said. He also ― apparently jokingly ― told Meadows “I’m coming after you!” according to Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas), who said the line nevertheless got cheers.“The way the crowd responded was pretty interesting,” Flores said.Interesting was not the word Meadows used to describe the overall situation, even as he professed to have faith in Trump.“I certainly still think the president is the best guy to bring this home and close this deal out,” Meadows said. “Hopefully we’ll be able to do that, but if everyone’s entrenched at this particular point, it’s going to be a very difficult 48 hours.”Meadows offered a somewhat ironic response when reporters asked him about being publicly called out by Trump.“The president and I know each other well, and I have nothing but the utmost respect for his willingness and ability to close a deal,” Meadows said, even though he didn’t change his mind. “This is what he’s done all his life, and who am I to challenge those tactics?”Trump was setting up meetings with individual holdouts in the Freedom Caucus, but it was unclear what he could offer them.Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) said it would be easy to talk to Trump if he calls: “They say, ‘What are you going to tell the president when he calls, blah, blah, blah, blah.’ You know, I said, it’s easy. You guys are overthinking this too much. It’s [crackling noises] Mr. Presi... [static noises] my cellphone [static noises] gotta real bad [static noises]...”Meadows told reporters that Ryan and the other House leaders were no longer negotiating changes.This article has been updated with additional comments from members of Congress."

Comey also confirmed in that hearing that the FBI is investigating several Trump associates regarding Russia’s alleged attempt to influence the 2016 election.But when Trump did a couple interviews hours later with local newscasts prior to his rally in Louisville, Kentucky, those two stories consuming the capital didn’t come up. A representative for a Cincinnati station interviewing Trump says they chose to focus on local concerns, while a Louisville reporter who spoke to the president said those two issues were off limits. “The White House made it clear the president would not answer questions about wiretapping or the investigation into Russia’s role in the election,” Lawrence Smith, a reporter at Louisville Fox affiliate WDRB in Louisville, said on air. “So we stuck to issues most directly important to Kentucky.” Trump also didn’t get questions about wiretapping or Russia during an interview on Cincinnati affiliate Fox19 Now, though the station’s news director, Steve Hyvonen, says they weren’t prohibited from asking about them. “Fox19 Now was never given parameters leading up to the interview,” he said in an email. “Had we been told what to ask or had we been required to submit our questions, we would not have done the interview. As the interview was being confirmed the day before, we told White House representatives we would like to talk with the President about several topics affecting Cincinnati and the Tri-State, including his new healthcare plan. We did not submit ― and were not asked to submit ― the topics or the questions.”A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. While Trump frequently attacks national news organizations as producers of “fake news,” his White House has expanded outreach to regional news outlets, including by bringing in local anchors to dine with the president and to the daily press briefing via Skype.By making Trump available to Louisville and Cincinnati reporters on Monday, the White House took advantage of the often differing priorities of the national and local press. Such a media strategy appears savvy given that the president avoided uncomfortable questions in Washington and appeared on newscasts in those two cities heaping praise on viewers and making promises to them. Smith said Trump was “clearly anxious to get outside the Washington bubble and talk about Kentucky issues.” The president talked about putting miners back to work and bringing back automotive jobs ― and again suggested he kept Ford from leaving the state. He praised the state’s Republican Sen. Rand Paul, a critic of the Republicans’ plan to “replace” the Affordable Care Act, as a “good guy” and said he “love[d] the people of Kentucky.”During his interview on Cincinnati’s Fox19 Now, Trump similarly praised Paul as having the “right heart, the right spirit” and said the ACA, commonly referred to as Obamacare, has been “very bad for Kentucky.” He boasted that “jobs are coming back into the country” and the “stock market is through the roof.” And when anchor Tricia Macke asked Trump about a local bridge in need of repairs, the president said he’d fix it.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would result in a significant reduction in coverage, as most states would scale back eligibility to what it was before Obamacare took effect — and as overall payments for the program failed to keep up with health care costs.Head here for the poll’s main findings, and here for its complete results.The respondents to AARP’s survey strongly believe in preserving Medicaid funding at its current levels. Seventy-three percent of all older voters, including 55 percent of Trump voters, would like Congress to “keep funding for Medicaid where it is now” if Obamacare is repealed, according to AARP. Respondents also preferred keeping Medicaid as an open guarantee rather than a flat amount doled out to states or recipients. The program currently provides as much funding as necessary to cover eligible recipients health care costs.In a question about Medicaid’s funding structure, AARP notes that the capped Medicaid payments in the Republican bill would rise “with inflation but may not cover rising costs of health care needs.” Sixty-eight percent of the surveyed voters, including 59 percent of Trump voters, support preserving Medicaid in its current form.The other major component of the Republican bill that older workers disliked is a feature that would allow insurance companies to charge older workers five times more than their younger peers.The law would create tax breaks that could be used to purchase insurance and that would increase with age. But they only increase by a factor of two, which is not enough to cover the full cost of the increase. The provision, which AARP has dubbed an “age tax,” would be a significant increase from the current 3-to-1 ratio permitted by Obamacare. Due in part to this increase, the replacement law would lead to a 20 percent to 25 percent rise in premiums for 64-year-olds by 2026, according to CBO.In its survey, AARP used its own estimate that buying insurance would cost many seniors as much as $8,400 more per year under the House Republicans’ plan. When AARP asked respondents whether they view the age rating provision as levying an “age tax” for that reason, 55 percent of voters said they did, including 51 percent of Trump voters.AARP has expressed its opposition to the bill in a letter to Congress, and is running internet ads and radio ads attacking the 5-to-1 age ratio and other provisions. It also plans to send each of its members a mailer showing how their member of Congress voted on the bill, and to keep members up to date via email and social media.But as public opinion over Obamacare proved, voters’ feelings about the specific provisions of a law often have little bearing on their feelings about the law as a whole. Despite their support for features of Obamacare that Republicans seek to eliminate, 72 percent of Trump voters strongly oppose the existing health care law, according to the AARP poll. These voters aren’t sure how to feel about the Republican bill, however. A plurality of the older Trump voters ― 41 percent ― said that they “somewhat support” the American Health Care Act, and 33 percent said they do not know what to think.Perhaps the most intriguing finding of the AARP poll is that older Americans of all political stripes support taking a harder line with pharmaceutical companies to control Medicare’s costs. Given a choice between turning Medicare into a voucher and empowering the program to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies, 78 percent of voters surveyed, including 67 percent of Trump voters, backed drug price negotiation. A similarly high percentage of respondents believe that drug prices “are the result of big drug company monopolies and the deals their lobbyists make.”The Benenson Strategy Group and the GS Strategy Group, which conducted the phone survey for AARP, polled a representative sample of 605 Americans aged 50 or older who voted in the 2016 election. Almost half of them were Trump voters. White House press secretary Sean Spicer has downplayed AARP’s opposition to the health care bill, calling the organization a “special interest.” But Republicans appear aware of AARP’s power ― or are at least sensitive to concerns about how older voters will respond to the law. House Republican leaders have added $85 billion to the bill for extra tax credits to help workers over 50 afford insurance under the law, Politico reported Monday.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

This time, the president referenced a Bleacher Report story in which an unidentified team general manager estimated that 10 percent of teams were reluctant to sign the former 49er over fears Trump would tweet about them.“There was an article today … that NFL owners don’t want to pick him up because they don’t want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump,” the president said. “Do you believe that?”“I said, ‘If I remember that one, I’m gonna report it to the people of Kentucky because they like it when people actually stand for the American flag.’”As of early Tuesday, Kaepernick’s Twitter remained mum on Trump’s comments.The 29-year-old footballer opted out the final year of his 49ers contract weeks ago and became an unrestricted free agent, ESPN reported.He will reportedly stand for the anthem next season ― if he signs with a team."

And it would restrict state funds from being used to create a registry of people on the basis of immigration status, nationality, religion or ethnic origin.The measure follows in the footsteps of dozens of municipalities and local jurisdictions across the country that have declared themselves “sanctuary cities,” including San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington.So far no such statewide designations have been enacted.Republican President Donald Trump in January signed an executive order seeking to withhold federal funds from local governments that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.At the time, he said local jurisdictions put U.S. citizens at risk by releasing criminals who should be deported and who, in some cases, commit additional offenses after being released from jail."

Needless injury and death can be really expensive.,2017-03-21,"President Donald Trump's proposed budget slashes the Susan Harwood Training Grant Program, which gives money to workers groups to provide safety training. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d03336140000880607083c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― More than 100 construction workers die in a typical year in Texas ― many of them immigrants who may speak little or no English and not know their rights on the worksite.A small, Austin-based nonprofit called the Workers Defense Project has tried to improve this situation. Sixty percent of Texas construction workers said they received absolutely no safety training before starting a job, according to a survey the group released in 2013. So the organization holds free safety training seminars in the Austin and Dallas areas, teaching workers how to avoid falling off buildings, getting hit with heavy machinery or being overcome by heat. Last year the nonprofit received a modest federal grant of $144,000 to help run its safety program. The budget proposal President Donald Trump put forward last week would eliminate that grant.The White House said the effectiveness of such funding is “unproven.” But Jose Garza, the executive director of Workers Defense Project, said he has no doubt that the training prevents injuries and saves lives. It also provides a rudimentary education that, in his experience, many employers simply won’t pay for ― even if it saves costs to employers and society in the long run.“This is a very dangerous industry,” Garza said. “It’s absolutely imperative that everyone on the job site has that basic safety training. If just one person doesn’t, that could have repercussions.”“This,” he added, “is a very dangerous proposal.”The White House’s budget blueprint takes an axe to all manner of domestic programs, slashing funding for education, workforce development and assistance to the poor to help pay for a military buildup and a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. While the budget is ultimately determined by Congress, the president’s proposal serves as a guide for how the administration sees the role of government and how it plans to run its agencies. It also tees up the specific funding fights that will unfold between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.The individual programs on Trump’s chopping block represent a tiny piece of the overall budget. The safety grants that go to groups like Garza’s ― known as the Susan Harwood Training Grant Program, administered by the Labor Department ― costs around $10.5 million a year. By getting rid of it, the White House would cut a whopping 0.0002 percent of the overall budget, according to the budget calculator from the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Like many other programs facing cuts from Trump and the Republican Congress, the elimination of the Harwood grants would provide a barely perceptible savings to the federal government, while hurting vulnerable workers in unseen ways. Setting aside the value of human life, it’s possible cutting the program could even cost money in the long run, through higher workers compensation and health care costs borne by employers and, well, all of us. That’s why backers of the grants see them as an investment rather than an outlay.“The program is tiny, but very cost-effective,” said David Michaels, who served as the head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration under former President Barack Obama, and teaches public health at George Washington University. “It’s for small employers and for workers, but especially vulnerable workers. I have no question [the grants] are very valuable and play an important role in protecting people.”The Harwood money is specifically devoted to people working in dangerous and low-wage industries, where injury rates are high and employer-provided training tends to be insufficient. It is as much a subsidy to businesses as it is to groups like Workers Defense.Last year’s grants helped fund training for New York City nail salon workers, who are exposed to dangerous chemicals on a daily basis; construction workers who live on tribal lands; Georgia poultry workers who face extraordinarily high levels of carpal tunnel syndrome; migrant farm workers in Virginia who handle pesticides and often don’t speak English; and tree-trimmers in the Northeast who are liable to fall from heights or have mishaps with heavy machinery, among others.Some of the grants go to labor unions ― a prime target of Republicans ― but the money must be used toward working safety and training, areas that unions specialize in. Most of the grants go to universities or colleges, trade groups, public-interest groups and nonunion worker centers. The program has been running since 1978 and trained more than 2 million workers, according to the Labor Department. A typical grant last year was around $130,000. Although Trump’s budget explicitly questioned the value of safety training, research has found that training workers in how to be safe on the job can both prevent injuries and save money. A 2004 study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine analyzed workers compensation and health insurance data, finding that trained construction workers were 12 percent less likely than nontrained workers to file a workers comp claim. Among the youngest workers, safety training could reduce claims by 42 percent, the authors wrote.And low-wage workers who’d received safety training were “significantly less likely to experience work-related injuries,” according to a 2015 report that UCLA prepared for California’s labor department. One of last year’s grants went to the International Association of Firefighters, a union representing 300,000 firefighters and paramedics. Elizabeth Harman, who oversees training grants for the union,, said the group has been using the $140,000 grant to redevelop its training program for working in confined spaces, one of the most dangerous situations any worker can face.Harman pointed to the January tragedy in Key Largo, Florida: Three utility workers died in a manhole after being overcome by poisonous fumes, and a firefighter was left in critical condition after trying to save them. The target audience for the training is firefighters in cash-strapped rural areas, Harman said, adding that the program benefits both nonunion and union workers.“Unfortunately, training can be a luxury,” Harman said. “We’ve got small rural departments out there with minimal funding to keep them going.”Harman said the union had to develop a detailed plan when it applied for the grant, and it files quarterly reports to the government on how it’s been using the money. She noted that the union often secures much larger grants from the government to fund training. “This is a small grant for us, but sometimes the smallest grants have the largest impact,” she said.Garza said Workers Defense will find a way to make up the shortfall if it can’t rely on the Harwood grant in the future. The majority of the group’s funding comes from foundations, individual donations, unions and member dues, and only a small portion through government grants. But he said Trump’s willingness to cut training for low-wage workers in dangerous industries violated his campaign promise to make work great again. “He went around the country talking about bringing back good jobs for American workers,” Garza said. “We’ve just seen mounting evidence that he’s cutting programs that give those folks a chance to have good-faith jobs.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d143492c00002100fef8c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters Health) ― The retail pharmacy company CVS Health helped its customers quit smoking by pulling cigarettes off the shelves two years ago, a new study suggests.Smokers who purchased cigarettes exclusively at CVS stores were 38 percent less likely to buy tobacco after the national chain stopped selling cigarettes, the study shows.In addition, cigarette sales dropped 1 percent ― or by 95 million packs ― in 13 states in the eight months after CVS left the tobacco market in September 2014, according to the report in the American Journal of Public Health.“It shows that responsible behavior by a pharmacy has public health benefits for the whole population,” Stanton Glantz said in a phone interview. He directs the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, and was not involved with the study.The results provide “very strong evidence” that removing tobacco from CVS’ more than 7,800 stores reduced smoking, Glantz said. “It was a big enough effect that you could see it in the population level, which is very impressive,” he said.The findings heartened Dr. Troyen Brennan, CVS Health’s chief medical officer and one of the study’s authors.“We think that this research definitely shows that if pharmacies didn’t sell cigarettes, fewer people would smoke, more people would live longer, and fewer people would die,” he said in a phone interview.Brennan and a team of CVS researchers analyzed data from a nationally representative survey of consumers’ cigarette purchases at drug, food, big box, dollar, convenience and gas station retailers prior to and one year following the company’s exit from the cigarette market.While they found that shoppers who purchased cigarettes exclusively from CVS were 38 percent more likely to stop buying cigarettes altogether, they could not conclude that those customers kicked the habit. The data shows they did not purchase cigarettes elsewhere, but it remained unclear whether they got cigarettes from another source, possibly a friend or relative, Brennan said.But states in which CVS pulled out of the tobacco market sold 0.14 fewer packs of cigarettes per smoker a month compared to other states, the study found.In 1970, the American Pharmaceutical Association declared cigarette displays to be in conflict with the public health role of pharmacies. The following year, the association recommended that pharmacies stop selling tobacco.But until CVS quit the business, nationwide pharmacy chains had ignored the recommendation.“We know that tobacco kills 488,000 people a year in the U.S.,” Brennan said. “How can you sell that kind of thing when you’re supposed to be emphasizing health care?”Public health advocates have pressed Walgreens to also clear its shelves of cigarettes. But the pharmacy chain, one of the nation’s largest, has refused to leave the tobacco market.Asked to comment about the study, Walgreens provided a written statement. “We believe that the most effective step we can take to help smokers quit is to address the root causes of smoking, which go far beyond the small percentage of smokers who access this product at pharmacies,” it says.“We have made an active decision to reduce space and visibility of tobacco products in certain of our stores as we focus on helping customers who want to stop smoking,” the statement says.Robin Koval, CEO and president of Truth Initiative, a Washington, D.C. nonprofit dedicated to ending youth smoking, took Walgreens to task for failing to follow CVS’ lead and “missing a significant opportunity to serve their customers’ health and welfare.”The new study underscores the need for Walgreens to remove tobacco from its stores, Koval, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S. One in four American adults use tobacco, and nearly 17 percent smoke cigarettes.The vast majority of smokers want to quit, Brennan said. Consequently, moving cigarettes out of their line of sight helps them to abstain.“Cigarettes are an impulsive buy,” he said. “When you change availability, you can change the smoking habits of individuals.” SOURCE: http://bit.ly/2lMrHQD American Journal of Public Health, online February 16, 2017."

That added to losses in the sector since the Federal Reserve last week raised interest rates by 25 basis points and signaled it would remain on a gradual pace of hikes, a less aggressive stance than some investors expected.Banks benefit from higher interest rates and their stocks are sensitive to changes in expectations of how quickly the Fed will change rates.Bank of America slumped 5.07 percent, the biggest drag on the S&P 500, while a 2.7 percent drop in Goldman Sachs pulled the Dow lower.“There was a feeling the Fed was going to possibly be more hawkish last week. That didn’t happen,” said Mark Kepner, managing director at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. “That takes a little out of the higher rates that the banks want.”Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were last up 9/32 in price to yield 2.441 percent, the lowest yield since March 1.Republican party leaders aim to move controversial healthcare legislation to the House floor for debate as early as Thursday. But they can only afford to lose about 20 votes from Republican ranks, or risk the bill failing, since minority Democrats are united against it.With valuations stretched, investors see the Trump administration’s recent struggles to push through the healthcare overhaul as a sign he may also face setbacks delivering promised corporate tax cuts. Expectations of those tax cuts are a major reason for the 10-percent surge in the S&P 500 since Trump’s election in November.“Republicans should have prioritized tax reform ahead of healthcare reform.

On Thursday ― seven years to the day since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law ― the House is tentatively scheduled to advance its repeal measure.“More people are going to get hurt under the Republican version than under the ACA. They may not like the ACA, but we could certainly work on it and improve it,” said former Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who chaired the Finance Committee during the period the Affordable Care Act passed Congress. The legislation that emerged from the committee in September 2009 formed the backbone of the eventual law.“But they’re going to hate the Republican version,” Baucus continued, “because it’s going to give much more benefits to the wealthy at the expense of others, and a lot of people are going to get hurt along the way.”If House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and the White House succeed in this gambit ― a far from certain prospect, given major schisms among Republican lawmakers about the bill ― the consequences would be significant. A law that extended coverage to 20 million previously uninsured people and reduced the national share of Americans without health coverage to its lowest-ever percentage would be throttled. Almost $1 trillion in money currently financing health benefits for low- and middle-income households would be diverted for tax cuts on the wealthy and health care companies.In the process, if the Affordable Care Act does not remain in place, 24 million more people would lack health coverage a decade from now, according to a Congressional Budget Office review of the legislation approved by three House committees this month.Older Americans, especially those with less income, would exit the health insurance market because they wouldn’t be able to afford policies, the CBO projected. States would lose $880 billion in Medicaid funding, forcing cutbacks to that program. House leaders have made changes to the bill since that analysis, but do not have a new CBO score yet.“We’re in a very tough spot, and it’s sad. It really is very sad. But what do we do about it? People who care about all this have to just keep presenting the facts,” Baucus said.And the Democratic Party’s decades-long mission to strengthen the social safety net, dating back to President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, would suffer a major setback.“It really comes down to an attitude. We Americans have to ask ourselves: Are we in this together or are we not?” asked Baucus, who served six terms in the Senate before becoming Obama’s ambassador to China from 2014 until Trump’s inauguration.“The Republican bill answers that question by saying, no, we’re not in this together, that insurance is really available for those who can afford it and is not really as available for those who can’t afford it. The sort of underlying basis of the ACA was: We’re in this together, we’re all Americans,” Baucus said.Kathleen Sebelius, who served as Obama’s secretary of health and human services from 2009 to 2014, is worried about the people she’s encountered who would be worse off under the House Republican bill.“I am really troubled to my soul and very disturbed about what is going to happen to the people I meet on a still-regular basis who tell me about their family situation, about their stories, about their worries that ― whether it’s themselves or their children or their parents who finally have some health security, who finally have a sense that they can count on affordable health coverage ― now this is going to be swept away,” Sebelius said. “I find it extraordinarily troubling that individuals are rushing to take away people’s health care, to shift costs onto people who are in difficult medical situations,” Sebelius said. “It’s hard to see who the beneficiaries are.”Beyond the human cost, those who spent all of 2009 and one-quarter of 2010 writing the Affordable Care Act in Congress see a deep irony in GOP leaders’ rush to pass their repeal and “replace” bill within three months of Trump taking office. “We spent more time going through the particulars of any bill in all of my years here,” said Rep. Sandy Levin (D-Mich.), who’s serving his 18th term in the House. Levin chaired the Ways and Means Committee during the final months of the Affordable Care Act debate in 2010.When Baucus and other key lawmakers wrote their legislation, they held dozens of hearings and spent many days marking up and amending the bill in committee. By contrast, two House committees approved the Republican bill without a Congressional Budget Office analysis of its impact.“It makes me very irritated, and it’s sad, because we were open, we Democrats were,” Baucus said. Accusations that Democrats rushed their bill by lawmakers who are now doing just that are adding “insult to injury,” he said.The Finance Committee approved its version of the Affordable Care Act after eight days of debate, some of which stretched into the night. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee spent even longer on the bill in June and July 2009.The Finance Committee action came after Baucus ― with the Obama White House’s support ― spent months courting Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Mike Enzi (Wyo.) and Olympia Snowe (Maine). In the end, all he got was Snowe’s vote in committee, before she opposed it on the floor two months later. “As we were starting to put it together, regrettably, it became partisan. You just feel it falling away at the very end,” Baucus said. “Republicans saw a major political opportunity to try to demonize Obama, demonize the Democrats and all vote against it. And they’ve been demonizing the ACA every since.”Even the lengthy committee work in 2009 understates the groundwork Democrats laid in Congress before Obama took office. “For two years, we worked on this. Worked very hard. Had all kinds of groups and subgroups. It was all nonpartisan. We all worked together,” Baucus said.In 2007 and 2008, Baucus convened 14 hearings on health reform, plus eight more in 2009. Eight days after Obama won the 2008 presidential election, Baucus released a 98-page white paper laying out options for health care legislation. Before the election was even over, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), dying from a brain tumor, and his staff convened meetings with a wide array of interest groups that would be affected by health care reform.The contrast with today’s proceedings is stark. At present, the Senate isn’t even planning committee action on the House bill and will take it directly to the floor if it passes the lower chamber.“There is this sort of beat-the-clock mentality of ‘We have to fulfill campaign promises at any cost’ [that is] is very, very troubling in an area where there are real life and death consequences,” Sebelius said.Levin is the last person who chaired a committee that passed a version of the Affordable Care Act who’s still in Congress, so he’s seeing all this firsthand. He still serves on the Ways and Means Committee and participated in its markup of the Republican health bill that went until 4:30 a.m.Levin shares Baucus’ frustration about the alternative history told by Republicans opposed to the Affordable Care Act. As a sitting member of Congress, however, he is “absolutely determined” to use his position to push back, directly and in concert with voters and allied interests. “We’re in battle trim,” he said.“What we need to do is to battle them here, but to combine resources, to coordinate, to organize,” Levin said. “What we need is just a massive outpouring. The people, I think, will speak and we need to help them speak out, to provide more and more opportunities and to organize.”"
19,POLITICS,A Lot Of Lobbyists Are Holding Their Annual Events In Trump Properties,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-conflict-of-interest_us_58d17065e4b00705db5360ba,"Some of the groups say their events were planned years ago, but even the appearance of conflicts of interest can pose problems.",2017-03-21,President Donald Trump with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe golfing at the president's Trump National Doral course.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d174602c00002000fef9cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The American Land Title Association, the main lobbying arm of the title insurance industry, will host 1,000 members at its annual gathering this October, which will be held at the Trump National Doral golf course and resort in southern Florida.The annual event, known as ALTA One, provides members with the “opportunity to network and build relationships with colleagues,” according to an invite for the event. It will also allow an organization actively lobbying President Donald Trump’s administration to put money in the president’s pocket.When Trump took office, he decided to maintain ownership of the multibillion-dollar Trump Organization while transferring management responsibility to his two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric. By not fully separating himself from his business and its profits, he opened himself up to numerous conflicts of interest, both real and potential. That the president’s many properties routinely play host to the conferences and conventions of the groups now seeking to influence his policy decisions is one of them.“It’s a problem,” said Larry Noble, an ethics and campaign finance law expert at the Campaign Legal Center. “The appearance is that they may be seeking favor with the White House by supporting the president’s properties.”The title insurance industry is indeed looking to influence executive branch actions in lobbying for relief from regulations under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Specifically, the industry has lobbied for legislation to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, seeking to turn it into an independent commission with a board of commissioners that both Republicans and Democrats would appoint. The bureau imposed new disclosure rules on the industry in 2016.Trump has promised to dismantle the Dodd-Frank law. “We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank,” he said in a Feb. 3 meeting with Wall Street CEOs. But Trump has not yet said what he plans to do with the CFPB. Some congressional Republicans continue to push legislation ALTA has previously supported that would turn the bureau into an independent commission. Another group is calling on Trump to fire CFPB head Richard Cordray and replace him with someone more friendly to the industries the bureau regulates.ALTA’s October meeting is just one example of a Trump-owned property playing host to a lobbying organization. The National Confectioners Association, the candy industry’s lobby arm, hosted its annual meeting at Trump’s Doral property in the first week of March. The confectioners have also scheduled their next two Washington lobbying events at the Trump hotel, slated for September 2017 and 2018. According to the Washington Post, the candy lobby group wants the president and Congress to end sugar subsidies, which the industry says drive up the cost of candy production.Members of the Metals Service Center Institute, an advocacy group for the industrial metal supply industry, will be descending on Doral on May 7 and 8. The Metals Service Center Institute has been outspoken in supporting Trump’s decision to restart construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, which the Obama administration had blocked after nationwide protests. The group has also endorsed Trump’s trade policies, his push to repeal and replace Obamacare and his appointment of Robert Lighthizer as the U.S. trade representative, who the industry believes will be tough on China’s alleged trade law violations.“I’m more hopeful today than I have been in a long time,” M. Robert Weidner, president and CEO of the Metals Service Center Institute, said in a statement when Trump was inaugurated. Weidner added: “We are pleased with the agenda the new president outlined today—specifically when it comes to protecting American jobs and American industry and rebuilding our infrastructure—and look forward to working with him and the entire Trump administration so that we can return growth to the industrial metals sector, and the U.S. economy as a whole.”The Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., will also play host to the 36th Annual Conference on U.S.-Turkish Relations this May. The American-Turkish Council and the Turkey-U.S. Business Council are hosting the three-day event, which the Daily Caller first reported. The chairman of the latter group is Ekim Alptekin, the Turkish businessman who hired former national security adviser Michael Flynn to run a public relations campaign against exiled cleric Fetullah Gulen, a man the Turkish government wants the U.S. to extradite for his alleged role in a 2016 coup attempt.The American-Turkish Council and the Turkey-U.S. Business Council both work to increase bilateral trade between the U.S. and Turkey. Their annual event routinely features high-level administration officials. In 2016, featured speakers from the Obama administration included energy secretary Ernest Moniz, trade representative Michael Froman and deputy secretary of state Tony Blinken. This year, Trump administration officials will appear at an event that is directly profiting the president.Most of these events were planned well before Trump became president or even launched his campaign. The confectioners lobby group told The Washington Post that it selected the venues in 2014 and 2015. The title insurance industry group told The Huffington Post that it booked its event at Trump National Doral “three years ago.”“Decisions on where to hold ALTA events are driven by cost, rotating geography for our membership, comparative value to other options and how the facility performed if they previously hosted an event of ours,” Jeremy Yohe, vice president of communications for ALTA, said in an email.Noble acknowledged that these trade groups probably did plan these events far ahead of time, but that they still pose “a real appearance problem.”While lobbying groups may get a pass for now, their future choices will receive closer scrutiny.“Next year there’ll be fewer excuses for this,” Noble said."
20,POLITICS,Neil Gorsuch Defends His Record Of Ruling For 'The Little Guy',Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neil-gorsuch-workers-rights_us_58d1546be4b0ec9d29dfac45,Democrats pressed Trump's Supreme Court pick on his pattern of siding with employers over workers.,2017-03-21,Democrats tried to put Neil Gorsuch on the defensive for his record of siding with corporations over ordinary people.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d158b12c00002100fef929.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch has come across as smooth and unflappable in his confirmation hearings this week, but he did show flashes of defensiveness on Tuesday when he was pressed on one point: his record on upholding workers’ rights.Gorsuch is a former corporate law firm attorney and currently a judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, where he has built a record of siding with employers in workers’ rights cases. One of his former law students has also alleged that he told his class that female job applicants manipulate companies to extract maternity benefits. (Another one of Gorsuch’s students refuted that account.)Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the committee, asked Gorsuch how people can trust that he would look out for the “little guy” in cases involving workers who sue employers.“I’m just looking for something that would indicate that you would give a worker a fair shot,” she said. “Maybe it’s in your background somewhere that I don’t know about.”Feinstein’s questions were part of a broader Democratic effort to paint Gorsuch as a judge who protects corporations at the expense of regular people. Last week, Democrats held a press conference with people who said they’ve been hurt by Gorsuch’s rulings, including Alphonse Maddin, a TransAm Trucking driver who got fired for unhitching his trailer and driving away to seek warmth when his truck’s brakes seized up on a freezing night in Illinois. When Maddin sued, claiming he was unlawfully fired because his life was at risk as he waited hours for help that never came, Gorsuch ruled against him.Gorsuch took issue with Democrats focusing on cases like Maddin’s.“I know a case or two has been mentioned yesterday,” he told Feinstein. “Respectfully, I’d suggest that does not represent the body of my work. I’ve participated in 2,700 opinions over 10 and a half years. If you want cases where I’ve ruled for ‘the little guy’ as well as ‘the big guy,’ there are plenty of them, senator.”When Feinstein asked if he could submit examples, Gorsuch replied, “Oh goodness! I’ll name a bunch right now.”He listed a few cases, including a 1990 lawsuit involving Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant in which he’d ruled in favor of people who had been subjected to uranium pollution by large companies in Colorado, and Orr v. the City of Albuquerque, which involved pregnancy discrimination in a police department.“The bottom line ... I’d like to convey to you, from the bottom of my heart,” Gorsuch added, with a somewhat dramatic pause, “is that I’m a fair judge.”Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) could not get over how “absurd” it seemed that Maddin had to choose between possibly freezing to death and getting fired ― and that Gorsuch ruled that TransAm had a right to fire Maddin in that scenario. He tried, unsuccessfully, to get Gorsuch to say what choice he would have made if he were in Maddin’s shoes that night.“I had a career in identifying absurdity. I know it when I see it,” Franken said. “It makes me question your judgment.”Meanwhile, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) raised concerns about the way Gorsuch became Trump’s Supreme Court nominee: Two conservative groups, the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation, recommended him to the president.“It appears the president outsourced your selection to far-right big money special interest groups,” Leahy said. “You might not like that terminology, but even Republican senators have praised the fact that the president had gone to this group.”He asked Gorsuch if he believes the drafters of the First Amendment intended for it to cover corporate money being funneled into political campaigns, a reference to the Citizens United v. FEC decision that has blown open the doors to money influencing elections.“Different justices came to different conclusions,” Gorsuch said. “Nothing about corporate money?” Leahy asked again, rhetorically, about an instance of those words appearing in the Constitution.“I don’t remember that term,” Gorsuch replied.“Trust me,” Leahy said. “There wasn’t.”This story has been updated to include Franken’s comments."

But a new stunning spread in Allure proves we still have a long way to go when it comes to true inclusion. Meghan Markle, Eva Longoria and Padma Lakshmi are just three of the 41 women of color profiled for the glossy’s stunning April cover story, celebrating beauty and diversity. Actresses, journalists, models and doctors shared anecdotes and realities of their complicated relationships with their skin, their bodies and the industries they work in. For many, the memories are distant. For some people, such as former model and fashion activist Bethann Hardison, they are still pretty fresh. Hardison hosted a town hall meeting in 2007 with various members of the fashion industry. She explained to Allure that during the event, she “sat in front of them and talked about what I thought was inappropriate behavior.” At that point, she said, models of color “were being told, ‘sorry no blacks, no ethnics’” at castings.Hardison, who said the event sparked articles and a shift in the conversation, added that the phrase “has never been said again.”There is no denying that things have improved in 10 years since that meeting, but these issues still arise today. Take this season’s Lanvin show, for example. The fashion house came under fire when casting director James Scully claimed he heard “from several agents, some of whom are black, that they have received mandate from Lanvin that they do not want to be presented with women of color.”It’s so important for magazines like Allure to represent a broad range of women with uniquely beautiful skin tones, shapes, sizes and ages. And it’s equally important for us to hear stories like these. They serve as a constant reminder that there is always more work to be done toward inclusion.Head to Allure to see the entire spread. "
24,POLITICS,Virginia GOP Demands State Attorney General's Apology For Mosque Visit,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virginia-gop-mosque-apology_us_58d15af1e4b0be71dcf872d4,"Though members of the party have visited mosques before, the GOP now seems to distrust any engagement with Muslims.",2017-03-21,"""I’m here to defend and protect the rights and civil liberties of all Virginians, including minority communities, no matter what you look like, what your background is,"" Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring told attendees at the Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center on March 17.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d16efd1400002000070bbe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Republican Party of Virginia is attacking the state’s Democratic attorney general, Mark Herring, for visiting one of the U.S.’s largest mosques to talk about President Donald Trump’s Muslim ban.“On March 17, Mark Herring joined with a Hamas-linked group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, to host a town hall to oppose the Trump Administration’s efforts to keep Americans safe from terrorism,” reads a petition on the state Republican Party’s website that appears designed to collect emails. “Sign our petition to demand that Mark Herring apologize to the victims of Islamic terrorism.”The message’s characterization of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a major Muslim civil society organization, as an affiliate of the Palestinian terror group Hamas echoes a theory that is popular in the right-wing media and Islamophobic circles but has never been proven.And the party’s description of the mosque where the event was held ― the Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia ― mentions former attendees who have been linked to terror, but makes no reference to the center’s outreach to the FBI, including hosting a top FBI official at the mosque in January. It also doesn’t mention the harassment, including a fake bomb threat and offensive messages, the community there has experienced in recent months.From the White House on down, Islamophobic rhetoric and actions are on the rise nationally. An FBI report released in November 2016 noted a 67 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes between 2014 and 2015.In Virginia, an increasingly purple state that twice voted for President Barack Obama and chose Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Trump, Republicans have tried to differentiate themselves from an increasingly anti-Muslim national GOP.Former Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.) has visited the mosque at the center of the controversy, and in December, the current chair of the state GOP, John Whitbeck, visited a different mosque in Sterling, Virginia.“The Virginia Republican Party is the party of religious liberty. We don’t support banning Muslims in the United States of America,” Whitbeck said at the time.Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), a lawmaker from a swing district Democrats are hoping to pick up in 2018, also attended the Sterling mosque event. She called Trump’s 2015 proposal to ban Muslim entry to the U.S. “not constitutional” and said she believed the president had changed his mind.Yet the party’s message about Herring suggests that it sees any engagement with Muslims as unacceptable and insulting to those who have experienced Islam-linked terror. “Stop pandering to terrorist sympathizers,” the appeal reads, conveniently ignoring the fact that Muslims in the U.S. and abroad are frequently victims of terror themselves.The GOP message reflects the increasingly extreme discourse and political polarization of the Trump era. Muslims’ place in American society is now a major issue of national debate, rather than something that’s largely accepted.A similar trend has emerged in Europe, with the rise of hyper-nationalist and often anti-Muslim parties. Once-extreme ideas like a Muslim ban or closing all mosques are now part of the political conversation, and politicians trying not to look weak are beginning to adopt more nativist and authoritarian talking points.“Under the cover of fighting off the ‘populists,’ the political establishment is slowly but steadily hollowing out the liberal democratic system,” Cas Mudde, a University of Georgia professor who studies European politics, argued in a March 20 op-ed.Robert McCaw, the government affairs director for CAIR and a speaker at the March 17 event, slammed the Virginia GOP’s petition. He said the mosque event offered more than 200 attendees a message of reassurance about their place in the U.S.“It’s not Herring [who] needs to apologize. It’s the state Republican party for engaging in this smear,” McCaw said. “It endangers Muslims when you have a state party smear an entire faith community in their house of worship. What type of signal is this sending, and on whose ears will it fall?”Colin Christopher, the deputy director of government affairs for Dar al-Hijrah, contacted HuffPost Tuesday night to say the congregation saw the GOP message as a sign of the party’s shift toward what he called “extremism.”“Instead of talking about the economic challenges our country faces, the party instead chose to try and criminalize an entire community that was hosting a citizenship application clinic and know-your-rights event with the highest law enforcement official in the State of Virginia,” Christopher said. The center is used to fear-mongering, he added. “If anyone wants to understand who Dar al-Hijrah is, what we do, they have to go no further than to talk to members of Congress, to local elected officials, to every single rabbi, priest and other religious leader in Fairfax County and Arlington County and they’ll get the story,” Christopher said. “We’re not threatened by this kind of language. It just shows the character of the Republican Party.”Herring’s team responded Tuesday night as well.“While Attorney General Herring is actively working to reassure Virginia Muslims and other minority communities that they are safe and welcome, the [Republican Party of Virginia] is sending dangerous messages that only embolden those who want to harm or harass Muslims here in our communities,” communications director Michael Kelly said in an email. “I’ll go ahead and extend an open, standing invitation to anyone from the RPV or any Republican elected official or candidate to join us the next time Attorney General Herring visits a Virginia mosque and they can tell their fellow Virginians to their face how they’re ‘terrorist sympathizers.’”Herring is one of several state attorneys general challenging Trump’s ban.“I’m here to defend and protect the rights and civil liberties of all Virginians, including minority communities, no matter what you look like, what your background is,” Herring told attendees at the March 17 event.John Findlay, the executive director of the Virginia GOP, told HuffPost his party was troubled by the specific mosque Herring spoke at, not by the general idea of political appearances at mosques.He also condemned CAIR, saying he was certain the civil society organization had links to Hamas. As proof, he emailed a link to a National Review story that cited a decision by the United Arab Emirates to designate CAIR a terror group. (Experts say the UAE action had more to do with suppressing civil society than a true terror threat, but anti-Muslim figures in the U.S. have cheered that government’s repression.) Findlay said he could not imagine the GOP engaging with CAIR.“We didn’t smear an entire faith community in any way, shape or form,” Findlay said. “We were commenting on Mark Herring’s appearance at this mosque that has been linked to multiple terrorists.”The visit by Davis, the former Republican lawmaker, was different because he had already left office, Findlay said. Asked whether he thought it was appropriate for the FBI to attend an event there this past January, he replied, “Oh, man ... when did they?”Findlay then said the bureau’s decision was different because FBI employees were not politicians. Asked again, he said he did not want to comment on the matter.This story has been updated to include comment from John Findlay, Herring’s office and Dar al-Hijrah."
25,POLITICS,Even Some GOP Governors Hate Donald Trump's Budget,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-gop-governors_us_58d17897e4b0ec9d29e00c1f,Several governors of the president's own party have big problems with his proposed spending plan.,2017-03-21,President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence meet with U.S. Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.) and members of the Republican Study Committee about his proposed budget at the White House in Washington on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d17bad1d0000cf3b7cfa9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s standard-Republican, program-slashing proposed budget has found some critics in seemingly unlikely places: governor’s mansions in Republican-run states around the country.Massachusetts’ Charlie Baker is alarmed by cuts to the National Institutes of Health as well as the elimination of subsidies for poor people to buy heating fuel. Wisconsin’s Scott Walker doesn’t like cuts to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Mississippi’s Phil Bryant has been working to add Amtrak routes in his state, while Trump’s budget could result in his state losing service entirely.Trump’s White House, in other words, is learning the inherent difficulty in translating easy campaign slogans into actual cuts to services, even in states with governors of his own party.“They have very different responsibilities,” said Stan Collender, a longtime staffer to the congressional budget committees and now a communications consultant. “One proposes. The others actually have to govern.”Trump’s budget chief explained that he simply translated what Trump had said he wanted to do over the course of the previous year and a half running for president.“We wrote it using the president’s own words,” said Mick Mulvaney, who had been a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus prior to his appointment to run the Office of Management and Budget. “We went through his speeches. We went through articles that have been written about his policies. We talked to him. We wanted to know what his policies were. We turned those policies into numbers.”In practice, that meant that Trump’s desire to increase defense spending by $54 billion without increasing the deficit meant cutting that same amount of money from the non-defense portion of the budget. And that resulted in enormous proposed reductions for dozens of programs, from foreign aid in the State Department budget, to the National Endowment for the Arts, to housing grants in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.The Environmental Protection Agency would see its budget cut by nearly a third, including the end of federal funding to projects for cleaning up the Great Lakes ― whose shores include the Republican-run states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio ― and the Chesapeake Bay, largely bounded by Republican-run Maryland.All four of those governors oppose those cuts.Walker has said he’ll lobby Trump and congressional Republicans to “protect funding that’s prudent.”Anna Heaton, a spokeswoman for Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, said: “There is strong support in Congress for important programs that help maintain the Great Lakes and foster economic development. We will continue to work with our congressional delegation on matters that are of importance to Michigan.”John Weaver, a Republican consultant who had run Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s presidential campaign last year, was less diplomatic about Trump: “He campaigned irresponsibly, and now he’s governing irresponsibly.”Kasich is among a number of Republican governors uneasy about the push to ram through a repeal of the Affordable Care Act by Trump and congressional Republicans, potentially costing their states many billions of dollars of health care for their poorer residents.“I’ve said that I don’t want to see anybody have the rug pulled out from underneath them, and that’s what I’m going to be advocating,” Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey told reporters earlier this month.Thomas Mann, with the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, said he’s not terribly surprised by the pushback from the Republican chief executives, particularly when Medicaid money is involved.“Governors, even ideological ones, have to be concerned about the overall health of their states,” he said, pointing out that a large percentage of Medicaid money goes toward the elderly poor. “It’s a good way of emptying out all the publicly supported nursing homes in those states.”Mann said Trump’s budget proposal appears to have been drafted with little regard for how it would affect actual people. “It’s so preposterous. It’s so extreme. It touches on so many lives of people, and therefore, so many commitments of members of Congress,” he said, adding that he doubted the plan had much chance of actually passing.Collender said the recklessness of Trump’s plan makes it stand out from previous presidents’ budgets. “There probably hasn’t been a budget in 10 years that hasn’t been declared dead on arrival,” he said, but added that usually that declaration comes only from members of the other party.Collender said Trump’s plan seems designed more to let him say he pushed the budget he said he would, rather than actually getting it enacted. “All presidential budgets are part accounting documents and part political statement. This one is all political statement,” he said. “At worst it’s probably just a campaign document.”"

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chair of the House Freedom Caucus does not expect a visit from the president to change conservatives' minds.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d0981f140000200007097e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As House Republicans scramble for votes on their health care overhaul, GOP leaders are betting that a visit from President Donald Trump on Tuesday will help close the deal on the legislation ― and House Freedom Caucus leaders are swearing it will not.Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) emerged from the group’s weekly meeting late Monday night to tell reporters he was confident House leaders did not have the votes to pass their Affordable Care Act rewrite and that, even with pressure from Trump, conservatives would not waver.“This is not a decision made on personalities,” Meadows said. “It’s made on policy.”Meadows said that, without the changes the Freedom Caucus has demanded, it would be “very difficult, if not impossible” for leaders to find the votes to pass their health care bill.“This is a defining moment for our nation, but it’s also a defining moment for the Freedom Caucus,” Meadows said.While Meadows was cagey about an exact whip count ― as well as whether some members of the group might waver if Trump applied all the pressure at his disposal ― other Freedom Caucus members were confident that conservatives controlled their own destiny.Reporters staking out the Freedom Caucus meeting Monday night couldn’t help but notice that the group of nearly 40 conservatives had not taken an official position against the Republican legislation, a potential signal that the caucus was split and opposition might not be as monolithic as some members wanted to present. But members assured reporters that leaders didn’t have the votes.“We took a position weeks ago. Our position has not changed,” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said.“They don’t have the votes to pass it,” Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) said.Asked if there were enough members opposed in the Freedom Caucus alone to sink the bill ― meaning there were at least 21 in the group who would vote against the bill ― Amash said that was “absolutely” the case.“And there are others outside of the Freedom Caucus not voting for it as well,” Amash added.GOP leaders made their own moves late Monday night, releasing a manager’s amendment that would assuage some concerns of less hard-line conservatives and GOP moderates. Republican leaders, as promised, added language for the optional block-granting of Medicaid, as well as optional Medicaid work requirements. At the same time, in a nod to moderates, the amendment would add funding to help individuals with high health care costs, though it does not explicitly detail how much money would go to that endeavor and is indecipherable from the legislative language.A section-by-section analysis from one of the committees with jurisdiction over the legislation says the amendment “would provide the financing for additional support for those with high health care costs before the bill goes to the Senate.” In effect, Republicans are saying the House has to pass the bill to find out what exactly is in it.Republicans also added language to win over reluctant New York Republicans. The language ― which we’re referring to as The Buffalo Buyout ― would prevent New York from requiring rural counties to kick in to cover Medicaid costs.The late backroom changes and deal sweeteners undermine Speaker Paul Ryan’s promise of an open legislative process, but even with the slapdash lawmaking, leaders continue to project confidence with regard to the bill. Late Monday, on Fox News, Speaker Ryan (R-Wis.) once again expressed confidence that Republicans would pass their health care legislation this week, and leaders are hopeful that Trump’s appearance before House Republicans Tuesday morning will push them over the top.But without the coverage changes to lower premiums that Freedom Caucus members have been demanding, conservatives think the legislation is doomed.Asked what would happen Monday night if leadership didn’t make the changes they wanted, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) simply said, “That means that the bill is going to fail.”And was Labrador confident of that?“I’m confident of that. Yes.”"
27,MEDIA,Trump’s Plan To Cut Public Broadcasting Funds Could Most Hurt Those Who Voted For Him,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-public-broadcasting-cuts_us_58d04203e4b00705db51ef30,"“We would have to turn the lights out,” says one TV manager in Oklahoma. “A travesty and a tragedy,” says another in Tennessee.",2017-03-21,"""Sesame Street"" characters Telly Monster, Abby Cadabby and Rosita visit ""Sway in the Morning"" with Sway Calloway at SiriusXM Studios in New York City on Jan. 10. President Donald Trump has proposed budget cuts that would affect PBS, which airs the children's show. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d19b061400008806070c8b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s proposal to slash funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting wouldn’t threaten to reduce programming at RSU, a public television station in rural Oklahoma. It would end it. “If the cuts go through with the CPB, my station would no longer exist,” station manager Royal Allis told The Huffington Post. “We would have to turn the lights out.”Republicans lawmakers have tried for decades to eliminate funding for the 50-year-old CPB, even though the $445 million it’s allocated each year accounts for just 0.01 percent of the federal budget. The attacks on public broadcasting have long been tied to politics, as some critics perceive outlets like NPR and PBS as having a liberal slant.And yet the Americans likely to be hit hardest by the proposed cuts live in deep red, rural parts of the country that overwhelmingly voted for Trump. NPR and PBS would both be adversely affected by cuts. Those national organizations receive some funding directly from the CPB, and local stations around the country may license NPR and PBS programs using money from the federal government. More than 90 percent of CPB funding goes to local stations around the country, The Washington Post reported last week ― and dozens of them rely on this money to make up more than 40 percent of their budgets.Trump won more than 75 percent of the vote in Rogers County, Oklahoma, where RSU is located and broadcasts to around 1.2 million homes. The station is tied to Rogers State University in the northeastern part of the state and employs 10 part-time student workers in addition to a dozen full-time employees, according to Allis. The school doesn’t have a journalism department, so Allis said the station serves as a lab for students. Shuttering the station “would be devastating to students who want to get that hands-on training,” he added.“What we do for our community, and how we promote our community, and how we effect our community ― all of that would go away,” Allis said.  Other nationwide leaders in public media echoed that sentiment, emphasizing that their stations serve an important role in their communities ― and that larger state outlets, and certainly national ones, likely couldn’t become substitutes. “For the people of our rural region, it’s a matter of pride to see their county fair, or their parade, or their neighbors talking about serving in World War II,” said Becky Magura, president and CEO of WCTE.The rural eastern Tennessee station is the only one within a 75-mile radius, she said. It has produced Americana music shows, like “Bluegrass Underground,” which now enjoy a national following. WCTE also assists in local initiatives regarding education, adult literacy and workplace development, Magura said.Magura, a lifelong resident of the area who has worked at the station for 35 years, said eliminating funding for public broadcasting would be “a travesty and a tragedy.” Several stations around the country are encouraging members of their communities to sign an online petition ― Protect My Public Media ― in hopes of influencing lawmakers in Washington. One of them is WLJT, located in a rural west Tennessee country where Trump received 74 percent of the vote. “If federal funding is cut, WLJT ― like most small stations ― will find it very difficult to replace that funding,” Monica Reese, the station’s general manager and CEO, said in an email to The Huffington Post. “WLJT’s viewers are typically low to middle income ― relying, in many cases, on over the air television programming rather than cable or satellite,” Reese said. “The majority of our schools are Title I and the students are in need of additional learning resources that WLJT provides through programming, outreach services, free books and other resources.”Richard Hise, general manager of Allegheny Mountain Radio, which serves three Trump-supporting counties in West Virginia and Virginia, said his stations “are often the only source of news, entertainment and emergency broadcast services available” in their communities. Whenever budget cuts are mentioned that could potentially slash funding to public media, educational programming such as “Sesame Street” is always a topic of concern.Trump’s proposed budget wouldn’t lead to Big Bird actually losing his nest on “Sesame Street” because the long-running children’s show is now produced by HBO, with episodes airing nine months later on PBS stations. But if kids who don’t have cable subscriptions or reliable broadband access also lose access public to television over the airwaves, there’s a risk they wouldn’t be able to watch the show or similar programs. “If he could see the impact public media has on the people who believe in him and support him, he’d know it’s not something that should be cut,” she said. “It’s something that should be valued and protected.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

28,HEALTHY LIVING,Climate Change Could Lead To An Uptick In Type-2 Diabetes,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-diabetes_us_58d15a56e4b00705db532117,Yet another way global warming poses a risk to health.,2017-03-21,The association between mean annual temperature and diabetes incidence in the United States over the period 1996–2009.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d15bf61400002000070b58.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Global warming already widens the footprint of Lyme disease while Zika virus exacerbates asthma and lung diseases and increases the risks posed by violent weather and wildfires.Now, new research suggests rising temperatures lead to a surge in diagnoses of type-2 diabetes.The study, published Monday in the BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care, compared annual average temperatures across the United States from 1996 to 2009 with reported new cases of type-2 diabetes. The disease, which typically develops later in life, prevents the body from absorbing glucose needed to produce energy. In particularly hot years, the number of new diagnoses spiked.“When it gets warmer, there is higher incidence of diabetes,” Lisanne Blauw, the study’s co-author and a PhD candidate at the Netherlands-based Einthoven Laboratory, told The Huffington Post by phone on Tuesday. “It’s important to realize global warming has further effects on our health, not only on the climate.” Blauw and six other researchers from the Leiden University Medical Center and Delft University of Technology ― both in the Netherlands ― used data from 14 years of surveys by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They capped the dataset at 2009, the year the CDC began including emails and mobile phones in its survey. The statistical models accounted for the passage of time and adjusted for age and seasonal temperatures changes. The study excluded Illinois, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, because data from those places was incomplete or unavailable, Blauw said.The idea for the study came in 2015, when a separate team of Dutch researchers found a connection between temperature, insulin production and brown adipose tissue, the fat cells that burn energy and produce heat. (White fat cells, by contrast, store calories.) The research concluded that type-2 diabetics placed in temperatures around 50 degrees Fahrenheit produced more insulin. “On the basis of that study, we thought maybe it’d be interesting to see the association between outer temperature and instances of diabetes,” Blauw said, but warned that her research could not make conclusions about brown fat. “The question that automatically comes up with this study is: Why is there an association? Why is there a relation between temperature and diabetes?”She has some hypotheses. Temperature changes could alter the cellular activity of brown fat, people could exercise less in hotter years or diets could change change. It could be all of the above. Next, Blauw said she plans to apply her findings to study smaller populations, such as the Netherlands or the United Kingdom, and new ways to activate brown fat, including through medications. Last year was the hottest year on record, according to analyses by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, one of the primary causes of global warming, increased at its fastest pace on record last year, too. Humanity is on pace this century to produce enough greenhouse gases, which trap heat and warm the planet, to send global temperatures soaring past the 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels that scientists say marks the point of no return, after which violent weather, surging sea levels, drought and environmental destruction become irreversible.The Paris Agreement, the historic climate deal signed by 195 countries last year, aims to gradually slash emissions over the next several decades in hopes of avoiding the imminent nightmare scenario. But the accord could be in jeopardy as President Donald Trump moves to shred U.S. policies for cutting emissions, increase fossil fuel use and defund programs that help poorer countries, which depend on coal and oil to lift their people out of poverty and to develop zero-emissions energy infrastructure.“Well,” Blauw said, reiterating her findings, “more diabetes cases will likely happen when the temperature of the year is higher.”"

His needs are immense, as are the bills, for him and the hundreds of thousands like him. If you pay taxes, you have made it possible to give him a critical chunk of what he and his fellow sufferers desperately need.If you resent that a bit of your tax dollar goes toward helping guys and gals like Ben – people with special needs who will require an intensive level of care and support for their entire lives – we still appreciate it. Count your blessings that your family has never needed such huge help. It can be managed out of pocket by not the “1 percent,” but maybe the top tenth of the 1 percent.We never take it for granted.At the same time, to the millions who are assisted by things like Obamacare – you are, sincerely, very welcome.My family is lucky that I have a job with excellent health insurance. We get little if anything out of Obamacare at this point, but a bit of our tax dollar goes to it, whether we mind or not.We don’t. Maybe Ben’s needs have sensitized us a little to the needs of others, but I’ve never had a problem with the idea of our country helping its huddled masses. Does that make me a socialist? Whatever.Our personal category of huddled masses are Ben and his cohorts, and one critical piece of his life (and please bear with me for a wonk-ish few moments) comes courtesy of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The most significant provision of IDEA is known by the acronym, FAPE, for Free and Appropriate Public Education. It is the most significant provision of IDEA, a federal government guarantee requiring state and local government to educate people like Ben.Legally, it is a right, established in 1973, 20 years before Ben was born. Thank goodness.FAPE assures (or should assure) the “provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that are designed to meet individual needs of handicapped persons,” and guarantees an “educational program that is individualized to a specific child, designed to meet that child’s unique needs.”But there is wiggle room, and how much wiggling is something that has played out in court. The tastiest word to someone (like a judge) seeking a way out of providing what it was designed to provide, is the “A” of FAPE:“Appropriate.”The Supreme Court ruled that “appropriate” does not mean the best education that money can buy.But how many publicly educated kids without disabilities in the U.S. get that, anyway? Money is limited, and “appropriate” has been, if not always great, good enough as a guarantee. The gap from best to worst is wide, but the goal is a heck of a lot better than the bare minimum as a standard.People like Ben are more expensive. Specialized training, smaller class sizes, one-on-one aides ― the list of needs is, yes, special, and they don’t come cheap. But Ben and his peers are some of the most vulnerable members of our society.So how do you define “appropriate”?Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, defines “appropriate” as just barely above the minimum.Literally.As the Huffington Post headline put it: “Neil Gorsuch Relied On A Legal Standard That Weakens Promises To Kids With Disabilities: Now his would-be colleagues on the Supreme Court may toss aside that standard.”That legal standard is called “merely de minimis,” and it is what it sounds like, a bar lowered (nearly) as low as it can go, to the bare minimum ― a hair more than zilch.Merely de minimis – the “de” even gives it a ring of Chicagoese, as in “barely da minimum.” The Huffington Post describes it as “a phrase that could undercut protections for students with disabilities across the country” in reducing the “educational benefits those children are promised under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.”In 2008, as an appellate judge, Gorsuch was largely responsible for applying this (sub)standard.It’s pretty hard to view “merely de minimis“ as anything less than the denial of a civil right, unless the barest minimum is the standard that should apply to all the children of the United States of America.The case to which Gorsuch applied this medieval measure is called “Thompson R2-J School District v. Luke P., and what is so chilling to us personally is that Luke P. sounds a lot like Ben R. ― our boy.They shared grossly inappropriate, sometimes even violent behavior at home and in public places, horrible sleep problems, and volitional “toileting” issues that have nothing to do with a toilet but with floors and walls – to name just some of our families’ “challenges” (to use a barely “appropriate” word).It wasn’t Luke’s or Ben’s fault. It wasn’t our families’ fault.It is autism’s fault.And it is Gorsuch’s fault that Luke got screwed by the court system whose job it is to protect his rights and him.Ben was luckier than Luke, because our school district recognized that he needed the residential placement we were seeking. That Ben injured and sent his classroom aide to the ER during our decision-making meeting no doubt helped seal the deal.Luke and his family were less fortunate. Before Gorsuch got to them, a hearing officer, administrative judge and federal district judge ruled, in three separate decisions, that the school district needed to reimburse Luke’s parents for a private school placement.Along came Gorsuch from his Tenth District federal bench to lead the charge.Those three prior decisions? Reversed. The bill for providing, appropriately, young Luke’s needs? Send it to Mom and Dad.The school was helping Luke become more independent and less reliant on life-long services ― which also translates to being less expensive to society as an adult with special needs.Just like Ben. When he left our home for a residential program at age 12 (he’s now 23), Ben was a different person in many ways. He has grown into a more functional member of society, more able to adapt and interact, better able to express his needs and desires, more willing to be out in the world, be productive in a work setting, and enjoy his life and the people he shares it with.This would absolutely not have happened without a Free and Appropriate Public Education. FAPE steered his fate.Mine is not a minority opinion. If you are a person touched by a disability like, in our case, severe autism, I’m preaching to the choir. And among my fellow choristers are dozens of disability advocacy groups, more than a hundred civil and human rights organizations, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the National Education Association, which states that it is “incomprehensible that Judge Gorsuch has gone out of his way to impose extra legal barriers for students with disabilities rather than helping them to overcome obstacles. In his court decisions, Judge Gorsuch endorsed the lowest of expectations for students with disabilities, which allowed public schools to provide our highest-needs students with the bare minimum educational benefit. We should all be concerned by this troubling trend in Gorsuch’s record.”Gorsuch’s thinking is in line with our newly elected government. Cut-cut-cut funding for critical services (i.e. reduce taxes). Let the chips fall where they may (i.e. lower standards for the 99 percent, more money for the one percent). Let future generations ― and administrations ― pay down the road (i.e. for adults with special needs who are less independent and in worse shape and thus more expensive).Gorsuch is the guy President Trump wants to send to the Supremes and, to make matters worse, at the dawn of our new education era headed by Betsy DeVos.Talk about the potential for a perfect storm, from which millions of special needs children and their families will be looking for shelter.In the Age of Trump, where will they find it?~~~Want to resist Gorsuch?

It is critical to our shared efforts to counter terrorism.”He added that “gratuitously damaging” the nations’ alliance with lies without setting the “record straight would be a gift to our enemies they could only dream of.”Westmacott also wrote disdainfully about Trump’s “famous reluctance to admit mistakes.”Earlier this month, Trump doubled down on his claim that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower phones during the presidential campaign. White House press secretary Sean Spicer also accused British intelligence of tapping Trump’s calls at Obama’s behest.Spicer later cited an unsubstantiated report by a Fox News analyst that alleged Britain’s GCHQ — the U.K. equivalent of the National Security Agency — had colluded to obtain intelligence on Trump for the Obama administration. Fox News now says it cannot confirm the report.GCHQ issued a rare public statement slamming the accusation as “utterly ridiculous” and warned that it “should be ignored.” When questioned about the stunning accusation during a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday, Trump said Spicer was simply repeating a media report.“All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn’t make an opinion on it,” Trump said. “So you shouldn’t be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox.”Trump also said he and Merkel “had something in common,” apparently referring to leaks by Edward Snowden that the NSA had listened in on the chancellor’s calls in 2013.Trump hasn’t offered a shred of evidence backing up his wiretap claims.Asked Sunday if there was any information supporting Trump’s accusations, House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said on “Fox News Sunday”: “Was there a physical wiretap of Trump Tower? No, there never was.”The committee is holding a hearing on the issue Monday.Trump’s wiretapping accusation against the GCHQ may be a touchy point of contention on Tuesday when Britain’s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson meets with senior Trump aides in Washington, The Guardian reported."
31,HEALTHY LIVING,Majority Of Floridians Want To Maintain Or Expand Obamacare,Erin Schumaker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-obamacare-replacement-poll_us_58cd3d58e4b00705db4fe0c9,The GOP's health care plan is not playing well in the Sunshine State.,2017-03-20,"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) at a news conference on the American Health Care Act, the GOP plan to replace Obamacare, on March 7, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cff65514000088060706fc.jpeg?cache=YrYgGA9BTZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Floridians overwhelmingly voted Republican in the 2016 election, with 58 of 67 counties going to Donald Trump. But that doesn’t mean they’re in favor of Trump’s campaign promise to repeal Obamacare, otherwise known as the Affordable Care Act.A survey of 500 people by Florida Atlantic University recently found that nearly half of Floridians polled said they approve of the Affordable Care Act, compared to 39 percent who said they disapprove. What’s more, 14 percent said they’re happy with Obamacare as it is and 39 percent want to expand it, compared to 18 percent who want to repeal it and 29 percent who want to replace it with a GOP alternative. The poll was conducted online from March 10-13, and has a margin of error of +/- 4.3 percentage points.Those aren’t theoretical opinions. Florida relies heavily on the Affordable Care Act, boasting the highest enrollment of any state with 1.7 million sign-ups.“The majority of Floridians are not keen to the new health care proposals,” Monica Escaleras, director of the Business and Economics Polling Initiative at Florida Atlantic University, told The Huffington Post.While opinions on the Affordable Care Act split predictably along party lines, another key factor that affects how Floridians feel about health care is age. Respondents older than 75 were the strongest opponents to a Medicaid cut, with a full 94 percent opposing Medicaid reductions. The GOP plan to replace Obamacare includes a $880 billion cut in projected Medicaid spending over 10 years.Nearly 20 percent of Floridians were 65 years old or older as of 2015, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Under the Republican plan to replace Obamacare, premiums would increase for approximately 454,000 Floridians between the ages of 50 to 64 who currently receive Obamacare tax credits. The “age tax,” as the AARP called it, would also allow insurers to charge older payers up to five times as much as the youngest payers. Currently, under Obamacare, insurers can charge the oldest enrollees up to three times as much as the youngest.“Under the new proposals, many people will end up without health care insurance with costs [going] up,” Escaleras said. “Especially low-income minorities and low-income people in their 60s.”“I’m going to have a difficult time being able to afford this,” Chris MacLellan, a 60-year-old Florida resident, told the Orlando Sentinel. MacLellan started his own consulting business in his late 50s and relies on Obamacare.“And right now, I am dealing with atrial fibrillation and probably will need a pacemaker in five years. Where is all the money going to come from? I don’t know. It’s very scary,” MacLellan said.During an appearance on “Fox News Sunday” on March 19, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Republican leaders were working to address concerns about their plan to replace Obamacare. “We think we should be offering even more assistance [for older Americans] than the bill currently does,” he said. Republicans are still planning to bring the bill to a House vote on March 23.This reporting is brought to you by HuffPost’s health and science platform, The Scope.

32,POLITICS,Trump's DHS Rolls Out Public Shaming Campaign Against 'Sanctuary Cities',Elise Foley and Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-sanctuary-cities_us_58d006e7e4b0be71dcf69233,"Weekly reports accuse cities and counties of releasing dangerous individuals, even if some are just following court orders.",2017-03-20,"President Donald Trump has signed an executive order targeting so-called ""sanctuary cities.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d007251d0000f42c7cf5ce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Trump administration has begun publicly shaming so-called “sanctuary cities” in an attempt to get them to cooperate with deportation efforts. The Department of Homeland Security on Monday issued a report about jurisdictions that had declined “detainer requests,” or appeals to hold individuals solely to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with some of the crimes those people had been accused of committing. Such weekly reports are part of President Donald Trump’s executive order targeting jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with ICE in some way, and are seemingly meant to pressure these cities and counties into compliance.The report sends a clear message from the Trump administration: Local officials’ decisions are “potentially endangering Americans,” as the DHS put it in a statement. Publicly calling out jurisdictions that refuse to fully cooperate with ICE also fits into the president’s larger emphasis on cracking down on crimes by undocumented immigrants, which he made central to his campaign.“When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders, it undermines ICE’s ability to protect the public safety and carry out its mission,” acting ICE Director Thomas Homan said in a statement. “Our goal is to build cooperative, respectful relationships with our law enforcement partners. We will continue collaborating with them to help ensure that illegal aliens who may pose a threat to our communities are not released onto the streets to potentially harm individuals living within our communities.”ICE made 3,083 total requests to detain individuals between Jan. 28 and Feb. 3, according to the report. Jurisdictions declined in at least 206 instances. Travis County, Texas ― which encompasses the city of Austin ― began to implement its “sanctuary” policies on Feb. 1 and accounted for about two-thirds of these denials to detain immigrants. Maj. Wes Priddy of the Travis County Sheriff’s Office said his county’s numbers were high because they included many people who had been in custody for months. After Sheriff Sally Hernandez took office, her office compiled all the names of people who wouldn’t be held under the new “sanctuary” policy and submitted them to ICE 10 days before implementing it. “The week they chose happens to fall at the time we implemented our new policy,” Priddy told The Huffington Post. “Any subsequent reports that ICE may choose to put out are going to show much smaller numbers.”Since implementing the new detainer policy, Priddy said, the county jail has released on bonds 38 people with felonies on their records. All but one person, who was charged with driving under the influence, had attended their scheduled court hearings. “That’s every bit as good as the record of U.S. citizens that have to go to a court date,” Priddy said. “These people are showing up.” It’s likely the total number of denied detainers will increase in future reports. Previously, some ICE field offices stopped issuing detainers to jurisdictions with a history of limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts ― including several major cities with large undocumented populations, such as Los Angeles and New York City. But the agency will once again issue detainers to all jurisdictions, regardless of their local policies, according to the report. Bob Libal, the director of Grassroots Leadership, an organization that pushed for the Travis County sanctuary policy, said the Trump administration’s pressure on local jurisdictions to cooperate with ICE would make immigration enforcement more erratic than it was under former President Barack Obama.“I fully expect that we’re going to see a dramatic uptick in detainers placed by ICE everywhere in the country, which only increases the rationale for county’s refusing to honor detainers,” Libal told HuffPost. “We’re not going to see the prioritization we saw under the Obama administration. We’re going to see a broad scope of people suspected of being undocumented or any immigration issue.” A growing number of local officials have refused over the past several years to honor ICE requests to hold undocumented immigrants, arguing that it undermined immigrants’ faith in local law enforcement and that the detainers funneled too many people with minor offenses or ties to the local community into deportation proceedings. Many local officials also worry that honoring all ICE detainers will force them to violate the constitution. Federal courts have ruled that local jurisdictions violate the Fourth Amendment when they honor a request from ICE and hold someone who would otherwise be allowed to go free.Refusing to honor an ICE detainer doesn’t mean a local jail is releasing a dangerous criminal onto the streets. Anyone arrested by local authorities remains detained if prosecuted on criminal charges unless a judge decides the person doesn’t present a threat to the community or a flight risk. In such cases, a person can be released on a bond or on recognizance while the charges proceed. The ICE report does not say whether the people it cites remain in local custody. Much of the “notable criminal activity” mentioned in the report concerns charges rather than convictions, and none of that information is dated. The report does not list cases by name, which would violate DHS’s privacy policy for immigration cases. Some of the jurisdictions singled out by ICE ― such as Clackamas County, Oregon, and Rhode Island ― created their policies based on court orders and legal challenges. Federal judges ruled in both cases that the jurisdictions had violated the constitution when detaining individuals on ICE’s requests.The agency acknowledges on its website that some jurisdictions don’t comply with all detainer requests because of court orders or state laws. But the agency brushed off that reasoning.“Regardless of the reason for which a jurisdiction does not honor ICE detainers or requests for notification, such action by the jurisdiction nonetheless adversely impacts public safety,” the FAQ section reads.“ICE’s response is, ‘I don’t care why they’re not honoring detainers, by doing that, they’re diminishing public safety,’” said Tom Jawetz, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center for American Progress. “The general lack of respect for constitutional order is mind-blowing.” Along with the weekly reports, Trump said he would deny federal funds for so-called sanctuary cities. This threat caused the leader of one jurisdiction, Miami-Dade County in Florida, to quickly reverse course and promise to comply with ICE requests. Most officials in sanctuary cities have said they will remain firm, however. The federal government doesn’t have the authority to force local law enforcement by taking away other funding, according to legal experts. Since becoming president, Trump has instructed ICE and Customs and Border Patrol to detain and deport more individuals. He also announced he will create a special office for victims of crimes by immigrants ― separate from existing government resources for victims of crime in general ― called the Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement office, or VOICE. The plan drew comparisons to Nazi Germany’s tactics to stir up fear and hatred of Jews. Some undocumented immigrants do commit crimes, but there’s no evidence that they do so more than American citizens. Multiple studies have found that immigrants as a whole are less likely than native-born U.S. citizens to be convicted of criminal activity. The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, released a report last week that found undocumented immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans.Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) defended Chicago’s sanctuary policies, describing Monday’s ICE report as part of Trump’s efforts to inaccurately paint undocumented immigrants as rapists and murders. “Trump and his team incorrectly see Fourth Amendment policies that require warrants to hold prisoners for the Feds as a threat to public safety,” Gutierrez said in a statement. “But the reality is that in most cities, the police have found that acting as deportation police makes it harder to keep their cities safe. In Chicago and everywhere else, immigrants are part of our communities and need to know that when they witness a crime or have information the police can use, they can call 911 and not lose their children or their homes to deportation.”This article has been updated with comment from Wes Priddy.

He deploys 160 for every 100,000 words he publishes. Yikes!In a new book, Nabokov’s Favorite Word Is Mauve, statistician Ben Blatt runs the numbers on bestselling and classic literature, coming to some startling ― and not-so-startling ― conclusions. In a Publishers Weekly article, Blatt shared a few of the stats from his book, revealing the most, and least, cliché-prone, exclamation-point-heavy, and weather-obsessed authors. “If you have a body of literature, stats can now serve as an x-ray,” he writes.Some of the revelations are hardly surprising.Patterson, who has his name on over 200 novels, many of them bestsellers, isn’t known for his innovative prose. After crosschecking 50 classic and bestselling authors against Christine Ammer’s The Dictionary of Clichés, Blatt found that the crime writer took top prize for most clichés. Certain literary writers known for pushing the style envelope weren’t far behind, however. Kurt Vonnegut, James Joyce (rather surprisingly), and Zadie Smith also deployed well over 100 clichés per 100,000 words. On the low end: Virginia Woolf, Veronica Roth, and Khaled Hosseini. What about exclamation points? Noir novelist Elmore Leonard hates ‘em (49 per 100,000 words) and James Joyce loves ‘em (1105 per 100,000 words). Interestingly, male writers populate the extremes of Blatt’s body of authors, when it comes to exclamation points. The top users include Tom Wolfe, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Sinclair Lewis, while the bottom users include Ernest Hemingway, John Updike, and Chuck Palahniuk. Blatt also analyzed how often authors open their books with descriptions of the weather, a scene-setting tactic that, he points out, was slammed by spare stylist Leonard. “The reader is apt to leaf ahead looking for people,” Leonard argued in a 2001 New York Times column. While some authors, like Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway, never mention weather in the first sentence, Blatt found that John Steinbeck and Willa Cather both did so about a quarter of the time. And then there’s the all-time champ: “Danielle Steel, known for selling hundreds of millions of books, should also be known for talking about the weather,” he writes. “Nearly half her of introductions involve weather.”These stats might not tell us anything particularly world-shaking about the authors we love, but there’s an inherent fascination about seeing the habits and stylistic patterns of great writers broken down into precise parts. Frankly, we just can’t get enough of it.Check out graphics and more stats from Blatt on Publishers Weekly. "
34,POLITICS,Neil Gorsuch Allegedly Said Women Abuse Maternity Leave. That's A Big Problem.,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neil-gorsuch-working-women_us_58cff5afe4b0ec9d29dd9e93,It sure sounds like he's calling for sex discrimination. Not a good look for a Supreme Court justice.,2017-03-20,Maybe someone should ask Neil Gorsuch about this before he's confirmed as a Supreme Court justice?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cffed92c00002000fef51a.jpeg?cache=UvNNCuMKEP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, may have a sneaking sympathy for companies that discriminate against women in the workplace.That’s one conclusion to draw from a troubling anecdote recounted by Jennifer Sisk, a former law student of Gorsuch’s, in a letter sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee ahead of the judge’s confirmation hearing this week.In a class discussion last year, Sisk said that Gorsuch pushed students to consider that women may manipulate employers by becoming pregnant, taking maternity leave and then quitting their jobs. (The judge was teaching a course on legal ethics and professionalism at the University of Colorado Law School.)Companies have to ask women about their motherhood plans to protect themselves, Gorsuch said, according to Sisk’s account. He didn’t raise similar concerns about male employees, she said.In a separate letter to the Judiciary Committee, another student, Will Hauptman, disputes Sisk’s story. So we don’t know for sure what happened or what Gorsuch believes based on this one account, which was first reported by NPR. But there’s certainly a lot to unpack in Sisk’s anecdote, because gender discrimination in the workplace remains a real problem.At a minimum, someone needs to ask Gorsuch about this allegation at his hearing. The issue didn’t come up on Monday. (It did come up on Tuesday; see the update below.)Sisk’s story suggests that Gorsuch may harbor some bias against women in the workplace and that he may not understand the reality for both working mothers and their employers, many of whom have found that offering more and better parental leave leads women to stay in their jobs.But most disturbing is the idea that Gorsuch may not truly support current law. Treating women differently than men in the workplace solely based on the chance that a woman might have children is discrimination and has long been considered illegal.Under federal law (Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964), employers cannot discriminate against workers because of their sex. The very first sex discrimination case the Supreme Court decided under Title 7 involved an employer that had a rule against hiring women with young children. The court in 1971 ― that’s more than 45 years ago ― found the rule was not OK because you can’t have different hiring rules for men and women.“The one-sided set of questions focusing on women as mothers is something the Supreme Court has long rejected as unlawful,” Emily Martin, general counsel and vice president for workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center, told The Huffington Post. “If these statements are accurate, they are really disturbing in a number of ways and reflect a time in U.S. history that most of us thought we left behind,” she said.Martin said another woman in Gorsuch’s class corroborated Sisk’s story, but wished to remain anonymous. While the Supreme Court nominee’s stance on abortion and birth control (in the Hobby Lobby case) will no doubt get the bulk of attention from women’s advocates, his possible views on working women should not be ignored at his confirmation hearing. Sisk’s letter ― which was posted online by the National Employment Lawyers Association and the National Women’s Law Center ― was addressed to Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the chairman and the ranking member of the Judiciary CommitteeAs Sisk recalled, students in Gorsuch’s class last year were talking about a hypothetical case in which a woman with a lot of student debt was interviewing for jobs at law firms. The woman also planned on starting a family in the “near future.” The issue was what to tell her prospective employer.Sisk said the question sparked a “lively” discussion in which students, both male and female, talked about the challenges of balancing work and family.But, she said, Gorsuch took the conversation in another direction, implying that working women take advantage of maternity leave policies when they quit their jobs after their leave is over. According to Sisk, there was no consideration of other factors that can push working mothers out of law firm jobs ― from covert and overt bias to a work culture that is unforgiving to anyone who needs time outside of work.“Judge Gorsuch outlined how law firms, and companies in general, had to ask female interviewees about pregnancy plans in order to protect the company,” Sisk wrote in the letter. “At least one student countered that an employer could not ask questions about an interviewee’s pregnancy plans. However, Judge Gorsuch informed the class that that was wrong.”In fact, it is not illegal under federal law for an employer to ask a woman about her plans on parenting. But if the employer doesn’t hire someone who said she hopes, or plans, to have children in the near future, the question may later be used as evidence in a discrimination lawsuit against the company.In addition, many states and even cities have laws prohibiting employers from making hiring decisions based on gender, caretaking status and other factors.Some attorneys and other advocates argue these questions shouldn’t be asked at all. “Why would you ask if it wasn’t intended to inform your decision?” said Christine Tschiderer, staff attorney at the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.Why not just ask a female job applicant if she’ll be able to put in the long hours or commit to the travel required by the job? Tschiderer said. Those questions would not be discriminatory. Asking if someone plans on getting pregnant is always going to be a question you only ask women.Tschiderer, who’s worked on many pregnancy discrimination cases, said she believes pregnancy and parenting questions are more common than we realize, but they don’t often come up in court because it’s hard to prove why a particular person wasn’t hired.In a statement, the University of Colorado Law School’s dean, S. James Anaya, said that administrators had met with Sisk to address her concerns about Gorsuch’s comments last spring and told her they would raise the issue with the judge after grades were submitted for the semester. That never happened, the school said, because of a transition of deans that occurred at the end of June.“We apologize to the student who expressed the concern and to Judge Gorsuch for not bringing this matter to his attention last summer,” the school said.Although sex discrimination is clearly illegal, it’s also far from uncommon. Just two years ago, the Supreme Court decided a case against UPS, which had refused to give pregnant women the same kind of work accommodations it offered male employees who got injured on the job. The court ruled that the woman had a claim and sent the case back for trial. (UPS may have seen the light in the meantime: It had changed the policy by the time the justices ruled on the case.)And suspicion of women’s commitment to work is hardly uncommon either. A recent study found that law firms were less likely to hire certain women because of a belief they weren’t truly interested in working full-time.UPDATE: March 22 ― During his second day of confirmation hearings, Gorsuch denied Sisk’s version of the story. In response to questions from Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Gorsuch testified that it’s inappropriate for employers to ask women whether they plan on becoming pregnant, and offered a detailed version of what happened during his conversation with students in 2016.The story has been updated with comment from the University of Colorado Law School."

I was mildly paying attention to it because since my playing days, I’ve constantly had pain in my neck. I was thinking it was related to some kind of nerve damage because it would just come and go,” Clark wrote.“After months of tests and treatment, I got some bad news,” he continued. “I was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. I have ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Those words are still very hard for me to say.”In recent years, ALS, commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease, has been linked to the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, ESPN noted. CTE is found in athletes and other individuals with a history of concussions and other repetitive brain trauma.Clark addressed questions surrounding the connection between his football career and the diagnosis. “I’ve been asked if playing football caused this. I don’t know for sure. But I certainly suspect it did,” Clark wrote. “And I encourage the NFLPA and the NFL to continue working together in their efforts to make the game of football safer, especially as it relates to head trauma.”Clark is perhaps best known for being the receiver in the play football fans simply call “The Catch.” The six-yard touchdown pass thrown by Joe Montana lifted the 49ers to victory over the Dallas Cowboys in the 1982 NFC Championship game.The San Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York released the following statement regarding Clark’s announcement: "

The treatment of previous Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. Rulings in which Gorsuch is accused of favoring the powerful over the powerless. His views on whether judges should second-guess the expertise of administrative agencies. His constitutional vision for the rights of women, minorities, workers, the poor and religious minorities. The role of money in politics.All of these were hot topics for Democrats, who don’t have the votes to reject Gorsuch outright but could try to block him on the Senate floor, an option Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has left on the table. The progressive base, meanwhile, just wants the party to fight the nominee tooth and nail ― and so the hearings, which are set to last through Thursday, are their chance to grandstand about the issues Democrats care about.“You’re going to have your hands full with this president,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told Gorsuch, who sat attentively as both Democrats and Republicans took turns in praising or raising doubts about him. “He’s going to keep you busy.”Trump’s controversial policies and imbroglios came up several times at the hearing, but Gorsuch didn’t engage any of them head on when it was his time to address the committee later in the afternoon. But while discussing the role of the judiciary, he did point out that the robes judges wear are meant to signify impartiality toward all.“Ours is a judiciary of honest, black polyester,” he said. He added that when judges put on robes, “it’s time to lose our egos and open our minds.”Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said the Senate’s job is to determine if Gorsuch will be “a reasonable mainstream conservative” on the Supreme Court as well as someone who “will protect the rights of all Americans, not just the powerful few.”She criticized Scalia’s constitutional views, which she said would’ve kept segregation and discrimination against women and LGBT people on the books, then wondered aloud about what Gorsuch’s appointment would mean for the future of abortion rights. Feinstein said that Gorsuch’s writings have been read by both anti-abortion and pro-abortion rights activists to mean that he’d vote to overrule Roe v. Wade, and she pointed out that Trump had campaigned specifically on the promise of nominating “pro-life judges.”Several Democratic senators highlighted the role two conservative groups, the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, played in shaping Trump’s selection of Gorsuch. Leonard Leo, who leads the Federalist Society, took a leave to advise the president on his court selection.“I do not know of any other Supreme Court nominee who was selected by interest groups rather than by a president in consultation with the Senate, as required by the Constitution,” said the No. 2 Democrat on the committee, Patrick Leahy of Vermont.Time and again, Democrats on the committee lauded Garland, the esteemed appeals judge President Barack Obama nominated a month after Scalia’s death but whose nomination was never given the kind of hearing Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is now promptly offering Gorsuch.Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Gorsuch’s home state senator who introduced him alongside Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), urged his colleagues to give the judge a hearing out of respect for him and for Garland, and to do it “in the manner that his predecessor deserved but was denied.” Bennet is taking heat in Colorado over whether he’ll vote for Gorsuch.Since Scalia’s death more than a year ago, the Supreme Court has carried on with only eight justices — four appointed by Democratic presidents, four by Republican presidents. The addition of Gorsuch would bring the court back to its prior status quo, with ideologically close rulings depending on Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative centrist who has often pivoted on hot-button constitutional issues.Perhaps because the stakes are high for Democrats, who fear that Trump’s agenda and an entrenched conservative majority on the court put the causes they care about at risk, Leahy posed a series of rhetorical questions of the nominee, who will no doubt get them again once the formal question-and-answer sessions begin Tuesday.“Will you allow the government to intrude on Americans’ personal privacy and freedoms? Will you elevate the rights of corporations over those of real people? Will you rubber-stamp a president whose administration has asserted that executive power is not subject to judicial review?” Leahy asked.If progressives are worried that Democrats might botch the Gorsuch confirmation battle, Rhode Island’s Sheldon Whitehouse delivered what’s likely the most potent moment for their base: a spirited speech listing all the cases on which Republican appointees to the Supreme Court have voted in five-justice blocs in important cases that, in Whitehouse’s view, have given Republicans more power.“I can’t help but notice the long array of 5-to-4 decisions with all Republican appointees to change the law to the benefit of distinct interests: Republicans at the polls and big businesses pretty much everywhere,” Whitehouse said. Among the cases he listed were one that gutted an key section of the Voting Rights Act and the Citizens United decision, which allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts in elections.Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who last month revealed that Gorsuch had told him during a private visit that Trump’s attacks on the judiciary were “demoralizing,” insisted that he’d demand that Gorsuch be more forthcoming with his condemnation.“It isn’t enough to do it in the privacy of my office or with our colleagues behind closed doors,” he said, adding that he should condemn Trump publicly and explicitly about the president’s verbal assaults on the courts.After taking the oath in the afternoon, Gorsuch finally got a chance to speak about himself and his record, following introductions by Bennet, Gardner and Neal Katyal, an experienced Supreme Court lawyer who was acting solicitor general in the early years of the Obama administration.Skirting the kinds of controversial subjects that often divide the high court, the nominee stuck to pleasantries, speaking fondly about his Colorado roots, his family and his legal heroes ― including Kennedy and the late Justice Byron White, for whom he clerked. “Justice Scalia was a mentor, too,” Gorsuch said.Indirectly, the judge pushed back against Democrats’ attempts to paint him as someone who’d rule against the less powerful, noting that, in his years as appellate judge, he’d sided with Native Americans, class-action plaintiffs suing corporations, prisoners, criminal defendants and undocumented immigrants.“Sometimes, too, I’ve ruled against such persons,” he added. “My decisions have never reflected a judgment about the people before me.”He then repeated a line that he used on the day he was nominated to the Supreme Court, emphasizing how judges should stick to the letter of the law ― no more, no less.“A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is probably a very bad judge, stretching for policy results he prefers rather than those the law compels,” Gorsuch said.Talking to reporters after Day 1 of the hearings, Grassley said that he expects the Senate to vote on Gorsuch’s nomination before Congress’ Easter recess, which is scheduled to begin April 8, and that he expects some Democrats to join Republicans in putting him through.Tuesday’s session is expected to be a marathon for Gorsuch, with all 20 senators on the judiciary committee posing questions in 30-minute intervals. That’s at least 10 hours in the hot seat.UPDATE: This article has been updated with more details from Monday’s hearing."

Will you rubber-stamp a president whose administration has asserted that executive power is not subject to judicial review?” Leahy asked.If progressives are worried that Democrats might botch the Gorsuch confirmation battle, Rhode Island’s Sheldon Whitehouse delivered what’s likely the most potent moment for their base: a spirited speech listing all the cases on which Republican appointees to the Supreme Court have voted in five-justice blocs in important cases that, in Whitehouse’s view, have given Republicans more power.“I can’t help but notice the long array of 5-to-4 decisions with all Republican appointees to change the law to the benefit of distinct interests: Republicans at the polls and big businesses pretty much everywhere,” Whitehouse said. Among the cases he listed were one that gutted an key section of the Voting Rights Act and the Citizens United decision, which allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts in elections.Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who last month revealed that Gorsuch had told him during a private visit that Trump’s attacks on the judiciary were “demoralizing,” insisted that he’d demand that Gorsuch be more forthcoming with his condemnation.“It isn’t enough to do it in the privacy of my office or with our colleagues behind closed doors,” he said, adding that he should condemn Trump publicly and explicitly about the president’s verbal assaults on the courts.After taking the oath in the afternoon, Gorsuch finally got a chance to speak about himself and his record, following introductions by Bennet, Gardner and Neal Katyal, an experienced Supreme Court lawyer who was acting solicitor general in the early years of the Obama administration.Skirting the kinds of controversial subjects that often divide the high court, the nominee stuck to pleasantries, speaking fondly about his Colorado roots, his family and his legal heroes ― including Kennedy and the late Justice Byron White, for whom he clerked. “Justice Scalia was a mentor, too,” Gorsuch said.Indirectly, the judge pushed back against Democrats’ attempts to paint him as someone who’d rule against the less powerful, noting that, in his years as appellate judge, he’d sided with Native Americans, class-action plaintiffs suing corporations, prisoners, criminal defendants and undocumented immigrants.“Sometimes, too, I’ve ruled against such persons,” he added. “My decisions have never reflected a judgment about the people before me.”He then repeated a line that he used on the day he was nominated to the Supreme Court, emphasizing how judges should stick to the letter of the law ― no more, no less.“A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is probably a very bad judge, stretching for policy results he prefers rather than those the law compels,” Gorsuch said.Talking to reporters after Day 1 of the hearings, Grassley said that he expects the Senate to vote on Gorsuch’s nomination before Congress’ Easter recess, which is scheduled to begin April 8, and that he expects some Democrats to join Republicans in putting him through.Tuesday’s session is expected to be a marathon for Gorsuch, with all 20 senators on the judiciary committee posing questions in 30-minute intervals. That’s at least 10 hours in the hot seat.UPDATE: This article has been updated with more details from Monday’s hearing."
39,PARENTS,Mom Shares Postpartum Medical Struggles With Powerful Instagram,Caroline Bologna,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mom-shares-postpartum-medical-struggles-with-powerful-instagram_us_58cca605e4b00705db4fc8aa,"""Our bodies really do tell stories.""",2017-03-20,"Horn and her boyfriend have an 18-month-old son together, as well as shared custody of his 10-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cca70e14000020000702e2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A powerful Instagram post is shedding light on the medical challenges that can follow childbirth and celebrating moms’ scars.Eighteen months ago, Kari Horn gave birth to her son via emergency C-section. Though becoming a parent has been a joyful experience for the Virginia mom, her postpartum journey involved umbilical hernias, more surgery and further complications.While recovering from these complications, Horn posted a striking photo of her abdomen on Instagram to share her story and remind other struggling moms that they are not alone. In the caption, Horn described her photo as one of “the parts of motherhood they don’t talk about much.”“Sometimes, despite what your dream of childbirth is, you have to have an emergency C-section,” she wrote. “Sometimes, no matter how much coconut and vitamin e oil you put on your pregnant belly, you still get all of the stretch marks.”She added, “Sometimes, even when your baby is now a toddler, you find out that you have not 1, but 3 umbilical hernias, and you have to get your abs and muscles cut into again. Then sometimes you’re allergic to the bandaging the doctor used and end up with burns and a rash all over your already sore tummy.”Horn won’t let the medical challenges and their physical remnants get her down, however. “Mothers are the real MVPs,” she wrote. “Don’t hate on yourselves, ladies. You’re beautiful no matter how many scars you get.”Horn told The Huffington Post she decided to post the photo after struggling with negative self-perception and feeling inspired by similar posts from other women. “I thought maybe if I did it myself, it would help me through my slump, which it definitely did,” she said, adding that the positive feedback and encouragement from others made her feel much better about herself and what she’s gone through.The mom has experienced quite a medical ordeal in her motherhood journey. “When we found out I was pregnant, we were all pretty shocked and worried, because up to that point, I had been made to believe that I couldn’t conceive because of endometriosis and a retroverted uterus,” Horn explained.Though she ultimately could conceive, she had a higher risk of complications, experienced more than average discomfort and swelling, and needed to visit her doctor for more frequent check-ups throughout her pregnancy. Horn’s water broke on the night of her due date. Because she was Group B strep positive, she needed to give birth as soon as possible in order to take antibiotics. “Contractions were pretty tolerable for the first couple of hours and once they really kicked in, my body went into shock and I couldn’t stop shaking or vomiting, so I had to get an epidural to control that ― which didn’t end up helping with the pain at all, but it did make the vomiting stop,” the mom recalled.By morning, her contractions were minutes apart but nothing had progressed. “They put me on pitocin and made me do miscellaneous leg exercises to try to speed up dilation, but I still didn’t progress any further,” she said. “By the afternoon, our baby had gone into serious distress, and they took us in for the caesarian.”The delivery and recovery process went well, but after a few months, however, she realized she still had a bulge over her belly button. “I didn’t think anything of it until about six months ago, when it started causing serious discomfort when eating, breathing, or holding our son,” the mom said.After a co-worker suggested it may be a hernia, Horn went to see a doctor, who made the diagnosis. During her hernia repair procedure in January, the doctor discovered she actually had three hernias. She’s still recovering from the surgery today.“I’m convinced that after a C-section and triple hernia repair, I will never have proper strength back in my abs or a pain-free day,” Horn told HuffPost. “My C-section scar still hurts to this day on top of the repaired hernia areas, but we make the best of it. At least eating, breathing, and holding my son is no longer uncomfortable, so that’s a win.”Horn hopes that her story shows women in similar situations that they are not alone. She also wants mothers to realize that no matter what they’ve gone through or how they look now, their bodies “created a miracle” and the physical effects show off the strength it took to do that. “I hope that women will be inspired to love their bodies more, even if they haven’t had children, because our bodies really do tell stories,” she explained. “Those of us who have become ‘less than ideal’ over time just have the scars, stretch marks, bruises, etc. to show it and remind us that we are warriors.”"

Ramirez described the cancellation as “sad but responsible” in light of a wave of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detainments and arrests. “Everyone is offended by the actions of ICE,” Ramirez told NBC10. “They did not feel comfortable holding the event.”Organizers wrote on Facebook that they didn’t want to create another risk for members of the immigrant community and warned people to be careful. “Under these sad circumstances, we do not think it’s fair nor the right moment for a joyful celebration,” they wrote. “This year we ask that you all stay well informed, that you don’t get led astray by rumors or make hasty decisions. Just for this one year, we don’t want you to take unnecessary risks until we know what we’re dealing with.”The festival celebrates the Mexican army’s victory over the French at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. In previous years, hundreds of carnavaleros, or marchers, have commemorated the historic battle while parading through south Philadelphia in traditional garb. ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls refuted the idea that attending the celebration would put individuals at risk, saying in a statement that the agency’s enforcement actions are “targeted and lead driven.”“ICE does not conduct sweeps or raids that target aliens indiscriminately,” Walls told The Huffington Post in an email. “ICE fully respects the rights of all people to voice their opinion peacefully without interference.”President Donald Trump’s promise to crack down on undocumented immigrants has sown fear in the immigrant community as ICE ramped up enforcement in cities around the country beginning last month.This month, ICE agents arrested 248 foreign nationals in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware. The operation targeted “criminal aliens, immigration fugitives, re-entrants and other immigration violators,” according to the agency. Philadelphia is a sanctuary city, meaning law enforcement limits cooperation with immigration officials. Agents arrested several undocumented immigrants in the city earlier this month. The city had released certain individuals who ICE had wanted to remain in custody, which the agency said in statement was “a situation that puts the public at unnecessary risk.”Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said the city was committed to protecting its immigrants.“I’m devastated to hear that ICE has had such a chilling effect that Philadelphians no longer feel comfortable engaging in this public celebration,” Kenney said in a statement emailed to HuffPost. “While we can’t stop ICE from conducting these raids, I want our immigrant community to know that we want them here, we remain committed to being a 4th Amendment City and protecting these values, and we will do whatever we can to help them feel comfortable bringing this celebration back in the future.”"

Appearing before the House Intelligence Committee on Monday, Comey said he had no evidence that could back up the president’s allegations. “With respect to the president’s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI,” Comey said. “The Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components, the department has no information that supports those tweets.”The House Intelligence Committee is looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Comey confirmed on Monday that the bureau is conducting an investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election and potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.The Justice Department on Friday provided the committee with information concerning the inquiry. The head of the committee and the ranking member have not indicated there is any reason to believe the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump.“We know there was not a physical wiretap of Trump Tower,” Rep.

Judges are not free to re-order regulations to make them more fair. For sure, judges aren’t free to update the Constitution. That’s not their job.”“Fortunately for every American, we have before us today a nominee whose body of professional work is defined by an unfailing commitment to these principles. His grasp on the separation of powers, including judicial independence, enlivens his body of work,” Grassley said.Democrats were expected to try to case that Gorsuch is a pro-business, social conservative insufficiently independent of the Republican president. About 30 people in the audience wore red T-shirts emblazoned with #StopGorsuch.Gorsuch, a cool-headed and amiable conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado, likely will try to engage members of the Judiciary Committee without being pinned down on specifics that could trip up his nomination to the lifetime post. Gorsuch was due to deliver his opening statement later on Monday after members of the committee make theirs.If Gorsuch, nominated by Trump on Jan. 31, is confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he would restore a narrow 5-4 conservative majority on the court. The seat has been vacant for 13 months, since the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016.The hearing which could go as long as four days, providing classic Washington political theater.Democrats can be expected to put up a fierce fight. They contend that Trump’s party “stole” a seat on the Supreme Court when the Republican-led Senate last year refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama’s nomination of federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland to replace Scalia.Had Garland been confirmed, the court would have leaned to the left for the first time in decades. Since Scalia’s death, the court has been split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals. The ideological leaning of the court could be pivotal in determining the outcome of a wide array of matters including the death penalty, abortion, gun control, environmental regulations, voting rights, immigration, religious liberty, presidential powers and others.In a bid to place hurdles in the way of Gorsuch’s confirmation, committee Democrats promise to question him on several fronts, focused on his record as an appellate judge and a Justice Department appointee under former President George W. Bush.Conservative activists called on the Senate to confirm Gorsuch.“It’s very, very important we get Neil Gorsuch confirmed,” said Gregg Cummings, a member of the conservative Tea Party Patriots group who came from Lamoni, Iowa. “We need individuals that will 100 percent stay with the rule of law and the Constitution, and he is one of those.”Among questions Gorsuch likely will face will be whether he is sufficiently independent from Trump, who has criticized judges for ruling against his bid to block people from a group of Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Another line of attack previewed by Democratic leader Chuck Schumer is to focus on rulings Gorsuch has authored in which corporate interests won out over individual workers.Democrats will also press Gorsuch on his role as a Justice Department lawyer under Bush from 2005 to 2006, when he helped defend contentious policies enacted after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, including the administration’s expansive use of interrogation techniques that critics called torture.Gorsuch’s views on social issues, including a 2006 book he wrote in which he argued against the legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia, likely will be discussed, too.Judiciary Committee members were scheduled to give opening statements on Monday and then take turns questioning the nominee on Tuesday.Democrats face an uphill battle to block Gorsuch. Republicans hold 52 of the Senate’s 100 seats. Under present rules, Gorsuch would need 60 votes in order to secure confirmation. If Democrats stay unified and Gorsuch cannot muster 60, Republicans could change the rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority.(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung; Additional reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Will Dunham)"

The show will change networks from Logo, the seminal gay television network, to VH1 ― a shift that will affect both accessibility and audience for the program. “Drag Race” fans will also now have to plan their viewing around Friday nights rather than Mondays.The changes mark a turning point for the show’s production company, World of Wonder, the LGBTQ entertainment world and for RuPaul himself.“I think the move to VH1 really reflects the broadening of our audience,” RuPaul told The Huffington Post in an interview last week ― a broadening that will prove crucial for LGBTQ visibility in a turbulent and hostile political climate.For RuPaul, drag has always been political, “just not in the sense of policies and committees in Washington, D.C.,” he jokes. And perhaps, now more than ever throughout the eight-year run of his hit reality program, Ru is becoming more outspoken about the political forces at work in our country and the role drag performers play in combating them.“Drag challenges the status quo. It’s always challenged the matrix – the matrix being ‘choose an identity and stick with it the rest of your life because that’s how we want to sell products to you, so we’ll know who you are and can put you in a box and then sell you beer and shampoo,’” Ru said. “Well, drag says ‘I’m a shapeshifter, I do whatever the hell I want at any given time.’ And that is very, very political.”If you’re unfamiliar with “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” think of is as “America’s Next Top Model” meets “Project Runway” with elements of other reality shows sprinkled throughout ― all broadcast through the lens of drag culture. But the show goes beyond pure entertainment ― it offers a picture of and an intimate look at a community of people whose very existence and identity is a political act.This takes on a whole new level of significance as the show moves into suburban American living rooms on Friday nights at 8:00 p.m.“I think people find our show because they relate on a deep level; that they know they’re more than just what it says they are on their driver’s license,” Ru said. “Now, in this current administration, which is telling people to go backwards, telling people to go back to another time ― as far as I can remember the time machine has never been invented.”According to Ru, different individuals in societies over the course of time have practiced this same cultural function served by drag queens.“That has been the role of drag queens and shamans and court jesters and witchdoctors throughout history. And all of those entities have always had a duality in their gender. Drag queens have always taken on that role of spilling the tea – and the tea is the emperor has no clothes!”After season nine of “Drag Race” airs, 114 different contestants will have entered the iconic pink workroom doors of “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” Many of those queens have had massively successful careers, and have also changed lives simply serving as possibility models for queer kids across America. A queen’s commitment to being authentically herself may help her win challenges on the show, but her journey throughout the season also creates a powerful example of existing exactly as one’s self in a world that tells young people certain ways of being are more valuable than othersPossibility models for all minorities in the age of Trump are both crucial and live-saving. “My legacy lives through my children, these kids who’ve come through our show, and that’s what I’m most proud of,” Ru said.Throughout the show’s past eight seasons, “Drag Race” has also touched on issues and experiences that are pertinent in the LGBTQ community. Participants have been through struggles with substance abuse, they’ve had to come to terms with one’s gender identity, they’ve dealt with broken relationships with family members, as well as learning to love one’s self. And while RuPaul doesn’t necessarily think his show is directly targeted at young LGBTQ viewers, he knows that they are certainly watching. “Life’s journey – it unfolds for you as you are ready for it.... I love it in ‘The Wizard of Oz’ Dorothy said, ‘why didn’t you tell me all I had to do was click my heels three times?’ And the good witch says, because you wouldn’t have believed me! You had to experience it for yourself.”Providing this representation for LGBTQ youth watching “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” especially as the show moves to a mainstream network, might be one of Ru’s greatest accomplishments of all.“That’s what I would say to these kids is, go and experience it for yourself – there’s nothing I can do,” Ru continued. “I’ve lived my whole life in the life ― I’ve lived my whole life doing the thing, I’ve been doing my own thing. And I think my life speaks volumes about what one must do. Never forget that the most political thing you can ever do is follow your heart.”“RuPaul’s Drag Race” season nine premieres March 24 on VH1 at 8:00 PM ET/PT. RuPaul’s new album “American” will debut the same day.James Michael Nichols is a queer writer and cultural critic whose work focuses heavily on the intersections of identity, art and politics.

You’re just a punk.” Spencer responded by posting a video to “Tomorrow Belongs to Me” from the 1972 film version of “Cabaret.” In the musical, the song is meant to dramatically depict the rise of the Nazis in Germany and is supposed to induce chills.However, it has been mistaken for a real Nazi anthem and has been covered by white power bands, according to Mashable.Leave it to Jason Kander, Missouri’s former secretary of state, to put the song in perspective and Spencer in his place.Turns out Kander’s great-uncle, John Kander, half of the acclaimed Broadway team of Kander & Ebb, wrote the music to “Cabaret.” Jason Kander explained why the song may not be the white supremacist anthem Spencer assumed it was.Spencer didn’t respond to Kander’s tweet, but he is no longer posting videos of show tunes taken out of context either.Kander was happy with how the exchange went, telling CNN: “It’s not every day you get to tell off a neo-Nazi.”The tweet has been shared more than 40,000 times since Sunday. Kander believes it’s because people are upset about what they are seeing.“When you look culturally at this, what is going on right now, and the feeling that some of these folks, like [Spencer], have sort of been given the license to be more mainstream, it bothers people,” he said.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said John Kander wrote the lyrics to “Cabaret.” Kander penned the music and Fred Ebb wrote the lyrics."

The focus of one of the investigations, launched by the US Attorney’s Office (now minus Preet Bharara), were on his since-defunct political nonprofit, the Campaign for One New York.With that pesky little investigation behind him, and that of the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, the Mayor would seem to have a clear path to a re-election, amirite? Maybe not. While city reporters have concluded safely (and predictably) within the box of mainstream political, soap opera-esque, storylines that de Blasio is a cinch for re-election, our good mayor isn’t quite yet in the clear. He has managed to piss off a sizable number of activists, parents and New Yorkers. Some of that might throw a monkey wrench into the prospects of another four years of Mayor de Blasio.A few of the controversies that could bite him in the ass, and that he likely won’t put behind him come November:The Mayor has professed his undying love for Broken Windows policing. This, despite the very clear risks (and devastating outcomes) that Broken Windows imposes on immigrant New Yorkers. Arrests for turnstile-jumping, which can get someone deported, started the year at 2000 for the month of January alone. You can read a recent statement from grassroots policing and immigration activists calling out the Mayor here.De Blasio has been ducking the parents of Ramarley Graham, who’ve been demanding that he fire Ramarley’s killer, police officer Richard Haste (currently living off of the taxpayer dime). The Mayor has similarly let down the family of Eric Garner, with the city claiming (falsely) that it can’t move on the Garner case until a federal probe, which isn’t likely to bring any charges against Garner’s killer, is completed. De Blasio could fire Haste and the killer of Garner, police officer Daniel Pantaleo, tomorrow if he really wanted to.The Mayor has also gotten flack from activists asking him to close Rikers Island. Over a hundred of them joined some of us from the anti-Broken Windows camp (and even construction workers) last month outside of the Apollo Theatre as several groups protested the Mayor’s State of the City speech.Outside the Apollo that night there were also housing activists, some of them with the Citywide Alliance Against Displacement coalition. This network of activists and tenant groups, which includes residents of Chinatown, Harlem, Queens and the Bronx, have consistently targeted the mayor. Their message is pretty straightforward: Dump de Blasio. While the Mayor often prides himself on his housing policy proposals, specifically his ""affordable housing"" plan, tenant organizations have called him out early and often. During an MLK day rally organized by the Alliance outside City Hall with over 200 people railing against not only the Mayor, but also the City Council, de Blasio was described as the ""gentrifier-in-chief"" because his plan would usher in, not protect from, the continued gentrification of low-income neighborhoods of color. The Alliance followed that up last Thursday, a day after the investigations of the Mayor were dropped, with another rally calling for de Blasio to step down. In a press release, the Alliance compared the Mayor's developer-friendly efforts to those of President Donald Trump, perhaps the world's most famous developer: ""While Trump pushes people out of the border,"" the press release said, ""de Blasio pushes people out of their homes and neighborhoods to benefit his political aspirations and ultra‐rich developers. They are two sides of the same coin: both destroy immigrant families and communities of color."" Roger Hernandez of El Barrio Unite, a group based in Spanish Harlem that's fighting the upzoning of that neighborhood through de Blasio's plan, says that the neighborhood is fed up: “Mayor de Blasio's Rezoning proposal for East Harlem is recognized by community residents as a gentrification strategy to displace its most vulnerable residents."" Is the Mayor doing the bidding of developers and not, as he wants everyone to believe, working class New Yorkers? Well, a pretty telling sign might be found in that now-defunct Campaign for One New York which the Manhattan DA and US Attorney's Offices were investigating. The biggest donors to the Mayor's nonprofit were (surprise, surprise) real estate developers. Some of de Blasio's Campaign for One New York sugar daddies included Alexander Levin (a real estate investor), Leon Goldenberg, (developer), Two Trees Management (developers), Brookfield Financial Property (developers) and Douglaston Development (developers). Another piggy bank for Team de Blasio, the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City, has gotten big bucks from other big name developers: Bill Rudin (mega-developer), Larry Silverstein (mega-developer of World Trade Center fame), James Capalino (real estate lobbyist), L&M Development (developers) and Tishman Speyer Properties (developers). So yeah, the Mayor has escaped criminal prosecution for now. However, New Yorkers probably don't want to hitch their wagon to another career politician elbow-deep in real estate money, do they? With a commitment to mass criminalization and luxury development, it might actually be hard for the Mayor, despite clearing recent legal hurdles, to fool New Yorkers into believing that he's some sort of champion of everyday, working class New Yorkers. He's not. We should all #DumpDeBlasio this year, once and for all. "

Some long for a wholesome, homogenous society straight out of anodyne TV fantasies like The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. It’s bad enough to pine for an era that would wipe out considerable progress, not to mention large swathes of American society. But what’s happening under Donald Trump’s Republican Party evokes not the affable and fictional Ozzie, but a far more ominous—and real—figure from the ‘50s: Senator Joseph McCarthy.If there were any doubt that the United States has entered an era of paranoia, wild allegations, and purges, the second month of the Trump administration has put it to rest. Unlike McCarthyism, which was laser focused on the “Reds” among us, McTrumpism’s targets are legion, including immigrants, Muslims, people of color, and members of the LGBTQ community. Even before Trump took office on January 20, there have been innumerable instances when he and his spokespeople have implied—or flat-out stated—that one or a combination of the above culprits is undermining the “real America.”“That’s what demagogues have always done,” Senator Bernie Sanders observed of Trump in an interview with the Huffington Post’s Sam Stein. “You pick on the weak and the powerless and you turn a majority against them and you deflect attention from the real causes of the problems that we face.” Case in point: In his first address to Congress, America’s 45th president touted his presidential order creating the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) registry, designed to highlight crimes committed by immigrants. This transparent effort to gin up fear and distrust of the “others” among us was largely brushed over by the media, which seems to be suffering from Stockholm syndrome. Instead, pundits praised the speech as “sane” and “presidential,” seemingly because Trump read a teleprompter and did not bite the head off a bat.Getting Back at BarackUnder McTrumpism, the most menacing bogeyman of all is the president’s predecessor in the Oval Office. In some ways, that’s unsurprising: Trump’s political career was founded on opposition to Barack Obama. He began his transformation from grotesque reality-TV character to grotesque political leader by championing the “birther” movement that alleged that Obama was foreign born—and hence, not a legitimate president under the U.S. Constitution. When that baseless and bigoted accusation was disproven, Trump shrugged and moved onto new ones. One of the richest was his charge that Obama “is the founder of ISIS.” Another was that the president bribed an attorney general to launch a lawsuit against Trump University (which is now defunct—and two days before Trump’s inauguration, that and two other cases were settled in a $25 million payout to Trump University students who’d complained about being ripped off).With this month’s allegation that Obama illegally wiretapped him during the campaign, Trump has outdone himself. He accused his predecessor of an impeachable act, casting aspersions on U.S. security agencies and other branches of government while he was at it. And he incorporated all the unmistakable Trump hallmarks as he did so in a series of dyspeptic early-morning tweets that featured a misspelling (“tapp [sic] my phone”) and the stunted vocabulary of a middle-school bully: “Bad (or sick) guy!”Trump sometimes complains that members of the media aren’t clever enough to “get” his sarcasm. I’ll confess that I may miss it sometimes—though I’m also pretty sure he uses the sarcasm claim as a smokescreen when he’s busted on his most easily disprovable assertions. However, I sense that Trump was being truly sarcastic (there’s an oxymoron for you) when he referred to “the very sacred election process” in one of his Obama-accusing tweets. Trump’s supporters likely didn’t get the joke, but I’ll wager he and Putin just about bust their guts over that one.Is it impossible, or even implausible, that Trump Tower was bugged during last year’s election? No, it isn’t. Pre-Watergate, some U.S. presidents seemed to dabble in that particular abuse of power almost as if it were a perk of office. But in the wake of Richard Nixon’s downfall, stronger scrutiny and new procedures for surveillance were put in place to check presidents when their scruples don’t.If Trump Tower was bugged, it’s far more plausible that the eavesdropping was part of a legal, FBI- and FISA-authorized investigation into Russia’s election tampering, not an Obama vendetta. Obama was coming to the end of his eight-year (and fairly scandal-untainted) presidency. Why would he risk his reputation to try to dig up dirt on a candidate that pretty much everyone—including Obama and Trump—believed would lose? I believe that the real reason Trump accused Obama of wiretapping him is to deflect attention from the fact that both America’s security agencies and Congress are investigating the ties Trump and his cronies have to Russia.Merriam-Webster’s definition of McCarthyism cites “indiscriminate allegations, especially on the basis of unsubstantiated charges.” Sound like anyone you know? If you’re still unconvinced that Trump is the new McCarthy, consider the fact that the wiretapping charge is just the latest among many. Remember the millions of illegal voters who supposedly handed Hillary Clinton the popular vote? Or the photo-doctoring done to make his inauguration crowd look small? If you’re hankering for a golden oldie from Trump’s hit parade of unsubstantiated allegations, there’s the one about “thousands and thousands” of Muslims who celebrated on New Jersey rooftops after the Twin Towers fell on 9/11.Updating Authoritarianism for the 21st CenturyProbably thanks to White House chief strategist (and history-buff white nationalist) Steve Bannon, the Trump administration is fluent in the 20thcentury lexicon of paranoid authoritarianism. To my ear, all the talk about “purges” of Obama allies evokes Stalin. And the determination to “root out” Obama sympathizers who have “burrowed in” to government reminds me of Hitler, who also equated human beings with vermin. Lately, Trump conspiracy theorists have been tossing around a new phrase: “the Deep State.” It sounds like dystopian science fiction, but apparently it’s a circa 1990 Turkish term for shadowy government and military actors who manipulate the levers of power on the sly.Trump isn’t just using the language of authoritarians, he’s turning on new spigots to pump out his fear-mongering bile. There are his often-parodied, but nonetheless resonant, tweets, which let him spout his delusions without the bothersome filtering and fact-checking done by traditional media. On March 13th, some unsuspecting people discovered a bastard communiqué from an official whitehouse.gov email address squalling in their in-boxes: a newsletter dubbed the “1600 Daily.” The first issue was devoted largely to bashing Obamacare.The Trump administration’s ominous language and the way it’s demonizing and bypassing the Fourth Estate is bad enough, but now it has begun carrying out its threats. Immigrant communities across the country are living in fear as Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) officers swoop in for raids ostensibly designed to root out Trump’s “bad hombres”—and catching others in their nets. As author and former labor secretary Robert Reich put it: “We have far fewer undocumented workers in the U.S. today than we did five years ago. There’s no reason for this outburst of cruelty.” Unless you’re trying to consolidate power by stoking fear and prejudice.Speaking of fear and prejudice: Despite the fact that the world is in the throes of the greatest refugee crisis since World War II, Trump has banned all refugees from entering the country for three months (we’ll see what happens after that). He’s also imposed an annual cap of 50,000 refugees, more than halving President Obama’s pledge to resettle 110,000 refugees in 2017. (To put those numbers in some context, Germany, a far smaller country, has taken in more than 1 million refugees—roughly 600,000 of them Syrians.)And the Trump administration isn’t just talking about government purges, it’s carrying them out. For instance, Attorney General (and Civil War relic) Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III recently demanded the resignation of 46 federal prosecutors who’d been appointed during the Obama years. Incoming presidents do replace prosecutors named by their predecessors, but they generally do so once replacements are named, or at least in an orderly fashion. Like so much in his presidency, the Trump’s administration sudden, dramatic sweep of Obama appointees is the opposite of orderly. But if your goal is kleptocracy, who needs prosecutors, anyway?One of those pesky prosecutors, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, refused to resign in Session’s purge, so he was fired. And the plot thickens: Bharara’s New York jurisdiction covers both Trump Tower and Fox News headquarters, and his office was handling allegations of wrongdoing at both institutions. I suspect the hope is that getting rid of Bharara will throw water on those investigative fires. It will be a test of America’s judicial system to see if that happens.The first of Trump’s March 4th Twitter salvos accusing Obama of wiretapping him closed with the words “This is McCarthyism!” Anyone watching has surely noticed that one of the staples of Trump’s playbook is to accuse others of precisely what he himself is doing, and this was a classic example of that adolescent subterfuge. But let’s be clear: Trump is the true heir to McCarthy. Indeed, he’s so adept in that role, in the 21st century, McCarthyism should be renamed McTrumpism.As I’ve said, I’m not sure Trump has a firm grip on sarcasm, but he does seem familiar with irony. For me, the greatest is that for all of Trump’s demonization of “others,” one of the few groups McTrumpism doesn’t target is the one that McCarthy—and until recently, the entire Republican Party—reviled the most: Russians. But now that Russia’s government has moved away from communism, and the Republican administration has apparently abandoned all principle, there’s really little daylight between the two. I can envision Trump and Putin in a couple of years, caviar running down their chins as they chortle over tales of consolidating power, squelching the press, taking down enemies—and oh yes, getting more obscenely rich with each passing day.Previously published as ‘The Rise of McTrumpism’ in The Wild Word magazine. thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:Rules for Being a Woman by Erin O’LoughlinWhy I Spent a Lifetime Marching as a Feminist by Marsha OwensA Beacon at Standing Rock by Sarah Drumm"

Big Bird and Mr. Rogers are way more popular than Congress. Americans would much rather pay their freight than the wages of politicians. Americans are horrified by the poisoned water in Flint, Mich., and are willing to invest in an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that would prevent such health hazards. And steelworkers and coal miners have seen dismemberment and death on the job and don’t want the Chemical Safety Board (CSB) eliminated or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) decimated.Americans balk at a budget that renders them less safe in their homes and workplaces.The entire function of the CSB, which Mulvaney claims Americans want abolished, is worker and public safety. It investigates catastrophic incidents and recommends changes to prevent recurrence. It doesn’t fine corporations or revoke licenses. It advocates for safety. Its annual budget is $11 million. Not billion, $11 million.Many incidents the CSB investigates are calamities. In 2005, a Texas City refinery, then owned by BP, exploded. The blast killed 15 workers and injured 180. Many of those killed were receiving training in trailers located near the unit that detonated. The CSB recommended refiners conduct instruction as far as possible away from dangerous processes, and the industry has largely complied. It’s not just workers injured in these incidents. More than 15,000 Richmond, Calif., residents sought medical treatment for breathing problems, chest pain, sore throats and headaches after an Aug. 6, 2012 fire at a Chevron refinery sent toxic smoke billowing for 10 miles. Residents sheltered in place, but the smoke still seeped into buildings. Among the many recommendations CSB made after investigating this incident was that refineries replace pipes made of a material susceptible to corrosion, which again, the industry has tried to do.After a 2015 explosion at an ExxonMobil Corp. refinery in Torrance, Calif., that injured two workers, the CSB found a much deadlier incident had been narrowly averted. Large pieces of debris from the blast that had the force of a 1.7 magnitude earthquake had nearly struck a tank containing thousands of pounds of deadly hydrofluoric acid. The explosion rained chemical ash around the plant for two miles. Release of the acid into the atmosphere could have chemically burned or killed everything living in that area. The residents of Texas City, Torrance and Richmond don’t want the administration to evaporate the CSB. Nor do workers at refineries and chemical plants. And neither do refinery owners. “I don’t think anyone in the industry wants to see the Chemical Safety Board be abolished,” Stephen Brown, a vice president with Tesoro Corp., told Bloomberg.This endorsement of the CSB came from an executive of a corporation that the agency concluded in 2014 conducted deficient oversight of its Anacortes, Wash., refinery, continuing to operate it with severely cracked and degraded equipment to the point where an explosion occurred on April 2, 2010, killing seven workers. The cost of an incident like the one at Anacortes could be more than $100 million, by the time the corporation pays fines, victim compensation and reconstruction fees. That’s more than nine times the annual budget of the CSB. And the money doesn’t erase victims’ pain.Mike Wright, director of the USW’s Health, Safety and Environment Department, explained how crucial the CSB is to workers and community members:“Its recommendations have certainly made the industry safer and helped prevent major chemical accidents. The CSB’s work has saved the lives of workers in chemical plants and oil refineries, residents who could be caught in a toxic cloud, even students in high school chemistry labs.”The CSB was created in 1990 as part of the Clean Air Act, and that might be its Achilles heel. The agency suffering the hugest hack in the Mulvaney budget is the EPA. It would lose nearly a third of its funding.A big reason for that is the administration’s rejection of science showing the human impact on climate change.“Regarding the question as to climate change, I think the president was fairly straightforward – we’re not spending money on that anymore. We consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that,” Mulvaney said.Even though the administration wants to cut 13 percent of the Education Department budget and eliminate Public Broadcasting, which is dedicated to education, Steelworkers have long been smart enough to know that saving the environment generates jobs. That is why the USW joined with the Sierra Club in 2006 to create the BlueGreen Alliance, which promotes creation of good, green jobs manufacturing and installing the likes of wind turbines and solar panels.When White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer introduced Mulvaney to reporters last week, he said, “The President’s budget blueprint keeps his promise to put America’s security first.”The budget blueprint does not do that. A less educated public is an insecure public. Americans sickened by polluted air and water are weak and vulnerable. Workers threatened by explosions and fires on the job are unsafe. As are their communities. This budget fails at placing America’s security first."

Jazz. The 1950s and ‘60s were a hotbed for cool music. And the hip musicians, who played those genres on records and in smoky, dimly lit nightclubs, were a special breed. Years later, most people still revere legendary trumpeters like Miles Davis and Chet Baker and are amazed by the lives they led. Time to add another artist of note to that list of iconic instrumentalists. His name is Lee Morgan. His life was as colorful and tragic. His talent as deep. This enlightening and haunting documentary gives him his due.Credit Swedish musical documentarian Kasper Collin for reassembling the sordid pieces of Edward Lee Morgan’s life. Collin has had some practice. He also documented the career of American avant-garde jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler in My Name Is Albert Ayler, in 2006. He continues his tributes to lesser-known jazz artists with this absolutely spellbinding non-fiction film that plays out like a torrid novel. It tells the story of an ambitious young man, who was shepherded by the greats, fought the demons of drug addiction but was finally undone by a paramour. The story is so primal and tortured it also deserves to be a feature film starring someone like Michael B. Jordan or Nate Parker. Someone with depth.Lee Morgan, born in Philly and a gifted trumpeter as a young adolescent, joined the Dizzy Gillespie Big Band at age 18 in the early ‘50s. Stints or guest performances with John Coltrane and Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers further solidified his reputation in the jazz community for blowing a sweet horn. Recording around 25 records, mostly for the famed Blue Note Records label, added sheen to his career and allure. But, as a musician’s life can go, he had his troubles. An addiction to drugs got him kicked out of Blakey’s band. He was broke, homeless and often sold his worldly possessions for a fix. Heroin.The stabilizing force in Morgan’s increasingly harrowing life was a magnanimous older woman named Helen. She fed him. Put a roof over his head. Was his ardent lover, biggest fan. If Morgan regained his footing at all, it was because of her unwavering support. She loved him with all her heart, but not unconditionally. She had her pride. When Morgan turned his attention to a younger lover, his common-law-wife was not about to take it on the chin. She had a plan—and a gun.Reconstructing Lee Morgan’s bio, through old interviews with Morgan, anecdotes from jazz greats like Wayne Shorter, photos and archival footage vividly recreates the jazz age and the trumpeter’s travails. The most soul-crushing recollections, however, come from Helen herself. Her stories can be heard on an audio cassette interview that was arranged by a night school teacher who was intrigued to find out that one of his students did a stint in prison for committing perhaps one of the most heinous acts of violence in the jazz world.Hearing Helen recall the ups and downs of her relationship that left her in an emotional fog is like hearing an old jazz 78rpm record that is so scratched you can barely make out the tune, but you do. Everything you hear and see leads up to an ill-fated, cold wintry New York City night in 1972. Performers and an audience are gathered at an East Village jazz bar. Morgan is there with a girl on his arm. A shot rings out. An irrevocable crime of passion is made. Time stands still. People live or die with the consequences.Kasper Collin has assembled a top-notch tech crew for this urban tale. The splendid cinematography of Bradford Young (Arrival, Selma) recreates scenes with the artistry of a painter. Editing by Collins with the help of Hanna Lejonqvist, Eva Hillström and Dino Jonsäter make you feel like a picture book has come alive, reeling out photos with a rhythm as precise yet eclectic as a jazz score.Watch I Called Him Morgan, and you will sit enraptured. Morgan’s music and Helen’s foggy memories will take your breath away.It’s an amazing coda to a jazz musician’s life. It’s the encore Morgan never had the chance to do.An exceptional documentary.

54,THE WORLDPOST,How Trump’s Budget Would Hurt Kids – And U.S. Workers,"Jo Becker, ContributorChildren's Rights Advocacy Director, Human Rights Watch",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-trumps-budget-would-hurt-kids-and-us-workers_us_58cfd8d8e4b0537abd9572c8,Congress should make it clear that relegating millions of children to exploitation and lifelong poverty is not consistent with either American priorities or values.,2017-03-20,A protester during a rally against President Trump's executive order on refugee admissions.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d0168c2c00002100fef580.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Trump’s proposed budget includes dramatic cuts to many programs, not to mention eliminating entire agencies. Among his proposals is a complete gutting of the Labor Department’s programs to eliminate child and forced labor worldwide.Eliminating these programs would not only hurt millions of children, but also U.S. workers. When child and forced labor flourish in other countries, it puts U.S. industries at a competitive disadvantage. It depresses wages and makes it harder to compete against those that use such labor. Ending child and forced labor abroad helps to level the playing field for U.S. companies that pay decent wages and ensure good working conditions.Trump says that his budget is aimed at reducing wasteful spending, but in fact, U.S. programs to eliminate child labor have been incredibly effective. For over 20 years, and across administrations from both parties, the U.S. has been the biggest funder of child labor elimination programs in the world, supporting more than 270 programs in 90 countries. During this same period, the number of children engaged in child labor dropped by 78 million — a remarkable one-third reduction in global child labor rates. America’s programs have played a significant part in realizing that progress and give a big bang for the buck. At $60 million a year, they make up only 0.4 percent of the entire Labor Department budget.In my work with Human Rights Watch, I’ve seen how child labor can put children’s education, health and even their lives at risk. In Morocco, I interviewed Latifah, a 12-year-old girl who worked 18-hour days as a housemaid, received little food and was beaten regularly by her employer. In Ghana, I met young boys who spent long hours hauling and crushing ore at gold mines, and risked permanent brain damage from handling toxic mercury to process the gold. In Indonesia, I met girls as young as eight who got sick with nausea and vomiting while working in tobacco fields, most likely from nicotine exposure from the tobacco plants.Child labor not only hurts children ― it also creates a huge drain on society. Children who enter the workforce at an early age end up with less education, poorer health and lower earnings as adults. They are then more likely to send their own children to work, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. The International Labor Organization has estimated that eliminating child labor would contribute trillions of dollars to the global economy. Keeping a girl out of the workforce and providing her with just one year of extra education beyond the average is estimated to increase her eventual wages by 10-20 percent.U.S. programs have been incredibly effective, but there’s still more to do ― and depleting U.S. resources would strain the consolidation of these gains. Despite steep reductions in child labor worldwide, the ILO estimates that 168 million children ― or 1 in 10 worldwide ― are still engaged in child labor. Over a third are under age 12, and over half are engaged in hazardous work that puts their health or safety directly at risk, including commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking. The ILO estimates that almost 21 million people are victims of forced labor.Last Wednesday, President Trump stated, “I want the American people to know that our budget will reflect their priorities.” Members of Congress now have the chance to show that relegating millions of children to exploitation and lifelong poverty, and turning its back on forced labor, is not consistent with either American priorities or American values or its own long-standing bipartisan priorities. Congress should make that clear by maintaining these critical programs. "

It is truly everywhere these days. And everyone is using it: men, women, I even heard some children say it. I’m talking, of course, about populism. You can’t read an article about politics these days without it. Virtually any election or referendum is set up as a struggle between an emboldened populism and an embattled establishment. There is no room for anything else.Don’t get me wrong, populism is a useful concept to understand contemporary politics in Europe, and far beyond, but only under two strict conditions. First, it must be clearly defined and, second, it should be applied as one of several concepts to understand politics. Unfortunately, this is not the case in most accounts of politics and populism today. The dominance of the populism lens makes it so we see both too much populism and too little non-populism.Populism is used in many different ways, mostly devoid of any clear definition, instead broadly referring to irresponsible or untraditional politics, such as promising everything to everyone or speaking in a folksy way. Neither is specific to populism, and both are in fact rather widespread in political campaigning more generally. Instead, populism is best defined as the following:An ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups ― “the pure people” and “the corrupt elite” ― and argues that politics should be an expression of the volonté générale or general will of the people.Populism is both monist and moralist. Populists believe that all people share the same interests and values and that the key distinction between the people and the elite is moral, i.e. “pure” versus “corrupt.” They present politics as a struggle of all against one, one against all, which, ironically, is confirmed by the dominant media narrative of an emboldened populism versus an embattled establishment. There is no doubt that populism is an important aspect of contemporary politics; populist parties are represented in most European parliaments and populist presidents and prime ministers rule in both European and American countries. But most of these parties and politicians are not just populists; they combine populism with other ideological features. Left populists combine populism with some form of socialism ― think Syriza in Greece or Chavismo in Venezuela ― while right populists primarily combine it with authoritarianism and nativism ― think U.S. President Donald Trump in America or Geert Wilders in the Netherlands.Before the rise of left populism, right populists would be discussed as “radical right” rather than “populists,” while a combination of the two, populist radical right (or, if you wish, radical right populism), is most appropriate. This is not just an academic matter, however. Because Western media tend to perceive the contemporary challenge to liberal democracy exclusively in terms of populism, they focus predominantly on anti-establishment sentiments by political outsiders. Hence, media outlets were quick to celebrate conservative Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s victory of “good populism” over Geert Wilders’ “bad populism.”What was missed, however, was that the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, or VVD, leader Rutte and Christian Democratic Appeal, or CDA, leader Sybrand Buma conducted an increasingly authoritarian and nativist campaign. Both CDA and VVD presented themselves as defenders of “Christian” and “Dutch values,” including the singing of the national anthem and the racist tradition of Black Pete. VVD parliamentary leader Halbe Zijlstra even suggested Easter eggs were under threat from Islam and Muslims, assisted by secular, left-wing fellow travelers. And Rutte took it a step further by explicitly targeting immigrants and refugees in his “act normal” campaign, implying that even descendants of immigrants are at best probationary Dutch citizens.But whereas most media saw too little in the Dutch elections, they saw too much in the British European Union referendum and the U.S. presidential elections. Both are now routinely hailed as populist victories, which is an exaggeration at best and a falsehood at worst. While the United Kingdom Independence Party, or UKIP, played an important role in pushing the “Leave” camp over the 50 percent mark, the push for Brexit was always predominantly a Conservative endeavor. Hence, many Brits didn’t vote against some kind of “corrupt elite,” be it British or European, but rather for re-establishing national sovereignty, as they perceive it, in line with a significant part of the Tory elite.Similarly, despite all the hype, the 2016 U.S. presidential elections were, first and foremost, just another presidential election, in which Republicans voted Republican and Democrats voted Democrat. It might be true that populism motivated some angry white working class men in the “American heartland” to turn out, which might have swung these states and thereby the whole election, but they constituted at best a tiny minority of the Republican electorate. The vast majority of people who voted for Trump did so for traditional Republican reasons like abortion, immigration, taxes, and, most notably, partisanship.In short, it is time to put the populism frame back in its correct place. Yes, populism is an important feature of contemporary politics, but not all anti-establishment politics is populism and populist parties are not just about populism. In fact, to accurately understand politicians like Trump and Wilders, and the challenge they pose to liberal democracy, authoritarianism and nativism are at least as important as populism, if not more. Moreover, while established politicians mainly adopt populism in their campaign rhetoric, authoritarianism and nativism are actually implemented in their policies, as we can see in recent responses to the refugee crisis and terrorism, from the EU-Turkey deal to the state of emergency in France. If we want to truly understand contemporary politics, and protect liberal democracy, it is time we focus on all aspects of the populist radical right challenge, including from inside the political establishment, not just on the populism of the outsiders. Because under the cover of fighting off the “populists,” the political establishment is slowly but steadily hollowing out the liberal democratic system."

I wanted to develop a creative tool that would challenge the period taboo and encourage others to interact with menstruation in a way they never had before. Toni the Tampon was, what I thought, a nonthreatening collection of cotton who could accomplish this ― whose goal was to make you laugh and rethink why it is we are so ashamed of a process that half the world experiences on a recurring basis.Around the same time as I created Toni the Tampon and my period coloring book, I was navigating through a constant questioning of my gender identity and feelings of dysphoria that intensified during menstruation. Consequently, my fight to break the period taboo became inextricably tangled up in a journey to feel comfortable in my own body and gender presentation. In fact, the first time I ever publicly came out as genderqueer to more than just close friends and coworkers was through a photo of Toni and a long Instagram post about nonbinary, intersex, and trans* menstruators, followed shortly by interviews with HuffingtonPost and Mashable where I requested the use of no pronouns and openly discussed my identity with strangers for the very first time.Taking photos of a tampon in public, with everyone staring at you and wondering what on earth you’re doing, is difficult enough without asking those same people to also reflect on the way we approach gender identity in our society.

They told me that I was a child abuser, a science-denier and that my queer identity was all in my head ― a mental illness. They told me that my decision to include trans and gender nonconforming people in the menstrual movement was yet another example of “liberal insanity” trying to drown our country in ignorance. The waves of hatred crashed down hard, and I felt so completely overwhelmed that, for a few moments, I lost track of what the point of my work even was anymore.But as the harassment continued to escalate, all of the hate, aggression and threats of violence began reminding me why I started Toni the Tampon in the first place.

No, my goal was to bring inclusive menstrual health education to everyone, but especially to those who did not agree with me. To the communities who needed it the most, communities like the one I grew up in, where strict adherence to conservative values restricted my own ability to learn about and love my body.The best thing about the backlash is that it has given me the chance to reach out to these very communities ― to kids and people in places I never dreamed would hear about my period coloring book. And if I was able to reach just one person, one girl who thought she had to sit out of soccer practice because she forgot a tampon and was too scared to say anything, one boy or nonbinary kid who thought their period was something only women could experience, or one menstruator who used to think that periods were something to be ashamed of ― if my message of inclusion and empowerment was able to reach just one of them, then it was all worth it.

65,POLITICS,Chesapeake Bay's Booming Oyster Industry Is Alarmed By Trump's EPA Budget Cuts,Alexander C.

The slippery, jagged-shelled bivalves became so popular in the decades after the Civil War that a gold rush ensued in the Chesapeake Bay and its teeming estuaries, at times spurring violent rivalries that became known as “the oyster wars.” But the Rappahannock Oyster Co. ― the first iteration of it, at least ― died in 1991 with Croxton’s grandfather. By the time Croxton and his paternal cousin, Travis, started growing oysters as a hobby on the family’s old property, the oyster industry in the region had all but collapsed.Overfishing over the last century badly hurt wild oyster populations. Diseases ravaged the remaining creatures in the 1950s. Runoff pollution from farms and sewage treatment plants tainted the waters with phosphorus and nitrogen. Bacteria and algae fed by the pollution blossomed into massive, toxic plumes that sucked up oxygen and blocked sunlight, stymying fish populations and thinning the marsh grasses that oysters cling to to keep from slipping into the soft, silty mud and dying. Things started changing in the last several years as the effects of an Environmental Protection Agency cleanup that began in 1983 under President Ronald Reagan took effect. (President Barack Obama imposed even stricter targets in 2009). Levels of phosphorus and nitrogen, a third of which settled on the water from being wheezed by power plants into the air, fell. The water cleared. Grasses grew back in dense thickets, tightening the river bed with roots. By 2004, Croxton quit his day job and started cultivating oysters full time. At first, restaurants in the area, knowing how dirty the water had been, wouldn’t buy his product, even though it was safe to eat. He shipped them to upscale eateries in New York. But as water quality improved over the past decade, local demand came roaring back. Croxton opened his fifth restaurant Thursday evening and plans to cut the ribbon on a sixth in September.Now the program that saved the Chesapeake Bay oyster industry is in jeopardy. The budget President Donald Trump proposed Thursday would eliminate funding for the $73 million initiative, along with more than 50 other programs and 31 percent of the EPA’s overall budget. Funding isn’t the only thing on the chopping block. Trump vowed to boost economic growth by axing regulations, particularly environmental rules he blames for holding businesses back. Already, his administration has scrapped a rule protecting streams from coal mine pollution, tossed out a directive ordering oil and gas drillers to report methane emissions and overturned a regulation giving the EPA power to police fertilizer and manure runoff from farms, the chief contaminants in the Chesapeake Bay.“Oysters are filter feeders,” Croxton, 47, told The Huffington Post in a recent interview. “We can’t operate without clean water and a good environment.” It wasn’t long ago that another Republican eager to placate his party’s populist wing took aim at cleanup efforts pursued by his Democratic predecessor. Weeks after taking office in January 2015, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan blocked regulations aimed at limiting Eastern Shore poultry farmers’ use of chicken manure on their fields. The phosphorus-rich fertilizer is a leading source of runoff in the Chesapeake Bay.  A month later, the Hogan administration received a letter from the EPA warning that, if the state dropped new manure rules, it would need another policy to meet the agency’s pollution limits. Maryland Democrats scrambled to pass bills that would have done just that. In response, Hogan made an about-face. He ordered an immediate ban that targeted fields oversaturated with manure, even though he gave other farmers more time to comply, local NPR station WYPR reported. “We have listened to the agricultural and environmental communities to find a fair and balanced plan for limiting phosphorus,” Hogan said in a statement at the time. “The enhanced Phosphorus Management Tool regulations … will protect water quality in the Chesapeake Bay while still supporting a vibrant agriculture industry in Maryland.”In a statement to The Huffington Post, the governor vowed he would “always fight to protect our state’s most important natural asset.”“If any of these budget proposals ever become law, we will take a serious look at how to address them during our budget process next year,” Amelia Chasse, the governor’s spokeswoman, said. “Since taking office, Governor Hogan has invested more than $3 billion in efforts to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay and will remain a fierce advocate going forward.”Conservationists, clean water advocates and oyster farmers hope Trump will have a similar change of heart. Or, at least, that Congress will withhold approval for any budget that doesn’t include funding for the project. Republican lawmakers, some of whom already joined Democrats in opposing Trump’s cuts to a similar cleanup effort in the Great Lakes, are expected to oppose the reductions.“This just makes no sense. We are in disbelief,” said William C. Baker, president of the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation. “The EPA’s role in this cleanup is nothing less than fundamental. It’s not just important; it is critical.” Oyster farmers emerged over the past decade as a force in Virginia and Maryland. In the Old Dominion State, farmers sold $16 million in oysters in 2015 alone, besting all other states on the East Coast, according to the Virginia Institute of Marine Science’s 10th annual report on the state’s aquaculture industry. Though smaller in Maryland, the industry has ballooned in the last eight years, said Jeffrey Brainard, a spokesman for the federally-funded Maryland Sea Grant, which is also earmarked for cuts.  In just the last five years, farmers in the Chesapeake Bay region helped double sales of farmed oyster on the East Coast to $155 million per year, said Bob Rheault, executive director of the East Coast Shellfish Growers Association. “We’re literally an engine of job growth, especially in Chesapeake and especially for the watermen of that region who are up for the challenge,” Rheault said. “These proposed cuts are just job killers.”“It’s like, my God,” he added, sighing loudly, “if we don’t have clean water, we don’t have customer confidence.” Uncertainty over the future of the EPA cleanup program has spooked some who left other jobs in recent years to join the booming industry. Johnny Shockley, 54, quit commercial fishing to build a sustainable oyster hatchery on Hooper’s Island, the bayside archipelago where he grew, a third-generation waterman. Now the man The Washingtonian once called “the Chesapeake Bay’s hope on the half shell” worries his small empire of sustainable oyster hatcheries could be imperiled. “One of the reasons why folks were getting in and willing to change their lives and commit their livelihoods to these efforts is the support we’ve seen from the federal government in the last 25 to 30 years,” Shockley said. “All of a sudden we’ve been threatened to see that all taken away.”Shockley wants to see the Chesapeake Bay oyster industry return to its former glory but not its old ways. Back then, wild shellfish were plucked from the water with greedy abandon ― a tragedy of the commons.  “We had billions of oysters in the bay when we hit the shores here back in the 1600s and quickly found them to be a strong economic force,” he said. “We totally upset the ecology of our estuaries.” Now he and other farmers grow oysters in submerged cages, helping them to achieve specific sizes and shapes. And that’s paying off. “The heritage is really unique for the Chesapeake, and I’ve found that oysters coming from this part of the country have a lot of meat, compared to, say, oysters in northern Canada or New England,” Julie Qiu, a Brooklyn-based oyster connoisseur who writes the blog In a Half Shell, told HuffPost. “There’s this kind of mushroomy flavor in them that’s pretty unique to the region.”She now ranks growers from the Chesapeake Bay among her favorites. One of them is Pleasure House Oysters, a boutique hatchery near Virginia Beach that harvests no more than 1,500 oysters by hand each week. Chris Ludford founded the company in 2010 when the population of blue crabs he once fished shrank. “I was a refugee from the blue crab industry,” Ludford said. “We hit an all-time low in the harvest of blue crabs and needed to give the resources a break.”Oysters are just one industry that could be harmed if the Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort is dismantled. The Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club, the 124-year-old environmental advocacy titan, slammed the White House for endangering an economic driver worth “over $1 trillion.” “This is an outrageous and unnecessary cut that violates a longstanding, bipartisan consensus that cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay is good for our region and good for our nation,” Kate Addleson, director of the state chapter, said in a statement. “The progress being made toward protecting this critical resource for the region supports fisheries, oyster and crab populations, tourism and other industries ― really the whole ecosystem. All of these beneficiaries of the program would be at risk if this reckless cut was to go through.”Despite this, Croxton said he remains “hopelessly optimistic.” He said his three children’s futures remain his foremost concern, and if business goes downhill, he’ll consider his options. But for now, he’ll wait it out.“Even if this one administration is going to create a hiccup, I hope it’ll be a four-year hiccup and we’ll get back on track. It took us much longer than four years to create this situation. It’ll take longer than four years to get out of it. I’m not going to be completely discouraged by a four-year slack.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misspelled Croxton’s last name. "

Now the man The Washingtonian once called “the Chesapeake Bay’s hope on the half shell” worries his small empire of sustainable oyster hatcheries could be imperiled. “One of the reasons why folks were getting in and willing to change their lives and commit their livelihoods to these efforts is the support we’ve seen from the federal government in the last 25 to 30 years,” Shockley said. “All of a sudden we’ve been threatened to see that all taken away.”Shockley wants to see the Chesapeake Bay oyster industry return to its former glory but not its old ways. Back then, wild shellfish were plucked from the water with greedy abandon ― a tragedy of the commons.  “We had billions of oysters in the bay when we hit the shores here back in the 1600s and quickly found them to be a strong economic force,” he said. “We totally upset the ecology of our estuaries.” Now he and other farmers grow oysters in submerged cages, helping them to achieve specific sizes and shapes. And that’s paying off. “The heritage is really unique for the Chesapeake, and I’ve found that oysters coming from this part of the country have a lot of meat, compared to, say, oysters in northern Canada or New England,” Julie Qiu, a Brooklyn-based oyster connoisseur who writes the blog In a Half Shell, told HuffPost. “There’s this kind of mushroomy flavor in them that’s pretty unique to the region.”She now ranks growers from the Chesapeake Bay among her favorites. One of them is Pleasure House Oysters, a boutique hatchery near Virginia Beach that harvests no more than 1,500 oysters by hand each week. Chris Ludford founded the company in 2010 when the population of blue crabs he once fished shrank. “I was a refugee from the blue crab industry,” Ludford said. “We hit an all-time low in the harvest of blue crabs and needed to give the resources a break.”Oysters are just one industry that could be harmed if the Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort is dismantled. The Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club, the 124-year-old environmental advocacy titan, slammed the White House for endangering an economic driver worth “over $1 trillion.” “This is an outrageous and unnecessary cut that violates a longstanding, bipartisan consensus that cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay is good for our region and good for our nation,” Kate Addleson, director of the state chapter, said in a statement. “The progress being made toward protecting this critical resource for the region supports fisheries, oyster and crab populations, tourism and other industries ― really the whole ecosystem. All of these beneficiaries of the program would be at risk if this reckless cut was to go through.”Despite this, Croxton said he remains “hopelessly optimistic.” He said his three children’s futures remain his foremost concern, and if business goes downhill, he’ll consider his options. But for now, he’ll wait it out.“Even if this one administration is going to create a hiccup, I hope it’ll be a four-year hiccup and we’ll get back on track. It took us much longer than four years to create this situation. It’ll take longer than four years to get out of it. I’m not going to be completely discouraged by a four-year slack.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misspelled Croxton’s last name. "
67,POLITICS,Jimmy Breslin Showed Us How To Cover A President Who Lies. Talk To The Gravedigger.,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-breslin-showed-how-to-torture-people-like-trump-talk-to-the-gravedigger_us_58ceea50e4b0be71dcf599c2,The newspaper columnist who died Sunday shined a light on the powerful by talking to the powerless.,2017-03-19,"President Donald Trump, seen in the gold-curtained East Room of the White House.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ceefcb1d0000cf3b7cf3b3.jpeg?cache=yIbGmMx282&ops=crop_29_117_2965_1544%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — The gravedigger doesn’t have any reason to lie to you.If the grave is deep enough and wide enough, that’s all that matters. The lies can be told by the shiny casket going into the dirt, by the funeral parlor salesman who talked the grieving relatives up to the gold-patina model, and by those mourners who didn’t really want to be there.But the man who shovels out the deep hole in the ground with a back hoe has no reason to embellish. He’ll just tell you what he thinks, if you ask.Jimmy Breslin, the columnist who died Sunday, knew that in 1963 when he framed the funeral of John F. Kennedy through the experience of Clifton Pollard.Pollard, an African-American man who dug graves at Arlington National Cemetery for $3.01 an hour, dug the slain president’s final resting place. He couldn’t watch the burial ceremony because he was digging more graves.Still, he called it “an honor.”Breslin’s story about the day is the one that’s remembered most out of the hundreds written, and it offers a lesson both about him, and for the reporters in Washington more than 50 years later covering a White House occupied by man who doesn’t need to be talked up to the gold model, and who has a strained relationship with the truth.The lesson is, if you want truth, you have to leave your desk, step away from your computer, and must certainly ignore your Twitter feed.“Breslin hardly ever came to the office. He just sent his stuff in,” said Anthony Mancini, a journalism professor at Brooklyn College who worked at the New York Post in the late 1960s when Breslin wrote for the then-liberal paper.“Jimmy got up in the morning, and put on his shoes. He never learned to drive, so he walked, took the subway, a cab, whatever,” said Denis Hamill, a former New York Daily News columnist and friend of Breslin’s.“He wouldn’t sit at a desk and think up what to write. He would form his opinion based on the legwork that he did,” Hamill said. “He went out and really did the work.”The results were stories that helped expose the corruption immortalized in the book City For Sale, revealed New York City cops had tortured suspects with a stun gun, and infuriated powerful people, including Breslin’s friends like former New York Gov. Hugh Carey. Breslin dubbed him “Society Carey,” and Carey declined to run in the next election.Breslin ran into some trouble in the era of “new journalism” when some of his regulars in his columns were deemed to be composite characters. “They were playing fast and loose in those days,” said Mancini, noting that in the era of “fake news,” reporters need to avoid some old-school liberties. “That was a little Trumpian.”Hamill said much of the concern was overblown, though, by people who didn’t like Breslin, and just couldn’t believe that the truth was true.“Most of the columns that looked fictional were real, and some of the people in them were not happy because they revealed real things about their lives,” Hamill said.“Shelly the bail bondsman was real. Marvin the Torch was real,” Hamill said, referring to some of Breslin’s recurring characters. “I met them.”For Hamill, the larger point is that Breslin, better than anyone, used the experiences of regular people to speak truth to power.In the era of President Donald Trump, it’s a skill the media would do well to rediscover. Reporters certainly do try to humanize the news these days, but often it’s the Trump tweet that dominates the headlines. And all too often, the press is cowed by claims that it is being unfair when reporters ask Trump about falsehoods.When Trump held his joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday, it was not the American journalists who asked Trump the hard question about the White House’s inflammatory and unsubstantiated claim that the British government helped former President Barack Obama tap Trump Tower. It was the Germans.“Breslin would have been the perfect guy to really go and illustrate the lies and deceit that Donald Trump has launched upon the nation and the world, by going to the little guys, the guys who had contracts with him and got stiffed, the guys at the casino who got laid off, the people who Trump University swindled,” Hamill said.Even in a laudatory moment in 1963, in a column that extolled Kennedy and the powerful fortitude of his widow, Breslin very intentionally included the fact that Clifton Pollard could not watch the burial.“He was very interested in what people did, the work they did, and what they meant to the world,” Hamill said, recalling a conversation with Breslin about Pollard. “He said what bothered me about [Pollard] was he was allowed to dig [Kennedy’s] grave but he wasn’t allowed to go over and watch the ceremony because he was a black guy and a working guy, and wearing shabby clothes. He couldn’t go over and mingle with the big shots. It’s what was wrong with this country.”Breslin probably wouldn’t have wanted to cover Merkel and Trump’s White House events, as staged as such things are. But you can be sure he would have asked the aggravating question.Mancini recalled watching Breslin on a panel where the columnist mentioned with satisfaction the fact that an interest group was furious about something he wrote.“Good,” Breslin said. “The more people we get angry the better.”If the anger is sparked by someone like a gravedigger, there’s a much better chance it will be true than if it’s delivered in 140 characters by a man who used to impersonate his own press agent. And there’s a better chance it will move other regular people.Breslin called it the “gravedigger theory.” Now it’s a lesson from the grave. Breslin surely hopes it haunts Trump.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Carey lost re-election. He declined to run."
68,POLITICS,Nancy Pelosi: Trump And His Administration Need To 'Grow Up' And Stop Repeating Baseless Claims,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-trump-wiretap_us_58ceabc5e4b0be71dcf57d59,The House's top Democrat said the FBI should clear up that there is no evidence to substantiate the president's claim that he was wiretapped by his predecessor.,2017-03-19,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said President Donald Trump made a ""terrible accusation"" against former President Barack Obama.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ceacdd2c00002100fef2ff.jpeg?cache=164uIcu6RZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said President Donald Trump and his administration need to “just grow up” and stop doubling down on unsubstantiated claims that former President Barack Obama and British intelligence colluded to spy on him. In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Pelosi said it was “really important” that FBI Director James Comey say publicly that there is no evidence of what she called a “terrible accusation.” “Of course it’s not true,” she said in the interview, conducted on Friday. “So let’s just grow up. ... The Justice Department, the FBI has to really clear this. Because otherwise this administration has decided that they, with impunity, can say anything, and it’s really damaging.” Trump claimed earlier this month in a series of tweets that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the presidential campaign, providing no evidence. The White House has scrambled since then to defend him for it ― even at the risk of alienating a major U.S. ally. Last week, White House press secretary Sean Spicer cited Fox News commentator Andrew Napolitano, a former New Jersey judge, who said that British intelligence helped Obama with surveillance of Trump. The Government Communications Headquarters, which is the U.K.’s version of the National Security Agency, made a rare public statement to call the claim “nonsense” and “utterly ridiculous.” White House officials assured the U.K. they wouldn’t repeat the claim again, according to British Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman. But publicly, neither the president nor Spicer have shown any remorse, insisting they were simply citing Napolitano. “All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television,” Trump said on Friday at a press conference. “I didn’t make an opinion on it.” Administration officials still haven’t offered any evidence of Trump’s claims about surveillance, even at the request of Congress, which has now devoted valuable time and resources to investigate a conspiracy theory the president heard on “Fox and Friends.” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said Sunday that information the Justice Department provided to the committee on Friday had no evidence to back up Trump’s claims about wiretapping. Comey, who heads the FBI, will go before the House Intelligence Committee on Monday and is expected to talk about the matter. He’s also slated to talk about Russian efforts to influence the election. He reportedly asked the Justice Department to publicly refute the claim earlier this month and some expect him to do so himself at the hearing."

But they don’t appear to have a strategy, or even the energy, for a coordinated fight against President Donald Trump’s conservative court pick.Chalk it up to Trump’s chaotic administration, or to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s low-key approach. Democrats just haven’t treated Gorsuch’s nomination as the kind of high-profile ideological battle that Supreme Court choices traditionally bring about. Even in the days leading up the hearing, it’s felt more like an afterthought on Capitol Hill.“I hope the questions are good,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told The Huffington Post on Wednesday when asked about her thoughts heading into the hearing. Asked if there are any particular issues she plans to press Gorsuch on, she replied, “Not right now.”Progressive advocacy groups have been demanding a real fight against Gorsuch, who, as an appellate judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, built a record of opposing reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, civil rights, workers’ rights, immigrants’ rights and environmental protections. Led by NARAL Pro-Choice America, 11 organizations sent a letter to Senate Democrats this month torching them for having “failed to demonstrate a strong, unified resistance to this nominee, despite the fact that he is an ultra-conservative jurist who will undermine our basic freedoms…. We need you to do better.”They also delivered more than 1 million petitions to the Senate urging Democrats “to oppose Donald Trump’s extreme anti-choice Supreme Court nominee.”Democrats on the committee certainly plan to ask tough questions of Gorsuch. They’re just all over the place.“We can use these hearings to put the spotlight on big special interests,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). “The test for Gorsuch is: is he willing to dissociate himself from them? In my view, the burden is on him to persuade us of that fact, particularly given that big special interests are spending tens of millions in dark money to try to help him get on the court.”Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he plans to pack in as many questions as possible, on as many topics as possible, because Gorsuch hasn’t given him clear answers on things he’s asked him about.“Workers protections. Consumer rights. Women’s health care. Privacy rights. The independence of the judiciary,” said Blumenthal, who made news last month when revealing that Gorsuch told him in private that he found Trump’s attacks on judges who ruled against his travel ban “demoralizing.” In the wake of those comments, and pushback by the White House, Schumer wrote in a New York Times op-ed that the episode “only raises concerns about his independence.”“I will be pressing him and aggressively questioning him on all of these issues because he has an obligation to come clean with the American people before he assumes a lifetime appointment on the nation’s highest court,” Blumenthal said.“There’s so many issues, I don’t know where to start,” added Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). “A contemporary issue is the relationship between the executive and the judiciary. I think that’s going to be tested time and again by this president.”But some advocates aren’t sure Democrats have it in them to put Gorsuch on the defensive. And Gorsuch has been preparing judiciously to meet whatever curveballs the Senate Judiciary Committee may throw his way.“I don’t think the Democrats are going to get him to say things that are wildly objectionable,” said Drew Courtney, a spokesman for People for the American Way, an organization that has long been involved in Supreme Court nomination fights. Courtney said senators would be best served by focusing on his record.In an attempt to crystallize their strategy, Democrats this past week unveiled something of an offensive on Capitol Hill, appearing alongside sympathetic plaintiffs who have been on the receiving end of a Gorsuch opinion. The goal, in Schumer’s words, is to paint this judge as someone who “sided with the powerful against the powerless.”But not everyone is convinced that the “little guy” approach is the right tack to use against Gorsuch. Some say it’s relatively easy to rebut that argument: One of the judge’s more popular opinions ― on immigration, a topic that’s central to Trump’s agenda ― found favor with an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. The decision effectively prevented the man’s deportation.“I don’t think [Gorsuch] is going to do everything President Trump thinks he will do in his favor,” said Timothy Cook, the Oklahoma lawyer who represented the immigrant in that case. He added that he thinks Gorsuch would be a good Supreme Court justice.Progressive senators, like Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), have already said they’ll oppose Gorsuch’s confirmation in the full Senate. But many are waiting to see how he handles himself in the hearing before deciding how they’ll vote, though they’re skeptical. Gorsuch clearly has a conservative record on the bench ― some commentators have observed he is even more conservative than the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who he’d be replacing on the Supreme Court. He was among those on a list of judges Trump announced during the campaign that was assembled with the help of The Federalist Society and The Heritage Foundation, two prominent conservative groups.“He has a very high bar to clear, both in proving that he can be an independent check on the executive and that he will give less powerful plaintiffs a fair shake before the Supreme Court,” said a Senate Democratic leadership aide. “Democrats are going to push him hard to answer direct questions on both of those topics.”“If his answers are anything like they’ve been in private meetings, he isn’t going to win anyone over,” added the aide.Gorsuch will need some Democratic support, which he did get in 2006 when he was unanimously confirmed to the 10th Circuit. It takes 60 votes to advance his nomination in the Senate, and there are only 52 Republicans. If Republicans can’t hit 60, it’s possible that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will eliminate that so-called filibuster rule altogether. If that happens, Gorsuch would only need 51 votes to be confirmed. Democrats, for now, are relying on that rule for leverage.“I will use every tool available, including the filibuster, to oppose him,” Blumenthal said this week. “We will use every tool at our disposal.”Out of tradition, one Democrat, Sen. Michael Bennet (Colo.), will introduce Gorsuch on Monday alongside fellow Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner (R), according to Politico. At least one other senator up for re-election in 2018, Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), has said he’s open to voting for Gorsuch. That’s not acceptable to some of their progressive allies. In a call with reporters earlier this month, some groups warned that Senate Democrats will pay a price if they help Gorsuch get confirmed.“We want the Democrats to act as the opposition party, not as the minority party,” said Murshed Zaheed, political director of Credo Action. Those who support him “will permanently damage his or her political career.”"

He was 88.He had been recovering from pneumonia, his wife Ronnie Eldridge, a former New York City Council member, confirmed to the The New York Times. His last column for the Daily News ran in 2012, but The Daily Beast began running new writing from him late last year after years of reprinting his classic columns. In his decades-spanning career writing for several outlets, Breslin found fame for his portrayals of ordinary New Yorkers and the city’s scruffy anti-heroes, often those at the sidelines of major world news events. In a 1980 Daily News story, Breslin told the story of the New York City cops who retrieved John Lennon’s body moments after he’d been fatally shot. For an iconic 1963 column in The New York Herald Tribune, he tracked down the cemetery worker tasked with digging President John F. Kennedy’s grave. Breslin’s depiction of gravedigger Clifton Pollard encapsulated his knack for letting his subjects’ details speak for themselves: Pollard is 42. He is a slim man with a mustache who was born in Pittsburgh and served as a private in the 352nd Engineers battalion in Burma in World War II. He is an equipment operator, grade 10, which means he gets $3.01 an hour. One of the last to serve John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who was the thirty-fifth President of this country, was a working man who earns $3.01 an hour and said it was an honor to dig the grave.That piece is often cited as the type of writing that made Breslin the legendary storyteller he’s remembered as.“[I]t showed how a writer can break away from the crowd, even on the biggest possible story; how, in the words of the great editor Gene Roberts, an enterprising reporter can zig when everyone else zags,” the Poynter Institute for Media Studies wrote.He received many awards for his writing, most notably the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1986. The board awarding him the prize praised him “for columns which consistently champion ordinary citizens.”Breslin said his pursuit of those characters was central to good journalism.“What’s wrong with journalists today? They don’t go out,” Breslin said in a 2015 interview with the City University of New York TV station. “Television would be your answer. They’re all on television giving the news. As you listen to them talk, you know they haven’t left the office. They have no authentic spirit to the voice as they’re telling you what happened in New York, because they don’t know and they don’t bother with it.”The Pulitzer board pointed to an emotionally wrought 1985 column that weaved a story of the AIDS crisis through the lens of one inflicted young man:“You have Karposi’s sarcoma,” the doctor said. “One of them was on an artery. That caused your trouble. There are 10 to 12 more in there.”In another fascinating 1977 column that spoke to the reach of Breslin’s writing, he published letters written to him by notorious New York serial killer “Son of Sam,” who had yet to identified as David Berkowitz.“If he wants any further contact, all he has to do is call or write me at The Daily News,” Breslin wrote. “It’s simple to get me. The only people I don’t answer are bill collectors.” Breslin also authored several lauded books, including The Church That Forgot Christ, a response to the Catholic Church’s many sex scandals; How the Good Guys Finally Won, a glimpse into the politicians who helped bring down President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal; and a novel, The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight. In 1969, Breslin ran as writer Norman Mailer’s running mate in an unsuccessful New York mayoral bid.Their campaign manager described the ill-fated run as “a dull campaign in a sad city with a grimace of despair carved into its face. Mailer and Breslin managed, for a short season, to turn that grimace into a grin.”He is survived by his wife, four children, three stepchildren and 12 grandchildren.

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said information provided by the Department of Justice contained no proof of Trump's unsubstantiated claim.,2017-03-19,"Nunes, right, on Wednesday, announcing that the House Intelligence Committee had no evidence to support Trump's claim.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ce8d1f14000088060704d5.jpeg?cache=J9bQeTXzN6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee on Sunday announced that evidence provided by President Donald Trump’s administration does not prove his unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor Barack Obama ordered wiretapping on Trump Tower during last year’s campaign.“Was there a physical wiretap of Trump Tower? No, there never was,” Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said on “Fox News Sunday.” “The information we got on Friday continues to lead us in that direction.” The DOJ was originally asked to turn over the information on Monday, but that afternoon, asked for an extension.Nunes also said that “there was no warrant that I’m aware of” authorizing any wiretapping of Trump Tower, confirming what top intelligence officials under Obama have also determined.Trump and his staff continue to defend the allegation, even after both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees found last week that they have no evidence to suggest any sort of activity.Trump on Friday continued to suggest that his claim was true, awkwardly joking about it during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.On Monday, the House Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing, which will include testimony from FBI director James Comey. Earlier this month, Comey reportedly told the Justice Department to publicly refute the claim, and the committee’s ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said last week that he expects Comey will debunk the claim at Monday’s hearing.Schiff also confirmed on Sunday that the DOJ’s documents did not support Trump’s claim.“I got a classified briefing on their response. They delivered it after most of us had left town. But once again, no evidence to support the president’s claim that he was wiretapped by his predecessor,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Yet several top Republicans still believe a congressional probe is necessary. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday that the committee “will be taking them seriously” at its own hearing later this month.When asked if there was any evidence backing up Trump’s claim, Cotton said: “Not that I’ve seen, and not that I’m aware of,” on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But as with all the other claims related to this matter, the Senate Intelligence Committee will be taking them seriously and approaching it in a deliberative fashion to review not only documents from the past year but also taking testimony of several witnesses.”House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said on “Fox News Sunday” that while he also has not seen evidence of the wiretap claim, “we will investigate each and every one of these things.”And Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) implored Trump to “explain to us on the Intelligence Committee and to the American people,” telling NBC’s “Meet the Press” that she hopes to “get to the bottom of this.”Responding to Collins, Schiff said that “there is nothing at the bottom.”“I have a lot of respect for Susan Collins, but I have to differ with her on this. She said we need to ‘get to the bottom of this.’ We are at the bottom of this,” Schiff said. “There is nothing at the bottom.”This article has been updated with comments from Schiff and Collins."

Many in the LGBTQ+ community have long been waiting for a Someday-My-Prince(ss)-Will-Come moment.This anticipation is part of the reason that concepts like Joey Graceffa’s “Don’t Wait” video play so well with the queer community. They tap into the desires of generations of the LGBTQ+ community to see characters like themselves find their “Happily Ever After.”Apparently, the community will have to wait a bit longer for that.Like Rachel Maddow’s release of Trump’s tax returns this week, the queerness of Beauty and the Beast does not live up to the hype surrounding it. And, as I left the theater, I realized that the defining of LeFou as “gay” had undermined my experience of the movie as a whole.

Only under a fragile, Gaston-esque definition of masculinity does such an act even read as queer. In fact, in some Western traditions, like Ultra-orthodox Judaism, dancing with your own sex is preferable in certain settings to dancing with members of the opposite sex.Additionally, examining Christian traditions, you will be hard put to find a biblical text which would condemn this “gay moment.” In fact, you will find the opposite. Early Christianity was more comfortable with displays of affection between members of the same sex than modern Christianity.

The film questions the legitimacy of labels, from the opening query, “For who could learn to love a beast?” to the Prince’s roar, “I am not a beast!” It shows the power of labels through Gaston’s manipulation of the villagers to attack the castle, and it shows the problem of labels by flipping the idea of what constitutes a “beast.”Unfortunately, in the discourse around the film, “gay” has proven to have the same powers as “beast.” This point is shown in the timing of the boycott movement: it preceded the release of the movie.

The character is similar to his other well-known characters such as Olaf in Frozen or Elder Cunningham in The Book of Mormon, and his performance of Beauty and the Beast’s classic songs are, at times, delightful. In many ways, his is a charming tribute to the animated version of the character and would have been satisfactory as such.However, rereading LeFou as “gay” necessarily changes his reception. What were adorable antics in Gad’s asexual talking snowman do not play quite as well when they are translated into Disney’s first “gay” main character. Instead, they are transformed into gay stereotypes performed for a laugh by a heterosexual man for a largely heterosexual audience. Despite Condon’s own gayness, the queerness of LeFou does not feel like it was written for the LGBTQ+ community. Instead, it was encoded for a heterosexual gaze.This fact is no more apparent than in LeFou’s own queer visibility. By even the most generous readings of the performance, LeFou is in the closet. A queer character written for a queer audience should have no need to hide his identity. Likewise, as Condon has interpreted the character, he plays into the tragic caricature of queer individuals pining away after the unattainable straight object of their affections. This idea not only recapitulates heterosexual preconceptions of queerness but also ties into and confirms their fears about homosexuality.Reprise: “How Long Must This Go On”Don’t get me wrong. In a Disney-verse where the true “magic” of the “Magic Kingdom” is how everyone is neatly cisgender and heteronormative (and, until recently, white), even caricatured tokenism is welcomed as visibility.

Not only do Republicans hold the majority in the General Assembly, they hold an overwhelming majority.

Maps of many of the districts look like snakes and toilet bowls. If every Democrat in the district voted and a good number of Republicans stayed home, it still wouldn’t make a difference. It’s why 79 out of 140 seats in the 2015 Virginia state election were uncontested. It was even worse in the House of Delegates, where 62 out of 100 of the races only had one name on the ballot.

In the process, perhaps we can liberate moderate Republicans so they may be moderate again—so long as they are not already extinct.

77,HEALTHY LIVING,Why Smart People Don’t Multitask,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-smart-people-dont-multitask_us_58caec2de4b0e0d348b34173,"You may have heard that multitasking is bad for you, but new studies show that it kills your performance and may even damage",2017-03-19,<p>Multitasking is really tempting. It’s also really bad for you. Dr. Travis Bradberry explains.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58caec631d000027007ced4e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You may have heard that multitasking is bad for you, but new studies show that it kills your performance and may even damage your brain. Every time you multitask you aren’t just harming your performance in the moment; you may very well be damaging an area of your brain that’s critical to your future success at work.Research conducted at Stanford University found that multitasking is less productive than doing a single thing at a time. The researchers found that people who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information cannot pay attention, recall information, or switch from one job to another as well as those who complete one task at a time.A Special Skill?But what if some people have a special gift for multitasking? The Stanford researchers compared groups of people based on their tendency to multitask and their belief that it helps their performance. They found that heavy multitaskers—those who multitask a lot and feel that it boosts their performance—were actually worse at multitasking than those who like to do a single thing at a time. The frequent multitaskers performed worse because they had more trouble organizing their thoughts and filtering out irrelevant information, and they were slower at switching from one task to another.Ouch.Multitasking reduces your efficiency and performance because your brain can only focus on one thing at a time. When you try to do two things at once, your brain lacks the capacity to perform both tasks successfully.Multitasking Lowers IQResearch also shows that, in addition to slowing you down, multitasking lowers your IQ. A study at the University of London found that participants who multitasked during cognitive tasks experienced IQ score declines that were similar to what they’d expect if they had smoked marijuana or stayed up all night. IQ drops of 15 points for multitasking men lowered their scores to the average range of an 8-year-old child.So the next time you’re writing your boss an email during a meeting, remember that your cognitive capacity is being diminished to the point that you might as well let an 8-year-old write it for you.Brain Damage From Multitasking?It was long believed that cognitive impairment from multitasking was temporary, but new research suggests otherwise. Researchers at the University of Sussex in the UK compared the amount of time people spend on multiple devices (such as texting while watching TV) to MRI scans of their brains. They found that high multitaskers had less brain density in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region responsible for empathy as well as cognitive and emotional control.While more research is needed to determine if multitasking is physically damaging the brain (versus existing brain damage that predisposes people to multitask), it’s clear that multitasking has negative effects.Neuroscientist Kep Kee Loh, the study’s lead author, explained the implications:“I feel that it is important to create an awareness that the way we are interacting with the devices might be changing the way we think and these changes might be occurring at the level of brain structure.” The EQ ConnectionNothing turns people off quite like fiddling with your phone or tablet during a conversation. Multitasking in meetings and other social settings indicates low Self- and Social Awareness, two emotional intelligence (EQ) skills that are critical to success at work. TalentSmart has tested more than a million people and found that 90% of top performers have high EQs. If multitasking does indeed damage the anterior cingulate cortex (a key brain region for EQ) as current research suggests, doing so will lower your EQ while it alienates your coworkers.Bringing It All TogetherIf you’re prone to multitasking, this is not a habit you’ll want to indulge—it clearly slows you down and decreases the quality of your work. Even if it doesn’t cause brain damage, allowing yourself to multitask will fuel any existing difficulties you have with concentration, organization, and attention to detail.Want to increase your emotional intelligence? My book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, is a great place to start."

In the days since, California-based artist Karen Fiorito says she’s received death threats.“I think a lot of people are feeling this way and I’m just trying to express what I think is on a lot of people’s minds these days,” she told local news operation 12 News. “Something that really concerned us was this idea of a dictatorship where things were going in a certain direction.”The billboard space was provided by the owner, Beatrice Moore, who 12 News reported has offered to showcase the work for the remainder of Trump’s presidency. On the back of the billboard, there’s another message. It reads “unity” both in English and in sign language.Of course, not everyone is on board with the sign, even those who say they’re fine with an anti-Trump message.“It’s pretty drastic, I thought swastikas were very crude and violent,” neighbor Jeff Whitman told AZ Family.com. He suggested more family-friendly symbols instead.“Maybe put some thumbs down up there around Trump or something but I don’t like waking up to the Nazi signs,” he told Arizona Central.Passerby Astrid Olafsen, however, threw support behind the sign, particularly the front and back contrast.“I think that it’s a wonderful expression of the two sides of the opinions of what is going on and how we can move forward,” she told Arizona Central.Jeremy Bacpac also shared her approval of the imagery. “It’s fantastic. I think this is what artists are supposed to do, make statements, whether you agree or not, it’s a statement,” she told ABC 15.On Friday, Fiorito posted on Facebook that she expected “death threats and the like” over the work. There appeared to be mixed reviews on her page’s comment section, one calling her a “racist pig” and another thanking her for her “amazing, insightful artwork.”"
80,MEDIA,Iconic New York Columnist Jimmy Breslin Dead At 88,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-breslin-dead_us_58ce9e9ee4b0ec9d29dcc5a5,New York bids farewell to one of its most prolific storytellers.,2017-03-19,"Jimmy Breslin poses for a portrait May 13, 1983 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ceb2ce1400008806070512.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jimmy Breslin, an award-winning New York Daily News columnist celebrated for his insights into the lives of everyday New Yorkers, died Sunday, the outlet confirmed. He was 88.He had been recovering from pneumonia, his wife Ronnie Eldridge, a former New York City Council member, confirmed to the The New York Times. His last column for the Daily News ran in 2012, but The Daily Beast began running new writing from him late last year after years of reprinting his classic columns. In his decades-spanning career writing for several outlets, Breslin found fame for his portrayals of ordinary New Yorkers and the city’s scruffy anti-heroes, often those at the sidelines of major world news events. In a 1980 Daily News story, Breslin told the story of the New York City cops who retrieved John Lennon’s body moments after he’d been fatally shot. For an iconic 1963 column in The New York Herald Tribune, he tracked down the cemetery worker tasked with digging President John F. Kennedy’s grave. Breslin’s depiction of gravedigger Clifton Pollard encapsulated his knack for letting his subjects’ details speak for themselves: Pollard is 42. He is a slim man with a mustache who was born in Pittsburgh and served as a private in the 352nd Engineers battalion in Burma in World War II. He is an equipment operator, grade 10, which means he gets $3.01 an hour. One of the last to serve John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who was the thirty-fifth President of this country, was a working man who earns $3.01 an hour and said it was an honor to dig the grave.That piece is often cited as the type of writing that made Breslin the legendary storyteller he’s remembered as.“[I]t showed how a writer can break away from the crowd, even on the biggest possible story; how, in the words of the great editor Gene Roberts, an enterprising reporter can zig when everyone else zags,” the Poynter Institute for Media Studies wrote.He received many awards for his writing, most notably the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1986. The board awarding him the prize praised him “for columns which consistently champion ordinary citizens.”Breslin said his pursuit of those characters was central to good journalism.“What’s wrong with journalists today? They don’t go out,” Breslin said in a 2015 interview with the City University of New York TV station. “Television would be your answer. They’re all on television giving the news. As you listen to them talk, you know they haven’t left the office. They have no authentic spirit to the voice as they’re telling you what happened in New York, because they don’t know and they don’t bother with it.”The Pulitzer board pointed to an emotionally wrought 1985 column that weaved a story of the AIDS crisis through the lens of one inflicted young man:“You have Karposi’s sarcoma,” the doctor said. “One of them was on an artery. That caused your trouble. There are 10 to 12 more in there.”In another fascinating 1977 column that spoke to the reach of Breslin’s writing, he published letters written to him by notorious New York serial killer “Son of Sam,” who had yet to identified as David Berkowitz.“If he wants any further contact, all he has to do is call or write me at The Daily News,” Breslin wrote. “It’s simple to get me. The only people I don’t answer are bill collectors.” Breslin also authored several lauded books, including The Church That Forgot Christ, a response to the Catholic Church’s many sex scandals; How the Good Guys Finally Won, a glimpse into the politicians who helped bring down President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal; and a novel, The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight. In 1969, Breslin ran as writer Norman Mailer’s running mate in an unsuccessful New York mayoral bid.Their campaign manager described the ill-fated run as “a dull campaign in a sad city with a grimace of despair carved into its face. Mailer and Breslin managed, for a short season, to turn that grimace into a grin.”He is survived by his wife, four children, three stepchildren and 12 grandchildren.

81,POLITICS,"The Deadly War On Drugs, Waged By Your Local SWAT Team","Lloyd I. Sederer, MD, ContributorChief Medical Officer, New York State Office of Mental Health",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-deadly-war-on-drugs-waged-by-your-local-swat-team_us_58ce980de4b0e0d348b34497,The New York Times recently delivered an extraordinary investigative journalism report depicting how our country’s continued,2017-03-19,"<p><em>""The playpen where a flash-bang grenade landed during a raid in Cornelia, Ga.

The utter failure for decades of border interdiction and crop eradication coupled with alienating neighborhoods with ‘buy and bust’ tactics (which have had no more of a momentary effect and have led to more juveniles being ‘employed’ in drug dealing to elude jail sentences) has had next to no impact in foregoing these wasteful and hugely expensive efforts, which of course disproportionately affect those living in poverty and people of color. These are supply-side drug control efforts, which endure despite their damage and profound inutility.Instead, ‘Gung Ho!’ has trumped a host of effective prevention and treatment strategies for drug use and dependence. The militant approach to limiting supplies of illegal drugs is estimated to cost $100 billion/year globally, one fifth of that in the United States (see Richard Branson’s Ending The War On Drugs, Virgin Books, London, 2016). Demand side approaches, of reducing use and thus purchases, have been lost in the fog of war.And as we witness a mounting ethos of military ‘solutions’ to social problems emanating today from Washington, D.C., we are likely to see even more useless and dangerous pursuits ahead, not just abroad but in your neighborhood and mine.The Times reported that from 2010 - 2016 there were at least 81 civilians and 13 law enforcement officers who died in what are called “dynamic entry”, “no knock” raids. Reportedly, as well, scores of people, civilians and officers, were wounded. So many of these assaults, which rival counter-terror raids in their violence, have resulted in avoidable casualties and deaths, widespread trauma among those raided – as well as neighbors and law enforcement alike, extensive property damage, and a spate of legal settlements costing many millions of taxpayer dollars.In a great many instances, no drugs were found. Instead, with 40% of adults in the US owning guns, deadly firefights have ensued as a result of the homeowner taking up arms for protection, not knowing who was breaking down their door. A 26 year old Hispanic former Marine was fatally shot 20 times in 2013 at his Tucson home after agents broke down his door and he rallied to protect himself; no drugs were found.The American Civil Liberties Union concluded in a recent study of 20 cities that 42 percent of those subjected to SWAT search warrant raids were black and 12 percent Hispanic. Of the 81 civilian deaths tallied by The Times, half were members of minority groups.The zeal for combat has also extended beyond illegal drugs, with injurious and fatal raids on suspected poker games, moonshine and even complaints of neglecting pets. One Indiana raid the Times reported involved a mother and adolescent daughter whose wireless had been pirated and used to make police threats, resulting in the bashing of their door and their being cuffed in plain view of the neighbors. Scores of raids have been on innocent citizens, and have yielded no contraband.This increasingly aggressive approach to drugs in America has been enabled by a program instituted by the US Defense Department called the “excess property program”. Since 1997, the DoD has distributed to local police and sheriffs in excess of $6 billion in military vehicles, weapons and other agents of war. When a war mentality prevails, then advanced weaponry is not only desired, it is rapidly and commonly employed. When SWAT teams are dispatched to presumed drug dealing sites, they are in full military attire, and equipped with machine guns, high caliber handguns, and powerful flash and incendiary grenades, one of which was lobbed in 2014 into a Georgia home on the basis of misinformation about drug dealing and landed in a 19 month old child’s playpen - with the boy sleeping there. He is still alive, several years later after 15 surgeries.The progression in violent raids also has been fostered by a 2003 Supreme Court ruling, which ""... affirmed the right of officers to break into a residence with a standard warrant after knocking and waiting only 15 to 20 seconds."" Law and order, even ill-begotten, could eclipse civil liberties. Only Oregon does not permit “no-knock” entries; the Florida Supreme Court has disallowed warrants for “no-knock” police approaches. And in a state of reason, the Utah Legislature in 2015 banned forcible entry when drugs are the only suspected offense. There can be no safe zone, no safe home, once law enforcement can (many times with limited or erroneous information) storm your home as if you were making bombs, instead of baking cookies. That's the moral we can take from the NYT story. The further tragedy of it all is that weapons not wisdom are driving drug policy in this country. The colossal expenses and damages and the endless failures of supply-side drug control efforts dating back well before Prohibition notwithstanding, we cannot seem to see what can save our country, which is in the midst of a growing and deadly opioid epidemic (on top of pervasive problems with alcohol, tobacco and psychostimulants). We are losing the War on Drugs, mainly because we keep viewing it as a war instead of attacking drug use and abuse as public health and societal problems. ………..Dr. Lloyd Sederer is a psychiatrist and public health doctor.

82,POLITICS,Meals On Wheels Sees 500 Percent Surge In Volunteers Since Budget Cuts Proposed,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meals-on-wheels-volunteers-budget-cuts_us_58cc1741e4b0ec9d29dbc991,Online donations have also skyrocketed this week.,2017-03-17,"Nancy Brennerman, center, makes a Meals on Wheels delivery to Josephine Hayward, 93, of Portland, Maine, on Christmas Day 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cc4d642c00002100fef078.jpeg?cache=Ya541fCMbp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Meals on Wheels America says it has seen a 500 percent increase in volunteer signups and 50 times more online donations than usual in the 24 hours since President Donald Trump’s administration proposed eliminating the program’s federal funding.“It’s been heartwarming to see this groundswell of support over the last 24 to 48 hours,” Jenny Bertolette, vice president of communications for Meals on Wheels America, told The Huffington Post on Friday. “Volunteers are our backbone. We couldn’t deliver meals without [them].”Since Meals on Wheels, which delivers food to millions of elderly, poor and housebound Americans, draws a significant amount of its funding from donations, Trump’s proposed budget cuts wouldn’t totally shut down the organization. But the cuts could end up restricting resources to federal agencies that provide additional grants to the program.Trump’s “skinny budget,” released Thursday, would gut the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s entire $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program ― a blow to low-income Americans who rely on the services it funds, including initiatives like Meals on Wheels.The Administration on Aging, established under the Older Americans Act in 1965 to administer grants for senior citizens programs, provides roughly 35 percent of Meals on Wheels’ funding. But under Trump’s proposed budget, the Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the Administration on Aging, would face a 17.9 percent slash in funding.Bertolette said the cuts could have a devastating effect on some of the 2.4 million senior citizens served by the organization. One Meals on Wheels program outside Detroit risks losing 30 percent of its annual budget if the block grant is scrapped. Administrators are contemplating scenarios where they’d have to cut food deliveries in half or put more seniors on the program’s already overloaded waitlist.“The scary thing about that is that funding is already not keeping up with pace,” Bertolette said. “There are already demands that we can’t meet. There is already a waitlist crisis... If this budget was enacted, it would obviously just make matters so much worse.”Despite studies touting the health and economic benefits of programs like Meals on Wheels, the Trump administration claims the initiatives “aren’t showing any results.”“We can’t spend money on programs just because they sound good and great,” Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s budget director, said Thursday. “And Meals on Wheels sounds great.”Bertolette hopes corporations and philanthropists would fill in the funding gaps if the budget is passed. In the meantime, she encourages the organization’s supporters to reach out to their elected officials and make their concerns known.“It’s definitely hard for [some of our recipients] to speak on their own behalf,” said Bertolette. “We need our voices.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?
