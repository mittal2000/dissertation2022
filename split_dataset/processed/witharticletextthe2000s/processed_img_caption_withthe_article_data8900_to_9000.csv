""Thus sewage does not only come from pipes but also trucks emptying pit latrines and septic tanks,"" Drechsel wrote in an email. ""One such truckload is like 5,000 cases of open defecation on a spot.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596541ee1800003800673c6e.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Farmers use 50 percent more untreated wastewater from cities to irrigate crops than previously thought, exposing nearly one-eighth of the world’s population to serious health risks, according to a new study.The situation could become more grave as climate change worsens. “One of the key adaptation strategies to climate change is using water very carefully and reusing it as much as possible,” Pay Drechsel, a researcher at the International Water Management Institute, told HuffPost over Skype from his home in Sri Lanka. “Wastewater is the only water source that is actually increasing in the future. The more people that consume it, the more wastewater will be generated.” The research, published last week in the journal Environmental Research Letters, analyzed data from previous studies that looked at land-use maps and satellite images, then added new official figures from city treatment agencies in major cities around the world. That gave researchers a sense of how much diluted sewage had made it into water systems. The findings were staggering. Researchers had previously estimated that between 6 million and 20 million hectares were being irrigated with wastewater. The results of the new research, which included diluted wastewater, put that figure at about 29.3 million hectares. That leaves the farmers and food vendors, as well as the 885 million urban consumers who depend on their crops, susceptible to ailments like diarrhea, typhoid and, in particularly bad cases, cholera. “These waterborne disease become foodborne diseases,” Drechsel said. “We enter a second highway where it can affect people, and that makes it very, very tricky.”Most of the affected cropland is in China, India, Pakistan, Mexico and Iran, according to the study, which was conducted by the nonprofit International Water Management Institute, Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley.But such irrigation problems can also have a major impact on smaller countries where cities are growing rapidly.In Ghana, a West African nation where the urban population has more than tripled over the last three decades, greens such as lettuce, cabbage and spring onion are increasingly grown on patches of undeveloped land using contaminated city water.“Farmers can make a lot of money if they find an open space in the cities or close to the cities, where people don’t build houses because it’s too wet or there are power lines,” Drechsel said, who lived in Ghana for 11 years. Unlike other vegetables, those items are often served uncooked at street food vendors. “As long as you can boil something you can kill a lot of the pathogens,” Drechsel said.Improving sewage treatment is the obvious best solution. But countries can take other steps to decrease the amount of wastewater used for irrigation. A chloride solution for washing vegetables is popular in some countries, including Burkina Faso and Benin, and Drechsel said it’s becoming more widely used in places like Ghana. In other countries, such as Sri Lanka, the International Water Management Institute is working to emphasize the potential benefits of human waste by creating a market for composted feces, although some experts have raised serious concerns about excrement-based fertilizers.“We are trying to get the shit out of the system by transforming it into fertilizer,” Drechsel said. “With this, we can bring incentives into the sanitation chain.” "

2,POLITICS,Iranian Scientist Arriving In U.S. To Aid Cancer Research Sent Home By Border Authorities,Elise Foley and Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iranian-scientist-boston_us_59650ebfe4b03f144e2e643a,Customs and Border Protection officials said they booted the researcher and his family for reasons unrelated to President Donald Trump's travel ban.,2017-07-11,"An international traveler arrives at Logan Airport in Boston, Massachusetts.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596510431800003800673b90.jpeg?cache=ctS6GQz8IS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An Iranian scientist coming to the U.S. to aid cancer research was detained at Boston’s Logan International Airport with his family on Monday and will be sent home on the next scheduled flight.It’s unclear why the scientist, Seyed Dehnavi, his wife, and their three young children were detained. He has a J-1 visa, which means President Donald Trump’s travel ban would not apply to him, and he was set to conduct research at Boston Children’s Hospital. Customs and Border Protection confirmed the family had been denied entry to the U.S. for reasons unrelated to the travel ban, but declined to elaborate, citing privacy laws. A friend of Dehnavi’s who asked to remain anonymous told HuffPost that the scientist flew from Tehran to Doha to Boston, and texted him around 3 p.m. on Monday to say he had arrived with his wife, their infant son, and their daughters, ages 6 and 3. Then Dehnavi went quiet. The friend said he eventually asked customs agents at the airport what was going on, and said they told him the family was denied entry because of a document issue. Trita Parsi, head of the National Iranian American Council, tweeted a copy of what he said was Dehnavi’s visa. Before traveling to the U.S., Dehnavi had asked Harvard University, which is affiliated with Boston Children’s Hospital, whether Trump’s travel ban would affect him. The Supreme Court allowed pieces of the ban to go into effect last month. Harvard told Dehnavi the president’s order would have no impact on him, his friend said.Trump signed an executive order in January seeking to bar nearly all nationals of certain Muslim-majority nations, including Iran. He signed a second, slightly narrower version in March after the first was blocked by courts. Both orders threatened important research, according to scientists, and could keep people from coming to the U.S. for their work. Customs and Border Protection noted in a statement that having a valid visa doesn’t guarantee entry into the U.S. Individuals must first show they are eligible for admission in an inspection with a Customs and Border Protection officer. They can be rejected on more than 60 grounds by law, including security, health, criminality, labor certification, immigration violations and document requirements, Customs and Border Protection said in a statement. Boston Children’s spokesman Rob Graham said in an email that the hospital “hopes that this situation will be quickly resolved and Dr. Dehnavi and his family will be released and allowed to enter the U.S.” "

Months before the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, then-reality TV star and pageant owner Donald Trump took to Twitter to pose a question to his online fans: “Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?As The New York Times reported Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin wasn’t in attendance, but the competition “put the Trump family in touch with other people with connections to the Kremlin.” Aras Agalarov, a billionaire Azerbaijani-Russian businessman with ties to Putin, had negotiated to have the Miss Universe pageant at his new concert venue, Crocus City Hall, outside Moscow. At the time, he and Trump were also discussing collaborating on a real estate project in Moscow. Two days after the pageant, Trump tweeted at Agalarov, saying he “had a great weekend” with him and his family and that “TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next.”Later that same month, Agalarov’s son, pop star Emin Agalarov, released a new music video featuring Trump and several Miss Universe contestants. At the end of the video, Emin is “brought back to reality by the always tough-talking words of Donald Trump,” as described in a YouTube video. Enter Rob Goldstone, a former British tabloid journalist and current publicist, who has worked with the Miss Universe pageant and who represents Emin. On Sunday, Goldstone told The Washington Post that he had arranged the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City between Trump Jr. and Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at the request of an unnamed Russian client. Goldstone has since confirmed that Emin was the client who requested the sit-down and said that Veselnitskaya told him she had information about possible illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee, as The Associated Press reported.Trump Jr. initially claimed the meeting with Veselnitskaya was to discuss an adoption program for Russian children, as The New York Times reported. The Times subsequently wrote that Trump Jr. had been promised some dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.Trump Jr. has changed his story, issuing a statement Sunday saying he was made to believe the individual “might have information helpful to the campaign.” “Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense,” he added. “No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.” Joining Trump Jr. at the meeting were Trump’s then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, now a senior White House adviser.While several of Trump’s allies defended the meeting as normal campaign activity, veterans of several Republican presidential campaigns have said they wouldn’t have agreed to such a meeting with a foreign agent.

President Donald Trump later in the day applauded his son’s “transparency.” But Trump Jr.’s decision to release emails related to the meeting only came after the New York Times informed him it already had the goods.On Tuesday morning, the Times asked Trump Jr. to respond by 11 a.m. to new details it had learned from emails about the meeting, according to deputy managing editor Matt Purdy. Given the possibility Trump Jr. would try to get out in front of the story, the Times had a version of it ready to go. Shortly after Trump Jr.’s 11 a.m. tweet, the Times published its initial story, followed by a more comprehensive version soon after. The Times’ bombshell ― “Russian Dirt on Clinton? ‘I Love It,’ Donald Trump Jr. Said” ― was written by Jo Becker, Adam Goldman and Matt Apuzzo, three Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters who had been advancing the story since Saturday through three previous articles. The reporters wrote Tuesday about how Trump Jr. received an email before the June 2016 meeting from an intermediary who had promised “very high level and sensitive information” that is “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. quickly emailed back: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.” Six days later, Trump Jr., then-campaign-chairman Paul Manafort, and son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner met with Kremlin-connected lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower.As President Donald Trump and his supporters repeatedly malign the news media, attempting to portray any scrutiny of the administration’s policies and behavior as “fake news,” the Times and other major news outlets have continued digging into questions of whether Trump allies colluded with Russia as part of that country’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 election in support of the Republican candidate.The Times’ Tuesday scoop is the latest example of the press nudging administration officials or family members to reveal details about their interactions with Russian officials or individuals linked to the Kremlin. Trump Jr. could have released the emails on Saturday, when the Times began asking him about the June 2016 meeting. Instead, he portrayed the discussion to the Times as being “primarily” about adoption of Russian children. He acknowledged Sunday that he had expressed interest in potentially damaging material from the Russians about Clinton ― after the Times informed him of plans to reveal it. On Monday morning on Twitter, Trump Jr. portrayed the June 2016 meeting as a routine example of a campaign seeking opposition research, though veteran Republican strategists said they wouldn’t have met with foreign agents.That night, Apuzzo, Becker, Goldman and Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman revealed Trump Jr. had learned in an email prior to the meeting that Russia sought to aid his father’s presidential campaign. Fox News’ pro-Trump primetime hosts downplayed the major news break as it was being covered on rival networks Monday night. Reliably supportive Breitbart News, which was previously run by chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, led Tuesday morning with a story noting that Times reporters had not actually seen the emails (they had never claimed to).Breitbart News dismissed the report as “only the latest effort by the Times to bring down President Donald Trump that relies on documents it has not seen and verified.”But around the same time the pro-Trump site questioned the Times’ scoop, the paper’s reporters, now having knowledge of the contents of the emails, were pressing Trump Jr. for comment. Instead of replying directly to the Times, Trump Jr. ― who is popular among the president’s base of supporters for staunch defenses of his father and attacks on the news media on Twitter― utilized the social media platform to briefly get ahead of the Times’ story. WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange suggested Trump Jr. may have followed his advice to release the emails.However, journalists saw the press as the catalyst for this act of transparency.“Reminder: These disclosures are not happening out of any action of good will,” Boston Globe deputy Washington bureau chief Matt Viser tweeted. “They’re happening because investigative reporters are digging.”One of those investigative reporters, the Times’ Goldman, expressed a similar sentiment. The Times’ recent stories on Trump Jr. followed the paper’s reporting in April on Kushner initially omitting his meetings with Russians, and other foreign government officials, on security forms he submitted to gain top-secret clearance at the White House. The 2016 meeting was only recently disclosed to government investigators, the Times noted in Saturday’s initial story. Learning about the meeting “got us pulling at the string,” said Purdy. For several days afterward, he said, journalists in New York and Washington worked round-the-clock to confirm more details about what transpired at Trump Tower a little over a year ago. Indeed, Goldman tweeted just after 11 p.m. on Monday that he was “still reporting.”Purdy said the Times, like other news organization, is “spending a lot of resources” in looking into ongoing questions about Trump ties to Russia. “Certainly the activities and actions on all sorts of issues by administration officials and people connected to the administration are important to public knowledge and an important target for journalism,” he said.

7,ENTERTAINMENT,'The Big Sick' Star Says A Producer Once Asked If She 'Spat Or Swallowed' On Set,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zoe-kazan-sexual-harassment-hollywood-big-sick_us_59651870e4b03f144e2e7ec5,Zoe Kazan recently opened up about sexual harassment she's experienced in the industry.,2017-07-11,"Zoe Kazan said everyone on the set of ""The Big Sick"" was “super respectful,"" but she can't say the same of everyone in Hollywood. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596520041500006303bfd115.jpeg?ops=crop_0_120_2060_1209%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As the daughter of two screenwriters and the granddaughter of famed Hollywood director Elia Kazan, Zoe Kazan has been in and around Hollywood her entire life.On the heels of her wonderful starring role in the romantic comedy “The Big Sick,” she’s not holding back about the industry’s shortcomings.“There’s so much sexual harassment on set,” Kazan told The Guardian as part of a feature on the actress that published over the weekend. “I have a lot of girlfriends who are amazing actors, and many times we’ve talked about having to go into a room and give ‘blowjob eyes,’” she continued. “You know, be flirty with a director or a producer. It’s the sense that your sexuality is somehow baked into this situation. Or there’ll be auditions where they’ll say, ‘Wear something body-conscious’ and then you’re aware that they’re checking out your body. You leave the situation feeling not good about what just happened, but you don’t really have the language for why. You feel like, if you said something, it would reflect badly on you.” Kazan made clear that people were “super respectful” during her time on the set of “The Big Sick,” which she stars in alongside Kumail Nanjiani of “Silicon Valley.” But other times, that hasn’t been the case. “I had a producer ask me on set once if I spat or swallowed,” she said. “At work. He’d say, ‘Oh, it’s a joke, ha ha.’ But he was also paying my cheque and then watching me from the monitor as I made out with another actor — so when he tells me I look good, it feels different.”She added, “It makes you feel guilty, and bad, as if it’s somehow your fault — that you’re somehow giving that person the signal that it’s OK to treat you that way.”Kazan said her boyfriend of a decade, actor Paul Dano of “There Will Be Blood” fame, sometimes has had difficulty grappling with the stories she tells him. But sexual harassment remains a rampant problem for women throughout the U.S. economy ― a 2015 Cosmopolitan of 2,235 full-time and part-time female employees found that one-third of them had been sexually harassed at work at one point. The situation might be even worse within the entertainment industry, where men continue to hold a tight grip on powerful positions, like director or producer. Prominent actresses, including Emmy Rossum, Ashley Judd and Chloe Sevigny, have detailed the harassment they and others have faced in the industry. “You’d be shocked how often these claims [of sexual harassment] are brought in the entertainment business,” attorney Lisa Maki once told The Hollywood Reporter.

Tures, ContributorProfessor of Political Science, LaGrange College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-major-league-baseballs-all-star-game-is-americana_us_5964f6d6e4b0deab7c646bf1,"The death of America’s All-Star Game has been protected, even promoted by nay-sayers who say the times have passed it by",2017-07-11,"<p>Photo by author from outside SunTrust Park, where the Atlanta Braves play.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5964f7251500006603bfd062.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The death of America’s All-Star Game has been protected, even promoted by nay-sayers who say the times have passed it by. Yet the fundamental nature of the game is one that’s as enduring as the American spirit itself, which is why we’ll continue to celebrate it long after its critics depart from the scene.“Dad, look! It’s a poster for Ender Inciarte!” My nine-year-old bounds over to a sign, cleverly designed to look like one of the many Karen Handel-Jon Ossoff yard signs that dotted the North Atlanta landscape. The sign begs fans to cast their ballots for the Atlanta Braves centerfielder, a little known player who has become a fan favorite for his stellar play, robbing opponents of hits (he currently leads the league in put outs), and he led the league in assists last year, gunning down baserunners (leading the league in double-plays from the outfield). In fact, he won a Gold Glove Award from Rawlings for his efforts.Inciarte doesn’t just prevent hits; he smacks plenty of his own. Quietly, he became a league leader this year in base hits, often hit in timely situations, sometimes the result of his hustle in beating out the infielder’s throw. And he’s number one in at-bats, never missing an inning of work if he can help it (and is in the top 10 in making it on base, and scoring runs). All this hard play is done at a fraction of what baseball stars make (he makes little more than $500,000, a pittance compared to the rest of the game’s best). He inspires my son to try and beat out infield hits of his own, or try to throw out a speedy runner after stopping a hard hit ball. If only we had tickets for the Ender Inciarte bobblehead doll night!In a way, Inciarte is a lot like a Horatio Alger story. From Marivel Venezuela, he made his way to America, even as his home country spirals into chaos thanks to the authoritarian rule of Nicolas Maduro. Given his public criticism of the Maduro regime, Inciarte is probably as much a political refugee as anyone today. Baseball players there targets, not sources of admiration.As my son poses for a picture with the “Elect Ender Inciarte” sign, he points at the others touting the All-Star candidacies of Brandon Phillips, an African-American second baseman, and the team’s star, Freddie Freeman, a white first baseman willing to move to third base to help the Braves win. It’s a multicultural team that the fans embrace as they battle teams with more stars and bigger payrolls in the competitive National League East.In fact, the greatest moment in our team’s recent years was the huge fan effort to write-in Freeman against Yasiel Puig of the Dodgers. Pundits had hoped to see the talented but controversial Puig win, instead of the lunch-pail style Freeman, who quietly has become one of the game’s best, while others like Mike Trout, Bryce Harper and Puig win the headlines. Last year, Freeman stopped to shake my hand at a Braves Day event while the staff was trying to drag him off to a press conference that he was late for.Times have changed. No longer do we punch out a ballot. It’s online nowadays. I’m sure it will give the purists something else to gripe about. These mandarins of the game have told us that we’ve ruined the game with inter-league play, by making the All-Star Game determine home field advantage. Those who chase fads, on the other hand, claim that the game has been eclipsed by football, basketball, hockey, or even the X-games. Yet which Pro Bowl or NBA All-Star game is filled with moments like Pete Rose crashing into Catcher Ray Fosse, or Carl Hubbell striking out a “who’s who” list of Hall-of-Famers, Reggie Jackson’s towering homer, Dave Parker gunning down Jim Rice and Brian Downing, Chipper Jones getting a hit at his last All-Star game or the moving tribute to Mariano Rivera?“Dad! Ender Inciarte’s going to the All-Star Game!” Zach exclaimed the good news a week or so ago as he bounded over to me, having read the trailer on the TV in Mighty Joe’s Pizza. And yeah, we’ll let him stay up to send the end. This game is special tonight.Regardless of how the games change, or society changes, there’s one thing about the Major League Baseball All-Star Game that remains the same and taps in to what America is all about. It combines individual talent and teamwork. In the game itself, players from a variety of teams must come together to harness their skill, while checking their egos to get outs and score runs. And yes, a little-known player can take his place among the best, and possibly be immortalized as the game’s MVP.John A. Tures is a professor of political science at LaGrange College in LaGrange, Ga.

9,POLITICS,The Heroin And Opioid Crisis Is Gridlocked By Discussion,"Karl Leonard, ContributorSheriff, Chesterfield County (Virginia)",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heroin-and-opioid-crisis-gridlocked-by-discusssion_us_596524a0e4b0911162fc2f63,Talking about this epidemic is not saving lives.,2017-07-11,Sheriff Karl Leonard with participants of his womens Heroin Addiction Recovery Program HARP.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5965309a1500006303bfd14a.jpeg?ops=crop_0_19_1200_729%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Our nation is at a critical juncture regarding the opioid and heroin crisis we are in. Any further delay in getting beyond the rhetoric and taking tangible action to start to turn this continually rising problem will result in a catastrophic number of our sons and daughters, sisters and brothers, mothers, and fathers continuing to die in tremendously high numbers.The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) states that every day, more than 90 Americans die after overdosing on opioids. That is one opioid death every 15 minutes of every hour of every day of every month. However, that doesn’t seem to be enough deaths to cause any great action on our parts.Our government, from the president (current and past administrations), to Congress as well as many state governing bodies have done little as far as implementing constructive substantive action to even start to have this crisis merely level off yet alone begin its demise. What they have all done well is talk about the crisis and work to raise awareness. Talking about this epidemic is not saving lives.Why is it that, as we find ourselves in the fourth or fifth or even tenth year of this deadly crisis, we have yet to do more than simply raise awareness? (Per the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) the threat posed by heroin in the United States has increased annually since 2007).Raising awareness is a great first step. On that front, government has done well. I am sure there are very few people in the United States who are not in tune with the opioid crisis in this country. Great job! However, we cannot sit idly by and pat ourselves on the back simply because we raised awareness of the opioid crisis in the nation. Why not? Because an opioid overdose just took another life. And it will again in 15 minutes. And again 15 minutes after that. It’s time for second steps and third steps and as many steps as we need to take to combat this.In addition, with the current widespread availability of Naloxone, I am fearful that we have lowered our guard, especially our state and federal governments who have taken on a more one-dimensional approach to this crisis perhaps because of the wide production and distribution of Naloxone. Yes, Naloxone is a miracle drug, no denying that. Almost all public safety entities and hospitals are stocking it and using it very frequently. And yes, it is now readily available to many Americans because of the open prescriptions several national drug chains now have.However, in my opinion Naloxone is not saving lives but rather postponing deaths. All too often, hospitals treat opioid overdose victims with Naloxone and in short time, sometimes less than two hours, discharge the overdose victim back onto the streets. Often these overdose victims, so fraught with the disease that is their opioid addiction, go right back to injecting because the Naloxone “stole” the high they were just on. In some cases, these same overdose victims end up going right back to the hospital on another overdose. That is if they are lucky enough to get to a hospital before they die.We must stop treating the overdose as the ailment and more as the symptom. If someone suffered a broken arm and went to the hospital in excruciating pain the hospital would probably administer a dose of morphine (or some other drug) to mask the pain for the patient. They certainly wouldn’t wait for the pain to subside and then send them off back on to the street still with a broken arm.The pain the patient was in was only a symptom not the ailment. A person who overdoses is not suffering from overdoses, they are suffering from the disease of addiction. Much like a person with a broken arm when the overdose symptom is controlled, using such a powerful and remarkable tool like Naloxone, hospitals then should shift gears and look to treat the addiction before simply releasing the individual back onto the street.Therein might be the very crux of our failure to start making any inroads with this crisis. How many hospitals are resourced and equipped to treat opioid ― or any other drug of choice ― addictions?This is where our government must refocus some of their attention and energy to create a multi-dimensional response to this crisis. Since hospitals are the common first step of those who suffer an overdose, they also would be the logical place to implement real addiction treatment programs.Hospitals should be resourced to provide immediate care and treatment after reviving an overdose victim which includes attention to the mental health matters that many addicts also endure. In many cases, addicts use drugs to mask pain, pain created by some underlying trauma or issue. To truly recover, addicts must get to the root cause of that pain and identify the trauma so they can then learn the proper tools to deal with that underlying issue so they no longer have the need to use drugs to mask it.It can be done and recovery works, however, it requires an investment much more than the hour or two an overdose victim currently spends in the hospital. Treatment must start right then, right there. You can’t schedule an appointment for someone to come back in a month, or a week, or even a day to start treating the addiction. It must be at that very moment.And yes, that would be costly to do, so how do we make this happen? How do we fund this capability? I don’t have the answer but I do know we must do it. Keep in mind though that this crisis is already costing us billions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the total “economic burden” of prescription opioid misuse alone in the United States is $78.5 billion a year, including the costs of health care, lost productivity, addiction treatment, and criminal justice involvement.Any multi-dimensional response must also provide services for addicts who have not overdosed. The same treatment mentioned above should be readily available and affordable to all addicts in their communities. Perhaps this would be an area our faith based groups could take the lead on. With the help of local, state, and federal government we could resource places of worship to serve as 24-hour help centers for opioid (or all) addicts.If recovery treatment facilities cannot be launched in our cities, towns, or counties, then allow open access to the same programs I suggested above hospitals should have for overdose victims. Addicts should be able to come in off the streets to participate.There is a critical need for “drop off centers” so that law enforcement isn’t left with the single option of incarceration when they encounter an addict. Our jails, which have become the largest repository for the mentally ill, now also serve the same purpose for those in the throes of addiction. Neither of which they are equipped or resourced to deal with.State, federal, and local law enforcement agencies also have a large role in this crisis to stem the flow of heroin and illegal opioids into this country and our neighborhoods and schools by targeting the dealers and importers. Because heroin is readily available and inexpensive, many users also elect to sell heroin. These “sellers” are not the “dealers” that all our efforts should be focused on. Certainly they should be dealt with, however stopping the flow of large quantities of heroin into this country must be a top priority.This is not an all-inclusive list nor do I have all the answers. I am doing what I can to address this crisis in my own jail, however that is limited. We must open the aperture on the lens we look at this opioid crisis through to see the bigger picture. There must be a way to make this happen and have it happen without being bogged down in lengthy debate and more rhetoric.As non-discriminatory or “bipartisan” as the opioid addiction is to its victims, our response to it will only succeed if we approach it in a bipartisan manner. The next time an opioid overdose claims a life, it will not be seeking to determine if the victim is a Republican or Democrat first. It simply wants to kill. This terrible disease, which is consuming our nation, should certainly be a major part of any national health care program we put forth, as well as provisions for mental health care.The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) states there has been a 248 percent increase in heroin deaths between 2010 and 2014 alone. Must we wait until it reaches 300 percent before we take constructive action? Or until an opioid overdose claims a life every 10 minutes rather than every 15? What will it take? Are we simply satisfied as to where we are today and comfortable with continuing the rhetoric? I would say the parents who lost a loved one to an opioid overdose just while you were reading this would say no."

Touted as the flagship for the future of coal, and backed by the U.S. Department of Energy and the heavy-hitter utility, Southern Company, what could go wrong? As many predicted from the very beginning, costs soon spiraled out of control; what started out with a $1.8 billion price tag ended up at $7.5 billion plus, giving Kemper the dubious distinction of being the most expensive power plant ever built in the United States.For comparison, $7.5 billion, which works out to about $40,000 per Mississippi Power customer, could have installed solar panels plus batteries for every one of the utility’s 150,000 residential customers.Years behind schedule, the plant has yet to run as advertised.This past week, the newly elected Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC) stepped in and “pulled the plug” on Southern Company’s big bet gone bad, putting an end to any further attempts to continue to throw good money after bad.This bold decision by the MPSC to shut down this eight-year fiasco ends this long-running nightmare for Mississippi families and businesses who faced the burden of debilitating electric rate increases to pay for Southern Companies bad business decisions. The MPSC made good on their pledge to get control of this boondoggle despite tremendous political pressure from the clean coal narrative.As part of the Sierra Club’s legal challenge of Kemper, we provided the catalyst to pave the way toward a clean energy future for Mississippians. The road to stop Southern Company’s gouging of customers with the Kemper coal plant was long, and Mississippians have fought the misguided attempts to tie their future to an unnecessary, expensive and dirty power plant for more than a decade. In the time that Southern Company fought to maintain the viability of the Kemper coal plant, the country’s energy landscape changed dramatically. Renewable energy is employing hundreds of thousands of workers, and it’s powering millions of homes affordably with prices continuing to drop.Southern Company and its subsidiary Mississippi Power did a disservice to its customers and to Mississippi by wasting their time and money on the Kemper coal plant boondoggle. Mississippians, however, haven’t missed a beat, and have been fighting hard at the MPSC during this time to expand access to clean energy in Mississippi.In the last two years, the MPSC adopted net-metering rules for the first time to allow solar customers credit on their electricity bills for power they provide on the grid. Before approving the net-metering plan, customers with solar panels that wanted to sell power back to the grid were being charged an administrative fee of $15.19 a month by Mississippi power. This rule includes a low income incentive to afford all Mississippians the opportunity to invest in a clean energy future.The Commission’s leadership on renewable energy has further netted a proposal to bring enough Texas wind energy to the state to power thousands of homes and businesses. Approval from the commission on 105 MW utility-scale solar projects in Mississippi Power territory, would not only account for possibly the largest installations in the state when complete but actively replaces fossil fuels and moves Mississippi toward a sustainable clean energy future.The MPSC has also established an ambitious Energy Efficiency Docket that will help Mississippi residents save energy and save money and move Mississippi forward for energy conservation in Mississippi. Even Mississippi Power has seen the light, having just cut the ribbon on the largest solar complex built to date and with more to come.The Sierra Club will continue to build upon this momentum to move Mississippi towards a 21st century clean energy economy and remain vigilant to ensure no community has to repeat the mistakes of the Dirty,Expensive, Unnecessary, Kemper boondoggle."

Here’s some helpful advice from those who’ve been through it.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594bfee315000027008ffb35.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After nine months of prepping you’ve finally brought that new precious baby into your home. And it is a whirlwind. There will be some things you wish people had warned you about and other things you wish people had kept quiet on. This is not more unwarranted and unwanted advice.Here are the tips you really need to know to survive this huge transition time in your life.1. It’s okay if you have no clue what you’re doingEvery new parent goes through a stage in the beginning of bringing that newborn babe home where they have no idea what they are doing. Even if you read plenty of parenting books and took all the recommended classes, nothing can prepare you for what a new baby brings. Who knew something so small and precious could make you feel so completely incompetent as a human being? You are not alone. Nearly every parent before you has felt this way at some point (they just didn’t tell you). It’s normal and it is okay.2. Set up the boundaries you wantPeople will want to come visit and see the new baby. They may want to bring you meals, help out while you nap, check in on you at the hospital, etc. These are all wonderful things, but can potentially be very overwhelming for new parents. Decide what you are comfortable with and then set appropriate boundaries. It is okay to refuse visitors at the hospital and at your home and/or to limit the amount of time they visit with you. Remember, it is about you and your new baby, not everyone else’s wants.3. Remember that it will get betterYou will start to feel more confident in your abilities day by day. There will still be some very challenging days, but in general, it will get better. You will soon become a pretty skilled at multitasking, diaper changing, and living on very little sleep.4. Don’t compare yourself to other familiesEveryone does things a little differently. Your sister, best friend, mother-in-law and next-door neighbor will likely have different tips on what worked for them. You can listen to these tips and then do whatever you want with them, including ignoring them completely. Remember that you only know a piece of each other’s situations and everyone is different, so cut yourself some slack and don’t fret if something isn’t working for you that worked for someone else.5. If you are especially frazzled, it’s okay to let your baby cryIt’s better to leave a baby crying in a crib than to take out any frustration on them. If you find yourself especially upset or angry, put your baby down or hand them off to dad and take a moment for yourself. Getting frazzled and frustrated is also normal. It’s just very important to recognize how you are feeling and deal with it in a healthy way.6. You will look back and miss this timeIt may seem impossible that you would ever yearn for these sleepless nights and chaotic lifestyle, but, unbelievably, there will be a point in your life when you will look back and miss this time. Throughout these newborn days, remember the saying, “the days are long but the years are short.” Try to appreciate each stage that your child is in, from diaper-changing newborn to temper tantrum toddler. Try to savor these days rather than wish them away.Being a new parent can be especially challenging. There will be several tests and trials that will come up within that first year and also a number of joys and treasures. It will challenge you like nothing ever has before. Remind yourself that you are capable of handling all of it and that you are doing a good job.You can read more advice from Dr. Kurt at Guy Stuff Counseling, Facebook, Google+, or Twitter."

He said his nation and its allies are considering demanding that Western countries choose between them and their neighbor Qatar, against which they have imposed a quasi-blockade.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is off to the Persian Gulf this week to try to mediate. Yet the issue looks esoteric to Westerners. Wealthy and pampered Saudi Arabia and the UAE, along with their satellites, particularly Bahrain and Egypt, whose loyalty has been purchased with abundant cash and military support, have declared diplomatic war on Qatar. They blame the latter for supporting terrorism, but almost certainly more important to them, dictatorships all, is the desire to silence criticism of their own crimes.Doha supports opposition groups, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, the chief target of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s brutal rule in Egypt, and TV channel Al Jazeera, which speaks ill of most of the oppressive Gulf regimes. Qatar also maintains civil relations with Iran, contra Riyadh’s attempt to turn every conflict in the Middle East into a proxy Sunni-Shia war. If Doha gave in to its antagonists’ demands on these issues, denunciations of Qatar’s alleged dabbling with terrorism likely would disappear.Indeed, under Saudi Arabia’s ruthless new Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman—who apparently has put his cousin and ousted predecessor under palace arrest—Riyadh has become the major threat to regional stability. Although U.S. officials blame Tehran for destabilizing the Gulf, it is the Saudi royals who supported radical insurgents in Syria, launched an aggressive war against Yemen, and sent troops to support Bahrain’s Sunni monarchy against the oppressed Shia majority. If the House of Saud ever loses its hold on power, the crash will be heard around the world.At one level there isn’t much to choose between the assorted Gulf kingdoms. They are monarchies in a world which mostly abandoned that ancient form of government a century ago. They are largely dictatorships. Kuwait is the freest, with an elected assembly and robust media; otherwise the picture is bleak. Most sit atop sizeable energy reserves and hire foreigners to do their dirty work. Including Americans to defend them.Saudi Arabia is the Gulf colossus and usually takes the lead. But Qatar, with the largest natural gas reserves in the world—and consequently the world’s wealthiest nation—long has followed a very different foreign policy. This rankled Riyadh’s royals, who were used to being obeyed. Worse was Doha’s creation of Al Jazeera, which promoted the Arab Spring and has attained wide viewership in a region where the media is highly controlled. (Confession: I’ve appeared on the channel.) Egypt’s al-Sisi, who in 2013 ousted a democratically elected president from the Muslim Brotherhood and imposed a reign of terror to crush all opposition, most objects to Qatar’s support for the MB.After President Donald Trump’s visit to Riyadh, where he apparently acknowledged, approved, or even encouraged his hosts’ plans, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, and Maldives (!) announced they were breaking diplomatic relations with Doha, expelling Qatari citizens, requiring their citizens to leave the isolated emirate, imposing a land blockade, halting operations by Qatar Airways, and barring any use by a Qatari entity of their waters and airspace. It wasn’t until the U.S. State Department proclaimed itself “mystified” by the coalition’s behavior that the latter bothered to issue specific demands. The list of 13, which insisted on changes, expulsions, closures, reparations, and even regular “audits” to monitor compliance, seemed designed for rejection, since no serious nation could accept such limitations on its sovereignty. Qatar would be a puppet state. The ultimatum is set to expire on July 3, with the unspecified consequences for refusal.Now UAE’s Ambassador Ghobash says the West might have to choose us or them. But he did his cause no good when he declared: “You’d be forced to choose between wanting to do business with an extremist agenda or wanting to do business with people who are interested in building an acceptable Middle East.” In fact, the country he represents and its allies are as if not more guilty of promoting an extremist agenda than is Qatar. If there is one country not interested in “building an acceptable Middle East” to anyone other than itself, it is Saudi Arabia.There is much to criticize about the Saudi five (later supplemented by one of Libya’s contending governments). One is that they have divided the Gulf nations, with Kuwait and Oman remaining neutral; in fact, the latter opened up its ports to Qatar. Moreover, Riyadh & Co. has pushed Doha closer to Turkey and Iran, both of which offered emergency food shipments after Saudi Arabia cut Qatar’s land lifeline. If the Middle East’s political boundaries end up redrawn, the fault will not be Doha’s.Moreover, the Saudis and their allies have appalling human rights records. Qatar is no liberal democracy, but Saudi Arabia is essentially a totalitarian state when it comes to politics and religion. Egypt’s al-Sisi is worse than long-serving dictator Hosni Mubarak let alone the ousted Mohamed Morsi. One of al-Sisi’s unique crimes: shutting down NGOs which attempted to hold the government accountable for its human rights abuses, many of which had survived Mubarak’s repressive rule. Bahrain’s monarchy relied on Saudi military backing to crush democracy protests. It’s no surprise that these governments’ prioritize eliminating opposition and maintaining power.However, most outrageous is the fact that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and UAE, in particular, have been criticized for precisely the same behavior which they are blaming on Qatar — promoting extremism and terrorism. It is the proverbial pot calling the kettle black. Ambassador Ghobash asked whether Western nations wanted “Qatari money with blood on it?” Why would they instead want Saudi, Emirati, or Bahraini money with blood on it?The complaints from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and their debtor allies are entirely self-serving. Although the Muslim Brotherhood is not and never has been a terrorist organization. It is the oldest form of political Islam and contains within it a range of extremist and more moderate thought. Americans have reason to be wary of the group, but should recognize its complexity. MB members serve in Bahrain’s, Tunisia’s, and Turkey’s governments and are well integrated into Kuwaiti society. Elements like these, admitted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, “have done so by renouncing violence and terrorism.”What offends Riyadh, in particular, is the knowledge (and consequent fear) that its totalitarian monarchy, by which thousands of princes enjoy licentious lifestyles at their people’s expense, holds no popular appeal, especially for the large youth population. Similar is the perspective of Egypt’s simpler but more brutal military rule. Nothing is more frightening for these regimes than a movement which offers something to believe in. The MB provides no good answers, but still is far more appealing than its oppressive opponents in the battle for hearts and minds in the Muslim world.Unfortunately, when it comes to genuine extremism and terrorism, there are few innocents in the Gulf. In Syria Qatar backed the al-Nusra Front, then formally affiliated with al-Qaeda, but even the Obama administration did little to target the group, since it was among the most effective in battling the Syria’s Assad-government. Moreover, observed Vice President Joe Biden: “Our allies in the region were our largest problem in Syria. The Turks were great friends … [and] the Saudis, Emirates, etc. What were they doing? They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad—except that the people who were being supplied, [they] were al-Nusra, and al-Qaeda, and the extremist elements of jihadis who were coming from other parts of the world.”The U.S. government criticized Doha for allowing money to flow to extremist organizations. But Washington routinely said the same about Qatar’s critics. For instance, the most recent report by the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Extremism said of Egypt: it “remained vulnerable by virtue of its large informal, cash-based economy.”Bahrain, concluded State, “is an important regional financial hub, which makes it vulnerable to large amounts of money flowing through the Gulf region to support various terrorist groups.” Moreover, “there were concerns that the government sometimes used counterterrorism laws—specifically citizenship revocations—to prosecute or harass individuals for their criticism of the government.”In language similar to that used regarding Qatar, State reported on Saudi Arabia: “Despite serious and effective efforts to counter the funding of terrorism originating within the Kingdom, some individuals and entities in Saudi Arabia continued to serve as sources of financial support for Sunni-based extremist groups, particularly regional al-Qaeda affiliates such as the Nusra Front.” Despite increased penalties, “funds are allegedly collected in secret and illicitly transferred out of the country in cash.”Regarding the UAE, State said that the country’s “numerous free trade zones varied in their compliance with and supervision of anti-money laundering/counterterrorism financing international best practices. Exploitation by illicit actors of money transmitters included licensed exchange houses, hawalas, and trading firms acting as money transmitters, remained significant concerns.”State discussed these problems in a lengthy cable dated December 30, 2009, released by Wikileaks. The authors criticized Qatar, but were tougher on Saudi Arabia: “it has been an ongoing challenge to persuade Saudi officials to treat terrorist financing emanating from Saudi Arabia as a strategic priority.” Despite Riyadh’s efforts, “donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.” Indeed, the KSA “remains a critical financial support base for al-Qaeda, the Taliban, LeT [Lashkar-e-Tayyiba], and other terrorist groups, including Hamas.” Even after reforms several large “groups continue to send money overseas and, at times, fund extremism overseas.”UAE fared little better. Complained State, “UAE-based donors have provided financial support to a variety of terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda, the Taliban, LeT and other terrorist groups, including Hamas.” The authors emphasized “that the UAE’s role as a growing global financial center, coupled with weak regulatory oversight, makes it vulnerable to abuse by terrorist financiers and facilitation networks.”In 2014 former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton contended that “we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistical support for ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.” She also complained that the two governments, along with that of Kuwait, failed “to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations.” The 9/11 commission also cited possible connections between the 9/11 hijackers, 15 of 19 who were Saudi, and the KSA government.Indeed, no less an authority than candidate Donald Trump declared last year that the Saudis were “the world’s biggest funders of terrorism.” Riyadh’s lavish welcome for him apparently caused an unfortunate case of amnesia, but he got it right originally.Finally, there’s the estimated $100 billion spent by Riyadh over the last three decades to promote the fundamentalist Wahhabist strain of Islam. While it does not explicitly advocate terrorism, it demonizes people of other faiths and radicalizes youth, especially when propagated by Madrassahs around the world, including some in America. Dr. Yousaf Butt of the British Cultural Intelligence Institute argued that Wahhabism is “the fountainhead of Islamic extremism that promotes and legitimizes such violence.” The group Freedom House concluded that the Wahhabi curriculum “continues to propagate an ideology of hate toward the ‘unbeliever,’ which includes Christians, Jews, Shiites, Sufis, Sunni Muslims who do not follow Wahhabi doctrine, Hindus, atheists and others.” William McCants of the Brookings Institution warned that the Saudis “promote a very toxic form of Islam that draws sharp lines between a small number of true believers and everyone else, Muslim and non-Muslim.”As practiced by Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism appears to produce a version of the Islamic State with slightly better public manners, where vicious intolerance enjoys the pretense of legal procedure. Indeed, the Islamic State adopted Saudi texts until it could write its own. In regions such as the Balkans Saudi subsidies have helped transform a relatively mild Islam into a much more confrontational creed. Norwegian anti-terrorism specialist Thomas Hegghammer argued “If there was going to be an Islamic reformation in the 20th century, the Saudis probably prevented it by pumping out literalism.”Yet Saudi Arabia and its cohorts are blaming Qatar for funding terrorism!?Certainly Doha should review its own actions: concerted effort is needed to cut off financing for terrorist groups everywhere. But its neighbors have the same responsibility. And where Qatar diverges from its neighbors it often is for the better.The best Western policy towards Iran would be to build on the nuclear agreement and continue to try to draw it into the international system, weakening extremist forces and creating greater pressure for reform at home. With repression from nations like Egypt encouraging a turn toward extremism and violence by the MB, Qatar offers a moderating influence. No one gains from pushing political Islam underground. Even a group like Hamas, which is an effective government ruling over millions of Palestinians, must be dealt with, not ignored.Although Secretary Tillerson has done his best to encourage the parties to resolve their differences—he just landed in Kuwait to make his latest attempt—he has a thankless task. President Trump has made the problem immeasurably worse by acting as the chief lobbyist for the Saudi royals. Yet they may be the most malign actors in the region today.As for Ambassador Ghobash’s threat that other nations should choose between the contending Gulf States, Western governments should respond with contempt. When the UAE and Saudi Arabia stop funding terrorism, attacking their neighbors, and oppressing their peoples, they may presume to lecture others. Until then, they should look inward. And if they don’t want to deal with the prosperous West, they can go elsewhere.This article was first published in Forbes online."
13,THE WORLDPOST,Trump's Foreign Policy Is 'Buy American' — Become An Ally By Becoming A Client,"Fyodor Lukyanov, ContributorEditor, Russia in Global Affairs",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-g20_us_5963d909e4b03f144e2cf2f1,"The rest, including political initiatives and even military force, seem for Trump to serve only as means to achieve commercial ends.",2017-07-11,Putin and Trump meet at the G20 in Hamburg on July 7.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596406bc2100003700fc63ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MOSCOW — At the meeting last week in Hamburg, the G20 turned into the G19+1. The “one” is not Russia, as one would expect, but the United States. The biggest economy in this global club, which was created to counter protectionist instincts, now openly proclaims a protectionist course. At the summit, it was ready to compromise only on minor corrections in the wording of the final declaration. China and Germany, two major targets of U.S. mistrust, reiterated their support for an open global economy. Russia supported the rest of the 19, both in trade and on climate issues, while being unusually constructive vis-à-vis the global agenda.Many Russian commentators have argued that the Hamburg summit marked a watershed moment in global development, when previous divides lost their relevance. Instead of emerging (or re-emerging in the case of Russia) versus developed economies, we are witnessing a growing split between “globalists” and “nationalists” — with some of the weaker globalists tensely watching trends at home, prepared to change sides if the more nationalistic approach prevails. And such trends could well prevail because, even isolated, the U.S. can still set the tone for many on the global stage. Whatever the experts might warn about avoiding trade wars, if somebody starts it, others will have to respond.Russian perceptions of U.S. President Donald Trump have gone through several stages. Initially, there was a sense of euphoria generated by his positive comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign and in the wake of his fully unexpected defeat of Hillary Clinton, whose statements on Russia and Putin left little space for positive expectations. Trump’s fixation on “deals” inspired some hope in Moscow as well, since pragmatism has always been proclaimed in Russia as the right and sober way to conduct inter-state affairs, contrary to the Western “value-based” approach. The Kremlin has always been committed to traditional geopolitical thinking, believing in a balance of power and reliance on hard power. For that reason, some say it is obsolete and cynical in its ways.Post-Soviet Russia was so focused on its own affairs and the need to overcome severe internal crisis — not least the implications of the collapse of its international status — that any concern with the common global good simply disappeared from the political imagination. An encompassing sense of the unfair treatment of Russia after the end of the Cold War added to the murky perception of international politics as a jungle-style zero-sum game.Everything is relative. Compared to the overtly mercantilist approach that Trump is not even trying to hide, Russia’s old-fashioned realism seems almost romantic. Even hardcore realists believe in rules, although generated by a power balance and not just by negotiated agreements. Mercantilists are much more flexible — profit is the endgame. That’s it. “Buy American” seems to be not only Trump’s domestic but also his international message — to allies above all. The rest, including big political initiatives and even use of military force, seem for him to serve only as means to achieve commercial ends.If Russia (and other countries) want to get Trump’s America right, it must not try to define it through moribund terms of the Cold War or post-Cold War world. Any American president who sees Germany primarily as an economic competitor and disregards the geopolitical or ideological dimensions is openly departing from the 20th century framework.Russians misunderstood Trump’s rhetoric when he spoke about deals. We didn’t realize he meant deals in the literal sense of those that bring economic gain, not geopolitical compromise. Others misunderstood as well, but not all. The Gulf states got it right — the more contracts with America agreed by Saudi Arabia, for example, the stronger the commitments from the U.S.Poles understood as well — they agreed to buy Patriot missiles and enthusiastically supported the idea of replacing Russian gas with American liquefied natural gas, at whatever the cost. Polish President Andrzej Duda went even further and offered Poland as a hub to dispatch U.S. gas to the whole of Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Maybe this is a reason why the Trump administration has turned its attention to Ukraine and recently started to demonstrate much more interest than before.Trump has also transformed the trans-Atlantic ties of NATO. The Article 5 obligation for America to come to defense of any member seems no longer to be a value-based and solidarity-driven arrangement but a mere service delivered by the U.S. to its distinguished clients. And for this service, America should be paid not only by increased European defense spending but by customer loyalty as well.Russia is confused by such an approach and is trying to figure out how to cope. Others are embarrassed too. The temptation is to ascribe this change to the peculiar characteristics of one U.S. president. Trump’s personality does indeed play a role. But looking back, it is difficult not to notice a longer trend of American disengagement from previous relationships and alliances. We’ve seen this starting from George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, with their ideas about a “coalition of the willing” and an “old” and “new” Europe, to Barack Obama’s modest interest in European affairs combined with his pivot to Asia. Trump is just taking it to the next level.After the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia strove to restore its statehood, its economic and political system, and its international stature. Russia felt defeated and wished to make up for its Cold War losses; the West, led by the U.S., was engulfed in euphoria and self-admiration.But between 2008 and 2016 — from the world financial crisis to Brexit and Trump’s election, the West’s delight gradually gave way to anxiety. Eventually, it became clear that things had not gone the way they were intended to go at the end of the last century.The Hamburg summit marks the turning point from the past to the future. The contest to shape that future is the order of the day. In that contest, by its own choice, the U.S. will not only be one among many but, if it continues its present course, one against many, as was the case at the G20 summit."
14,HEALTHY LIVING,Gucci Mane Focuses On Recovery To Find New Music Success,"Jeremy Broderick, ContributorRecovery Advocate - Founder, Windward Way Recovery",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gucci-mane-focuses-on-recovery-to-find-new-music-success_us_59645620e4b0deab7c646b67,I was inspired and amazed to read this incredible artist’s story.,2017-07-11,"Gucci Mane performs on stage on Day 6 of Roskilde Festival on June 29, 2017 in Roskilde, Denmark.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5964dd641800003500673aca.jpeg?ops=crop_0_96_5015_2985%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"I was scrolling through Facebook this week and a link caught my eye: Gucci Mane, Sober for 3 Years. I was inspired and amazed to read this incredible artist’s story. It reminds me that sober people are everywhere, even in places we least expect it.Gucci Mane, who was born Radric Davis, is a bright light in hip hop. He’s released over 2,000 songs and collaborated with the industry’s best producers, as well as artists like Mariah and Mario. He came from the Atlanta hip hop scene, which is known for its innovation. The New York Times said, “Gucci’s trademark is his flow: buoyant and melodic, with light comedic flourishes. He raps with a slurry intricacy that’s inscrutable to old-fashioned hip-hop purists, but holds consistent thrills. His rhymes take unanticipated turns, and he loves to hover over the same syllable, dropping it over and over from different angles.”And, like so many people who are bright, smart, and creative, he struggled with addiction, too. His drug use increased until he said he was smoking almost a pound of weed every other day. “I talked different,” he told FADER Magazine. “When I was drinking lean like crazy every day, I was out of my mind.”I definitely related to that. Obviously, I’m not a hip hop star. But I did have a monumental drug and alcohol problem, and when I was actively using, I couldn’t stay out of trouble either. Gucci’s been arrested 10 times since 2001. The drug, assault, and gun charges, plus a murder charge that was dropped in 2005, kept him incarcerated for most of this decade. Being a black man, with drug problems, in a highly visible career, only added to his struggle.Gucci has stayed close to greatness but his addiction kept him from realizing his incredible potential. “Every single time that he was about to break through is exactly when he went back to jail,” said Todd Moscowitz, a member of Gucci’s management team. According to Gucci, part of his addiction was believing that he needed drugs and alcohol to create: that his music was somehow “better” when he was drinking and using. That’s a common misconception about musicians, artists, and other creative people. Now that Gucci is sober, his fans are listening closely to his new music and judging whether “he was better before he got sober.”Gucci, who got sober during a 3-year prison sentence, is happy, healthy, and hard at work in the studio. Now 36, he said that he hadn’t been sober since he was 17. That’s almost two decades of drug use. He tried rehab once, but it didn’t work for him. He struggled to find a solution to his misery. “I can’t say I felt happy my last six, seven years in the music business,” he said. “I was just numb. You told me that I was doing good or told me I was doing bad, you hated me or loved me, either which way I greeted with nonchalance. It was sincere nonchalance—like, I really didn’t care.”He finally detoxed behind bars at the high-security federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. He composed songs with pen and paper, exercised until he had a six-pack, and learned the language of recovery from reading self help books and the Bible. He emerged from prison in May looking so different that people wondered if he was a clone. He says, no, it’s still him: just sober, clear, and on top of his game. “A clone is, like, perfection. So if I look like a machine or a robot, then I’m doing something well,” he said.Yet, during his years of active addiction, he also made amazing strides. He discovered Waka Flocka Flame and Young Thug, and launched producers like Zaytoven, Drumma Boy and Mike Will Made-It into the spotlight. Now that he’s been released to house arrest and probation, he is focusing on his sober lifestyle and continuing to work on his career. He acknowledges his previous success, but emphasizes that the real victory isn’t his record sales or his swag. “Anybody can do the stuff Gucci used to do,” he said. “Can y’all copy living how I’m living? Can y’all copy getting y’all life together?”It’s true. Anyone can drink, or party every weekend. Getting sober and finding lasting recovery is the real gift. Gucci Mane is an amazing example of what’s possible, and his story inspires me to keep investing in my own recovery. People in recovery are everywhere: in prison, in the music industry, and in the house next door. It’s great to be reminded that no matter where we start, we can get sober and stay that way.Jeremy Broderick is a national recovery advocate and founder of Windward Way Recovery in Costa Mesa, California."
15,POLITICS,LGBTQ Rights Group Launches Massive Anti-Trump Effort For 2018,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hrc-lgbtq-rights-donald-trump_us_5963a41ce4b0d5b458ec4ec7,"The Human Rights Campaign is investing $26 million in supporting pro-equality candidates and ""resisting the politics of hate.""",2017-07-11,Members of the LGBTQ community protest President Donald Trump at the 2017 Pride Parade in Los Angeles.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596400432100003700fc639e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Human Rights Campaign announced Tuesday that it’s making a massive ― and early ― investment in its grassroots mobilization efforts, with a goal of turning the 2018 midterm elections into a rebuke of President Donald Trump and anti-LGBTQ members of Congress.The LGBTQ rights group is spending $26 million on “HRC Rising,” a new campaign aimed at electing pro-equality candidates and fighting homophobic policies in all 50 states. HRC will beef up its staff and volunteers nationwide, but make a particularly strong push in six states: Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada. It will also focus on trying to unseat about two dozen House Republicans with records of voting against LGBTQ rights but who represent districts Hillary Clinton won last year.It’s the biggest investment the organization has made in its 37-year history. It’s also more than a year out from the midterms, which is early in the political process for such a coordinated grassroots effort. HRC president Chad Griffin said it’s warranted given “the extreme nature” of Trump’s administration.“Mike Pence has spent his entire career attempting to undermine equal rights for LGBTQ people. That’s who Trump chose as his No. 2,” Griffin told HuffPost. “His secretary of housing and urban development [Ben Carson], charged with enforcing fair housing, doesn’t even acknowledge that LGBT people exist. Then, one of [Betsy DeVos’] first acts as education secretary was to attack transgender students.”Griffin is referring to Carson previously describing the LGBTQ community as “a few people who perhaps are abnormal.” DeVos, in February, rolled back protections put into place by President Barack Obama for transgender kids. Vice President Pence, meanwhile, has a generally awful record on LGBTQ rights.A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on HRC’s plans.For all the losses Democrats sustained in 2016, HRC did see some scattered wins. National exit polls last fall revealed that LGBTQ voters were the only demographic that increased in support for Clinton over Obama four years earlier. HRC also successfully mobilized supporters to bring down former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R), who authored the state’s extreme anti-LGBTQ law, HB 2. By Election Day, 57 percent of voters said the law was the top reason they voted against McCrory.The way HRC sees it, the secret to the North Carolina victory was significant long-term investment and staff deployment on the ground. That’s the same tack it plans to take in other states leading up to 2018. The group has already begun recruiting at least 20 new full-time staff for political, field and volunteer engagement work. Those staffers will team up with HRC’s existing volunteer-led committees around the country to expand local partnerships, mobilize constituents and register voters.“We are seeing more activism than we have ever seen in our organization’s 37-year history,” Griffin added. “We intend to harness that energy.”"

Buffett, Sherwood and NoVo Foundations, respectively overseen by his children, Howard, Susan and Peter.Following Monday’s donation, Buffet remained the world’s fourth-richest person, according to Forbes magazine.Before the donations were announced, Forbes estimated Buffett’s net worth at $76.3 billion, trailing Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates’ $89.4 billion, Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos’ $84.8 billion, and Spanish retailing magnate Amancio Ortega’s $81.8 billion.Gates is a close friend of Buffett and a Berkshire director.Buffett typically reduces the number of shares he donates by 5 percent from the prior year.The charities usually sell the Berkshire shares to finance their activities, reflecting Buffett’s desire that his money be spent. Buffett also makes smaller donations to other charities."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596532901800003500673c31.jpeg?cache=Nak1gexHvV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After months of internal criticism and increasing press attention, The Wall Street Journal’s parent company, Dow Jones, just announced a new effort to tackle gender equality at the paper, which has a reported gender pay gap and a clear lack of women leaders.In an email to all Dow Jones staff, the company’s chief executive, William Lewis, said he plans on hiring a “diversity and inclusion specialist” to spearhead the effort, which will ultimately also focus on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and other areas.Improving conditions for women is the current priority, Lewis writes in the memo, sent Monday and published Tuesday in Talking Biz News.“Promoting gender equality within our company will be the critical, initial focus,” Lewis writes in the email. “This is not the limit of our ambition in promoting diversity ― rather, it is a starting point.”Lewis provides few details on how the new effort would work. However, he does say the company will aim to increase the percentage of women in its executive ranks to 40 percent. He also outlined a female mentorship program for 25 women at the company that will help “accelerate their careers.”“We are currently working through this process and will have more to share in the coming weeks and months,” a Wall Street Journal spokesman told HuffPost.Read the full memo below.Staffers at the paper had mixed feelings about the email, one Journal reporter told HuffPost. “Will believe in change when I actually see it,” a female reporter said. “Easy to set vague goals. Harder to follow through.”“The email promises to take some of the more visible aspects of gender equity seriously, like career advancement,” said another female reporter. However, the paper needs to do more to address gender pay gap issues, she added.After a report last year found women were making less than men at the paper, the company said it looked into the issue and made some adjustments. Then, this year, a new and more detailed report revealed more problems: Even when controlling for their levels of experience, job title and location, women still made less than men. Lewis said in his email that 2 percent of salaries at the company would be adjusted because of these issues, but so far, the company hasn’t said more about the latest numbers ― or made its own pay audit public. “We regard any steps Dow Jones management takes to improve diversity and gender equality as positive moves,” said Tim Martell, the executive director of IAPE, the news guild that represents the Journal’s reporters and conducted the pay audits, in an email to HuffPost. “However, Dow Jones still has not responded to the recent pay equity study conducted by IAPE, and we are surprised the company’s latest analysis shows only 2% of employees are in need of further adjustments to their salaries.”Many companies hire diversity executives to track data on staff demographics, something Lewis said his new hire would work on. And many corporations set modest diversity targets ― earlier this year, Twitter announced it had met some of its goals. The company had aimed to increase its total percentage of women from 34 percent to 35 percent and surpassed that goal, getting the number to 37 percent. Dow Jones does not publicly report the percentage of women at the Journal, but only four of the paper’s 14 top editors (who include Editor-in-Chief Gerard Baker and his deputy Matt Murray) are women. Only two of those women work on news coverage directly. Lewis’ Monday memo comes less than a month after a half-dozen female reporters at the outlet emailed Baker and Murray on behalf of nearly 200 staffers, expressing their growing frustration with the paper over its lack of action on diversity and gender equality. The email, obtained by HuffPost, noted that members of the paper’s leadership haven’t meaningfully addressed either the paper’s lack of racial diversity or its gender pay gap, first reported more than a year ago. (Full disclosure: This reporter was an editor at the Journal from 2006-2011.) That communication followed an earlier note from more than 200 staffers that offered concrete suggestions on how the Journal could diversify, including by adopting a practice of always considering women and minorities for open leadership positions and by releasing a detailed salary audit to staff that includes information on gender and ethnicity. The Journal has been a leader in reporting corporate efforts on diversity, and people working on bias in corporate America consider most of the employees’ ideas to be best practices.It remains to be seen whether any of the proposals will be adopted.Read Dow Jones CEO William Lewis’ email on the company’s diversity efforts below.Dear Colleague,This story was updated with comment from Tim Martell."

More than 1,700 people in the war-torn country have died of cholera in the past months, the International Committee of the Red Cross announced on Monday, and 300,000 people are suspected to be ill. The epidemic is now growing at the staggering rate of 7,000 new cases per day, said Robert Mardini, the Red Cross regional director for the Middle East, in a tweet. The capital of Sanaa and the regions of Hodeida, Hajjah and Amran are among the hardest hit. “Unfortunately, we have a perfect storm in Yemen,” ICRC spokeswoman Iolanda Jaquemet told HuffPost on Monday. “The country has been brought to its knees because of this conflict.”Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by the ingestion of contaminated food or water, and it can be fatal. Yemen’s historic poverty and years of fighting between the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels have made access to clean water “a luxury” there, Jaquemet said. Over 14 million Yemeni civilians do not have access to clean water.In addition, the war has left more than half the country’s health care facilities closed or partially functioning due to severe medicine and staff shortages and inadequate infrastructure and equipment. A de facto blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia also contributes to the shortage of pain medication, antibiotics, vaccines and other surgical equipment, according to a report by the NGO network Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict. Half the people affected with cholera in Yemen are classified as having severe cases of the disease, meaning they are or will be in desperate need of medical care such as intravenous fluids and antibiotics, said Jaquemet. Just two months ago, the World Health Organization called the epidemic in Yemen “the worst cholera outbreak in the world.” The WHO reported at the time that the number of cholera cases in the country surpassed 200,000, meaning that the epidemic has since increased at an alarming rate. Preventable diseases like cholera target the most vulnerable civilians first, such as older people and children. Thirty-three percent of people who die from the disease are over age 60, while half the infections occur in children under 15 years old, according to the WHO. Sanaa declared a state of emergency in May and called for international help to deal with the crisis. Yemen’s health ministry, run by Houthi rebels, said via its news agency, Saba, that the outbreak was “unprecedented” and had become impossible to contain.“The situation is in Yemen absolutely tragic,” ICRC’s Jaquemet said on Monday. “There just isn’t enough attention to given to the situation.”"

The survey was conducted in late June, soon after Trump launched a Twitter rant against “Morning Joe” host Mika Brzezinski.In contrast, 37 percent approve of Trump’s handling of the presidency overall, 38 percent approve of the way Trump is carrying out his policies as president, and 40 percent approve of his positions on policy issues. (HuffPost Pollster’s average of public polls gives Trump an overall approval rating of about 40 percent as of Monday afternoon.)Results remain deeply divided along political lines. Eighty percent of voters who supported Trump in last year’s election approve of his temperament, according to the HuffPost/YouGov survey, with 90 percent or more approving on the remaining measures. Around 90 percent of voters who supported Hillary Clinton disapprove of his performance across all four metrics tested.Although the majority of Trump voters approve of the president across all of the questions, just 45 percent say they strongly approve of Trump’s temperament as president. By contrast, 58 percent strongly approve of the job he’s doing overall, and nearly two-thirds strongly support both his policy positions and the work he’s done to carry them out. Just because many Americans don’t like Trump’s personality, of course, doesn’t mean they’ve all turned against him ― or even that they would necessarily vote against him. Nineteen percent of voters who didn’t feel Trump had the temperament to be president voted for him anyway, according to last year’s exit polls, as did 17 percent of those who didn’t feel he was qualified and 20 percent of those who didn’t consider him honest and trustworthy. Asked whom they’d prefer to see as president, 27 percent of those in the HuffPost/YouGov poll named Trump, with 11 percent saying they’d prefer a different Republican, 36 percent saying they’d prefer a Democrat, and 26 percent saying they weren’t sure.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted June 29-30 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

The pipeline currently runs 10,200 miles from Texas to New York. The $3 billion expansion, called Atlantic Sunrise, aims to increase the pipeline’s capacity by 1.7 million dekatherms per day, according to the company’s website.Atlantic Sunrise would cross land owned by the Adorers, as well as that of other residents who have refused to sell their land to Williams. The company filed an emergency order last week to seize control of the Adorers’ land. But a U.S. district judge ruled against granting Williams immediate possession of the property, according to Lancaster Online.A court hearing scheduled for July 17 will determine whether the company has the right to seize the land via eminent domain.Sunday’s ceremony served as a symbolic action to delay construction of the pipeline.“While the Adorers understand that the federal court order of eminent domain, once it goes into effect, can allow Transco to call for the removal of the ‘chapel’ from the easement, they believe that having this structure on their land, for however long, gives tangible witness to the sacredness of Earth,” the nuns wrote in a statement.Williams did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement obtained by CNN, the company said it respected the nuns’ right to protest as long as it didn’t interfere with the project.“With the exception of the width of the construction right-of-way, this structure (the open-air chapel) can be placed anywhere else on the property without issue,” Williams said.The Adorers say the pipeline goes against their land ethic, a theological statement approved by their congregation in 2005, and which treats the environment as sacred and promotes reverence for the Earth.Neumann said if the judge rules in favor of eminent domain next week, residents are prepared to hold vigil at the chapel 24/7.“Our only remaining option is to put our bodies on the line,” she said."

He was visiting North Korea with a tour group. On Thursday, North Korea said that it had released Warmbier “on humanitarian grounds.”The University of Virginia student’s father, Fred Warmbier, said at an earlier news conference that his son had been “brutalized and terrorized” by the North Korean government.Fred Warmbier said the family did not believe North Korea’s story that his son had fallen into a coma after contracting botulism and being given a sleeping pill.Doctors said on Thursday that there was no sign of botulism in Otto Warmbier’s system.Kanter said that Warmbier had suffered “extensive loss of brain tissue in all regions of the brain,” but he declined to discuss Warmbier’s prognosis at the request of his family.While doctors are uncertain as to what exactly caused the condition, cardiac arrest that stops the flow of blood to the brain is generally seen as resulting in the death of brain tissue.Cardiac arrest in young, healthy people is rare and generally caused by either intoxication or traumatic injury, Dr. Jordan Bonomo, a specialist in neurosurgery and neurocritical care at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, said at the news conference.Although doctors had no information about the type of medical treatment Warmbier received while in North Korea, they did receive MRI images from North Korea dated April 2016, Kanter said. Based on those images, doctors estimate the brain injury likely occurred in the preceding weeks, he said.Doctors said there was no evidence that Warmbier suffered any broken bones.On Thursday, the State Department said that its special envoy on North Korea, Joseph Yun, who negotiated Warmbier’s release during a visit to the country this week, had also met with three other U.S. citizens being held in North Korea.Tensions between the United States and North Korea have been heightened by North Korean missile launches and two nuclear bomb tests. Pyongyang has vowed to develop a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.Fred Warmbier said he was stunned when told of his son’s condition one week ago.“I don’t know what being in shock is, but I’m pretty sure I was,” he said.“There is no excuse for any civilized nation to have kept his condition secret and denied him top-notch medical care for so long.”He said his wife, Cindy, had not left their son’s side since his return to the United States and that he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday night.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters on Thursday, “We’re glad he’s home.” He said officials would not comment on Warmbier’s health or how he came to be in his current condition.Tillerson said on Wednesday that U.S. officials were considering some type of travel visa restriction to North Korea.U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill last month that would ban U.S. citizens from traveling to North Korea as tourists and require them to obtain special permission for other types of visits, following the detention of at least 17 Americans there in the past decade.In Wyoming, a northern Cincinnati suburb of about 8,000 people, Warmbier’s return to the United States was marked by blue and white ribbons, representing the colors of the local high school, tied around trees and telephone polls.(Writing by Timothy Mclaughlin in Chicago; Additional reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin, and Mohammad Zargham and David Brunnstrom in Washington, Texas; Editing by Toni Reinhold and Leslie Adler)"

31,POLITICS,ACLU Stalls Trump’s Plan To Deport Iraqi Christians,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-iraqi-christians-aclu_us_59415667e4b09ad4fbe4ce41,"“Our immigration policy shouldn’t amount to a death sentence for anyone,"" the ACLU says.",2017-06-15,"The remains of destroyed church are seen in the town of Qaraqosh, south of Mosul, Iraq, on April 13, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59430494210000290033c761.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The American Civil Liberties Union has slowed down the Trump administration’s plan to deport 114 Iraqis, most of them Christians, who were arrested in Michigan last weekend and were expected to face deportation starting Friday.After the ACLU filed a class-action petition and a motion for a temporary restraining order on behalf of the Iraqis on Thursday, the government set a hearing for Wednesday afternoon and confirmed that deportations would not be allowed to begin until next Friday at the earliest, Rana Elmir, the deputy director of the ACLU of Michigan, told HuffPost. At the hearing next Wednesday, the detainees will have a chance to tell a judge their fears about what they could face in the war-torn nation, including torture and violent religious persecution, and the judge will have the opportunity to halt the deportations pending further legal proceedings.The rights group believes President Donald Trump’s move to begin the deportations was illegal.“Not only is it immoral to send people to a country where they are likely to be violently persecuted, it expressly violates United States and international law and treaties,” said Kary Moss, the executive director of the ACLU of Michigan, in a Thursday afternoon statement. “We are hoping that the courts will recognize the extreme danger that deportation to Iraq would pose for these individuals,” she added. “Our immigration policy shouldn’t amount to a death sentence for anyone.”Activists and community members were startled by the weekend arrests because of Trump’s promises to protect Christians in the Middle East and prioritize Christian refugees. Many Iraqi Christians voted for Trump in Michigan ― a key state he won by only a few thousand votes.Both the Obama and Trump administrations, along with Congress, have declared the persecution of Christians in Iraq a “genocide” ― suggesting the U.S. has some responsibility to help.Advocates like Nathan Kalasho, an activist who runs a popular charter school in the area, discussed the feeling of betrayal but avoided drawing sectarian lines: “This is not just a Christian matter,” Kalasho told HuffPost on Wednesday.Shiite Muslims and members of the small Yazidi community ISIS has targeted were among those arrested in Michigan and other states, the ACLU statement said.The ACLU petition named seven individuals: five Christian Iraqis who were brought to the U.S. as children and two Shiite Muslims, one of whom arrived here as a refugee at age 19. It blasts ICE for holding the petitioners in Ohio, miles from their families.Most members of the detained group entered the U.S. legally and then lost their legal status because of criminal convictions. Despite receiving removal orders, they remained in the United States because Iraq declined to issue travel documents for most Iraqis who received orders of deportation, the ACLU’s petition noted.On March 12, however, Iraq agreed to start taking back more Iraqi nationals living in the U.S. so it could be dropped from the list of Muslim-majority countries affected by President Donald Trump’s travel ban. (The ban policy also invalidated Trump’s promise to help Middle East Christian refugees: Decreasing the overall intake of refugees would reduce the number of Christians allowed in.)ICE does not comment on pending litigation, press secretary Gillian Christensen told HuffPost in an email on Thursday. An earlier statement from ICE said the arrested individuals had already gone through court proceedings and that their previous criminal records posed a “very real public safety threat.” But many of the detained people had their troubles with the law years ago, some for lower-level offenses, according to activists and the ACLU. Since then, they complied with their orders of supervision by periodically checking in with immigration authorities.“Petitioners, Christian and Muslim alike, cannot be removed to Iraq without being afforded a process to determine whether, based on current conditions and circumstances, the danger they would face entitles them to protection from removal,” the petition read. Activists say the Trump administration move should show the Middle East Christian community in Michigan and around the country that their hopes were misplaced.“Every move [Trump has] made in the Middle East has been an unmitigated disaster for Christians in the region, and now he’s brought his ‘Midas touch’ to our community in Michigan,” Steve Oshana, executive director of A Demand For Action, which works on Middle Eastern Christian issues, wrote in a Thursday email. Wisam Naoum, a volunteer attorney whose own parents came to the U.S. to escape conflict between Iraq and Iran, said the community now feels trapped between multiple threats.“Since 2014, our community has been fighting [the Islamic State]. All of our resources have been going to our internally displaced people in the homeland, to galvanizing support for our militias, to getting a political solution,” Naoum told HuffPost on Wednesday. “And now in 2017, our war against ISIS has opened up into a two-front war: against ISIS and the Trump administration.” This story has been updated throughout."

Huntpalmer’s shirt features a rainbow and the words “rainbow dad.”“As the host of a birth stories podcast, I hear stories of loss regularly, but I also know that in the mainstream world of all things baby, pregnancy and infant loss aren’t as widely discussed,” Huntpalmer told HuffPost.“One question I always ask my guests is, ‘What types of resources were most helpful to you during your journey?’” she explained. “They always tell me about how helpful the pregnancy loss community was to them, whether it was a Facebook group, a local support group or a hashtag on Instagram; they want to feel like they aren’t alone. And while there are so many ways for moms to find support, dads are often left out.”Huntpalmer has two kids, ages 3 and 5, and recently suffered a miscarriage. She said she first got to know the pregnancy and infant loss community when her best friend lost her baby at 34 weeks pregnant. “I found that it was always the moms that were finding ways to share their child with the world, whether through wearing a necklace with the baby’s footprints or wearing a “rainbow mama” shirt, but there’s not a lot out their for men,” she said.Huntpalmer thought having a ‘rainbow dad’ shirt could serve as a small way to bring more men into the pregnancy loss community. She enlisted a group of moms and dads to help design a shirt that fathers would want to wear.“Funnily enough, my husband actually gets a little jealous that I have so many mom-and-me matching tees with our kids while there’s nothing like that for dads, so I designed a “rainbow kid” shirt too,” she told HuffPost.The shirt is available on Amazon and comes in five different colors. Huntpalmer is asking people to use the hashtag #rainbowdad to post photos of dads wearing the shirt and share their stories.“The response has been so heartfelt and enthusiastic that it has really confirmed the need for something like this for dads,” she said. “The dads that I have spoken to really love the idea of a way to recognize their role in the family after the loss of their child.

Ultimately, starting conversations is the main goal of the shirt. “When you’ve lost a baby, it is always on your mind, and this mistaken idea that it hurts to have it brought up is what has contributed to the stigma around infant loss and miscarriage,” Huntpalmer said.“All of the dads that I know that have suffered a loss are eager to talk about their baby, and being able to wear a shirt that brings that conversation to the forefront is just one more way to do that,” she added. “The grief that parents go through after a loss is a hard thing to put into words and often people assume that once you have your rainbow baby, you are ‘all better.’ While rainbow babies do bring an overwhelming amount of joy, the child that died is such an important part of the journey as well.”"

NBC has faced criticism for giving Jones a network television platform and a teaser prompted doubts he’ll be seriously grilled over his reckless claims. CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker defended booking Jones, telling reporters that he is a “newsworthy” subject because President Donald Trump “relies on him and his points of view.”The issue, Zucker said, is that NBC’s handling this week didn’t indicate he’d be “held to account as much as somebody who spews such hatred and nonsense needs to be.”“You can’t put out pictures of yourselves driving in cars together and wearing sunglasses and tease the way they did,” said Zucker, who was previously CEO of NBCUniversal. “If you’re going to do this story, the tease needs to be you holding up a picture of the dead kids at Sandy Hook and saying, ‘How dare you?’”“New Day” co-hosts Alisyn Camerota and Chris Cuomo, who were being honored Thursday on the fourth anniversary of the CNN morning show, both agreed Jones is worthy of being interviewed given his influence. Camerota said she is interested in how Jones justifies “his sickening philosophy” and positions.“The complete responsibility is on the interviewer to be prosecutorial and to really, really hold his feet to the fire,” she said. “If you can do that with someone who’s that slippery, then I do think it has some news merit.”Cuomo said he would have released a transcript of the interview with Jones after the controversy began, which NBC has not done, but also defended the competitor against the charge it shouldn’t book the conspiracy theorist. “I think it’s a little dangerous to get into the ‘you don’t deserve a platform’ business,” he said. “If someone has no following, and they come out of nowhere, and I decide to elevate you, and make you relevant, now I think that you have a bigger stick in your hands when you come at me with that question.” “But when you’re dealing with someone like Alex Jones, who clearly has a constituency, who has the president of the United States who has applauded him and supported his efforts ― at least in part ― well now the relevance is built in,” he continued. Jones appeared on CNN four years ago to debate gun rights with then-host Piers Morgan.

36,MEDIA,CNN Chief Calls Politicians' Attacks On The Media 'Shameful' And 'Dangerous',Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cnn-jeff-zucker-press-attacks_us_5942b65be4b06bb7d2718be8,"Anti-press rhetoric and threats are ""much more serious than I think anybody would realize,"" says Jeff Zucker.",2017-06-15,CNN chief Jeff Zucker said correspondents have faced heightened anti-press rhetoric.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5942ba1f15000045004e688d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CNN President Jeff Zucker said Thursday that the “the amount of rhetoric and threats” that his network’s journalists receive daily “is much more serious than I think anybody would realize.”GOP congressional candidate Greg Gianforte’s violent attack on a reporter last month brought national attention to an alarming trend of journalists around the country facing physical aggression when doing their jobs.During a breakfast with reporters celebrating the fourth anniversary of “New Day,” HuffPost asked Zucker about the uptick in verbal and physical attacks on journalists ― not only from the president’s Twitter feed, but also from politicians around the country. Zucker signaled deep worry inside the network over the matter, initially saying he needs to speak carefully in public about just “how serious a concern we think this is.”He acknowledged there has been a recent spate of examples in which the press has been targeted, but said CNN has been dealing with anti-media rhetoric “in a very real and heightened way over the last 18 months, when our correspondents are front and center at events where the chants about CNN are front and center.”During the presidential campaign, “CNN sucks” became a common refrain among supporters of now-President Donald Trump, who routinely attacked the network and even individual journalists on stage. In Gianforte’s case, he went on to win the election even after being charged with assault.“This is what happens when you try to delegitimize an institution that is doing its job,” Zucker said. “And I think it is shameful on the part of the administration and other politicians to cause a frenzy against something that is guaranteed in the Constitution of the United States. And it does disservice to this country and its position in the world and ... allows for a heightened sense of rhetoric against journalists and media organizations. And it is unconscionable and dangerous and they should know better.”"
37,BLACK VOICES,A Major Christian Denomination Almost Passed Up An Opportunity To Condemn White Supremacy,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/southern-baptist-convention-alt-right_us_5942cc37e4b01eab7a2c3e69,"The Southern Baptist Convention passed a revised resolution to condemn ""alt-right"" ideology after outrage over their initial failure to do so.",2017-06-15,"Hundreds gather for a ""Unity, Peace and Prayer Rally"" at Cornerstone Baptist Church in Arlington, Texas, where Rev. Dwight McKissic is senior pastor.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5942ed3716000022001166a7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When a black pastor submitted a statement condemning white supremacy to the Southern Baptist Convention for review this week, the resolutions committee swiftly denied it and moved on.A revised version of the resolution ultimately passed, but only after considerable internal and outside pressure forced the denomination’s president to step in.It’s not uncommon for the committee to turn down a resolution, said Rev. Dwight McKissic, the Texas pastor who submitted the proposal.“When that happens, you can either accept it or challenge it by asking the convention in session to request that the resolutions committee bring your resolution to the floor to be voted on,” McKissic told HuffPost. “So I chose to challenge it.”The Southern Baptist Convention, the country’s largest Protestant denomination, convened on Tuesday and Wednesday in Arizona for its annual meeting, during which church leaders discussed denominational issues, made budget decisions, and voted on resolutions outlining their theological and social stances on various issues.Every year, a 10-person resolutions committee reviews proposals and determines which issues will be voted upon at the meeting. Just one of the committee’s members is black this year, McKissic said.The pastor’s original resolution, a draft of which he posted on Southern Baptist blog site SBC Voices in May, denounced the alt-right movement ― the beliefs of which include white supremacist rhetoric ― as a “toxic menace.” It urged the convention to oppose its “totalitarian impulses, xenophobic biases, and bigoted ideologies that infect the minds and actions of its violent disciples.”It referenced the “curse of Ham” as the root of white supremacy in the “Christian context.” This once-touted theory was used in the justification of slavery and racial segregation and claimed that “God through Noah ordained descendants of Africa to be subservient to Anglos.”The committee initially refused to consider the resolution. After McKissic challenged the committee’s decision, convention attendees voted on whether to instruct the panel to reconsider, which would require a two-thirds majority. The vote failed.“After that I took my seat,” McKissic said. “I could live with that because everything had gone by the rules.”Barrett Duke, the head of the resolutions committee, told The Atlantic that he was aware that “feelings rightly run high regarding alt-right ideology,” but didn’t clarify what those feelings were. “We share those feelings,” he said. “We just weren’t certain we could craft a resolution that would enable us to measure our strong convictions with the grace of love, which we’re also commended by Jesus to incorporate.”But resolutions rarely go for a vote in their original forms, McKissic said. Duke confirmed to The Atlantic that the committee hadn’t reached out to McKissic to work on a revised version.Duke did not immediately respond to a request from HuffPost for comment.After internal debate and social media backlash, the convention decided to vote on whether to challenge the committee’s decision once again. And once again, the vote failed to reach a two-thirds majority.“I just want clarity from the president of the Southern Baptist Convention about whether we condemn, as a convention, racism,” said Rev. Garrett Kell, a white pastor in Virginia, addressing SBC president Rev. Steve Gaines from the microphone Tuesday night.Gaines responded, CNN reported, by saying: “I’ll speak for myself. I don’t know that I can speak for everyone in this room, but I believe God loves everyone. I believe there is only one race and that is the human race.”The Southern Baptist Convention has long grappled with issues of racial equality. The denomination first apologized in 1995 for its role in upholding the practice of slavery. Since then, the denomination has passed resolutions supporting racial reconciliation and calling on Christians to stop displaying the Confederate flag.Just when the denomination seemed poised to forgo an opportunity to categorically denounce white supremacy, a group of Southern Baptist leaders quickly got to work on a new draft of the resolution, which Gaines personally endorsed. The final resolution, unambiguously titled “On The Anti-Gospel Of Alt-Right White Supremacy,” finally went to the floor for a vote on Wednesday and passed.The resolution condemned “every form of racism, including alt-right white supremacy, as antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.” It didn’t mention the curse of Ham, which Duke said would be “redundant.”McKissic said he was satisfied with the final resolution and hoped it would be a stepping stone for further action on racial justice. But he added that “until the convention repents the curse of Ham by name,” the denomination will continue to be haunted by its racist past.“The damage was done by taking three votes on something that was a no-brainer,” McKissic said. “What’s the reason they couldn’t so readily say that white supremacy is wrong and the alt-right is evil? Many of us are asking that question.”"

Many are now stepping up to address one of the most urgent challenges today: the loss of America’s invaluable working forests.Protecting these forests—which provide jobs, timber for our homes, and pulp and fiber for paper and packaging—represents a leadership opportunity for corporations regardless of sector, especially those committed to taking responsibility for their most significant environmental footprints.This week, U-Haul and C&S Wholesale Grocers announced they are joining with The Conservation Fund in an initiative that will contribute to the continuing conservation of more than 8,700 acres of working forestland in New England. Both of these companies use significant amounts of wood fiber in order to serve their customers every day. U-Haul relies on forests for millions of moving boxes, while C&S uses wood pallets to ship food and groceries to thousands of stores. Both companies have committed to offset a portion of their forest footprint by contributing to the conservation effort surrounding New Hampshire’s Success Pond.A collaborative effort between The Conservation Fund, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Forest Legacy Program, and the New Hampshire Division of Forests and Lands—with funding from the two companies—will result in a conservation easement that ensures the forest will be sustainably managed, open to the public for outdoor recreation, and safeguarded from development. And because it will still be a working forest with environmentally-responsible timber operations taking place, it will support more than 20 jobs for loggers, truckers, foresters and more.This is significant because while many companies have a plan to address their consumption of energy or even water, most don’t quantify and account for their impact on the forests that supply the materials they use to package or ship the goods they make or sell. U-Haul and C&S Wholesale Grocers are setting an important example that is not only environmentally responsible, but also business savvy with an eye on more than just the short term.It’s a corporate leadership trend we hope will grow. Kimberly-Clark, one of the world’s largest buyers of pulp, recently promised to commit $4 million in order to further the global efforts to conserve the world’s forests in a branding partnership with World Wildlife Fund. Two years ago, Apple partnered with The Conservation Fund to protect more than 36,000 acres of working forestland in Maine and North Carolina, ensuring sustainable harvesting and a steady supply of timber to paper and pulp mills. Since then, Apple committed to protecting or creating enough sustainably managed forests to cover all its product packaging needs.Protecting and creating a sustainable supply for the wood we use in products every day is critical if we are to meet our supply chain and sustainability goals. Equally important, our nation’s manufacturing sector directly stands to benefit. But neither will happen without action. More than 45 million acres of working forests are at risk of being lost to development in the next 30 years. Once we lose them, we’ll never get them back. Protecting our environment and growing our economy don’t have to be at odds with one another. The announcements this week further illustrate how companies can reduce risk to their business objectives while making significant, and strategically important, environmental investments. The far-sighted companies we work with are playing the long-game by demonstrating that business and conservation are strongest when they work together. Keeping working forests ‘working’ is the epitome of long-term economic and environmental value. As we all explore opportunities to bolster the private sector’s role in corporate social responsibility at the local and community levels, this idea should be high on the list. It’s a solvable challenge, but only if we take the right steps with America’s most innovative companies leading the way."
39,POLITICS,"Citibank, Dirty Once Again","Alan Singer, ContributorSocial studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of c...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/citibank-dirty-once-again_us_59426595e4b0d99b4c921163,"Federal investigators uncovered Citibank’s Mexican affiliate, Banamex USA, laundering drug money and illegally shipping it",2017-06-15,<p> Citigroup acquired Banamex to gain access to millions of Mexican immigrants who send money to their families at home. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594265d2210000140033c526.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Federal investigators uncovered Citibank’s Mexican affiliate, Banamex USA, laundering drug money and illegally shipping it back to Mexico. Officials at Banamex USA, which is based in California, either ignored or did not report suspicious financial transactions, as required by law. Citigroup, the parent company for Citibank and Banamex USA, acquired Banamex in 2001 to gain access to millions of Mexican immigrants in the United States who send money to their families at home.To get the Justice Department not to prosecute the bank on criminal charges, Citigroup agreed to pay $97.4 million in fines. As part of the settlement, Banamex USA “admitted to criminal violations by willfully failing to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering” compliance program. Citigroup was allowed to settle the Mexico case without pleading guilty.According to the New York Times, between 2007 to 2012 Banamex USA internal safeguard procedures produced approximately 18,000 alerts for suspicious transactions. But the bank initiated fewer than ten investigations and filed only six reports with regulators. Banamex USA ignored $1.3 billion in transactions for more than $1,500, much higher than immigrant families typically are able to send to relatives at home. The most blatant case was an account holder in Mexico who received “1,400 remittances from 950 senders in 40 states. Despite several automatic alerts about these transactions, Banamex USA did not file a suspicious activity report with regulators.” Investigators discovered that Banamex USA assigned only two people to review the thousands of suspicious transactions, even when employees raised questions with supervisors about the problematic transactions.In 2015, Citigroup was forced to pay a $140 million fine to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation because of other oversight lapses at Banamex USA. As part of that settlement three former executives at Banamex USA had to pay tens of thousands of dollars in fines and were barred from the banking industry. Citigroup now says it expects to close its Banamex USA operations this year.Citibank has a long history of dirty dealings. Prior to 1978, Citibank was the largest U.S. lender to the apartheid government of South Africa and it continued to provide extensive loans to the South African private sector despite an international boycott. In the 1990s, Citigroup was implicated in another money laundering scandal for Mexican drug cartels and was investigated by Congress. In 2002 Citigroup was involved in one of the biggest corporate scandals in United States history when it was accused of helping Enron disguise debt and agreed to pay $101 million to settle charges relating to the Enron fraud case. During the 2008 financial crisis, a New York Times investigation uncovered evidence that Citigroup recklessly purchased toxic subprime mortgages. In 2012 Citigroup was one of five mortgage companies that agreed to pay a combined $25 billion to resolve allegations of loan and foreclosure abuses.In May 2016 government prosecutors in New York’s Eastern District announced that Citigroup was being investigated over ties to alleged bribery and corruption at FIFA, the international soccer federation. Traffic Group, a conspirator in the bribery charges, made wire payments totaling $11 million from a Citibank account in Miami. In February 2017, Citigroup paid an “administrative penalty” of 69.5 million Rand ($13 million) in South Africa for colluding to fix prices and manipulate financial markets.The 19th century predecessor bank of Citibank had its office at 55 South Street in Manhattan, still the site of a Citibank branch office but now with a new address, 111 Wall Street. The predecessor bank was headed by a banker and sugar trader named Moses Taylor who was deeply involved in financing the illegal 19th century trans-Atlantic slave trade smuggling Africans into Cuba. Taylor became a member of the board of the City Bank in 1837 and served as its president from 1855 until his death in 1882. During this period Taylor used sugar profits to help the bank survive a series of economic downturns and to purchase mines, railroads, and real estate. In the crucial months leading up to the American civil war, Taylor promoted a compromise between the North and South that would leave slavery in place. After the war he served on a commission that whitewashed the corrupt Tweed Ring that controlled New York politics. When Moses Taylor died in 1882, he was one of the wealthiest men of the 19th century with an estate reportedly worth $70 million, or about $1.6 billion in today’s dollars. Taylor clearly is a role model for current Citigroup executives.Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8 "
40,POLITICS,The Most Important Senate Hearing You Didn't Hear Anything About This Week,"Sammie Moshenberg, ContributorSammie Moshenberg is a consultant in Washington, DC.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-important-senate-hearing-you-werent-glued-to_us_594273dce4b0d99b4c921169,It’s always a bad sign when a judicial nominee has to begin his hearing with an apology.,2017-06-15,"<p>Nominee John K. Bush greets his guests prior to the start of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on June 14, 2017.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594275ef2100001b0033c542.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"No bars opened early. Photographers and reporters didn’t crowd the hearing room. And senators showed up in drips and drabs, asked their questions, and snuck out. Regardless, the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on June 14, 2017 was one step toward enshrining the legacy of Donald J. Trump for generations to come—no matter how long his tenure as president lasts.This hearing, covering two circuit court nominees and another to the federal claims court, was not business as usual. Ordinarily, the Judiciary Committee gives circuit court nominees their own hearings, allowing senators several rounds of thorough questioning. This hearing was so rushed that even Senator Tom Tillis (R-NC) got mixed up as to which nominee wrote what. It would be surprising if other senators weren’t confused given that both circuit court nominees were grilled together!Seated together before the nearly empty row of committee chairs were Sixth Circuit nominee John K. Bush — a Louisville attorney who enjoys the enthusiastic support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — and Kevin Newsom, former Solicitor General of Alabama, nominee to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. And what a pair they were.Kevin Newsom appeared thanks to the fact that Alabama senators Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby refused to return their blue slips, signing off on President Obama’s nominee, Judge Abdul Kallon who would have been the first African-American to sit on the 11th Circuit from Alabama.Newsom has argued that Title IX which protects against gender discrimination in education does not protect individuals who claim discrimination from retaliation. And he has questioned the legal doctrine of substantive due process, pivotal to protecting abortion and LGBTQ rights. He fielded some questions but, luckily for him, John Bush—sitting to his right—had an even more troubling record to defend. No doubt if Newsom had had his own hearing, senators would have explored his record and views more thoroughly as is fitting when considering whether to grant life tenure on such an important court.Indeed, John K. Bush attracted most of what questions could be squeezed in during the single round of five-minutes per senator. Bush, one of President Reagan’s attorneys during the Iran-Contra investigation, was essentially wearing two hats—one as a conservative lawyer with all the bona fides one would expect from a Trump nominee and, another, as a blogger on his wife’s blogsite, writing under the pseudonym G. Morris.Bush aka G. Morris’ blogposts were shockingly extreme: referring to “the two greatest tragedies in our country—slavery and abortion;” calling for then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be “gagged;” referring to then-Senator Obama as ‘Senator Moneybags’ and promoting the lie that Obama was born in Kenya. Sen. Franken hammered Bush on his reliance on racist fake-news sources. Bush refused to answer why he used such a widely discredited source. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), one of the more conservative committee members, humphed that he was not “impressed” by his blogs.As Bush repeatedly explained that his blog posts were “political” and would not influence his ability to be a fair and impartial jurist and apologized for his public use of anti-LGBTQ slurs, one couldn’t help wondering about his judicial temperament.His record on his day job is troubling as well: support for excluding women from Virginia Military Institute (a position rejected by the Supreme Court), support for allowing more money in politics, and his opposition to the landmark Supreme Court case, New York Times v. Sullivan, which protects journalists covering public officials.Again, this stacked, rushed hearing saved Bush from what we can only hope would have been more probing questions and scrutiny. Somehow the follow-up written questions just don’t cut it when it comes to shining a light on someone about to make decisions impacting every aspect of our lives for the next 30 years or so.Finally, 38-year-old Damien Schiff from the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF) got his turn. His nomination to the Federal Claims Court, a court with national jurisdiction that hears monetary claims against the federal government, would be for 15 years.It’s always a bad sign when a judicial nominee has to begin his hearing with an apology, especially if it is for insulting a Supreme Court justice. Schiff had called Justice Anthony Kennedy a “judicial prostitute,” a remark that was universally decried and certainly raised the question about his legal temperament. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) observed that if an Obama nominee had insulted Justice Kennedy that way, “the other side’s hair would be on fire!”A staff attorney at the Koch Brothers-funded Pacific Legal Foundation which is devoted to undoing the ‘regulatory state’ established by the New Deal, Schiff shares the PLF’s animosity towards environmentalists, the EPA, OSHA, labor unions, and any campaign finance laws (a partial list). He has gone on record opposing the landmark Lawrence v. Texas case which opened the door to civil rights for LGBTQ Americans and marriage equality. Senator Franken was openly incredulous at Schiff’s piece “Teaching Gayness in Public Schools” which excoriates anti-bullying curricula. Many of Schiff’s views were expressed in blog posts on the PLF’s website.This extraordinary stacked hearing illustrated the impact that Trump will have regardless of how those other blockbuster hearings turn out. Say what you will about his ‘stalled’ policy agenda. This is one very crucial piece of his agenda that is rushing forward at alarming speed to the detriment of the future of our justice system. And there are—as of this writing—146 judicial vacancies for Trump to fill.So maybe it is time to belly up to the bar and turn our TV’s and attention to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearings on the potential judges on whom we will depend to safeguard our rights and provide the judicial check on the Executive Branch that the Constitution envisioned."

From world-famous productions on proscenium stages to longstanding drumming circles in City parks, New York is home to an unparalleled variety of artistic activities that give New Yorkers a sense of belonging amid a dense, impersonal urban enclave; provide space for people to engage in civic action; and celebrate the beauty and ingenuity that exists within all of us. A city like ours doesn’t happen overnight. It is the result of centuries of migrations, policies, protests, and practices of people that value culture, heritage, and expression. Over the next year, we have the opportunity to continue this legacy and sustain New York as a global cultural capital. As the City completes its cultural plan, a blueprint for cultural policy in the years to come, the federal government renews efforts to cut funding for the arts and basic social services. We need a cultural plan that advances artistic practices and cultural institutions that serve New Yorkers who will be the most affected by proposed federal cuts, or we risk losing the diversity that makes New York City a cultural hub. The concept of creative “placemaking” – that arts and culture help develop a place and its community – is not a new idea. At The New York Community Trust, we recently brought some of our donors together to learn about this phenomenon.Since 2010, an organized national creative placemaking field has emerged, shepherded by the team at ArtPlace America. Increased attention to this work has sparked more investments at the nexus of arts and community development. We’ve seen it through philanthropic partnerships like ArtPlace, a funding collaborative that positions culture as a core sector for community planning and development, and newer endeavors like Upstart Co-Lab, which connects artist-innovators doing place-based work with impact investors who want to support it. Policymakers also have taken note. In recent years, more municipalities have enacted cultural policy initiatives aimed at harnessing the power of the arts to increase wellness and social cohesion in their cities.A recent study funded by The Trust identified several neighborhoods for strategic investment, including so-called “civic clusters,” lower-income neighborhoods with a density of cultural assets that exceeds that of other neighborhoods with similar economics (e.g., Bedford-Stuyvesant, Flushing, Hunts Point), and lower-income neighborhoods that have fewer cultural assets than their peers (e.g., Corona, East New York, South Jamaica).Many lower-income neighborhoods house community development corporations (CDCs), which have been creatively supporting their communities since the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation became the nation’s first CDC in 1967. Recently the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation (GJDC) has been working with the City Department of Cultural Affairs’ Building Community Capacity (BCC) initiative (also funded by The Trust) to advance equitable development in Downtown Jamaica that is inclusive of culture, and it is exploring the development of a new artist housing development in the neighborhood. CDCs are well-positioned to help ensure local artists and cultural groups have a say in the future of their neighborhoods. The City has put forward a proposal for its cultural plan (due out in July) to provide baselined funding for the Building Community Capacity initiative in the City’s budget, and therefore remove reliance on a now at-risk federal Community Development Block Grant program for this effort to survive. New York is a dynamic, creative place because of the plurality of cultural resources it houses in every borough. Artists are the problem solvers, truth tellers, community builders, and spiritual guides of our society. Our cultural traditions give us a sense of belonging, help us connect to our neighbors, and allow us to explore human ingenuity. Social, spiritual, economic, and health benefits are associated with culture, and recent research has the data to prove it. The challenge for philanthropy and the City’s cultural plan is to ensure that our arts investments keep New York a creative place for all of us.Michele Kumi Baer is a program associate for The Trust’s grantmaking to promote thriving communities."

Brahmachari is founding director of India’s Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. He was interviewed by Gaëll Mainguy, director of development and international relations for the CRI (conversation has been edited and condensed for publication).Gaëll Mainguy: Professor Brahmachari, can you introduce yourself in a few words?Samir Brahmachari: I have dedicated most of my career to DNA structure and function, and in particular to repetitive sequences – long before the discovery of trinucleotide repeats, a major cause of neurological and neuromuscular diseases. I got hooked to the subject of the potential functions of the so called “junk” portion of the genome when I was a post-doc in Paris in Jacques Monod’s laboratory. The field was virtually blank and not yet competitive – a real bonanza for a young researcher looking to start a scientific career. This uncharted territory was fascinating. In 1997, I moved to Delhi and founded the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, associated with a large number of hospitals and doctors, to annotate and analyse the functions of genome variations. I led the Human Genome Variation project for Asia and mapped the Indian genomic diversity to identify predictive markers for complex diseases and pharmacogenomics studies. That’s when I decided to move to bacteria: as people were discussing the need for modelling an entire human genome, I realised that the complexity of our species and the paucity of data would preclude such an endeavour for a long time to come. The question was: is it possible to build a computational model of 4,000 genes?Right now I’m in Paris as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity because of my work on Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD). What is Open Source Drug Discovery and why did you start the project?S.B.: OSDD is a global platform – one of the first crowdsourcing pharma projects – where the best minds can collaborate and collectively discover novel therapies for neglected diseases. While I was serving as director general of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research and at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), for the Indian government, I designed and led a project on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis (TB). TB is a dreadful disease: it infects a third of the world’s population and claims 1.4 million lives per year. Yet it is neglected; the last TB drug was developed in the 1960s. I felt the obligation to use the TB genome – which was known for ten years without anyone making any effort to turn these data into useful knowledge – to develop new therapies.Why did you decide to go open source? What advantages does it bring?S.B.: The Wright brothers paved the way to modern aeronautics by conceiving and testing prototypes that were more or less able to fly. That was brave and courageous but also slow and perilous. Today, aircraft are entirely conceived and designed on computers, which model them in all their complexity. Why should drug discovery be kept in the Wright brothers’ era of trial and error? It should be possible to upgrade and design drugs in computers. For us, the first challenge was to obtain a comprehensive understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The genome was only 50% annotated, and completing it was a daunting task that required retrieving and reading more than 45,000 articles on the subject. No single team could do this alone – it had to be scaled. With crowdsourcing, the work was completed within one year. We started with 1,200 students, and 400 remained until the end. Involving so many people must be difficult.Yes, you need to share and collaborate at a massive scale. Only open source can deliver the necessary level of confidence and trust. Once all our notes, protocols and findings went open source, we witnessed a profound cultural change. A lot of young students were hungry for science and wanted to contribute. We gave them wings. A second challenge was to create a virtual laboratory for suggesting and screening drug targets. After creating an open source inventory of existing pharma facilities, we then used chemicals to synthesise more than 2,000 molecules (all this for less than US$500,000). The third and biggest challenge was to actually build, in silico [via computer simulation], a system biology model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The “simple” organism still has 50 pathways, 890 genes, 1,152 metabolic reactions involving 961 metabolites. But we made it! We also identified 33 novel targets for multiple drug-resistant TB as well as Metformin, a Type II diabetes drug.What is the future of open-pharma and the OSDD?S.B.: Today, an open source in silico model exists that can be used for any other organism, not just Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

About how my award-winning work on the heroin epidemic and its effect on families has a worldwide readership.I usually bring up statistics. Like how, in 2015, 52,000 Americans overdosed on drugs and died. Within that number, 33,000 died at the hands of opiates. Never in history had drugs killed so many of us in a single year. According to New York Magazine, the drug-induced death toll was so staggering, it helped reduce life expectancy in the United States for the first time since 1993. In 2016, roughly 60,000 people in the United States overdosed on drugs and died. And all the numbers suggest the epidemic has continued to worsen in 2017.I do this to stress the undeniable point that any family could be affected by this epidemic.  You are not unaffected. You are not ABOVE being affected. You are not a better parent than the grieving parents next door. You are not the stronger individual who could “control” their habit. Your town does not have an all-powerful force field keeping this drug out.Parts of society seem to be still treating those grieving the loss of someone due to drugs as second-class grievers. Dismissing the losses as “preventable,” so, not worthy of sympathy.I am here to tell you right now, that grief is grief is grief. Do not be ashamed. Do not hide away.In life, everyone has lost, or will lose, someone they love – maybe not due to drugs, but in some other way.When you lose someone you love, why does it matter how they died? Drugs, freak accident, illness, old age.Death is death is death. Grief is grief is grief.What does matter is a parent just lost their child, a sister just lost a sibling, someone just lost a partner, cousin, best friend, co-worker, or neighbor. They are gone, and you are left behind to clean up messes and pick out coffins. You are left behind to stand on some twisted receiving line as “I’m sorry for your loss” is repeated in your face every two seconds. You are left behind for the rest of your life, forever heartbroken because they mattered. They were a person, and they mattered.They mattered – the circumstances, secondary.My cousin Jessica turned 30 earlier this year. Jess and I were cousins by design, but friends by choice. We were born ten months apart, but now I am 10 years older. This has been weighing heavy on my psyche. Not sure why. Maybe because she is turning 30 but never had the chance to even enter her 20s. She never left her teens.March 3 will never be just a date on my calendar. She will never be just the cousin I “had” for 19 years. People I know, know her because I knew her. People I will meet one day will get to know her because I knew her.I still call her “Jess” because “Jessica” is too formal and engraved on her tombstone and I don’t think I ever called her that once while she was here.That’s the thing I want anyone grieving out there to realize. Though I speak in past tense, she’s still here because I’m still here. You’re loved one is still with you, even though they are no longer physically a part of your life.My life isn’t what it would’ve been if Jess had recovered. Loss altered my DNA. I’ve become what wasn’t intended at the start, but that doesn’t make me broken, just reconfigured. Though heartbroken, you are not broken, I swear.My life was made better because we existed together for that brief time, but I became more compassionate and strong due to her abrupt exit. I will never know who I would’ve been if she had stayed, but I know who I became without her: someone she’d be proud of. Someone who doesn’t judge, but someone who understands that addiction is a disease, not a moral failing. Because of her, I became someone who doesn’t idly stand by but speaks the hell up about things that matter.It may take a village to do most things, but it only takes one person to remember in order to be remembered. I know Jess is remembered by many, and I hope your loved one is, too. Jess is remembered by those she knew personally, by those who share her bloodline who she never met, like her nieces, and by strangers who got to know her through photos and my words and our shared last name.She once existed here with us, so she will continue to exist here with us.Anyone we have ever loved and lost still exists as long as we continue to exist.Look for signs. They are there, I promise you. Jess still finds me. In license plates spelling her initials. On 60 degree days in the dead of winter. In the rattling of blinds and the rustling of papers in a breezeless room. In pictures that float from dusty shelves like autumn leaves when I’m reaching for something else. She still finds me, because I still look for her. Jess will always find me because I will always keep looking.I just want anyone who is grieving right now to know, the most important thing you can do is keep your loved one’s memory alive, because I have learned, if you do, they never feel too far away.Keep saying their names aloud. Keep telling people about them. Keep sharing photos. Because if they mattered to you, they will always matter to you, so they should always matter to the world, too.Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

45,WOMEN,"Nevertheless, Persistence Pays Off","Jennifer Rand, ContributorLawyer, political activist, middle-aged mom of two teens, and ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nevertheless-persistence-pays-off_us_5942cf9fe4b024b7e0df4a23,Part of the problem is that persistence can be a lifelong and often lonely mission.,2017-06-15,<p>Some persistent women who have become role models for many of us to follow despite their detractors.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5942f3b815000038004e6985.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a progressive, feminist mom of a 15-year-old girl, I worry about a lot of things that are probably not on the minds of my more conservative counterparts. Will my daughter be able to fulfill her dreams, regardless of living in a world that endeavors to hold her back? As a woman, will she be taken seriously in whatever career path she may ultimately choose to follow? Will she be valued and respected for her contributions to society, rather than merely viewed as an object? Will she continue to have a modicum of self-worth, self-respect, and self-confidence, or will she fall into the trap of so many promising young girls, and become overwhelmed by the messages of pop culture and the media, encouraging her to doubt herself, her viewpoints, and her values. Will she understand that her body is her own and that she knows best about what is good or bad for it — that it is her choice and her dominion? Will she appreciate that she has a voice, and a brain — that she can figure out her own values and opinions without them being shaped by the men in her life? We know what happens when women assert themselves and reveal themselves to be smart, self-confident, and strong. They are belittled, maligned, disliked, and even despised. It’s much easier as a woman to fall in line: Don’t rock the boat. Don’t speak up. Don’t fight for your rights. A smart, hardworking little girl should have the same opportunities when she grows up as any boy sitting next to her in school. We know, however, that this is not the case. It is the rare little girl that grows up to succeed in the upper echelons of our society — to become a CEO of a major corporation, or a senator or, even rarer still, a president. And it takes more than being smart and hardworking to achieve to these levels of greatness. It takes grit, determination, and yes, gobs and gobs of persistence.The obstacles are many: a strong and successful woman is not “likable,” is often perceived as bossy or shrill (or as Sen. Kamala Harris was just described for doing her job by competently interrogating Attorney General Jeff Sessions — hysterical), does not receive nearly the same amount of money as a man for the same job, and is all too often forced off of her career path in order to do the extremely important business of raising society’s children. The United States has yet to do what so many other countries have been able to do —support women and families through paid family leave, paid sick leave, and affordable childcare. And with all of these roadblocks, how often does success happen? Let’s put it this way: rarely enough that it is remarkable and a shock to our collective system when a smart, hardworking woman actually does achieve. For every persistent woman, such as Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, Nelly Bly, and Sojourner Truth; such as Hillary Clinton, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, U.S. Rep. Shirley Chisholm, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor; and such as Harris, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Sheryl Sandberg, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, there are countless other women with so much potential and so much to offer society but, instead of persisting and speaking up and out for what’s right, they sit down and shut up.Part of the problem is certainly that persistence can be a lifelong and often lonely mission. Many persistent women will not even live long enough to see their labors bear fruit. Much like an artist who achieves fame and praise after death, many of our heroines throughout history had no idea that their diligence and dogged determination would only pay off after many years of toiling in the trenches — the true legacy of persistence. Change does not come easy and white male domination in this country is deeply engrained. It is highly inspirational, however, to consider the stories of women like Anita Hill. Yes, when she bravely came forward to inform the American people that a sexual harasser had been nominated to the highest court in the land, she was dismissed by the (all-male) Senate Judiciary Committee, who proceeded to approve Clarence Thomas’ appointment. Hill apparently lost that battle, as Justice Thomas continues to preside in the Supreme Court decades later. However, I suspect she takes solace (at least I hope she does), that by raising awareness about sexual harassment in the workplace, over time the laws and public viewpoint did change to make it more plausible (and effective) when Gretchen Carlson and others accused their boss at Fox News of similar misconduct. The same can be said about Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a debilitating mass shooting, and went on to be a leader in the fight for common sense gun laws. Yes, she has not won the battle yet, but her persistence has not gone by unnoticed, and is an inspiration for so many other women who are now fighting against the NRA in favor of gun violence prevention.Hillary Clinton’s devastating electoral college loss has been seen by many as a setback of epic proportions for the women’s rights movement. It is only a setback though to the extent that we fail to use the defeat as a catalyst to persist and fight even harder. Clinton has told us as much repeatedly (she says her mantra is resist, insist, persist, enlist) since the day after the election when she conceded to Donald Trump. As she told the nation’s girls, many of whom stood by their pantsuit-wearing mothers as they cast their vote for the first female president, “never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world.”I hope those girls were listening and, as more and more women run for public office, perhaps one of them will grow up to be our first female president. Indeed, Clinton may not live to see her efforts to elect the first female president pay off, but she can feel confident that her persistence has paved the way for future women to see that such a lofty goal, while audacious, is possible and worthy of effort.When it comes to my own 15-year-old daughter, there is no crystal ball to see where she will end up in life and whether I can successfully instill in her my feminist and progressive values. Indeed, she is at the stage of most teenagers, where if mom thinks it or says it or does it, “it” is inherently suspect and even an embarrassment. Will my daughter ultimately be a persister or will she, like most women, quietly take her place in our culture? Who knows, but a small glimmer of hope emerged yesterday. I stay out of the way by and large when it comes to school. Nevertheless, my daughter has set a goal of getting into and attending a prestigious college 3000 miles from home. What’s more, this goal has made my daughter much more focused on academic success, which she now realizes is essential if she wants to be accepted to the college of her choice. Yesterday, my daughter confided in me she had not done well on one test this semester and it had brought her grade in Spanish down to a “B”—her only B this year. She said she was upset about it, but then told me she had asked her teacher if she could retake the test. The teacher told her she could not. As I was thinking to myself, “well, then, I guess that’s that,” my daughter added, “But I wrote her an email and explained why she should make an exception.” A few hours later, my daughter came in to tell me—excitedly, and with some surprise in her voice—“The teacher said I can retake the test tomorrow!” My daughter retook the test, and it brought her grade up to an “A.” Had she taken that first “no” for an answer, that wouldn’t have happened. Had she not taken that additional step, and advocated for herself in a persuasive manner, that wouldn’t have happened. I told my daughter that I was proud of her—not so much for the “A” but for her willingness to speak up for herself. I am hoping that she will take that ability to self-advocate and continue to use it in life, even if it’s a more public setting, and even if it places herself toe-to-toe with a difficult male colleague.Yes, there’s no crystal ball for knowing whether persistence ultimately will pay off, when it comes to parenting or politics or, for that matter, life—but it sure beats the alternative, and history bears this out."

You put in an opponent’s name and you will see all the sites, blogs, social networks related to that user.”A second employee who worked closely with Ben Ali said: “Sometimes they would ask me to get information about specific people...some information used to go directly to the president. Most of this was about his opponents.”The system can collate and analyse millions of people’s electronic communications. Human rights campaigners have warned for years that the technology is being used to track down and imprison dissenting citizens of authoritarian regimes.A former ETI employee who developed Evident described its vast surveillance capabilities:“You’d be able to intercept any internet traffic,” he said. “If you wanted to do a whole country, you could. You could pinpoint people’s location based on cellular data. You could follow people around. They were quite far ahead with voice recognition. They were capable of decrypting stuff as well.”Activists in Saudi Arabia told the BBC of the intense repression made possible by such advanced spying technology.“I wouldn’t be exaggerating if I said more than 90% of the most active campaigners in 2011 have now vanished,” said Saudi former air force officer Yahya Assiri, who was forced to flee the country after airing pro-democracy views online.“It used to be that ‘the walls have ears’, but now it’s ‘smartphones have ears,’” said Manal al-Sharif, a Saudi women’s rights activist who now also lives abroad.“No country monitors its own people the way they do in the Gulf countries,” she said. “They have the money, so they can buy advanced surveillance software.”The sales were legal but made despite the British government’s long time acknowledgement of the deadly repression meted out by the Middle Eastern governments, and its pledge of support for the Arab Spring.In 2011, the year BAE purchased the spying system, then Prime Minister David Cameron declared the government had made the wrong choice in ‘backing authoritarian regimes in the Gulf states’, and said British interests instead “lie in upholding our values – in insisting on the right to peaceful protest, in freedom of speech and the internet, in freedom of assembly and the rule of law.”BAE defended its sales of mass surveillance technology, stating: “We have robust policies and procedures in place to ensure our international exports to overseas governments are all fully compliant with international export regulations as well as our own strict criteria to evaluate every potential contract.”The BBC said it had asked the Middle Eastern states to comment but received no response."

Posh Hotel is the only venue with a discotheque in the capital.“The fighters are still inside Pizza House and they hold inside over 20 people. We do not know how many of those are dead or alive,” Ibrahim Hussein, a police major, told Reuters.Earlier on Wednesday, police said nine people, mostly women who were hotel staff, had died in the attack.Security officials said the suicide attacker had rammed the explosive-laden car into the hotel’s entrance before gunmen stormed the restaurant.“A suspected car bomb is also parked in front of Pizza House. This and snipers have made it difficult for the security forces to head inside,’ said Hussein.Other officials said victims inside the hotel had been safely evacuated but that there were likely to be more than nine casualties.Al Shabaab claimed responsibility. The group has carried out a campaign of suicide bombings in its bid to topple the Somali government and impose its strict interpretation of Islam.“A mujahid (fighter) with his suicide car bomb martyred himself after he rammed into the Posh Hotel, which is a nightclub. The operation goes on,” Abdiasis Abu Musab, the group’s military spokesman, told Reuters.Since losing large swathes of territory to African Union peacekeepers supporting the government, the group has frequently launched raids and deadly attacks in Mogadishu and other regions controlled by the federal government.The Horn of Africa country has been racked by armed conflict since 1991, when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other.(Writing by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Toni Reinhold)"

As a result, they were reportedly among the first to react to what would become a deadly, devastating blaze ― pounding on doors to wake up sleeping neighbors, moving quickly to collect relief supplies, and throwing open the doors of mosques to offer victims shelter. One local resident told HuffPost UK, “Muslim boys saved people’s lives. They ran around knocking on people’s doors. Thank God for Ramadan.”Another resident was filmed by HuffPost UK saying, “If it wasn’t for all these young Muslim boys around here helping us, coming from mosques, people would’ve [been] dead ... more people would’ve [been] dead.”“They were the first people with bags of water giving to people, helping people. They were running and telling people,” she said. At least 12 people died and dozens more were injured in the fire at Grenfell Tower, which broke out about 1 a.m. London time. Local police anticipate that there may be more people in the building who are unaccounted for.During Ramadan, many Muslims wake up to eat Suhur before the Fajr prayer, which in London falls around 2:39 a.m. After this pre-dawn meal, many won’t eat again until iftar, an evening meal eaten after the sun sets. Khalid Suleman Ahmed told HuffPost UK that if it weren’t for Ramadan, he wouldn’t have normally been awake at the time the fire started. When he started smelling the fire, he looked out his window and saw smoke drifting from the floor below him. He claimed that he didn’t hear a fire alarm go off in the building. (Other residents have also claimed the same). “I woke my auntie up, then got clothes on and started knocking on neighbours’ doors. Every house opened except two,” Ahmed told HuffPost UK. “I would be up this late on a Friday night possibly but never a random midweek night unless it was Ramadan. There are a lot of Muslims living there and people choose up to stay up and wait so it was certainly a factor for me and others. It probably did save lives.”Another resident of the area who lives near Grenfell Tower told Sky News, “If it wasn’t for Ramadan, there would have been more casualties,” since more people would have been asleep when the blaze broke out.Muslims from other areas of London also showed up early in the morning to assist with relief work, according to Channel 4 journalist Assed Baig. Zia Salik, head of fundraising at the humanitarian organization Islamic Relief, told The Independent that he lived near Grenfell Tower and could see the fire from his window as it started early Wednesday morning. Islamic Relief began coordinating its response soon after. It has set aside £10,000 from its emergency fund to help survivors. The organization is also sending over 6,000 water bottles to the area. “When something like this happens sometimes you do feel a bit helpless but at the same time we know that some people have lost everything. They’ve lost their homes, they’ve lost their belongings, they’re going to be without shelter for the night,” Salik told The Independent.Islamic centers and mosques in the area also responded on Wednesday by opening up their worship spaces for survivors looking for shelter. Al Manaar, a Muslim cultural heritage center located near Grenfell Tower, has been coordinating distribution of relief supplies to survivors ― things like food, toiletries, blankets, and water. The center also announced on Facebook that “anyone of any faith or no faith is most welcome to walk in to have some rest, sleep, and or have some water and food.”The center is also offering an evening iftar dinner to anyone who needs it. In a Facebook post, Masjid Annoor, an Islamic center a few miles away from the blaze, said that its doors are open and “will remain open for anyone that has been affected ... Everyone is welcome. Irrespective of religion or background.”Other faith groups ― including local Christian churches and Sikh gurdwaras ― also opened their doors, offering survivors temporary shelter. "

Nathan led his dogs around the trails as Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) fielded ground balls at third base. Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) was playing shortstop. It was barely 7 a.m., but it was starting to get hot, and both lawmakers had already finished their turns at bat. DeSantis suggested to Duncan that they cut out of practice early to beat the traffic into Washington. The two men and a few staffers piled into the Chevy Suburban they’d arrived in, and were about to pull off when a man approached the car. DeSantis rolled down his window.“Are those Republicans or Democrats?” the man asked, pointing toward the field where other lawmakers continued practicing. DeSantis thought little of the encounter as they left.Moments later, a man rounded the third-base dugout, walked toward the field and opened fire. “We weren’t exactly sure what it was,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). He saw a swirl of dust, and realized the man “was firing indiscriminately.”Over at the dog park, Nathan heard bullets ring off a chain-link fence and bounce in the dirt. He dove to the ground. Lying there in the gravel, he pulled out his phone, pointed it in the direction of the shooter and started filming.“I was thinking, okay, do I want to call my girlfriend or try to get this video?” Nathan told HuffPost. “I don’t want to freak her out.”The gunman first took aim at Rep. Trent Kelly (R-Miss.), who was at third base. Then he turned to Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the House GOP’s majority whip, and fired a bullet through his left hip. Scalise dropped to the ground and crawled toward first base, away from the shooter. Across the street, Laura Russell had just walked outside after hearing shots, she told MSNBC. When she opened the door and looked toward the field, she saw a young man fall to the ground at home plate. She dialed 911. It was 7:09 a.m.David Woodruff, 46, was on a morning run when he heard the shots. He looked toward the fields, where his son had played a Little League game the evening before. Then he ducked inside a parking garage and dialed 911, too. As the shots continued, lawmakers and their staffers dove into the first-base dugout for cover. Flake grabbed Rep. Joe Barton’s 10-year-old son and hid him beneath the bench. Barton’s son, who was shadowing his dad at the Capitol this week, clung to his father’s leg. Capitol Police Special Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner, who were part of Scalise’s security detail, scrambled to stop the shooter. They fired toward the gunman from behind the first-base dugout, confusing the lawmakers who had huddled inside. “Are you friendly, are you friendly?” Flake yelled, unsure if there was a second shooter behind them. One of the officers turned the corner to assure the senator that he was. The shooter was “mobile” and “crafty,” said Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio). He fired continuously with a rifle, pausing only to reload. Some lawmakers said they thought they saw an automatic pistol, too.Scalise lay on the field as gunfire continued around him. One bullet hit Zachary Barth, an aide to Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas). Barth eventually scrambled to the first-base dugout. Matt Mika, a 38-year-old former congressional aide who now works as the director of government relations for Tyson Foods, was shot multiple times.In the dugout, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) removed his belt and used it as a tourniquet to stop one of the staffers’ bleeding. Outside the field, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) hid behind a tree with another staffer as bullets hit the ground around them.Three minutes after receiving the 911 call, Alexandria police officers arrived at the scene, a department spokesperson said. Along with Capitol Police officers, they pursued the shooter across the ball field. Both Capitol Police officers were hit — in the foot, Flake thought — but continued to chase the gunman anyway.By 7:15 a.m., the officers had wounded the gunman and taken him into custody. Bullets were lodged in trees near the field; at least one shattered a window in a nearby building, according to witnesses. On the streets around the field, a Ford Explorer had a bullet hole in the passenger-side window; other cars showed similar damage. There were bullet holes in electrical transformers, too. After the shooting, Scalise and the others who were injured ― including Mika and Barth ― were taken to hospitals. Scalise underwent surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center for a rifle wound to the hip that “travelled across his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal organs and causing severe bleeding,” the medical center said in a statement. He was in critical condition late Wednesday. Mika was undergoing surgery and was in critical condition, his family said. Barth posted that he had been shot, but was “in the hospital and okay.” Both officers were wounded, but were in good condition, Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa said. Two people were taken to the George Washington University Hospital in critical condition, and one later died, according to spokeswoman Karoline Hutson. Back on Capitol Hill, Duncan and DeSantis heard the news — and wondered about their strange encounter earlier. Democratic lawmakers who had been practicing for the congressional game on a different field halted their practice, gathered in a circle and began to pray. At Watkins Elementary School in Washington, reporters practiced for a different annual event: the Congressional Women’s Softball Game, which pits journalists against members of Congress for charity. Most of them bolted for Alexandria. Scalise’s D.C. roommates — Reps. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), Kevin Brady (R-Texas) and Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.) — gathered around 11 a.m. at George Washington University Hospital, which is where original reports had indicated Scalise had been taken.The trio, who have played in the Congressional Baseball Game with Scalise for years, lingered morosely with their coats in their hands, waiting for a car to take them across town to MedStar, where their roommate was undergoing surgery. Brady had left practice early. Shimkus, a relief pitcher for the team, had skipped it.As they waited for updates, they noted what a shame it was for violence to erupt around one of the hallmarks of congressional bipartisanship — and fun.“You know if it’s Steve’s decision, the game will go on,” Brady told HuffPost. “He’ll insist on it. He’s tough.”The trio also was concerned for Mika, who was being treated at GWU Hospital for multiple gunshot wounds. Brady noted how valuable Mika had been for the GOP team over the years, saying he often coached from second base and shortstop.Shortly after, the trio piled into a black SUV and headed off to see their roommate.By 11 a.m., law enforcement officials had identified the shooter as James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old man from Illinois. Hodgkinson died from his injuries at a hospital, President Donald Trump announced in a news conference later in the morning. It was too early to determine whether the FBI would consider the attack an act of terror, Tim Slater, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, told reporters. Hodgkinson was a Bernie Sanders supporter and Trump critic with a history of violence. But it’s “too early” to declare a motive, Slater said.In Congress, members called for unity. They hailed the efforts of Bailey and Griner, the Capitol Police officers who engaged the shooter. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) called the shooting “an attack on all of us.”House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) rose to address the chamber. “To my colleagues, you’re going to hear me say something you’ve never heard me say before: I identify myself with the remarks of the speaker,” Pelosi said. “Tomorrow we’ll go out on the field, we’ll root for our team, we’ll want everyone to do his or her very best, and we’ll use this occasion as one that brings us together and not separates us further.” When she was done speaking, every member present — Democrat and Republican — stood to applaud. Ryan gaveled out the House and canceled all votes for the rest of the day. In Alexandria, law enforcement officials cordoned off the baseball field and interviewed witnesses. They took Nathan’s phone. He hoped his shaky iPhone video would help police make sense of what had just unfolded. “I was like, well, if I’m going to sit here and get shot at, at least let me do something,” Nathan said.The annual Congressional Baseball Game is Thursday at 7:30 p.m. Jennifer Bendery and Elise Foley reported from Alexandria; Travis Waldron and Lauren Weber reported from Washington.This article has been updated with details on Scalise’s injuries.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said that Rep. Duncan Hunter of California was playing shortstop. It was Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina."

He’s tough.”The trio also was concerned for Mika, who was being treated at GWU Hospital for multiple gunshot wounds. Brady noted how valuable Mika had been for the GOP team over the years, saying he often coached from second base and shortstop.Shortly after, the trio piled into a black SUV and headed off to see their roommate.By 11 a.m., law enforcement officials had identified the shooter as James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old man from Illinois. Hodgkinson died from his injuries at a hospital, President Donald Trump announced in a news conference later in the morning. It was too early to determine whether the FBI would consider the attack an act of terror, Tim Slater, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, told reporters. Hodgkinson was a Bernie Sanders supporter and Trump critic with a history of violence. But it’s “too early” to declare a motive, Slater said.In Congress, members called for unity. They hailed the efforts of Bailey and Griner, the Capitol Police officers who engaged the shooter. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) called the shooting “an attack on all of us.”House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) rose to address the chamber. “To my colleagues, you’re going to hear me say something you’ve never heard me say before: I identify myself with the remarks of the speaker,” Pelosi said. “Tomorrow we’ll go out on the field, we’ll root for our team, we’ll want everyone to do his or her very best, and we’ll use this occasion as one that brings us together and not separates us further.” When she was done speaking, every member present — Democrat and Republican — stood to applaud. Ryan gaveled out the House and canceled all votes for the rest of the day. In Alexandria, law enforcement officials cordoned off the baseball field and interviewed witnesses. They took Nathan’s phone. He hoped his shaky iPhone video would help police make sense of what had just unfolded. “I was like, well, if I’m going to sit here and get shot at, at least let me do something,” Nathan said.The annual Congressional Baseball Game is Thursday at 7:30 p.m. Jennifer Bendery and Elise Foley reported from Alexandria; Travis Waldron and Lauren Weber reported from Washington.This article has been updated with details on Scalise’s injuries.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said that Rep. Duncan Hunter of California was playing shortstop. It was Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina."

(”I know, right?” the actress responded.)So when the subject of Poussey’s Season 4 death came up, Brooks expressed well-wishes for her friend, who wasn’t onstage but has since gone on to appear in Hulu’s smash-hit “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Brooks shared one other hope for Wiley, too ― that her character’s shocking and emotional death by a poorly trained prison guard could help viewers understand what it’s like to see a friend or family member die a similarly unjustified death at the hands of police.“This is one of those things I just pray so hard about,” the actress said. “We show so much love to a fictional character like Poussey, and I just want us to take a second and really care the same about people that are really losing people like that in this world.”The actress spoke about the parallels between Litchfield and real life, which witnessed a spate of black Americans’ controversial deaths by police officers in 2016, inspiring continued activism around the Black Lives Matter movement around the time “Orange Is the New Black” crew were filming Season 5.“It made the stakes that much greater,” Brooks said. “You feel responsibility to the people that have really gone through those things.”In the aftermath of the Season 4 finale, Wiley explained how her character’s death was meant to provoke a strong response from fans who were charmed by her optimism and seemingly bright future. “What I’ve been reading online from people is just this profound sadness, something that they can’t shake away,” Wiley told The Hollywood Reporter last June. “And that is exactly what Jenji is wanting people to feel, she wants people to not be able to shake this off.”In Season 5, Poussey’s death leads to an all-out riot as prisoners rebel against brutalist tactics by guards.The whole season is now streaming on Netflix."

From a shooting near UPS center in San Francisco to a shooting near our nation’s Capitol – where it appears our nation’s leaders were targeted. Details are still unfolding, but so far we know that during a congressional baseball practice at least one member of Congress was shot, alongside congressional staffers and police officers. Other members of Congress and their family members were present. The humanity of the response to this shooting has been overwhelming: lawmakers crying on television while giving thanks to the police who responded so quickly and saved so many lives, an image of the Democrats’ baseball team gathering to pray for their colleagues.But what impacted me so viscerally was a photo of Representative Joe Barton and his sons boarding a train in Alexandria after the shooting. According to witnesses, Rep. Barton’s 10-year-old son hid under a bench in the dugout as shots were fired.As a mother, I recognized the fear and concern Rep. Barton had for his son and how as parents, we hold our children’s safety paramount to anything else on earth.The trauma of this shooting has played out in far too many American communities every single day. Ninety-three Americans are shot and killed daily, and hundreds more are injured by gunfire. Too many Americans have experienced what it’s like to be shot or have a loved one killed by gun violence.There will be all kinds of speculation today. Pundits will point fingers and place blame. And we’ll all hug our loved ones a little tighter.The bottom line is this: Americans should be able to practice baseball, dance in a nightclub, and attend religious services without the threat of gun violence. No other developed nation suffers from the same rates of gun violence. In fact, America’s gun homicide rate is more than 25 times the average other peer nations. We deserve better. We must come together to make it better. So much of the gun violence in America is not only senseless, but preventable. There are solutions. Rep. Rodney Davis said after the shooting, “I never thought I’d play a baseball game for charity, go to practice… and have to dodge bullets.”This is sadly the current reality in America. The only way to change that reality is to face it together.Shannon Watts is the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America."

That evening, a small group of black men and women had gathered at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Church for bible study—unaware of the sinister motives of the new visitor in their midst. After an hour of discussion and prayer, then 21-year-old Dylann Roof stood up and calmly announced, “I’m here to kill black people,” before opening fire on the unsuspecting group of parishioners.Within minutes, Roof took the lives of nine black men and women: Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Cynthia Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lance, Depayne Middleton-Doctor, Rev. Clementa Pinckney, Tywanza Sanders, Daniel Simmons, and Myra Thompson. He forever shattered the lives of countless more. The massacre would go down in history as one of the most horrific acts of racial violence in recent memory.Immediately after the shooting in June 2015, I collaborated with fellow historians Chad Williams and Kidada Williams to launch the #CharlestonSyllabus, a Twitter movement and crowdsourced list of reading recommendations on the history of racial violence in the United States. With the public reading list we created and the subsequent book, we hoped to do more than simply provide an opening for yet another national conversation on race. Instead, we wanted to offer valuable resources that would provide the necessary historical context for understanding the massacre—a context that was clearly missing from public discourse surrounding the shooting.The Charleston massacre opened the eyes of many Americans to the persistence of racial violence in this country and many vowed to work toward its end. Yet, as we approach the two-year anniversary of the Charleston massacre, racial violence continues to plague our society. In the two years since the massacre, we have witnessed an unprecedented rise in racist acts of violence across the country.The Long History of Racial ViolenceThe Charleston massacre, though tragic, was not the first act of racist violence in the United States. Black men and women in this country have been subjected to this kind of violence and terror for centuries. Significantly, the church where the massacre took place has strong ties to slavery in the United States—it was the site of Denmark Vesey’s planned revolt against slavery almost two hundred years ago. In 1822, a group of white men burned down the predecessor of the Emanuel AME Church, located only a few blocks away from the current-day location in Charleston.These acts of racist violence that took place in black communities during the nineteenth century extended well into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Because of the central role they play in black communities—as sanctuaries for education and political organizing, for example—places of worship are often the first to be targeted by white supremacists.Perhaps the most well-known act of racial violence took place in 1963 at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, a central meeting place for civil rights leaders who were attempting to register local black residents to vote. During a service on Sunday, September 15, 1963, white supremacists planted a bomb at the Birmingham church, killing four black girls—Denise McNair, Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley—and injuring twenty-three others.Many evoked the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing during the wave of burnings at Southern black churches in the 1990s. Similarly, many evoked the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in the wake of Charleston.The links between the 1822 white supremacist attack on the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the 1963 Birmingham Church bombing, and the 2015 Charleston shooting underscore a continuum of racist violence in the United States. Violence, terror, and hate remain deeply ingrained in US culture and society. Racial violence is not solely a thing of our past but also of our present.A Persistent ProblemTwo years after the Charleston massacre, acts of racial violence remain rampant in American society. In the days following the election of Donald Trump, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported receiving more than 200 complaints of hate crimes.Within the last few months alone several incidents have captured news headlines, bringing the issues of racism and racial violence to the fore. In March 2017, a white supremacist from Baltimore stabbed Timothy Caughman, a 66-year-old black man, to death on a public street corner in New York City. The murderer had traveled to New York City from Baltimore with the explicit intention of killing black men. More recently, a white supremacist was arrested for the stabbing death of Richard Collins III, a black Bowie State student who was recently commissioned U.S. Army second lieutenant.Equally troubling are the recent appearance of nooses at the African American History Museum, American University, and other public sites in the nation’s capital—another attempt to terrorize black men and women by evoking the sordid history of lynching in the United States.What all of these events reveal is that we are still living in the shadow of Charleston.The anniversary of the massacre invites us to reflect on this tragic incident in our nation’s history—but it should not end there. The anniversary of the massacre provides a unique opportunity for us to confront both the unsettling history and current reality of racism and racial violence in the United States. Honoring the memory of those who died at the Emanuel AME Church requires acknowledging the unbreakable ties between past and present, the persistence of racial violence, and the stagnancy of race relations in the United States."

Here is the transcript of this brief exchange:McCain: “During the 2016 campaign season did you have any contacts with any representative including any American lobbyists or agent of any Russian company within or outside your capacity as a member of Congress or member of the armed services committee?”Sessions: “I don’t believe so.”However, according to an October 7, 2016 report by Politico, Sessions met at least twice with Richard Burt during the summer of 2016. Burt, a former Reagan administration official, was a lobbyist for Gazprom, a Russian government-owned natural gas company tied to the Kremlin. According to Politico, in the first two quarters of 2016 (January 1 through June 30, 2016), Burt was paid $365,000 to lobby for a new Russian pipeline to span from Russia across the Baltic Sea to Germany, which could potentially make Europe more dependent on Russian gas. The lobbying work was registered under Burt’s firm, McLarty Inbound LLC, which is documented by a congressional Lobbying Registration dated February 24, 2016. An amended report was also filed on January 14, 2017 for the third quarter of 2016 (July 1-September 30), which showed earnings of $140,000. According to Daily Beast source Sergi Kostiayev, a Russian political scientist researching international lobbyists, “Gazprom’s New European Pipeline AG paid Burt’s company $690,000 for their 2016-2017 contract, that just ran out this month [March 2017].”According to Politico’s sources, including Burt himself, Burt was invited by Sessions to two dinners to discuss foreign policy and national security issues in the summer of 2016, and he also wrote two white papers for Session on these subjects. Reuters has also reported that Trump’s first foreign policy speech (April 27, 2016), which stressed “easing of tensions” between Russia and the U.S., and “upgrading NATO’s outdated mission and structure,” received input from Burt. Based on the aforementioned lobbying reports, Burt’s meetings with Sessions as well as his help with Trump’s speech appear to have occurred at the time he was on the Russian payroll.Therefore, based on Politico’s sources, including Burt himself, as reported by Politico, and congressional lobbying reports managed by the U.S. Senate Office of Public Records, it appears that Sessions’ denial, made under oath, of his having met with “any American lobbyists or agent of any Russian company within or outside his capacity as a member of Congress or member of the Armed Services Committee” was false."

So after that, I was ready to move on and so I went for ‘Drag Race.’”But as many queens know, getting on the Race isn’t as easy as one may think.“I actually auditioned for season one and didn’t get it... then I auditioned for another season and some queen ruined that for me and I didn’t get on.”As for who the mystery queen is, you might remember her from the very first season of RuPaul’s show. and as for what that certain queen did, Naysha’s keeping that sip of tea to herself.READ MORE: Nina Bo’Nina Brown On Her Struggle With Loving Herself “I don’t really want to talk about the queen...

66,QUEER VOICES,Sparkle Boy: Writing About Boys In Skirts,"Lori Duron, Guest WriterGuest Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/writing-about-boys-in-skirts-lori-duron-interviews_us_59417252e4b04c03fa261774,"Lori Duron interviews Lesléa Newman about her book featuring a little boy who loves things that sparkle, shimmer and glitter.",2017-06-14,<p>Lesléa Newman with her new book <em>Sparkle Boy</em></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594172fa1d00001700cc2f6d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of my favorite authors has a new book out about one of my favorite topics. Lesléa Newman’s Sparkle Boy is about a little boy who loves things that sparkle, shimmer and glitter. He’s a lot like my son C.J. I interviewed Lesléa about her new book and her work over the last 35 years as an award-winning, trailblazing author and advocate for the LGBTQ community.Lori Duron: I discovered your work when my brother gave my sons your book The Boy Who Cried Fabulous. As a fabulous, gay uncle, he wanted his nephews to see characters like him in literature. Little did we know that the book would resonate so much with my youngest son, C.J., who is fabulous and gender creative. After I started my blog, I reached out to you to say how much that book meant to us and our son. And I wrote a blog post about it.Lesléa Newman: I so appreciated hearing from you! The Boy Who Cried Fabulous resonates with lots of people, including teachers and librarians who love the fact that it contains so many adjectives, which is something I never thought of.Duron: Shortly thereafter we discovered A Fire Engine for Ruthie, about a little girl who likes motorcycles and fire engines. I feel like that book doesn’t get enough attention. I mean, it came out 13 years ago and the protagonist is clearly more than a tomboy ― she’s gender creative. Once again you were ahead of your time. What was the reaction to that book when it was first published?Newman: As far as A Fire Engine for Ruthie goes, I wrote that book as a direct response to Charlotte Zolotow’s classic, William’s Doll. The book did well when it first came out, but unfortunately it never went into paperback and is now out of print. (Any takers out there?) Tomboys of all ages really liked that book.Duron: And, now, all these years later, you give us Sparkle Boy (out June 15). Thank you for writing this book, it’s so important that gender creative boys like my son see themselves in literature. What inspired you to write Sparkle Boy?Newman: I was inspired in part by your book, Raising My Rainbow, which I was moved to tears by many, many times. I also learned a lot, especially about the different journeys each family member takes, in addition to the journey taken by the person in the family who is gender creative. Jessie, the older sister of Casey, who is the “sparkle boy” in my book, starts off in one place emotionally at the start of the story, and ends somewhere else. I think this is very important, and shows that everyone goes through a process when someone in the family discovers something about themselves.I was also inspired by attending Family Week (in Provincetown, MA) which is run by the Family Equality Council. I saw so many little boys wearing tutus happily running around, filled with joy at being able to be themselves. One boy’s dad said to me, “I wish my son could wear his tutu every day, not just in Provincetown during Family Week.” And I remembered what you said in your book—that your job as a parent is to make the world a safe place for your son to be himself. That is my intent with Sparkle Boy: to put forth a book that respects, accepts and celebrates everyone’s right to shine!Duron: You started writing books that deal with LGBTQ issues and identities in the 1980s, long before there were LGBTQ shelves in popular bookstores and online booksellers. What was it like writing about LGBTQ issues and advocating through written word back then?Newman: You know, I really didn’t think about it. When I came out, in 1982, my writing just exploded. Previous to that time, I only wrote poetry and considered myself exclusively a poet (I had studied with Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado). But in the early 80s, much to my surprise, I wrote a novel called Good Enough to Eat, I was hungry (pun intended!) for books that featured a character like me (a Jewish lesbian) and couldn’t find any, so that’s why I wrote it.I write to explore the world inside me, the world outside of me and the relationship between the two. I followed up that novel with a short story collection called A Letter to Harvey Milk. Each of the nine stories featured a different Jewish lesbian. And I was still writing poetry. I didn’t write these books to make any kind of political statement, though I do think writing as an out lesbian about lesbian characters is a political act. I was just writing stories about my life and the lives of the people in my community. I took the advice of Grace Paley, with whom I also studied, who said, “Write what you know you don’t know about what you know.” And then a lesbian who knew I was a writer stopped me on the street and said, “There are no books that show a family like mine. Someone should write one.” And, thus, Heather Has Two Mommies was born.Duron: Heather Has Two Mommies was a pioneering book. It was the first children’s book to portray a family of two lesbian moms and their child in a positive way. What was the reaction to the book when it was first published?Newman: I had a lot of trouble getting the book published. No publisher would touch it. Finally, my good friend Tzivia Gover and I decided to put the book out ourselves under the auspices of In Other Words, which was her desk top publishing business at the time. We sent out fundraising letters (before the internet! licking envelopes and stamps!) and raised about $4,000 ― mostly in $10 donations. Then we found an illustrator through the lesbian gravevine and printed 4,000 copies. I never thought anyone except lesbian moms would be interested in the book, so I was surprised at the huge reaction it received.Lesbian mothers were thrilled with the book. I heard about kids who got three copies for the holidays, who went to bed with the book tucked under their pillow every night. And I heard from people who were less-than-thrilled with the book and stole it from the library and refused to return it, or returned it with its pages glued shut. Part of the book was read into the Congressional Record by Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire in an attempt to convince other representatives to vote on a bill that would cut federal aid to schools that in his words, “carry out a program or activity that has either the purpose or effect of encouraging or supporting homosexuality as a positive lifestyle alternative.”Duron: You’ve written more than 70 books and your works are pretty evenly divided in terms of intended audience. About half are for an adult audience and half are for children. What are the pros and cons of writing for each audience?Newman: To me, it’s really all writing. What I try to do is let the content dictate the audience (children, middle-graders, teens, adults) and the form (poetry, prose, fiction, non-fiction). As long as I’m writing, I’m happy. The advantage to writing a picture book, is that usually—though not always—it takes less time to write than a chapter book or novel. The advantage to writing a novel is that I always know what I am going to be working on when I return to my writing notebook the next day (as opposed to starting from scratch every time I finish something short such as a poem or a picture book).What I love about writing for children is that a book such as Heather Has Two Mommies can really make a difference in a child’s life. So many families have told me how important that book was to them because it was the first time their children saw a family just like their own between the covers of a book. That is extremely important and validating to a child. What I love about writing for adults is that often I hear from readers who tell me how my work has touched their lives. I never get tired of hearing that. That’s what it’s all about.Duron: I think it’s important for people to know that you’re an amazing voice for the LGBTQ community through written word and the speaking that you do, but you’re also such an encouraging and nurturing mentor. You help emerging authors and advocates; that’s something not a lot of established authors do. They don’t always want to help other people.Newman: I don’t really understand that. I firmly believe that when one of us succeeds, all of us succeeds. So many people have been kind to me along the way: my mentors, Allen Ginsberg and Grace Paley; the women in my writers group; and so many others, too numerous to mention.The literary life is not an easy one. Authors need to stick by each other and support each other. I am always thrilled when emerging writers I have mentored succeed (shout out to Newbery medalist Kwame Alexander author of The Crossover, and Leah Henderson whose first middle grade novel, One Shadow on the Wall has just been published). Allen and Grace kept in touch with me for years (again, before the internet), always showing an interest in my work and taking me seriously as a writer. That was so important to me. I honor my mentors by paying it forward."

All photos mine.</em> </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59419946160000280011635a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I remember the box that the nurse from Medicaid checked when she came to evaluate Lucia – it read something like “qualifies for institutionalized level of nursing/medical care.” She’d been so empathic and caring, so visibly at ease seeing and talking about a child that was on a feeding tube and yet puked the contents of her stomach uncontrollably while we talked in my dining room. But when she left my heart skipped a beat – did she check that box because she thought Lucia belonged in an institution? I thought she’d been there to process Lucia’s Medicaid. Sure no one was going to take our child away?When we spoke over the phone a few days later she explained that she had to check that box for Lucia to qualify for the highest level of nursing care. She explained to me that while many years ago kids like Lucia couldn’t be cared for in their homes, today modern technology, skilled in-home nursing care, and the Managed Long Term Special Services (MLTSS) Medicaid program in New Jersey were trying to do just that – support families with children with special needs to allow them to care for their children at home.Looking back, I don’t remember being particularly fazed by the severity of Lucia’s medical needs. Growing up with my own health problems, a twin sister with asthma and respiratory problems, and a mother with multiple sclerosis (who is also a nurse), I think I learned that while health challenges were part of life they didn’t prevent a person from being a person. We had good medical care and my parents were able to provide what we needed to thrive. Therefore, for my husband and I, when it came to Lucia, so much of that first year and a half was just wading through the newness of parenthood alongside the advent of seizures, abnormal MRIs, and feeding tubes without much distinction. We were coping and surviving with rare moments that glare through the blur with clarity and poignancy – the long nights of shrieking as we weaned our poor baby off of narcotics; the morning she woke up with her head and her eyes glued permanently to the left and because she had special needs the ER doctors rather dismissively sent us home saying she probably had a cold; or the night a month later when I nursed her for the very last time in the glimmer of hospital monitors because that onset of brain damage (what had really sent us to the ER) had caused her to lose the ability to feed by mouth.Yet those moments, as ingrained as they are in my memory, did not so much smack of worry and fear as heartache and pain. You see, by God’s grace my husband and I are not much of worriers. We’re eminently logical and practical people, people who sort of spring into action and competency when faced with crisis – as pained and bleary-eyed as any first-time parents may have been. We found this way to treasure those moments, laced with sorrow, with our precious child, precisely because the future was always so unknown and held in suspense. And when Lucia’s prognosis pointed to death in early childhood, it only made worry that much more the enemy of the present. We had the present. The luxury of worry was fleeting. Fortunately you know there is so much more to the story. Lucia is thriving today thanks to New Jersey Medicaid, loving family and friends, her own irrepressible spirit, great doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and God.And yet, I’m more riddled with worry than I’ve ever been. I’m more confused and angry and scared because everyday I know I’m waking up in a world where her life is not instinctively and supremely valued – rather her ways of life, costly though they may be, fall definitively at the bottom of a decisively immoral federal budget that sees fit to do without them. As an intellectual and a person of faith, I really try to overcome these worries with logic and prayer, but they remain apparent, diffuse in the backdrop of our otherwise grace-soaked lives, hopefully dormant but palpably there.This is my new present, and it makes me sick.I’m sick that although my child is now even miraculously taking small spoonfuls of puree at school by mouth (go Lucia!), I’m wondering whether her special needs public school and feeding therapy will be on the chopping block next. I rejoice that Lucia’s God-given companion, her nurse Sylvia, has been with us for over a year and a half, but I worry how I will work when Lucia’s Medicaid gets cut, how Lucia will ride the bus to school or eat through her tube without Sylvia, or how my husband and I will ever sleep without a nurse in our house to monitor Lucia’s seizures, vitals, oxygen levels, feeds, and neurological pain. I’m worried because in the back of my mind I wonder if someday in the absence of Medicaid I may not longer be able to care for my own child, this precious, precious gift, because I actually can’t do it without in-home nurses and feeding pumps and pulse ox monitors and special education and therapy and seizure medication and durable medical equipment – all things that Medicaid provides.Some friends along the way have insinuated that I’m being a bit dramatic here–that perhaps I should give Donald Trump, the Republicans, the AHCA, the budget negotiations more of a chance – perhaps I shouldn’t worry so much. Perhaps, according to them, I have nothing to worry about. But I can tell you this much: I didn’t worry for Lucia’s life or ours initially because those were so firmly and are so firmly in God’s hands. The rarity of her genetic disease, the onset of her brain damage and consequences, and the wisdom and beauty that God had in making her are so simply beyond me. But this politics and justice and being human stuff? God’s charged us with that. God’s charged us with preserving and caring for human life that God has made – all human lives – that’s ours to do. And as long as people like my daughter are cast aside in some human mishandling of God’s charge to God’s stewards, I reserve the right to be very angry. I reserve the right to be worried. And I reserve the right to fight like hell to preserve her life, like any of you would your own child’s, and my ability as a parent to care for her in my own home.You can tell me not to worry, but it makes me feel as though you are not really listening as I tell my story. I learned how to live in the present a long, long time ago, and I’m telling you it’s become a downright inhospitable place for people with disabilities. It’s a present deeply in need of a change. Won’t you join me in being that change so none of us need worry about our children’s future?Please call your Senators to urge them to vote against the AHCA and the proposed cuts for Medicaid. Let them know that more than 80 percent of Medicaid’s budget goes to children with disabilities, poor children and the elderly; only 15 percent of Medicaid funding goes to health care for able-bodied adults.

Smith Is America's New Poet Laureate,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tracy-k-smith-poet-laureate-library-of-congress_us_5940c77be4b0d3185485cf45,"“Her work travels the world and takes on its voices,"" says the standing Librarian of Congress who appointed Smith.",2017-06-14,"Tracy K. Smith, Pulitzer Prize winner and professor of creative writing, is due to begin her term as the poet laureate in September.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5940d1682200003d00c6df15.jpeg?cache=48petkuq8d&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tracy K. Smith, Pulitzer Prize winner and professor of creative writing, is the next poet laureate of the United States. Carla Hayden, the standing Librarian of Congress, announced Wednesday that she has appointed Smith as the nation’s next poet. Smith will be taking the reins from Juan Felipe Herrera, who was appointed poet laureate twice in 2015 and 2016.Smith, 45, received the Pulitzer Prize in 2012 for her collection of poetry titled Life on Mars, which “sends us out into the magnificent chill of the imagination and then returns us to ourselves, both changed and consoled,” according to a 2011 New York Times book review.Smith authored two more books of poetry ― The Body’s Question (2003) and Duende (2007) ― and a memoir, Ordinary Light, which earned her the honor of National Book Award finalist for nonfiction in 2015.Every year, the Librarian of Congress appoints one “poet laureate consultant in poetry” to serve the Library of Congress. The library’s description for the role is purposefully vague, so the poet laureate has the freedom bring to the official position whatever they desire.The only steadfast requirement is that the laureate serves as “the nation’s official lightning rod for the poetic impulse of Americans,” according to the national library. In return, the poet laureate receives a $35,000 annual stipend, and $5,000 travel budget.Smith told NPR that her responsibility as the nation’s poet is to “raise awareness of poetry and its value in our culture” and to bring it to those who are not yet familiar with the art form.“To me that means talking to people — getting off the usual path of literary festivals and university reading series and talking to people who might not even yet be readers of poetry,” she told NPR.“I would love to go to places where people might be struggling, where people might wonder if there are voices out there for them,” she added.Smith was born in Massachusetts and is the youngest of five siblings, according to NPR. She attended Harvard University for her Bachelors and received her Masters of Fine Arts in creative writing from Columbia University. Smith was a Stegner fellow at Stanford University from 1997 to 1999 and, in 2014, she was awarded with a fellowship with the Academy of American Poets.She currently teaches at Princeton University and, according to NPR, she is working on another form of literature: opera. Hayden paid tribute to Smith’s poetry work for traveling the world and taking on its voices. It “brings history and memory to life; calls on the power of literature as well as science, religion, and pop culture,”the current Librarian of Congress said. “With directness and deftness, she contends with the heavens or plumbs our inner depths ― all to better understand what makes us human,” she added.Smith sees value in sharing poetry with the country especially in today’s tense political climate.“Poetry can help us make sense of the contemporary moment,” she told The Washington Post. “I’m excited by the fact that what poets are writing speaks to a particular moment and it speaks to the ages. Any political moment is uncertain, and a voice that lets us think about that will last,” Smith continued. “Let’s think about how empathy can drive our perspective of one another. Let’s think about how we can get past what’s binary and simplest to what’s complicated.”Smith is due to begin her term as the poet laureate in September. “Wade in the Water,” her fourth book of poetry, is due in stores in April."
