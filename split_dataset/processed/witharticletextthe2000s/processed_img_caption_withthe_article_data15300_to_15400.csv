What I’ve tried to do on the back end of that is help the youth understand what those issues are,” Bryant said, according to ESPN. “What is the system that can help you understand what those issues are? It’s one thing to say we need change, but what does that actually look like? What are the issues that we need to vote on and understand?”In the past, Bryant has spoken highly of President Obama. He even released the POTUS-inspired Kobe X Elite “Commander” sneaker in conjunction with Nike.“Kobe has long looked up to the commander-in-chief, and not just because of his hoops game,” Nike explained at the time, according to The Hill."
1,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton's Camp Looks For A Quick Knockout With Florida Blitz,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-florida-early-vote_us_581916e5e4b00f11fc5c8270,Clinton herself or a top surrogate has been in Florida just about every day since early voting started last week.,2016-11-02,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton urged supporters in Sanford, Florida, to cast their ballots in the remaining days of the early vote period. If Clinton can win Florida, she is virtually assured of becoming president.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5819372e150000b70053127b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SANFORD, Fla. ― Hillary Clinton continued her push to close out election night early, with a Florida appearance Tuesday urging supporters to register their unhappiness with her Republican opponent by casting their ballots now.“The best way to stop him is by showing up and voting,” the Democratic presidential nominee said to the crowd of 1,000 jammed into the Sanford Civic Center.“How many of you have already voted?” she asked, and watched nearly every hand go up amid a chorus of cheers. “Well, I’m asking you to go out and make sure you get more people to vote.”The strategy is both simple and straightforward. Florida is the biggest and most valuable prize among the battleground states. Clinton doesn’t need it to win the presidency, but Republican nominee Donald Trump does.“Donald Trump has practically no pathway to victory without Florida,” said Valentina Pereda, the campaign’s Florida press secretary.Without Florida’s 29 electoral votes, Trump would have to win every single other battleground ― Ohio, North Carolina, Iowa, Colorado, Virginia, Nevada ― and in addition to that, flip at least a couple of Democratic states. In reality, strategists on both sides agree, Clinton winning Florida would mean winning the election.To that end, her campaign has been swarming the state with its top surrogates since early voting began on Oct. 25. Vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine visited Tallahassee last week, and is to return this weekend. President Barack Obama hit Miami last Friday, and is planning another trip there and to Jacksonville on Thursday. Vice President Joe Biden is in Tampa and West Palm Beach on Wednesday. Clinton’s Tuesday trip was her third in just over a week, and even as she spoke in Central Florida, husband Bill Clinton was on his third Florida event of the day in St. Petersburg.In contrast, on Wednesday Trump is to make his second visit since early voting started, while running mate Mike Pence hit three cities in Central Florida on Monday. Trump daughters Ivanka and Tiffany visited South Florida one day last week.While Trump’s campaign favors locations that help attract massive crowds at his rallies, the Clinton campaign is instead targeting its visits to work with local field teams to turn out identified supporters. Every appearance has been a short stroll away from an early voting site.“Not far from here is the North Branch Library, one block away,” she said, and then listed its hours, 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. through Sunday. “So early voting here is convenient.”Hundreds of paid staff and thousands of volunteers are focusing on banking ballots from strong Clinton supporters who are regular voters, but are spending even more energy persuading strong supporters who have voted only sporadically in the past to visit an early voting site this week. Of particular interest to the campaign are the 80,000 or so Democrats who requested absentee ballots but who have not yet turned them in. “We’re definitely hassling you then,” joked one staffer.At a predominantly Latino voting site about 30 miles south Tuesday afternoon, the differing approaches of the two campaigns was on display. One independent voter said he was getting about three times as many calls and door knocks from Democrats as he was from Trump. A Trump voter with a history of voting in Republican primaries, meanwhile, said no one had contacted him at all.Steve Schale, a Democratic consultant who worked on Obama’s two winning campaigns in Florida, said the low-propensity voter strategy appears to be paying off for Clinton. He said more than half of the Hispanic voters casting ballots are either first-time or low-frequency voters.In her 36 minutes on stage Tuesday evening, Clinton hit her usual themes of helping the middle class, supporting equal pay for women and dealing with high college tuition costs. She also mixed in her now-familiar lacerations of Trump for his insults of various groups, his refusal to disclose his income tax returns and his admiring language for dictators including Russian leader Vladimir Putin.One topic she did not broach: FBI Director James Comey, who on Friday shook up the presidential race with a letter to Congress announcing that he would examine a new tranche of emails found on the computer of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to see if they contained classified information.Campaign officials and Clinton herself have been aggressively criticizing Comey for apparently violating Department of Justice guidelines regarding the release of such information so close to an election.Clinton, though, avoided the topic altogether in Sanford, and closed with an extended appeal to get out the vote in the coming days. “Twenty-six million people in America have already voted, more than 4 million of them right here in Florida,” she said. “If we can keep this up, there is no doubt. If we vote, we win.”"

Editor-in-chief Ken Kurson told The Huffington Post Wednesday that the “Observer is not going to make an endorsement in the general.” The Observer was one of four publications to endorse Trump during the Republican primary, along with the Rupert Murdoch’s New York Post, the Santa Barbara News-Press and The National Enquirer. The Santa Barbara News-Press is also among the handful of newspapers to endorse Trump in the general election. The New York Post, which backed Romney nearly two weeks before the 2012 election, has not yet weighed in for the general even as its tabloid rival, The Daily News, doubled down Monday on its support for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Clinton has racked up dozens of newspaper endorsements throughout the country, including from conservative editorial boards that hadn’t picked a Democrat in decades ― or, in some cases, more than a century. No major magazine has backed Trump. Some have endorsed for the first time or in recent memory; the Atlantic’s endorsement of Clinton was only its third in a 160-year-history. The Observer has struggled at times with covering Trump given Kushner’s familial, political and business ties. Kushner, who bought the paper in 2006 and married Ivanka Trump three years later, has been a top adviser throughout the election cycle ― even described as the de facto campaign manager. He’s also reportedly been inquiring about launching a Trump-related media venture after the election. The Observer faced criticism in 2014 for publishing an unflattering article on New York attorney Eric Schneiderman after his office brought a fraud case against Trump University. As the presidential race was under way in July 2015, Kurson told HuffPost “there’s no good way to cover Trump’s candidacy from an opinion perspective” given that any take, pro or con, could be viewed through the prism of Kushner’s ownership.In April, New York magazine reported that Kurson ― who worked as a former speechwriter for Rudy Giuliani in addition to journalism roles ― provided input for a speech Trump gave at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference, a role that raised conflict of interest concerns. Kurson was unapologetic, telling HuffPost that he and Kushner have long discussed politics and he simply looked at a draft in the course of their discussions. A family friend, Kurson landed the Observer’s top job after Kushner cycled through five editors in seven years.While Kurson didn’t regret his involvement, a former senior politics editor put out a statement shortly afterward that no editorial staffers should assist campaigns. The paper’s national political reporter quit just over a week later in response to the primary endorsement and other Trump coverage concerns. To its credit, the paper has allowed for some debate over Trump, and his influence, in its pages. In July, arts and culture writer Dana Schwartz wrote an open letter to Kushner asking him to respond to the anti-Semitic attacks leveled at her and other journalists by Trump supporters. Kushner, who is orthodox Jewish, and whose wife, Ivanka, converted to the faith, responded that his father-in-law is not anti-Semitic or racist. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

5,POLITICS,Migrant Farmworker Enclave Gets A Presidential Campaign Visit,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-florida-farmworkers_us_581804f3e4b064e1b4b48261,Former President Bill Clinton shows Dems are serious about harvesting every last Florida vote.,2016-11-01,"Former President Bill Clinton will visit Immokalee, Florida, Tuesday, home to just 4,348 registered voters. The town is predominately Hispanic and home to a large community of migrant farm workers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ORLANDO, Fla. ― As Hillary Clinton visits a largely Republican Central Florida suburb on Tuesday, husband Bill Clinton heads to even more unlikely source of votes 200 miles to the south on the edge of the Everglades.Collier County is among the most reliably Republican in the state. But one of its faster growing towns, Immokalee, is home to a bloc of support for the Democratic nominee: farm workers, many of them from Mexico.Unfortunately for Democrats, there aren’t that many of them. Of the 17,000 adults of voting age who live in the town, which the census says is three-quarters Hispanic, only 4,348 are registered to vote.“It’s good symbolism,” said Steve Schale, a Democratic consultant who led President Barack Obama’s two successful Florida campaigns.Originally an outpost of the Seminole Indians, Immokalee sits near the northern edge of the Everglades, where vegetable farms employ thousands of agricultural workers. This has been a natural Democratic constituency, although the party has had a difficult time registering them and getting them to vote. Many are not citizens ― a large number are undocumented ― and those who have not historically been interested in voting.Democrats’ task, though, has generally gotten easier with Latinos since Donald Trump began his campaign by calling undocumented Mexican immigrants “rapists,” made his promise to build a border wall a centerpiece of his campaign, and then managed to win the GOP nomination.Still, at least for this election, the former president’s visit may be more about the message than a serious push for votes.Schale said the 2012 Obama campaign actually opened an office in Immokalee, and sent former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson there. “Kind of proud to be the first presidential to have an office there,” Schale said. “But it was much symbolic as practical.”Bill Clinton is to speak at 3:30 p.m. He is scheduled to start the day with a campaign stop in Florida City, in southern Miami-Dade, and finish with a visit to St. Petersburg.HuffPost Pollster, which aggregates all available public polls, shows Clinton narrowly leading Trump in Florida."

Talks about women being pigs?”Biden was referencing tweets Trump sent out in the middle of the night in September mocking former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Since coming forward about the derogatory comments Trump made about her while she was Miss Universe, Machado has been campaigning for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. She spoke at a rally in Florida on Tuesday afternoon.Biden added that Trump’s candidacy has been bad for America’s image.“This guy is so dumbing-down, I mean it, America’s brand around the world. It’s outrageous,” he said.“There’s a lot on the ballot, but one of the things is dignity and respect.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
7,SPORTS,Cliff Avril Is Winning On And Off The Football Field,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cliff-avril-haiti_us_57f28021e4b024a52d2ff2ba,He's using the gridiron as a platform to help those who need it the most.,2016-11-01,"Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril has family ties to Haiti, and he recently helped build a brand-new school there. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f7d0da1a000067145b7c73.jpeg?cache=Q42rK1P8P8&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Cliff Avril entered the NFL in 2008 as a third-round draft pick out of Purdue. He landed in Detroit, and instantly made an impact rushing the quarterback for the Lions, earning All-Rookie honors as a defensive end. While football was his primary focus, Avril soon envisioned the game as a platform for making a positive impact in the community.“When I first got in the NFL, I had an inkling and I had a feeling that I wanted to do some things in the community,” Avril tells The Huffington Post. “But for me, I was worried about people not supporting me because I wasn’t really known. As I matured a little more, got married, had kids ― my view and vision on life changed completely.”Avril’s vision became clearer after a few years in the league: He wanted to help others on a larger scale. His parents are both from Haiti ― the Caribbean island nation suffering in the wake of a devastating 2010 earthquake and now again from Hurricane Matthew ― and he traveled there every summer until he was 15 years old. Naturally, his interest in helping Haiti resurfaced, especially given that it’s the poorest country in the Northern Hemisphere.“I was thinking more of what I can do for these kids,” the 30-year-old says. “Then going out there and seeing it firsthand, I was like, ‘I want to go out there and build them a whole school.’ Initially it was just a classroom, and they tried to get donors and other people to try and come up with the rest of the money for the school. I said, ‘Screw that, I just want to do it myself.’”Avril, through the Cliff Avril Family Foundation and a partnership with an organization called Free the Children, started by fixing up two classrooms. Two turned into four, which turned into seven.Once he reached that number, Avril decided to construct an entire school. But it wasn’t merely the infrastructure ― it is built to withstand natural disasters ― that needed special attention. A new school also meant better textbooks and making sure the children actually had shoes, a luxury most could not afford for the 90-minute walk to and from school every day.During a visit following the earthquake, Avril and his wife, Tia, realized that there was an even larger problem developing at a local orphanage. “Cliff had told me all the stories about Haiti,” Tia tells HuffPost. “I was all on board. We get to this remote community where the people were so passionate about education. They just had so many obstacles. They were just so appreciative.”One of the key obstacles was something as basic as water.“They showed us a water reservoir of where they store all their water,” Avril says. “They literally had 1 inch of water left in it. It’s crazy because we knew we wanted to give them water but they were literally on their last inch. ... It was very humbling.”As he learned more, Avril realized that perhaps the largest need ― even more so than schools ― was actually housing. “How can kids go to school if they don’t even have a place to sleep?” Avril started asking himself.After joining forces with the Baltimore Ravens’ Elvis Dumervil, the two are now helping build permanent homes for families throughout Haiti.“We’re using all Haitian workers to help stimulate the economy,” Avril says. “And every sack I record this season [his 7.5 sacks are tied for third in the NFL], results in one new home in Haiti. After the hurricane, I just felt like I needed to do something right now. We partnered with The Mission of Hope ― whether its feeding people or providing water [for one full year] and medical assistance, we had to make an immediate difference.”While Avril ― whose three forced fumbles are tied for second in the league ― was touched by his experience, he was also humbled by the influx of support he received from fellow NFL players, including Seahawks teammates. Michael Bennett, Richard Sherman and former Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch have all joined the cause. Lynch actually joined Avril in Haiti and physically helped build the school.“When we were done, I looked at the school and just felt really proud,” Lynch tells HuffPost.Avril believes that more players will want to be involved, but only when they make the trek to Haiti and experience the poverty for themselves.“I’m trying to bring guys with me next year to see the situation,” he says. “You know, everyone has a different view on how bad the situation is in America but it can always be worse, and that’s definitely one of the countries where you can see that.”The curious part for Avril is that while education plays an increasingly important role in his life today ― he and Tia have two young boys ― that wasn’t always the case. In fact, even at Purdue, Avril’s focus was almost entirely on the gridiron. “Honestly, school didn’t get important to me until my third year in the NFL when I went back to graduate,” he says. “Now don’t get me wrong, I went to school because I knew I needed an education. ... I didn’t value it as much as I should have growing up, it was just something that I had to do. I thought, ‘How am I going to set a precedent for my child to go to school and to get a degree if I went to school for free?’ That’s why I went back and graduated.”Avril, who is enjoying his ninth professional season and who was recently nominated for the 2016 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, earned a Super Bowl ring with the Seahawks in 2014 and signed a four-year, $28.5 million contract extension that will keep him in Seattle through 2018. With that in mind, he believes that now is the time to keep pushing and to keep educating those who will listen. It’s why he has brought a mobile medical clinic to Haiti, hosted a football camp and organized nearly 30 community events in both Washington state and Florida this year.“There was a time [in Haiti] when there was just food sitting on the tarmac at the airport,” he says, “because certain help groups were saying it was theirs, while other ones were saying, ‘No, it’s ours,’ so it just sat there until they figured out whose food it was to get credit for helping people.”“Are you looking for notoriety, or are you looking to actually help?” he says. For Avril, there really is only one answer to that question.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

I thought, ‘How am I going to set a precedent for my child to go to school and to get a degree if I went to school for free?’ That’s why I went back and graduated.”Avril, who is enjoying his ninth professional season and who was recently nominated for the 2016 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, earned a Super Bowl ring with the Seahawks in 2014 and signed a four-year, $28.5 million contract extension that will keep him in Seattle through 2018. With that in mind, he believes that now is the time to keep pushing and to keep educating those who will listen. It’s why he has brought a mobile medical clinic to Haiti, hosted a football camp and organized nearly 30 community events in both Washington state and Florida this year.“There was a time [in Haiti] when there was just food sitting on the tarmac at the airport,” he says, “because certain help groups were saying it was theirs, while other ones were saying, ‘No, it’s ours,’ so it just sat there until they figured out whose food it was to get credit for helping people.”“Are you looking for notoriety, or are you looking to actually help?” he says.

9,POLITICS,The FBI Story Hasn't Changed Many Americans' Minds About Hillary Clinton,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-hillary-clinton-emails-polling_us_5817cd75e4b064e1b4b477b6,Just 5 percent of Americans say the latest development tells them something new about her.,2016-11-01,"By a 12-point margin, 49 percent to 37 percent, Americans currently say the story of the FBI's Hillary Clinton investigation is relevant to the election, rather than a distraction.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5817d295150000b700530e89.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most Americans see the ongoing saga over Hillary Clinton’s emails as a serious problem, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, but very few think the latest chapter sheds any new light on the Democratic nominee.Fifty-one percent of Americans say Clinton’s use of personal email to conduct government business while secretary of state is a very serious problem, with 65 percent saying it’s at least somewhat serious, according to the survey. The survey was taken after the FBI announced last Friday that it was reviewing emails related to Clinton’s handling of sensitive government information.The percentage who view it as “very serious” is up 8 points from a May YouGov survey. Democrats and independents are 4 points more likely to describe her emails as a very serious problem than they were in the earlier poll, rising to 16 percent and 48 percent respectively, but the biggest movement was among the GOP. Eighty-nine percent of Republicans now call Clinton’s emails a very serious problem, up from 76 percent in May.By a 12-point margin, 49 percent to 37 percent, Americans currently say that the FBI story is relevant to the election, rather than a distraction. Eighty-one percent of Republicans and 51 percent of independents, but just 16 percent of Democrats, see the story as relevant.Certainly, having speculation about her emails splashed across every TV screen and front page less than two weeks out from the election isn’t good news for Clinton, not least because the candidate getting the lion’s share of media attention this year has tended to struggle in the polls.But the divide between Democrats and Republicans hints at a wider dynamic of the race: Views of both candidates are mostly baked in, and split largely along party lines. The FBI’s announcement ― especially given how much it is lacking in concrete detail ― seems to be functioning as a kind of political inkblot test, with Americans reading into it whatever they were already inclined to believe beforehand. Republicans may be increasingly dubious about Clinton’s ethics, but most were never at any risk of voting for her, either.Accordingly, Americans are strikingly unlikely to say that the story has changed their mind about Clinton. Just 5 percent say the latest development tells them anything new about Clinton, while 52 percent say it confirms what they already thought of her, and 34 percent that it doesn’t have much effect on their opinion of her.A 63 percent majority of Democrats say the story doesn’t affect their view of Clinton, while 50 percent of independents and 84 percent of Republicans say that it strengthens their pre-existing suspicions about her.Similarly, scandals relating to Trump have failed to dramatically shift the public’s view of him. The leaked video of him bragging about groping women may have cost him some high-profile endorsements among office-holders, but it had only a negligible effect on whether voters believed he respected women.Both the Trump tape and the controversy swirling around Clinton’s emails feed readily into the most negative portraits drawn by each candidate’s opponents ― that he’s inexcusably sexist, and that she’s corrupt. But the people most convinced the newest stories are evidence of each candidate’s unsuitability are the ones who already disliked them. Clinton and Trump’s supporters, in contrast, seem more or less willing to shrug them off.“I do not equate sexual assault with mishandling of classified information, but it strikes me that the cognitive task before voters is similar,” Michael McDonald, an associate professor at the University of Florida, wrote Sunday, noting the overall stability of the early vote so far. “In both cases, voters have a mountain of evidence already placed before them. One more woman making an accusation against Trump will not change voters’ assessments of the veracity of the totality of the allegations. Similarly, possibly finding new Clinton-related emails ― without any further evidence that they are relevant ― does not change voters’ assessments of Clinton on this issue.”Another question on the HuffPost/YouGov survey further bears that out. By a 50-point margin, 65 percent to 15 percent, Democrats say that allegations about Trump sexually assaulting women are more important than the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s emails. By an 81-point margin, 86 percent to 5 percent, Republicans see Clinton’s emails as the more important story. (Independents, by a 24-point margin, also consider Clinton’s emails more important, although those who lean toward the Democratic Party feel differently.)It’s still somewhat premature to draw any definitive conclusions about what effect the FBI’s announcement has had on the race, especially since surveys prior to Friday already varied significantly on the size of Clinton’s lead. But what evidence there is so far suggests that, despite the news, national polling has remained relatively stable over the weekend. A new NBC/SurveyMonkey tracking poll found Clinton’s lead holding steady at 6 points nationally, while Politico/Morning Consult’s tracking poll also found little change in the race.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 30-31 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

12,POLITICS,Republicans Tried Trump's 'Ballot Security' Strategy 35 Years Ago. Here's What Happened.,Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roger-stone-donald-trump-ballot-security_us_5818f6a1e4b0f96eba966f03,The GOP is still suffering the consequences of its decision to intimidate voters in 1981.,2016-11-01,HuffPost created these two badges using the Vote Protectors online I.D. Badge Generator,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581004b11a00004e2d5bbc84.png?cache=kJqRcpa451&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Roger Stone, the political trickster who is organizing thousands of Donald Trump supporters to monitor polls on election day, was the chief strategist for a 1981 New Jersey gubernatorial campaign that benefited from a similar “ballot security” effort. In that race, New Jersey Republican Tom Kean’s top advisers, including Stone, warned the public that the election would be “stolen.” Volunteer election monitors with official looking garb flocked to minority neighborhoods. This, along with signs warning that “it is crime to falsify a ballot or to violate election laws,” led to widespread reports of intimidation.Kean won the election by a hair, but a federal judge later determined that the “National Ballot Security Task Force” organized to support him had violated prohibitions against voter intimidation. Ever since then, the Republican party has been forced to operate under a special set of rules, called a consent decree, that is supposed to ensure that similar voter suppression efforts never happen again. Reached via email, Stone denied he had anything to do with the Kean National Ballot Security Task Force, telling The Huffington Post, “it was a Republican National Committee operation thru the New Jersey Republican State Committee, and not the Kean for Governor [campaign].” Stone said he learned about the voter intimidation “on Election Day.” But the parallels with today’s Stone-led pro-Trump effort are uncanny. During the Republican primary this year, Stone organized the “Trump Ballot Security Project” to fight what he claimed was a conspiracy by the RNC to “steal” the GOP nomination from Trump.Once Trump secured the nomination, Stone turned his sights toward Nov. 8, and began arguing that Democrats would “steal” the general election. Stone called for a legion of Vote Protectors, untrained volunteers who agreed to travel to minority neighborhoods on Election Day and act as “citizen journalists” and “exit pollers” — just like the volunteer poll watchers that monitored inner-city neighborhoods in New Jersey in 1981.Until a few days ago, the group organizing these “exit polls” was also encouraging volunteers to wear official looking I.D. badges, and to videotape voters approaching the polls. But after HuffPost asked Stone about them, he pulled down the webpages from his site that showed Trump supporters how to create I.D. badges and how to videotape voters at the polls. These are the badges HuffPost made:As of Tuesday, the homemade “exit poll” function was still up, and volunteers were still signing up all over the country to conduct the “exit polls,” despite there being no information on Stone’s site about how to actually conduct an exit poll. Below is the “exit poll” format. HuffPost accidentally cast two votes for Trump, which were apparently recorded for the poll.Stone recently told Trump supporters that this unscientific exit poll could serve as evidence for the Trump campaign to use in a legal challenge over a Clinton presidential victory.But Stone is wrong. Exit polls “are not a legitimate reason to challenge an election,” Danielle Lang, deputy director of voting rights at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit public interest group, told HuffPost. “That’s why we have a secret ballot, so you don’t have to tell anyone how you voted.”Stone’s activities are causing major headaches for the national Republican Party. Until last week, the RNC was looking forward to having the 1982 consent decree from the Kean campaign case lifted in 2017. But late Wednesday, Democrats filed a motion to extend the special rules another eight years, citing the Trump campaign’s “ballot security” initiatives and Stone’s emphasis on sending his “exit pollers” to largely minority neighborhoods. Trump, meanwhile, had his own ties to the Kean campaign, and the voter intimidation fallout. When Democrats filed a lawsuit accusing the RNC of voter intimidation in 1982, it was Trump’s brother-in-law and personal attorney, John Barry, who represented the Republicans fighting the consent decree.On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly encouraged his supporters to monitor polls. In August, he told a Pennsylvania crowd, “I hope you people can … not just vote on [Nov.] 8th, but go around and look and watch other polling places and make sure that it’s one hundred percent fine.” The consent decree prohibits the Republican National Committee and its allies from engaging in any “ballot security measures” that could suppress the vote in minority neighborhoods, and from recording, intimidating, or approaching voters headed to the polls. It does not specifically apply to presidential candidates, but the New Jersey lawsuit seeks to prove that the RNC and the Trump campaign are coordinating on Trump’s “voter integrity” efforts.

None of the tampered candy was eaten. The firefighter reported the tampered treats to local police, which warned other families with this Facebook post:Police in Coldwater, where the children received the candy, is reportedly investigating. HuffPost was unable to reach police for comment.That wasn’t the only report of tampered candy in Coldwater.Heather Kay Williams said her sister bit into a thumb tack while eating a piece of her 2-year-old daughters’ Halloween candy on Monday night.Her NSFW Facebook post has since gone viral:Williams said the saddest part about the experience is that the tampered candy either came from someone on her block, or someone participating in her church’s “Trunk or Treat” event.Williams couldn’t be reached. She said on Facebook she’s not happy that some people reacted to her warning about tainted candy by accusing her of making it up.Most reports of tainted or tampered candy turn out to be urban legends or flat-out hoaxes.Joel Best, a sociology and criminal justice professor at the University of Delaware, has researched candy-tampering cases dating back to 1958.“I have yet to find of a report of an incident where a child was killed or seriously injured by a contaminated treat picked up in the course of trick-or-treating,” Best told the Canadian Broadcasting Co. He said fears of someone adulterating candy with poison or sharp objects is absurd.“This is a guy who is so crazy that he kills little children at random, but he’s so tightly wrapped, he only does it one night a year,” Best said."
14,POLITICS,GOP Senator Denies Irish Investment Is Designed To Avoid Taxes,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ron-johnson-denies-avoiding-taxes_us_5818f778e4b07c97c1c4eb7c,But Ron Johnson was not eager to answer questions about it.,2016-11-01,Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) faces tough re-election odds.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5818f83b170000b3045bb126.jpeg?cache=Hycb827LdT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) denied Monday that an investment in an Irish company is a tax avoidance scheme, in response to a Huffington Post report that the company had many features of a tax shelter. Johnson maintained that the Irish company, DP Lenticular, is merely a distributor of products made by Pacur, the Wisconsin-based plastics manufacturer he helped found. The Wisconsin senator told the Journal Sentinel he invested in DP Lenticular to get its financial information.The Journal Sentinel’s Daniel Bice was among a group of reporters who followed Johnson out of a campaign event Monday to get answers about the investment.Initially reluctant to speak about it, Johnson finally spoke with the scrum of reporters once he got outside. A local TV news station caught the exchange on camera.“This is how you export product,” Johnson told the reporters. “Without a sales agency, I don’t know how you sell product.”“There’s no profit parked over there or anything else,” he added, according to the Journal Sentinel. “Those profits are paid out every year, and I report them and I pay taxes on them.”Johnson’s campaign declined to comment for HuffPost’s story about the investment on Friday. The senator’s response Monday was nearly identical to the one he gave when a reporter asked him about the investment after a debate with challenger Russ Feingold at Marquette University Law School in October.Johnson did not explain, however, why the multimillion-dollar company supposedly charged with distribution of Pacur’s products throughout Europe only employs one person. DP Lenticular is also owned by a Spanish company, Dodecinvest SL, that reported no employees or revenue and paid no corporate taxes in the most recent year its data is available.Tax experts told HuffPost that the one-employee structure of the company, and ownership by another, similarly empty company, suggests it is a mechanism for funneling profits to low-tax Ireland or elsewhere.In addition, Johnson owns 9.9 percent of DP Lenticular ― just below the threshold that would require him to report it to the Internal Revenue Service. Johnson told the Journal Sentinel that the decision not to buy more of the company in 2007 was indeed meant to “minimize the impact of government regulations,” something he said was “just smart business.” Johnson subsequently had to disclose the investment as a United States senator.Ireland is a top destination for tax dodging due to its corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent ― which is lower than the official top U.S. rate and that of many other developed nations ― and other rules making it easy to transfer money to countries, like Bermuda, with even lower taxes. Even if Johnson had legitimate business reasons for investing in the company, he stood to benefit from Ireland’s favorable tax laws.Johnson has opposed measures that would toughen enforcement on corporate tax avoidance overseas, claiming instead that the solution is to lower domestic tax rates for U.S.-based corporations.Feingold and the Wisconsin Democratic Party have attacked Johnson for the investment, claiming it is evidence of tax avoidance that resembles the antics of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.“It’s not that Sen. Johnson doesn’t understand the issues facing middle-class and working families,” Michael Tyler, spokesman for Feingold, told the Journal Sentinel in a statement. “It’s that, just like Donald Trump, his own interests come first.”Feingold, who lost his Senate seat to Johnson in 2010, currently leads Johnson in the polls by about 6 percentage points, according to HuffPost Pollster’s polling average.UPDATE: 11/3 ― Brian Reisinger, a spokesman for Johnson’s campaign, insisted that there are “no earnings outside dividends.”“No income attributable to Ron is retained in DP Lenticular in Ireland or Europe,” Reisinger said in an email. He also denied that Johnson’s investment in DP Lenticular is designed to avoid U.S. taxes.“The purpose of Ron’s investment in DP Lenticular is to create a partnership that allows PACUR to export more products overseas,” he said. “The only income Ron makes, about $15,000, is subject to both state and federal income tax, and Ron paid them.”Reisinger also described Johnson’s proposals for corporate tax reform in greater detail. “Ron supports scrapping the tax code and enacting pro-growth tax reform, and reducing burdensome regulations ― all to remove unfair government policies and help create jobs here at home,” he said.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) criticized the rising price of the company’s insulin drug Humalog on Twitter.Sanders tweeted his disapproval of the price of Humalog at 12:28 p.m. ET. The former Democratic presidential candidate attached an image from a Washington Post report on Monday showing that the drug’s price had risen from $21 to $255 in the past 20 years ― a 700 percent increase when adjusted for inflation, according to the Post. Immediately after, the price of an Eli Lilly share quickly went from $72.71 to $72.05 in fewer than 10 minutes. CNBC first reported the development. Eli Lilly’s share price recovered promptly, but it nonetheless demonstrated the power of a single senator’s fury to move markets in an era of increasing political scrutiny of controversial corporate practices.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a progressive ally of Sanders in the Senate, recently demonstrated the power of her bully pulpit to punish corporate misbehavior with her televised grilling of Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf. Wells Fargo’s stock price could also be seen dropping in real time as Warren called on Stumpf to resign, return profits and be investigated for criminal misconduct.  Thanks to Warren’s pressure, Stumpf was forced to forgo $41 million in unvested stock, as well as his annual salary and bonus. Warren’s brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, along with other federal agencies, had caught Wells Fargo setting up accounts for customers without their knowledge and levied a record fine on the bank.Warren, Sanders and other liberal lawmakers are already using scandals like these to signal that they plan to maintain the role of populist gadfly if Hillary Clinton occupies the White House.But Sanders’ tweet also illustrates the particular challenge facing the pharmaceutical industry after a series of highly public drug price increases that have drawn negative attention to industry practices. Members of Congress from both parties had harsh words for Mylan CEO Heather Bresch in September after the company jacked up the price of a two-pack of the life-saving EpiPen from $100 in 2009 to $608.And former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli sparked widespread outrage in August 2015 when he raised the price of vital drug Daraprim to $750 per pill from $13.50. The drug is primarily used to treat toxoplasmosis, a parasite infection that can be fatal for pregnant women, and some AIDS and cancer patients who contract it.Sanders has seized on popular discontent with these companies’ conduct to push for the government to use its power as an insurer to negotiate lower drug prices. He has campaigned for Proposition 61 in California, a referendum on the state’s general election ballot next Tuesday that would link the prices state agencies pay for drugs to what the federal Department of Veterans Affairs pays.The VA, unlike Medicare and state-level health insurance programs, is authorized to use its power as a large insurer to negotiate lower drug prices.Clinton, for her part, supports empowering Medicare to negotiate drug prices, capping consumers’ out-of-pocket drug costs and other reforms."

The former Democratic presidential candidate attached an image from a Washington Post report on Monday showing that the drug’s price had risen from $21 to $255 in the past 20 years ― a 700 percent increase when adjusted for inflation, according to the Post. Immediately after, the price of an Eli Lilly share quickly went from $72.71 to $72.05 in fewer than 10 minutes. CNBC first reported the development. Eli Lilly’s share price recovered promptly, but it nonetheless demonstrated the power of a single senator’s fury to move markets in an era of increasing political scrutiny of controversial corporate practices.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a progressive ally of Sanders in the Senate, recently demonstrated the power of her bully pulpit to punish corporate misbehavior with her televised grilling of Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf. Wells Fargo’s stock price could also be seen dropping in real time as Warren called on Stumpf to resign, return profits and be investigated for criminal misconduct.  Thanks to Warren’s pressure, Stumpf was forced to forgo $41 million in unvested stock, as well as his annual salary and bonus. Warren’s brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, along with other federal agencies, had caught Wells Fargo setting up accounts for customers without their knowledge and levied a record fine on the bank.Warren, Sanders and other liberal lawmakers are already using scandals like these to signal that they plan to maintain the role of populist gadfly if Hillary Clinton occupies the White House.But Sanders’ tweet also illustrates the particular challenge facing the pharmaceutical industry after a series of highly public drug price increases that have drawn negative attention to industry practices. Members of Congress from both parties had harsh words for Mylan CEO Heather Bresch in September after the company jacked up the price of a two-pack of the life-saving EpiPen from $100 in 2009 to $608.And former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli sparked widespread outrage in August 2015 when he raised the price of vital drug Daraprim to $750 per pill from $13.50. The drug is primarily used to treat toxoplasmosis, a parasite infection that can be fatal for pregnant women, and some AIDS and cancer patients who contract it.Sanders has seized on popular discontent with these companies’ conduct to push for the government to use its power as an insurer to negotiate lower drug prices. He has campaigned for Proposition 61 in California, a referendum on the state’s general election ballot next Tuesday that would link the prices state agencies pay for drugs to what the federal Department of Veterans Affairs pays.The VA, unlike Medicare and state-level health insurance programs, is authorized to use its power as a large insurer to negotiate lower drug prices.Clinton, for her part, supports empowering Medicare to negotiate drug prices, capping consumers’ out-of-pocket drug costs and other reforms."
17,POLITICS,Republican Congressman: The Best Reason To Vote For My Opponent Is He Has A Hot Wife,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-reed-john-plumb-beautiful-lady_us_5818b71de4b064e1b4b4dc9f,"Bro.

Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) and his challenger, Democrat John Plumb, were asked, “What qualities does your opponent possess that would cause you to vote for them?”Plumb stumbled through the answer a bit, somehow relating the question to working across the aisle. But Reed took it to another level.“I was hoping you were going to say something nice about me, John. I think that’s what the question was, where you would agree with us,” Reed began, seeming to understand the question a bit better.The New York Republican said he’d talked with Plumb on the campaign trail and gotten to know him a little.“You recently got married to a beautiful lady,” Reed said. “And that maybe is a reason why I would consider voting for my opponent, given the relationship that he has there.”Yes, you heard it right. The reason Tom Reed would consider voting for John Plumb is because John Plumb married a “beautiful lady.”If the answer sounds a bit Donald Trump-ish, that’s probably no coincidence. Reed was one of the first congressmen to endorse Trump, and he’s stuck by the nominee throughout the campaign, despite being in a close race in New York’s westernmost district, and, you know, all the crazy things Trump has said.When Trump’s lewd 2005 comments on “Access Hollywood” surfaced, Reed did call the comments wrong, but he didn’t withdraw his support.“Women are never to be talked about in this way. As someone with eight older sisters, a wife and daughter I care deeply about, it is disappointing and offensive to hear these words,” Reed said, talking about women and their value in relation to himself. “It is not right and these comments must be called out for what they are, just wrong.”Both Reed’s campaign and Plumb’s declined to comment. The Cook Political Report currently rates the race as “Likely Republican.”"

With a week-and-a-half remaining in the 2016 election campaign, the Republican presidential nominee was in Maine.“One of the most beautiful places on earth,” Trump purred and then launched into an uncharacteristically focused discussion of the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. The crowd, clearly invigorated by the latest news about the inquiry, responded with yelps and whoops more characteristic of a victory speech.The thing is, Trump’s visit was actually one of the more politically intelligent things he did in a week that saw him stop by Washington, D.C., to hawk his new hotel, congratulate Newt Gingrich on a stupendously awful Fox News interview, and revive his beef with former rival Jeb Bush, who isn’t actually running for president anymore.The likelihood of a Trump victory on Nov. 8 is still hovering at a percentage typically associated with Harvard admissions, 55-yard field goals and Green Party candidates. But there is one plausible scenario in which Maine could hand Trump the election.Maine awards two of its four electoral votes to the winner (or winners) of its two congressional districts. Although Trump is almost certainly going to lose the state and the comparatively liberal 1st District, he has been more competitive in the mostly rural 2nd District.Were Trump to pick up every swing state but Virginia, Pennsylvania and Colorado, a win in Maine’s 2nd District would put him at 270 electoral votes, the bare minimum required to win the presidency. It’s a long shot and would require a particularly large upset in New Hampshire, where Clinton has opened up a 5-point lead. But it’s one of Trump’s best shots.Maine’s 2nd District covers most of the state, stretching from its eastern coast to its western border with New Hampshire and north to the Canadian border. This isn’t the bucolic Vacationland of knit-cap-wearing seamen stacking lobster traps, craggy coastlines, quaint B&Bs and so forth. Instead, this mostly inland district resembles other traditionally Democratic locales, like Ohio, that Trump is targeting in the final days of his campaign.Maine is the whitest state in the country, and the 2nd District is whiter still. It’s the country’s second-most rural district. Although the area leans Democratic, it is not without a strong base of conservative Christians ― indeed, last Friday’s rally occurred at the Open Door Christian Academy, a private Baptist school.More significantly, inland Maine has witnessed a major downturn in manufacturing over the last few decades, something that has left many people frustrated with the political process. One of the district’s biggest attractions, Museum L-A (for Lewiston-Auburn), contains artifacts from the area’s economic rise during the Industrial Revolution. The museum is, fittingly, located in a shuttered textile mill.The 2nd District isn’t teeming with prospective guests for the luxury hotel that Trump was shilling for in Washington or his similarly pricy resort in Doral, Florida, where he held a rally several days prior. This is a working class place whose woes seem magnified by the dreary late fall weather, as the dying leaves have unmasked the state’s very gothic coniferous forests. “Life is pretty tough out here,” Michael Wentzheimer, a Trump supporter from Lisbon, observed as he walked to Friday’s rally. “People aren’t making the money that they were, and people are struggling a bit more than they were in the past.”“We’ve had five paper mills close here in the last three years,” said former Democratic state Sen. Emily Cain in an interview with HuffPost. Cain is challenging Republican incumbent Bruce Poliquin to represent the 2nd District in Congress. Though she’s running against Trump and the GOP agenda, Cain sympathizes with the discontent that has driven a lot of people in the district to support the real estate mogul.“When nothing is getting done and yet you see more and more of your neighbors addicted to opioids, when you don’t feel safer, when you hear about veterans waiting for months and months for appointments and you hear about Congress underfunding the VA, you feel like, ‘Are you kidding me?’” said Cain. Much of the socioeconomic resentment and burn-it-all mentality that has fueled the Trump campaign nationally is evident here in the 2nd District, where disdain for the ever-gentrifying 1st District is never far from the surface.Trump is going to “deal with reality,” said Todd Beaulieu of Durham. The 2nd District “deals with real life,” he said. Trump, he added, “speaks to us.”“I think he plays to an anger,” said Lisa Ward, the chair of the Lisbon Democrats. “He’s playing to fear in every way.”The 2nd District has provided a base of support for the state’s controversial Republican governor, Paul LePage, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump and in many way presaged the GOP nominee’s success here with his own unmeasured, often populist rhetoric. LePage made national headlines earlier this year when he claimed that “90-plus” percent of the drug dealers arrested in his state “are black and Hispanic people from Waterbury, Connecticut, the Bronx and Brooklyn.” “The 2nd District is fertile ground for Trump both because of the same demographic trends we’ve seen across the country but also because Gov. LePage has helped to till the soil through his two elections with a similar extremist style,” observed Mike Tipping, communications director at the Maine People’s Alliance and a columnist for the Bangor Daily News. Also serving to inflame passions here is a ballot measure that seeks to regulate private gun sales.

Release the information on his connections to the Russians,” Mook said on CNN. “It is mind-boggling, and Director Comey needs to answer this.”Law enforcement officials have been investigating Russia’s role in the presidential campaign and any ties to Trump or his senior advisers, but have found no conclusive, direct link, the New York Times reported on Monday. The United States has blamed Russia for cyber attacks on Democratic Party organizations.The Clinton campaign has been furiously pressing the FBI to provide details on the new trove of emails, which Comey said may or may not be significant in the case. Little is publicly known yet about the emails, other than that they were found during an unrelated probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.In an effort to shift the focus back to Trump’s vulnerabilities, the Clinton campaign released a provocative new ad raising the specter of a possible nuclear war if Trump is elected president, and Clinton emphasized the message that Trump has a bad temper and an overly cavalier attitude toward nuclear weapons at rallies in the battleground state of Ohio on Monday.The FBI spent a year investigating Clinton’s use of a private email server, instead of government systems, while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Comey concluded in July that while Clinton and her staff had been “extremely careless” in handling classified information, there were no grounds for any charges.Comey has said he released more information about the investigation than is typical because of election year sensitivities.“If Director Comey was so concerned about how information would be handled and about the reputation of the FBI, why did he release this letter that was full of innuendo and absolutely no facts?” Mook said on CNN, referring to Comey’s letter to members of Congress on Friday.The New York Times also assailed Comey, accusing him in an editorial in its Tuesday edition of sending “a brief, inscrutable, election-shaking letter” in a “breathtakingly rash and irresponsible decision.” The FBI announcement 11 days before the Nov. 8 presidential election blindsided Clinton, who had extended her lead over Trump in opinion polls after the release last month of a 2005 video in which the Republican bragged in vulgar terms about groping women.Opinion polls show Clinton’s lead has narrowed slightly since early last week. It was not known if the email controversy would hurt her support.Clinton held a 5-point lead over Trump in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, supported by 44 percent of likely voters, compared with Trump at 39 percent.(Additional reporting by Susan Heavey and Doina Chiacu; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Frances Kerry and Jonathan Oatis)"
21,POLITICS,Black Voter Turnout So Far Is Not Good For Hillary Clinton,Natalie Jackson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-voter-turnout-north-carolina-ohio-florida_us_5818c782e4b0990edc33acfc,It's down in several key states.,2016-11-01,Republican efforts to stymie black voters may be working in North Carolina.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5818c871190000a502c303cd.jpeg?cache=2J9733o21C&ops=crop_0_14_2979_1778%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"With a week to go before Election Day, over 25 million Americans have already cast their ballots via early voting. If this year is similar to 2012, those early votes will be nearly 20 percent of the final turnout. So it could be a big deal that black voters aren’t opting for early voting as much as they did four years ago, especially in key swing states like Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.Low turnout among African-Americans could hurt Hillary Clinton. In most polls, more than 90 percent of black voters support her over Donald Trump.North Carolina is seeing fewer black voters casting their ballots early this year, The New York Times reports. They accounted for just 22 percent of early voters as of Monday, compared to 27.3 percent of early voters in 2012. Although there’s still a week left for that proportion to increase, the decline is concerning for Democrats, who expect to receive nearly all of those votes.Black voters were likely more enthusiastic about casting a ballot for President Barack Obama four years ago than for Clinton today, but that may not be the entire explanation. In North Carolina, Republican lawmakers and officials have engaged in a concerted effort to reduce turnout among African-Americans.A legal battle over early voting in the state led to a court order that polling places must be open the same number of days this year as in 2012, but the order didn’t specify how many polling places had to be open. So the state GOP chair urged local election boards, which are generally controlled by Republicans, to limit early voting opportunities in other ways.Another party official went even further, encouraging local Republican election officials to open only one polling place in their counties, The News & Observer reports. “We will never discourage anyone from voting but none of us have any obligation in any shape, form or fashion to do anything to help the Democrats win this election,” Garry Terry, the 1st Congressional District chairman for the state GOP, wrote in an email. “Left unchecked, they would have early voting sites at every large gathering place for Democrats.”These efforts have impacted turnout among black voters in North Carolina, according to Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida and voter turnout expert:Among the most conspicuous counties was Guilford (Greensboro), which had 16 in-person early voting locations for [the] duration of early voting in 2012, but opened only one for the first week [of early voting in 2016], and did not open its single office on either the first Saturday or Sunday. ... Guilford is a county that Obama won with 58% of the vote and about a third of its population is African-American. Add to this that Democrats prefer in-person early voting over mail balloting, [and] a partisan effect is expected from Guilford and other counties reducing the number of in-person early voting polling locations.The negative effects might not persist as more polling places are opened. McDonald noted in a HuffPost blog:Since the opening of all sixteen polling places [in Guilford County], from Thursday to Saturday, in-person early voting is running at a much higher clip, with 54,574 in-person early voters. During this same period in 2012, 24,312 people voted in-person. Many North Carolina counties will expand their in-person early voting polling locations the week before the election. ... In the past, the volume of early voting has increased as the election nears, so these actions to reduce turnout may not be entirely effective.It’s not just North Carolina, however, that is seeing reduced turnout among African-Americans. Lower numbers of black voters have been reported in Ohio and Florida as well.The news from Ohio looks more like 2008 than 2012, but with better numbers for Trump than for the Republican presidential nominees in those earlier contests. However, that report came before Sunday’s “souls to the polls” day, in which many black churches provide transportation to and from early voting locations after services.In Florida, black voter turnout is down from 25 percent at this point in 2012 to 16 percent now. However, Latino turnout is up ― as of Monday morning, it was already at 97 percent of the 2012 early voting total ― and more than 60 percent of that group is expected to vote for Clinton.All of this makes for a very uncertain picture of how early voting will affect the election’s outcome. But one thing has been clear all along: Clinton needs black voters in these swing states ― and Republicans know it.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Fort Lee, New Jersey, police accused Familia, identified as Jeurys F. Mojica, of causing “bodily injury to another,” according to a complaint posted Tuesday by The Record. The victim, whose name is redacted from the complaint, had “visible injuries, specifically a scratch to the chest and bruise to the right cheek.”Familia, 27, was arrested after an officer who responded to the incident “found probable cause to believe domestic violence had occurred,” the complaint states. The athlete was charged with simple assault, and bail was set at $1,500. In a statement to The Record, the Mets said, “The matter was brought to our attention and we are monitoring the situation.”Familia was among a number of athletes who recently starred in an ad campaign sponsored by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.In the video below, Familia, a native of the Dominican Republic, says in Spanish that he’s “not a fan” of domestic violence.New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito helped launch the #NotAFan campaign, which also features Yankees manager Joe Girardi, former New York Knicks star John Starks, New York Liberty rising star Kiah Stokes, hockey Hall of Famer Rod Gilbert, and others. Mark-Viverito said Tuesday that she was “deeply disturbed by the allegations” against Familia and called on Major League Baseball to conduct a thorough investigation. “We created #NotAFan so fans can communicate that domestic violence is absolutely unacceptable and to give a voice to fans who didn’t have one before. I will be reaching out to the Mets and the Familia ads will be removed from the campaign,” Mark-Viverito said in a statement.Familia’s photos were indeed gone from the campaign website on Tuesday.The pitcher signed with the Mets in 2007 and made $4.1 million this season, according to MLB.com. In August of last year, MLB announced a new domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy. Since then, three players have been suspended.On Halloween 2015, then-Colorado Rockies shortstop José Reyes was arrested in Hawaii after allegedly assaulting his wife, Katherine Ramirez. The domestic abuse charge was eventually dropped. Still, MLB suspended the infielder 51 games without pay. Reyes has since signed with the Mets. Aroldis Chapman, now a closing pitcher for the Chicago Cubs, received a 30-day suspension in March following an October 2015 incident in which he reportedly hit and choked girlfriend Cristina Barnea in his home before firing off eight gunshots in the garage. And in May, Atlanta Braves outfielder Hector Olivera received an 82-game suspension after he was arrested in April at a hotel outside of Washington, D.C., and charged with assault and battery of a woman.Need help?

She performed on stage alongside Carol Konka, one of Brazil’s leading female rap artists and instantly became an international sensation.Asked by a fellow performer shortly before going on stage what it meant to be part of such a big event, she said: “I’ll be representing all the black kids from the outskirts who can’t be here talking, I’ll be their voice.”Within minutes of appearing on stage, photos of her performing were splashed across Twitter and other social networking sites, while several international papers declared her the star of the show.For a country that has struggled with racism, it was a powerful moment brought about by a young girl who says her music is inspired by her experiences of being bullied growing up.Afro-Brazilians make up 53 percent of the country’s population, a total of about 106 million individuals. It is the world’s largest black population outside Africa and the second largest after Nigeria. According to UNICEF, black Brazilians aged 12 to 18 are nearly three times more likely to get killed than their white counterparts.MC Soffia, whose real name is Soffia Gomes da Rocha Gregório Correa, began rapping when she was in primary school.“My mother took me to a hip-hop workshop when I was six,” she says. “When I started singing, I wanted to make rap music because it helps you say how you are feeling, what you’re seeing and what is happening.”Her lyrics are mix of childish ideas and powerful political messages. In one song called Menina Pretinha – “little black girl” in Portuguese – she sings: “Barbie is cool but I like Makena [black dolls made by Lucia Makena] best.”The song, about a fairytale princess with dreadlocks, continues: “Exotic doesn’t mean beautiful; you’re not cute, you’re a queen.”Her no-nonsense attitude reflects a new generation of young black girls in Brazil who are being raised to feel more confident, and to fight racism, from an early age.“I don’t want children born today to suffer in the way I have suffered,” she says. “I was a victim of racist bullying. I didn’t do anything about it [at the time] but now my school has an anti-bullying group, where we discuss this kind of thing.”Her message to young black girls is simple. “The first thing you need to do is to accept yourself, to love yourself,” she says, adding that girls need to stand up for themselves when people criticise them or say things mean about their appearance. When someone mocks her hair, she says she always knows what to say: “My hair is not kinky, it is coily [sic],” she says. “Kinky is your prejudice.”While she says most of the time her life is like any other young schoolgirl – she plays with her friends and hangs out at her dad’s or her aunt’s house on weekends – she also sometimes gets stopped in the street by fans.“When I am walking downtown, usually someone stops me to say things like, ‘you influenced my daughter,’ or ‘you inspired my niece.’” Young girls also come to her gigs and tell her how much she influences them.MC Soffia’s own influences include Willow Smith and Beyonce. She says she wants to be that famous, too, one day.Speaking about her Olympic performance, she says she was nervous before going on stage, but Carol Konka joked around with her, helping to keep her calm.“The moment I started singing, I didn’t see anyone anymore.”MC Soffia also credits Carol Konka and other rappers with helping her fight sexism in the music industry and rise as a star.“When a woman suffers, we all suffer together and the rap scene is very prejudiced,” she says. “When I began singing, no one helped me. Only Criolo [a Brazilian rapper], he gave me a microphone as a gift. But now [that I’m well-known] I think I have earned their respect.”In order to capitalize on her fame and newfound respect among Brazil’s more mature rappers, MC Soffia says she plans to release a new single and video soon.“Her career is on the rise,” Kamilah Pimentel, MC Soffia’s mother, told Women & Girls Hub. “We expect even bigger visibility after the release of the new clip, [which] will talk about the empowerment of black children.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

24,POLITICS,Congressman Trolls Obama Administration Over Yemen Waffling,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congressman-trolls-obama-administration-over-yemen-waffling_us_5818df9ce4b0f96eba96495d,Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) thinks it's silly to simultaneously call for an end to Saudi-led bombing and enable it to continue.,2016-11-01,U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power (left) on Monday called for an end to Saudi-led strikes on Yemen.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A lawmaker critical of the United States’ role in enabling mass slaughter in Yemen is using an Obama aide’s statements to highlight problems with the administration’s narrative of the war.After Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, urged the Saudis and their Iran-backed opponents, the Houthis, to stop fighting, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) issued a statement on Tuesday saying Power was on the right track.“I commend U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power for calling for an end to airstrikes by the Saudi-led military coalition (which includes the United States) in Yemen,” Lieu said.“The logical consequence of this apparent change in U.S. policy is that our nation must stop aiding and abetting the military coalition by pulling out of the coalition immediately,” he added. “The U.S. must stop refueling Saudi jets that have struck civilian targets over 70 times in Yemen; stop transferring vast amounts of arms to the Saudi military; and demand an independent investigation into allegations that multiple war crimes have been committed against Yemeni women, men and children by the Saudi-led coalition.” Washington is not actually changing its policy, officials were quick to clarify after Power made her remarks Monday at a U.N. Security Council meeting.But Lieu’s statement underscored how ludicrous it can sound for the U.S. to both call for strikes to end and keep enabling them with refueling, logistical support and weapons sales. Power’s critique of the Saudis seemed unusually direct, but it matches the Obama administration’s broader approach to the coalition’s missteps: be loudly critical without actually doing anything to stop them. U.S. officials regularly call for an end to the U.S.-supported airstrikes. They say they want both the coalition and the Houthis to commit to ceasing hostilities, and they were deeply invested in a 72-hour pause in fighting last month.The U.S. won’t pressure the Saudi-led coalition to stop fighting until both sides lay down their arms, officials say. Forcing this to happen would only encourage provocations by the Houthis and anti-Saudi forces loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, they argue. They worry about missile strikes across Yemen’s border with Saudi Arabia or further Houthi advances in contested areas that would increase tensions.Administration officials want more attention to be paid to their efforts to make the Houthis and the pro-Saudi Yemeni government agree to U.N. peace proposals. Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, Yemen’s internationally recognized president, rejected the latest U.N. plan, arguing that it ignores his electoral mandate and gives too much power to the rebels, whose controversial move into the Yemeni capital in 2014 sparked the latest crisis.Observers like Lieu challenge this logic. They believe the only way for the U.S. to show that it is serious in seeking peace is for the government to stop supporting the coalition. Human rights groups agree. And experts say that if the U.S. were to cut its assistance, it could instantly slash the coalition’s ability to kill Yemenis and achieve the kind of de-escalation of violence that Obama administration officials say they want. A funeral strike that killed 140 people on Oct. 8 prompted the administration to review its involvement in the war, according to White House spokespeople. However, a Huffington Post investigation found that there is almost no evidence that President Barack Obama is serious about reassessing the role of the U.S. there. As the review continues, so does the bombing: 60 people died Saturday in a strike by the U.S.-backed coalition.Lieu’s statement suggested that the war’s critics are becoming increasingly aggressive in holding the Obama administration directly responsible for the more than 10,000 deaths in Yemen since the full-on fighting started last March. Speaking of the U.S. as a member of the Saudi-led coalition represents a break from previous rhetoric from the congressman and other lawmakers. Even as they have blasted U.S. assistance for the coalition, they have mostly stayed loyal to the Obama administration’s argument that the president has not forced the U.S. to become a combatant in the conflict. Denying combatant status is one way the administration has tried to distance itself from the scores of war crimes allegedly carried out by the coalition. But Lieu, a former military lawyer, has already argued that U.S. officials may be liable to international prosecution and investigations over those apparent violations of international law ― and a Reuters investigation found that some Obama administration lawyers felt similarly. Three laws that regulate when the U.S. can provide security assistance to foreign governments already require the Obama administration to stop helping the coalition until its excesses can be investigated, the American Bar Association has said. While less well-known than the war in Syria, the Yemen conflict is fast becoming one of the most urgent humanitarian crises in the world. The country is now “one step away from famine,” the U.N.’s humanitarian chief said Monday. "

Top-dollar tickets include a “photo-op with dignitaries.”It’s customary for diplomats to avoid being associated with partisan or extremist groups. But the Center for Security Policy, founded by Frank Gaffney, openly espouses far-right, anti-Islam views. On Tuesday, for example, Gaffney tweeted a conspiratorial YouTube video accusing Huma Abedin, a Clinton aide, of having connections to a Saudi financier of al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood. The video is “absolutely required viewing,” Gaffney wrote in his blog on the Center for Security Policy website. Over the years, Gaffney has posited that President Barack Obama might be a Muslim, the Council on American-Islamic Relations is linked to Hamas, Muslim members of Congress shouldn’t be given access to classified information, and white nationalist Jared Taylor’s website is “wonderful.”Gaffney’s Islamophobic conspiracy theorizing has endeared him to several 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls, some of whom borrowed his ideas during their primary races. GOP nominee Donald Trump cited as justification for his proposed Muslim ban a bogus survey Gaffney produced, which claimed to show American Muslims were willing to use violence against other Americans and were eager to be governed by Sharia law. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) appointed Gaffney to his team of national security advisers before ending his presidential campaign.The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, warned that Dermer’s acceptance of the award, “not only further legitimizes this organization, but could be read as an endorsement of anti-Muslim hate by the Israeli government.” A spokesman for the Israeli embassy rejected the law center’s suggestion. “Accepting this award does not mean that the ambassador subscribes to every point of view expressed by individual members of the center, as would be true of any other organization,” spokesman Itai Bar Dov said. Dermer hosts an annual Iftar dinner and has made clear in past speeches that “Islam is not the enemy,” Bar Dov added. Dermer will share the Freedom Flame award with Morton Klein, head of the Zionist Organization of America. Both men campaigned aggressively against the Iran nuclear deal, a diplomatic agreement that the Obama administration considers one of its biggest foreign policy accomplishments. During the height of nuclear negotiations between the U.S., Iran, and five other world powers, Dermer organized for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to deliver a speech before Congress, urging members to buck the U.S. president and block the agreement. The speech marked a low point in an already strained U.S.-Israeli relationship. Dermer told The Jerusalem Post earlier this year that the speech marked the “highlight” of his tenure in Washington. "
26,MEDIA,CNN Chief Jeff Zucker Rips Donna Brazile's 'Disgusting' Dealings With Clinton Campaign,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cnn-donna-brazile-jeff-zucker_us_58189c8de4b064e1b4b4ba02,Network boss has “no tolerance” for tipping off a campaign with debate questions.,2016-11-01,"Jeff Zucker ripped former pundit Donna Brazile's ""unethical"" dealings with the Clinton campaign.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58189db5190000a502c302e0.jpeg?cache=5b4bxYKXxS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― CNN president Jeff Zucker described former network commentator Donna Brazile’s interactions with the Clinton campaign as “unethical” and “disgusting” during a Tuesday editorial meeting, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.Zucker’s remarks followed reports Monday that Brazile informed Hillary Clinton’s campaign in March about a question they could expect at a Democratic primary debate the following night against Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. This was the second time last month that hacked emails published by Wikileaks appeared to show Brazile tipping off the Clinton campaign with a possible CNN debate or town hall question.Brazile, a longtime Democratic strategist and TV pundit, served as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee through much of the 2016 election. In July, she became interim DNC chair after Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) resigned because emails published by Wikileaks showed party officials supporting Clinton’s candidacy even though the organization was supposed to remain neutral during the primary. CNN suspended Brazile’s contract at the time, but it was expected she’d return to the network after the permanent selection of a DNC chair following the election. But WikiLeaks published an email on Oct. 11 in which Brazile appeared to send the Clinton campaign a question on the death penalty ahead of a March town hall event. “From time to time I get the questions in advance,” she wrote to campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri. The email is one of thousands leaked from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The Clinton campaign has accused Russian hackers of targeting Podesta, though has not authenticated the documents being published by Wikileaks.Networks hosting presidential debates take great pride in maintaining a cone of silence around their preparation and it’s almost unheard of for a question to reach a campaign ― never mind twice.On Tuesday’s call, Zucker said the perception campaigns could receive questions in advance “hurts all of us,” according to a source. “I have no tolerance for her behavior or that kind of behavior,” Zucker added, referring to Brazile. Zucker stressed on the call that CNN staffers working on the debates did not reveal any questions. CNN has previously said the network did not give Brazile any questions and suggested TV One host Roland Martin ― who co-moderated the March debate with CNN’s Jake Tapper ― or someone close to Martin provided the question in advance to Brazile.In that first instance, Zucker reiterated Tuesday they believe the town hall question came from the TV One side, a view that’s supported by email correspondence reported by Politico.A CNN spokeswoman declined to comment Tuesday on Zucker’s remarks. In the second instance, revealed Monday, Brazile may have learned of a possible question when she met a woman at a CNN volunteer event in Flint, Michigan, just before the debate. Brazile mentioned participating in a service project in a March 5 email to the Clinton campaign and said “a woman with a rash” would be asking Clinton a question the next night.“Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint,” read the email found in Podesta’s account.The next night, during the March 6 debate, Flint resident Lee-Anne Walters said her children had been poisoned by lead and asked how Clinton and Sanders would handle the crisis. It’s unclear if Walters was the same woman mentioned by Brazile. Walters told The Huffington Post on Monday that she did not recall speaking to Brazile, but provided three questions to someone else at CNN. On Monday, CNN announced Brazile resigned on Oct. 14 ― three days after the first email surfaced ― and reiterated that the network hadn’t provided her with questions. “CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate,” a spokeswoman said Monday. “We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.”On Monday, Brazile referred questions back to her Oct. 11 statement in which she said that “as it pertains to the CNN Debates, I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did.”The revelations that Brazile tipped off the Clinton campaign has drawn attention to the common practice of networks hiring partisan operatives whose loyalties may be more to their parties or desired candidates than the audience.CNN has faced criticism in recent months for hiring Corey Lewandowski, who was fired in June as Donald Trump’s former campaign manager but was receiving severance payments while working for the network and continues to travel with the GOP nominee to events.Arthur Delaney contributed reporting."

That total is less than the attendance for some papal ceremonies in Rome.“A decade or so ago, people were even uneasy about wearing crosses, having to explain to Swedes who did not understand,” Josephine Kabogoza-Muksoke, a Ugandan-born Catholic, said as the pope drove by in a golf cart around Malmo stadium.“That isn’t so now. Catholics have more confidence and there are more of us - thanks to immigration.”ACCEPTANCE AND CRITICISM OF IMMIGRATIONThousands of Swedes, many immigrants from Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, had lined up outside the stadium in cold autumn rain.Sweden took in 163,000 asylum seekers last year, more than any other European Union state relative to population. Its reputation for tolerance and stability have made it a haven for refugees for decades.Polls say Sweden is one of the world’s most irreligious nations.

Savior of Saint Bridget of Sweden are seen as Pope Francis arrives to leads a Holy Mass at the Swedbank Stadion in Malmo, Sweden, Nov. 1.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5818f62b190000a502c3049c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pope Francis celebrated Mass on Tuesday for Sweden’s tiny Catholic community, made up of many refugees and migrants, praising as “blessed” those in this overwhelmingly non-religious nation who take in asylum seekers.The main purpose of the pope’s two-day trip was to take part in a joint commemoration with Lutherans of the 500th anniversary of the start of the Reformation.After the historic inter-religious ceremony on Monday, Francis turned his attention to largely secular Sweden’s record of accepting tens of thousands of asylum seekers last year, in contrast to many other European nations.In a football stadium packed with some 15,000 spectators, Francis weaved his homily around Jesus’ “Sermon on the Mount,” which lists the Beatitudes, but added a few modern twists.“Blessed are those who look into the eyes of the abandoned and marginalized and show them their closeness,” the Argentine-born pontiff said. “Blessed are those who renounce their own comfort in order to help others.”Francis’s statement held special symbolism in Malmo, which has become a gateway for thousands of immigrants who have fled from Middle East wars over the last few years.The Mass was also a shot in the arm to Sweden’s small Catholic community, which numbers only about 150,000 out of a population of about 10 million. That total is less than the attendance for some papal ceremonies in Rome.“A decade or so ago, people were even uneasy about wearing crosses, having to explain to Swedes who did not understand,” Josephine Kabogoza-Muksoke, a Ugandan-born Catholic, said as the pope drove by in a golf cart around Malmo stadium.“That isn’t so now. Catholics have more confidence and there are more of us - thanks to immigration.”ACCEPTANCE AND CRITICISM OF IMMIGRATIONThousands of Swedes, many immigrants from Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, had lined up outside the stadium in cold autumn rain.Sweden took in 163,000 asylum seekers last year, more than any other European Union state relative to population. Its reputation for tolerance and stability have made it a haven for refugees for decades.Polls say Sweden is one of the world’s most irreligious nations.

Special forces units sweeping in from the east have made fastest progress.“We are currently fighting battles on the eastern outskirts of Mosul,” CTS Lieutenant-General Abdul Wahab al-Saidi said. “The pressure is on all sides of the city to facilitate entry to the city center.”He said CTS forces had cleared Islamic State fighters from most of the eastern district of Kokjali, close to al-Quds, on Tuesday, “so now we are inside the district of Mosul”.Blackish grey smoke hung in the air east of the Islamists’ stronghold and the regular sound of outgoing artillery fire could be heard, said a Reuters reporter near Bazwaia, about five km (three miles) east of Mosul.Inside the city, residents speaking to Reuters by telephone said they heard the sounds of heavy clashes since dawn.One inhabitant of al-Quds district at the city’s eastern entrance said bullets were fizzing past and hitting the walls of houses, describing the explosions as “deafening and frightening”. Many people in the area have stayed indoors for the last two days.“We can see Daesh (Islamic State) fighters firing towards the Iraqi forces and moving in cars between the alleys of the neighborhood. It’s street fighting.”One witness said he saw nine cars, laden with families and furniture, heading from the eastern half of the to the west bank of the Tigris River to escape the encroaching frontline.Away from the eastern fringe of the city, however, traffic was relatively normal, markets were open, and Islamic State fighters were patrolling as usual. “CHOP THE SNAKE’S HEAD”Mosul is many times bigger than any other city held by Islamic State in Iraq or Syria. Its recapture would mark the collapse of the Iraqi wing of the caliphate which it declared in parts of both countries two years ago, although the hardline Sunni militants have recovered from other setbacks in Iraq.Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Monday that Iraqi forces were trying to close off all escape routes for the several thousand Islamic State fighters inside Mosul.“God willing, we will chop off the snake’s head,” Abadi, wearing military fatigues, told state television. “They have no escape, they either die or surrender.”Commanders have warned that the fight for Mosul, which could be the toughest of the decade-long turmoil since the U.S. invasion which overthrew Saddam Hussein in 2003, is likely to last for months.The United Nations has said the Mosul offensive could also trigger a humanitarian crisis and a possible refugee exodus if the civilians inside in Mosul seek to escape, with up to 1 million people fleeing in a worst-case scenario.The International Organisation for Migration said that nearly 18,000 people have been displaced since the start of the campaign on Oct. 17, excluding thousands of villagers who were forced back into Mosul by retreating jihadists who used them as human shields.U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said Islamic State fighters tried to force another 25,000 civilians from a town south of Mosul back toward the city on Monday. Most of the trucks carrying them turned back under pressure from patrolling aircraft, she said.Not all those heading back were doing so under duress from the militants, according to Mosul residents who said people were streaming in from the south as military operations edged closer to the city.Most came without any belongings, though some brought sheep and a few camels into the city, they said.In Bazwaia, CTS guards told Reuters that a suicide car bomber tried to attack their position early on Tuesday, but they halted it with machinegun fire. Rubble and parts of the attacker’s body could still be seen by a nearby berm.As well as the suicide attacks, the Islamic State militants have slowed the army’s advance with snipers, mortar fire, roadside bombs and booby traps inside abandoned buildings.In Bazwaia, recaptured by Iraqi troops a day earlier, about a dozen civilians could be seen coming out of the village, waving white flags and bringing with them their livestock ― about 200 sheep and a few cows and donkeys.Saidi, the CTS officer, said 500 civilians had already been moved from Bazwaia to a camp for displaced people further away from the frontline.“We expect to encounter more civilians as we push through the city,” he said."

That’s much higher than in 2012, when $500,000-plus donors had given $444 million at this point in the campaign. This year’s $1 billion total even exceeds the combined amount of all soft-money donations to political parties from 1999 until they were banned in 2002.Surging super PAC spending by the rich shows how the wealthiest Americans are exploiting looser campaign finance laws to expand their political power. More than three-quarters of the $1 billion raised from high-dollar donors in this year’s election comes from very wealthy individuals. Among their ranks are 90 billionaires whose super PAC contributions total $562 million ― more than half of the total. (The $1 billion total does not include contributions from super PACs to other super PACs. Further, not every penny of these mega-donors’ contributions will be spent on federal elections.)As income inequality has surged over the past three decades, the rich ― those from old-money dynasties and those with fresh fortunes ― have found ways to plow vast sums into the political arena, often in support of policies and candidates that would aid the interests of themselves and their ilk. They’ve been aided by a Supreme Court that has been loosening campaign finance restrictions since Justice Sandra Day O’Connor retired and was replaced by Justice Samuel Alito in 2006.The 2010 Citizens United decision had the most important impact on loosening restrictions to favor the rich. That ruling allowed corporations and labor unions to spend unlimited sums of money on elections, so long as they remained independent from the candidates they support. A subsequent lower court ruling applied the legal concept to individuals. The Federal Election Commission then allowed for the creation of independent expenditure-only PACs (dubbed super PACs by the reporter Eliza Newlin-Carney) for the super rich to pool their unlimited contributions to spend on elections.Almost every politician has directly embraced super PACs as a necessary tool to raise and spend money and to maintain connections to wealthy donors. Candidates staff their own super PACs and often work directly with them. Party leadership in both the House and Senate operate super PACs to centralize unlimited fundraising and help elect their own members.These groups have almost entirely replaced the unlimited soft money that was banned by the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law. The main difference between the soft money regime and super PACs is that some of the super PAC money is controlled by the donors themselves, or splinter factions, and not entirely controlled by the party.Both parties in this year’s election are benefitting, with money from mega-donors almost evenly split. Republican donors giving $500,000 or more have provided $488 million. Democratic mega-donors have given $479 million. An additional $44 million has been given by donors supporting Libertarian Gary Johnson for president, or those whose contributions are divided between the two major parties.This near-parity between the two major parties is a major shift from previous elections. In the 2012 election, Republicans had received 61 percent of mega-donor giving at this point in the campaign. In this year’s election, Republicans had raised $295 million from billionaires, compared with Democrats’ $245 million. Republicans had received $398 million from all wealthy mega-donors and the companies they control, compared with $331 million for Democrats. Among the 10 largest super PAC donors, nine are familiar to the world of big-money politics. The top 10 donors include billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer ($66.2 million), billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam ($52.9 million), hedge fund billionaire S. Donald Sussman ($37.2 million), NewsWeb Corp. chairman Fred Eychaner ($32.1 million), Facebook billionaire Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna ($22 million), hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer ($21.6 million), former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg ($21.2 million), and the Service Employees International Union ($19 million).Moskovitz and Tuna are newcomers to the list of top super PAC donors. In a post on Medium titled “Compelled to Act,” Moskovitz explained that he would put $20 million into a range of super PACs to defeat Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. He has donated to a number of super PACs supporting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, including For Our Future PAC, League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund, Color of Change PAC and MoveOn.Org Political Action. Moskovitz also is the main funder of the Republicans for Clinton super PAC, though he has only supported Democrats for election.Labor unions giving more than $500,000 spent $132 million on super PACs, with nearly all of that money going to help Democrats.The largest corporate donors all were pro-Republican. The Starr Companies, an insurance and investment organization owned by former AIG chief executive Maurice Greenberg, gave more $14 million, billionaire Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries Inc. gave $4.3 million, Besilu Stables LLC, owned by billionaire Benjamin Leon, gave $3.5 million, oil behemoth Chevron gave $3 million and Petrodome Energy, an oil and gas company in Texas, gave $3 million. There are no corporate super PAC donors giving $500,000 or more that have donated solely to Democrats. The U.S. Sugar Corp. is the only company that has given $500,000 or more to super PACs and donated to support Democrats. The Florida-based sugar company donated $75,000 to Senate Majority PAC, which is closely connected to Sens. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and works to elect Democrats to the Senate.Nonprofits and trade associations, which do not have to disclose their donors, are also among the ranks of super PAC mega-donors. The largest such donor is One Nation, the nonprofit arm of Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely connected to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). One Nation donated $11 million to Senate Leadership Fund ― the largest donation from a dark money nonprofit to a super PAC ever.Most of these dark money donations went to support Republicans. Aside from the One Nation donation, the non-disclosing Freedom Frontier donated $4.7 million, American Policy Coalition gave $2.3 million and FreedomVote gave $2 million.Nonprofits and trade associations donating to Democratic super PACs include Environment America Inc. with $3.7 million; Greater New York Hospital Association, $2 million; Civic Participation Action Fund, $1.5 million; and Majority Forward, more than $1 million.Donations from mega-donors are likely to increase in the final days of the campaign, as the parties fight for control of the White House and Congress.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

This year, the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement -- Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi -- will be honored for their tireless activism, highlighting the issue of police brutality in America.After George Zimmeran was found not guilty of the murder of Trayvon Martin in 2013, Garza shared a status on Facebook to express her feelings about the verdict, writing: “Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.” After Patrisse Cullors shared Garza's post, adding the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, Tometi reached out to them to create a digital platform to keep the conversation and the movement going. Today, ""Black Lives Matter"" has become a rallying cry against police brutality and other realities of systemic racism in America. Beyond a hashtag, the movement has sparked demonstrations and other activist events all over the country. “We gave tongue to something that we all knew was happening,” Tometi told Glamour of the three activists’ work.“We were courageous enough to call it what it was. But more than that, to offer an alternative. An aspirational message: Black lives matter.”Other black women honored on the list are Olympic gymnast Simone Biles and actress Zendaya.The entire group of honorees, which also includes Miuccia Prada and model Ashley Graham, will be honored at a special awards ceremony in Los Angeles on November 14.

37,POLITICS,Democrats Shouldn't Panic Over One Poll Showing Donald Trump Ahead,Natalie Jackson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-donald-trump-ahead_us_58190572e4b07c97c1c50525,"Hillary Clinton still has a strong advantage in the Electoral College, but her supporters need to vote if she's going to win.",2016-11-01,The HuffPost presidential forecast shows that Donald Trump only has a 1.8 percent chance of winning.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581909c1170000c3045bb165.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The ABC News/Washington Post national tracking poll shows Republican nominee Donald Trump closing the gap on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Over just 8 days, the poll went from a 50-38 strong Clinton lead to an insignificant 46-45 Trump lead as the presidential election approaches.That poll is the most extreme example, but over the last week, Republicans are returning to their prior levels of support for Trump after a lackluster month. Much of that movement in the polls, including the spread in the ABC/Washington Post poll, occurred before FBI director James Comey’s announcement that the bureau is looking into more emails that could be related to Clinton’s private email use while she was secretary of state. The FBI investigation doesn’t seem to have affected views of Clinton, but there’s evidence that it could have taken a toll on enthusiasm to vote for her. Those two trends have a lot of Democrats on edge and some Republicans getting more hopeful. But a closer look at the polls, predictions and campaigns indicates that Clinton is still likely to prevail. The ABC/Washington Post poll is a high-quality poll, but it’s the only one showing such a dramatic change in the last week. It’s very unlikely that voter preferences have changed by 13 points in 8 days. For example, the IBD/TIPP tracking poll, which favored Trump in its debut, has held steady, with Clinton leading by 1-4 points over the past week. All other national polls in the past week have shown Clinton leading by 1-7 points.The HuffPost presidential forecast gives Clinton a 98 percent chance of winning. That runs counter to the narrative that polls are closing in and is very different from other forecast models ― most notably the 71 percent probability she has in FiveThirtyEight’s model.One reason for that is the HuffPost model relies almost entirely on state-level polling data, which shows Trump still has a huge Electoral College deficit, rather than national-level data.State polls show that Clinton is maintaining her lead in the key states she needs to win: Colorado (+5 points), New Hampshire (+5 points), Wisconsin (+6 points), Pennsylvania (+6 points) and Michigan (+7 points). Those five states, plus all of the Democratic strongholds, get her to 273 electoral votes. Clinton also narrowly carries North Carolina (+2 points), Florida (+2 points), Ohio (+1) and Nevada (+2). That’s a total of 341 electoral votes ― more than Barack Obama’s 332 in 2012, but less than the 365 he garnered in 2008. Trump, on the other hand, faces a steep uphill battle. He only has 164 electoral votes from states he leads by more than 5 percentage points, plus another 33 from Georgia, Arizona and Iowa, where he has a narrower lead. That’s still only 197 electoral votes. He needs to turn 73 votes over in order to win ― no small task.Trump’s most likely path to victory would be through Nevada, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and either Colorado or New Hampshire ― states he has the best chances of flipping. If he loses Florida, there’s not much that will save him. In that case, he’d need Nevada, Ohio, North Carolina, Colorado and New Hampshire, plus both Wisconsin and Michigan or Pennsylvania. Trump only has a more than 10 percent chance of winning two of those states: Ohio and Nevada. Unless all the polls are wrong, there’s not much of a possibility that he’ll pull an upset. That still leaves the matter of the national polls closing in, though. National polls do provide a good indicator of the state of the race, even though the election happens in the individual states. And since state polls are generally slower to come in than national polls, it’s possible that we could see some narrowing in the state polls as well. But if the state polls do close in to reflect the national poll movement, it probably won’t be enough to swing the race. Over the past week, Trump has gained about 1 percent in the HuffPost Pollster average, putting him just over 6 points behind Clinton in a head-to-head matchup and about 5.6 points behind her when third-party candidates are included. Even if he continues to gain, he’ll be behind on Election Day.Trump supporters should be very worried.Clinton supporters, meanwhile, should be concerned about get-out-the-vote efforts but remain calm. They should only get very worried if all the polls nationally and in swing states start tilting wildly toward Trump ― but short of a massive scandal much larger than other recent “October surprises,” that’s not likely to happen. Other forecast models, most notably FiveThirtyEight’s, show that Trump has more substantial odds of winning than the HuffPost forecast model shows. As Nate Silver wrote last week, the FiveThirtyEight model differs from other models in four ways, the most important being that it allows for higher probability that the polls are wrong and that all of the states would be wrong in the same direction.The possibility that polls could be wrong is factored into HuffPost’s model ― in fact, that assumption accounts for most of the 2 percent chance that Trump will prevail ― but not as aggressively.

38,POLITICS,Democrats Shouldn't Panic Over One Poll Showing Donald Trump Ahead,Natalie Jackson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-donald-trump-ahead_us_58190572e4b07c97c1c50525,"Hillary Clinton still has a strong advantage in the Electoral College, but her supporters need to vote if she's going to win.",2016-11-01,"The New York Times compares Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the presidency, according to different forecast models.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58190ade170000c3045bb16e.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The ABC News/Washington Post national tracking poll shows Republican nominee Donald Trump closing the gap on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Over just 8 days, the poll went from a 50-38 strong Clinton lead to an insignificant 46-45 Trump lead as the presidential election approaches.That poll is the most extreme example, but over the last week, Republicans are returning to their prior levels of support for Trump after a lackluster month. Much of that movement in the polls, including the spread in the ABC/Washington Post poll, occurred before FBI director James Comey’s announcement that the bureau is looking into more emails that could be related to Clinton’s private email use while she was secretary of state. The FBI investigation doesn’t seem to have affected views of Clinton, but there’s evidence that it could have taken a toll on enthusiasm to vote for her. Those two trends have a lot of Democrats on edge and some Republicans getting more hopeful. But a closer look at the polls, predictions and campaigns indicates that Clinton is still likely to prevail. The ABC/Washington Post poll is a high-quality poll, but it’s the only one showing such a dramatic change in the last week. It’s very unlikely that voter preferences have changed by 13 points in 8 days. For example, the IBD/TIPP tracking poll, which favored Trump in its debut, has held steady, with Clinton leading by 1-4 points over the past week. All other national polls in the past week have shown Clinton leading by 1-7 points.The HuffPost presidential forecast gives Clinton a 98 percent chance of winning. That runs counter to the narrative that polls are closing in and is very different from other forecast models ― most notably the 71 percent probability she has in FiveThirtyEight’s model.One reason for that is the HuffPost model relies almost entirely on state-level polling data, which shows Trump still has a huge Electoral College deficit, rather than national-level data.State polls show that Clinton is maintaining her lead in the key states she needs to win: Colorado (+5 points), New Hampshire (+5 points), Wisconsin (+6 points), Pennsylvania (+6 points) and Michigan (+7 points). Those five states, plus all of the Democratic strongholds, get her to 273 electoral votes. Clinton also narrowly carries North Carolina (+2 points), Florida (+2 points), Ohio (+1) and Nevada (+2). That’s a total of 341 electoral votes ― more than Barack Obama’s 332 in 2012, but less than the 365 he garnered in 2008. Trump, on the other hand, faces a steep uphill battle. He only has 164 electoral votes from states he leads by more than 5 percentage points, plus another 33 from Georgia, Arizona and Iowa, where he has a narrower lead. That’s still only 197 electoral votes. He needs to turn 73 votes over in order to win ― no small task.Trump’s most likely path to victory would be through Nevada, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and either Colorado or New Hampshire ― states he has the best chances of flipping. If he loses Florida, there’s not much that will save him. In that case, he’d need Nevada, Ohio, North Carolina, Colorado and New Hampshire, plus both Wisconsin and Michigan or Pennsylvania. Trump only has a more than 10 percent chance of winning two of those states: Ohio and Nevada. Unless all the polls are wrong, there’s not much of a possibility that he’ll pull an upset. That still leaves the matter of the national polls closing in, though. National polls do provide a good indicator of the state of the race, even though the election happens in the individual states. And since state polls are generally slower to come in than national polls, it’s possible that we could see some narrowing in the state polls as well. But if the state polls do close in to reflect the national poll movement, it probably won’t be enough to swing the race. Over the past week, Trump has gained about 1 percent in the HuffPost Pollster average, putting him just over 6 points behind Clinton in a head-to-head matchup and about 5.6 points behind her when third-party candidates are included. Even if he continues to gain, he’ll be behind on Election Day.Trump supporters should be very worried.Clinton supporters, meanwhile, should be concerned about get-out-the-vote efforts but remain calm. They should only get very worried if all the polls nationally and in swing states start tilting wildly toward Trump ― but short of a massive scandal much larger than other recent “October surprises,” that’s not likely to happen. Other forecast models, most notably FiveThirtyEight’s, show that Trump has more substantial odds of winning than the HuffPost forecast model shows. As Nate Silver wrote last week, the FiveThirtyEight model differs from other models in four ways, the most important being that it allows for higher probability that the polls are wrong and that all of the states would be wrong in the same direction.The possibility that polls could be wrong is factored into HuffPost’s model ― in fact, that assumption accounts for most of the 2 percent chance that Trump will prevail ― but not as aggressively. There’s always the possibility that FiveThirtyEight’s 71 percent chance of a Clinton win is closer to reality. But there’s just as much of a chance that we’re correct, and Clinton’s odds of winning are around 98 percent, even though that doesn’t make for much of a splashy headline right now. Either way, all models still point to a Clinton win, and ― more importantly ― the Electoral College is stacked in her favor. Democrats just need to vote.

39,SPORTS,The NCAA Is Really Not Going To Like This New Ben Simmons Doc,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-simmons-ncaa_us_5818ff76e4b0f96eba9681e2,"""The NCAA is really f**ked up,"" the former LSU Tiger says.",2016-11-01,"Ben Simmons has some very strong criticisms of the NCAA in ""One and Done.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58190145190000a502c304ba.jpeg?cache=VJPAap0K1p&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ben Simmons is done with the NCAA, in more ways than one.After one uneven season at Louisiana State University, the point forward prodigy has escaped to the NBA, where he was drafted as the No. 1 overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in June. Simmons’ lone year in the NCAA was mired in controversy, capped off in March when ESPN reported Simmons hadn’t met the academic requirements to win the Wooden Award, given to the best player in college basketball each year. His time at the school quickly soured his once-sterling reputation, and left NBA teams and fans alike whispering about issues related to maturity and dedication. But in “One and Done,” a new Showtime documentary about Simmons set to debut on Friday, the Australian-born phenomenon hopes to give his side of the story. And his side of the story is none too kind to the institution he felt forced to play under due to an NBA rule that requires athletes be 19 years old and one year removed from high school before they join the league. “The NCAA is really f**ked up,” Simmons reportedly says in the documentary, according to ESPN. “Everybody’s making money except the players. We’re the ones waking up early as hell to be the best teams and do everything they want us to do and then the players get nothing.”The trailer for Showtime’s “One and Done,” premiering Friday, Nov. 4Simmons apparently spends much of the documentary, created by Maura Mandt and Josh Swade, lambasting the NCAA for forcing him to do things that won’t benefit the players, but will benefit the people who control them. “Don’t say I’m an amateur and make me take pictures and sign stuff and go make hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars off one person,” he says at one point. While Simmons is exaggerating slightly when he says the NCAA is making “hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars” off him alone, the money-making capabilities of the organization are unambiguous. Earlier this year, the NCAA announced it had agreed to sell the rights to eight years’ worth of its March Madness basketball tournament for $8.8 billion. Any way you measure it, the NCAA is making big-time money off a system that provides its most valuable employees with a scholarship and little more.“I’m going off on the NCAA. Just wait, just wait,” Simmons says in the documentary. “I can be a voice for everybody in college.”“One and Done” premieres Friday on Showtime at 9 p.m. ET/PT."
40,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Is Left With One Option: Put The Heat On James Comey,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-james-comey_us_581783a3e4b0990edc32b03d,That doesn't mean it will work.,2016-10-31,Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) wrote a blistering letter to James Comey expressing disapproval of his letter to Congress on newly found emails that may or may not be pertinent to its investigation of Hillary Clinton.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton had not planned to spend the closing week of the year-and-a-half presidential election waging war with the director of the FBI. Yet, after James Comey vaguely announced the discovery of new emails that may or may not have been pertinent to its previous investigation into Clinton’s private email account, her campaign concluded it had no other option. As Donald Rumsfeld once said, you go to war with the army you have. In interviews with Democrats in and around the campaign since Comey’s announcement, The Huffington Post found that none second-guessed the decision to ratchet up the attacks on the FBI director for interjecting the bureau into an election so close to Election Day ― a move that breaks from Department of Justice precedent. Not only was the criticism morally justified, they argued, it was the only prudent political option.“I don’t think they have any choice but to go hard after him. If they didn’t do that, the story would be dictated by [Donald] Trump and the misleading attacks that he has launched off of it,” said Tad Devine, a top strategist to the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).Still, as the pressure on Comey heightened over the weekend, there was concern that the Clinton campaign’s reaction could boomerang in damaging ways. “They have a legitimate grievance in that Comey, in an apparent effort to protect his reputation and that of his bureau, intruded on the race in an awkward and potentially prejudicial way,” said David Axelrod, a longtime Barack Obama aide and CNN commentator. “But pushing it too far, by implying that he had the intent to put his finger on the scale, would be risky, particularly in light of their past, laudatory statements.”Clinton’s campaign against Comey comes with pitfalls. There is the risk of looking craven because, as Axelrod notes, people in and around the campaign praised the FBI director’s conduct in past moments. There is also the risk of elongating a story that the campaign would rather have go away entirely. (Democrats may be changing the subject from Clinton’s conduct to Comey’s, but the conversation still revolves around an FBI investigation.)And then there is the risk of blowback. One worry in Democratic circles is that the FBI will selectively leak information to justify the investigation, thereby producing a continuous drip of context-free stories. A Wall Street Journal item on Sunday, detailing the discovery of the potentially related emails on the computer shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her estranged husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), is seen as an illustration of what might happen when Comey comes under siege.“They didn’t have any choice but to go after Comey,” said Matthew Miller a former spokesman for the Department of Justice and a vocal critic of Comey. “What he did put them in a terrible situation in which there was no way for them to respond on the underlying substance because no one knows what it is. The FBI seems to be already retaliating with leaks, but based on their track record so far, they probably would’ve done that anyway.”Inside the Clinton campaign, these risks are appreciated. But they are underwhelming when placed alongside the other (non-existent) options. Comey’s letter on Friday left aides blindsided. Abedin, aides say, is unclear how her emails ended up on the computer, and even the FBI hadn’t been given access to review the emails when the letter was sent. Without the ability to point to exonerating evidence, the Clinton team felt the need to turn the saga into a process story.Part of the calculus was to rally Clinton’s base of voters, who otherwise would have been deflated by the latest email drama. But part of it was also a sense of aggrievement with how Comey handled matters.The campaign moved swiftly. After the Comey letter dropped on Friday, the Clinton team put out a statement from chairman John Podesta and had surrogates fan out on the airwaves. Saturday morning, it held a press briefing with Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook, this time calling more explicitly for more information from Comey about the case. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus held an event in Ohio to make a similar case. Clinton brought up the news on the stump. The campaign put out a video “fact-checking” the claims being made about the latest email revelations. And it blasted out op-eds critical of Comey, including one from his former boss, Attorney General Eric Holder.The biggest pushback came Sunday. The campaign organized a letter signed by former federal prosecutors criticizing Comey. Also, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) wrote a blistering letter to Comey, accusing him of violating the Hatch Act, suggesting he was sitting on information tying Trump to Russia, and arguing that he had violated the faith and trust of those lawmakers who had confirmed his nomination.“We’re not worried,” a Senate Democratic aide said of the collective pushback against Comey going too far. Asked if there was any hesitation in Reid writing Comey, the aide replied, “No.”Monday brought some indication that the Clinton campaign’s strategy was working. Several Republican officials, including ones comically critical of Clinton in the past, publicly questioned Comey’s decision. Alberto Gonzales, the attorney general under George W. Bush, called the FBI director’s decision “a mistake.” This proved, one Clinton aide argued, that all sides agreed that Comey’s “actions were an indisputable breach of protocol, especially given he didn’t know the facts behind these emails.”That is certainly optimistic spin at this point. Comey may well be under a harsh spotlight now. But it’s hard to see this playing out as a net positive for Clinton: Even if she were exonerated before the election, voters have absorbed the initial headlines and her critics will point to that exoneration as evidence of a system rigged against Trump. And should Comey say nothing at all until Nov. 8, then it is left to the voter to sort out the story between the initial letter and the subsequent leaks.But Clinton had no other option. You go to war with the army you have.“I think it is the only card they can play, but a bad hand nonetheless. Comey has mishandled this since July, but he isn’t dumb. He didn’t do this for fun. I doubt he is voting for Donald Trump, and he has a 10-year term,” said Anita Dunn, a longtime Democratic operative. “So not a great situation for us, and the polls were tightening before now. We need another debate!”"

44,POLITICS,Former AG Alberto Gonzales: James Comey Made A Mistake With Letter On Clinton Email Investigation,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alberto-gonzales-james-comey_us_58176a2ee4b064e1b4b38ed3,The FBI director has gotten a lot of heat for his decision.,2016-10-31,Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said James Comey's letter did not help the situation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58176e26150000b700530ce5.jpeg?cache=K2NxffHfUD&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Another former law enforcement official said on Monday that FBI Director James Comey may have erred in releasing a vague letter so close to the election on the investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s email practices. This time, it was former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who served under President George W. Bush. In 2007, Gonzales resigned amid controversy after firing eight U.S. attorneys for what Democrats said were political reasons. He told senators more than 50 times before his resignation that he could not recall details relevant to the dismissals. “It appears that this was an error,” Gonzales said on CNN Monday. “To throw out this kind of letter without more information, without really knowing what the facts are with respect to these additional e-mails, I think was a mistake.” The FBI is reviewing newly uncovered emails that may have some bearing on its investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information while using a private email server during her time as secretary of state, Comey told members of Congress on Friday. The emails reportedly came from a computer owned by former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), who is married to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, as part of an FBI investigation into his alleged sexting with a minor. In July, Comey announced that he would recommend to the Justice Department that “no charges are appropriate in this case,” although he also said Clinton and her staffers “were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.” Comey’s decision to announce the new development 11 days before the election was considered highly unusual, especially given the lack of clarity on whether the emails implicate Clinton in any way. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and other Republicans, who have criticized Comey for months because he did not recommend charges in July, leaped on the chance to condemn Clinton in spite of the relative lack of new information.Gonzales said Monday that although it “would be a stretch” to say Comey intended to influence the election, his decision might make a difference anyway. Comey and Gonzales briefly overlapped at the Justice Department. Gonzales became attorney general in early 2005, and Comey stepped down as deputy attorney general later that year.“Certainly in hindsight, it appears that that did not help the situation at all,” Gonzales said on MSNBC. “Quite frankly, it muddled the situation and obviously, it puts at risk this election. Some people, some voters are going to be making a decision on Election Day and in early voting about which way they’re going to go based upon this very incomplete letter that really doesn’t say anything other than there is a continuing investigation that may implicate Secretary Clinton.” Comey told FBI employees he wrote the letter out of an “abundance of caution.” He wrote in the letter that the FBI could not yet assess whether the material under review is actually significant. He also could not give a timeline for how long the review will take. Typically, the Justice Department does not announce investigations or take actions close to an election that could affect its outcome. Gonzales said Saturday on NPR’s “All Things Considered” that he was “a little surprised by Comey’s decision” to release the letter, although the entire investigation had been unusual. He declined at the time to second-guess the FBI director without having more information.“One other thing I can say is that the FBI director’s probably spent a great deal of pressure to go either way ― you know, to have said something, to not have said something,” Gonzales said on NPR. “And, you know, he made the decision this was the right way to go.”A number of people have called for the FBI to release more details, including members of the Clinton campaign itself.Dozens of former federal prosecutors signed an open letter spearheaded by the Clinton campaign that says Comey’s “unprecedented decision to publicly comment on evidence in what may be an ongoing inquiry just eleven days before a presidential election leaves us both astonished and perplexed.”“We do not question Director Comey’s motives,” reads the letter, which was released Sunday evening. “However, the fact remains that the Director’s disclosure has invited considerable, uninformed public speculation about the significance of newly-discovered material just days before a national election.”Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who served under President Barack Obama, signed that letter and penned a separate op-ed on the matter for The Washington Post. He said he was “deeply concerned” with Comey’s decision and that it “violated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition.”“These rules have been followed during Republican and Democratic administrations,” Holder wrote in the op-ed, published Sunday. “They aren’t designed to help any particular individual or to serve any political interest. Instead, they are intended to ensure that every investigation proceeds fairly and judiciously; to maintain the public trust in the department’s ability to do its job free of political influence; and to prevent investigations from unfairly or unintentionally casting public suspicion on public officials who have done nothing wrong.”"

Lyft drivers, in contrast, didn’t cancel on African-American riders. Researchers speculate that’s because the Uber app only shows a rider’s name and photo once they’ve accepted the trip, forcing drivers to cancel after they’ve already agreed to pick up the passenger. Lyft’s app contains more upfront information, meaning drivers can discriminate without needing to accept the trip first.Female passengers in Boston were also more likely to be taken on longer, more expensive routes than their male counterparts, sometimes while being flirted with.“Other female riders reported “chatty” drivers who drove extremely long routes, on some occasions even driving through the same intersection multiple times,” the report notes. Researchers believe this is a combination of drivers seeking higher profits, and also “flirting to a captive audience.”Fortunately, that doesn’t seem to be a systemic issue. Stephen M. Zoepf, the executive director for the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford and one of the study authors, told car blog Jalopnik the creepy profiteering “seems to be a few bad actors,” where “a few drivers were taking routes that were five-times as long as they should be.”Minority riders had similar experiences in Seattle, where African-American passengers endured “statistically significant” longer wait times for their UberX and Lyft trip requests to be accepted.The study also found similar issues in the traditional taxi industry, which has long struggled with racial discrimination.In Seattle, for instance, traditional taxi-cabs “stopped nearly 60 percent of the time for white [research assistants], but less than 20 percent of the time for African American [research assistants].” In emails to The Huffington Post, both Uber and Lyft made clear their apps are intended to facilitate rides for all, and that discriminatory drivers wouldn’t be tolerated.“We are extremely proud of the positive impact Lyft has on communities of color. Because of Lyft, people living in underserved areas - which taxis have historically neglected - are now able to access convenient, affordable rides,” Lyft’s Director of Policy Communications Adrian Durbin told HuffPost in a statement. “And we provide this service while maintaining an inclusive and welcoming community, and do not tolerate any form of discrimination.”That sentiment was echoed by Uber head of North American operations Rachel Holt, who noted the service should reduce inequities, not perpetuate them.“Ridesharing apps are changing a transportation status quo that has been unequal for generations, making it easier and more affordable for people to get around—no matter who they are or where they live,” Holt said in a statement. “Discrimination has no place in society, and no place on Uber.

That margin is just slightly below the lead Democrats held at the same point in 2012, when President Barack Obama ended up winning the state by 6.6 percent.Democrats actually increased their turnout lead by roughly 3,000 votes on Saturday, one day after FBI Director James Comey made headlines by releasing a controversial letter indicating his agency was again looking into Clinton’s email practices while she was secretary of state. Nevada is one of a small handful of swing states where polling aggregates show Clinton and GOP nominee Donald Trump currently within five points of one another, according to HuffPost Pollster.To understand the state’s importance, consider this: If Clinton wins Nevada, she could lose all of the other swing states ― Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, Arizona, Georgia ― and still win the presidency, assuming the non-battleground states do not shift.Democrats hold a 90,000-voter registration edge over Republicans in Nevada, and if current turnout trends continue, the state will be “almost impossible for Trump to win,” wrote Jon Ralston, an influential Nevada political reporter, on Sunday. Of course, it’s unknown who they’re actually voting for. But only considering voters’ registrations, Trump faces considerable odds, Ralston explains: [H]ere’s how daunting it is for Donald Trump right now in Nevada, with six days left in early/mail voting, which is usually 60 percent or so of all votes cast:Press reports have also noted a dramatic gap between the parties’ respective get-out-the-vote operations.On Saturday, for instance, reporters found that Democrats in Reno had six different staging areas for volunteers, each expected to draw over 100 people. On the same day, a visit to the city’s local Republican headquarters turned up just five people.Before Trump’s rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, speakers informed the estimated crowd of 8,000 that buses would be available to take them to early voting sites after the event. But reporters couldn’t easily find the buses.In the end, all they turned up were two vans that brought about 20 people to the polls.Democrats in the state say they’ve been thrilled with turnout operations thus far, and some Republicans acknowledged their party faces an uphill climb.“I think the Clinton campaign is far more organized,” a GOP consultant in Nevada, Tom Letizia, told McClatchy News. Republicans “are going to get their clock cleaned...based on what I’m seeing,” he said."

Labor unions and low-wage workers have sued, mocked and vilified the Golden Arches ever since workers first walked off the job in 2012 to protest poverty pay.So it’s no shock that the world’s most recognizable burger chain would have turned to outside consultants to help fight its high-stakes public-relations battle. But workers leading the Fight for $15 may have been surprised by exactly who helped out the company: a consulting firm with close ties to the Clinton family and the Democratic Party.As The New York Times reported last week, McDonald’s relied on Teneo Holdings to help craft its message around growing calls to raise its pay for workers. Fashioned as an advisory firm for CEOs, Teneo is stocked with powerful politicians and business executives who help corporations handle “reputational” risks. Former President Bill Clinton and longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin are among Teneo’s alumni. One of the firm’s co-founders, Douglas Band, was an adviser to Bill Clinton while he was in the White House; another, Declan Kelly, raised money for Hillary Clinton’s first presidential bid. Abedin’s stint at Teneo coincided with her work under Clinton at the State Department, a controversial arrangement that was rife with potential conflicts of interest.In short, Teneo offers corporate executives entree to major players in the Democratic orbit, at a price of up to $250,000 or more per month, according to Politico. As the Times reported, Chelsea Clinton complained in hacked emails released by WikiLeaks that Teneo consultants were “hustling” for work at the annual Clinton Global Initiative confab.In the case of McDonald’s, Teneo would have been helping the fast-food giant counter a labor cause that Democrats and Hillary Clinton herself have championed. It’s just the sort of relationship that progressives point to as evidence of establishment Democrats’ coziness with corporate America.Teneo and Band did not respond to a request for more information on the firm’s work for McDonald’s. Terri Hickey, a McDonald’s spokeswoman, said in an email that “Teneo previously assisted us broadly on corporate strategy and they no longer assist us.”The Fight for $15 has been organized and bankrolled by the 2 million-member Service Employees International Union. SEIU was one of the first labor unions to endorse Clinton for president, and it is spending millions of dollars trying to get her into the White House. Asked for comment on Teneo’s work for McDonald’s, SEIU provided a statement attributed to Chantoria Henderson, a 27-year-old McDonald’s worker from Richmond, Virginia, who earns $8.50 per hour. Henderson reserved all her criticism for McDonald’s.“It’s disappointing McDonald’s would spend big money on a consulting firm to keep wages low and hold back workers,” she said. “We are trying to lift up families, help people get ahead and strengthen communities. Instead of paying a consulting firm to fight against raises for hard working Americans, McDonald’s should do the right thing and just pay workers more.”Retaining Teneo would have made a lot of sense for McDonald’s. When SEIU launched the Fight for $15, the idea of a $15 minimum wage seemed preposterous. But four years later, the campaign has notched victories around the country, including a path to a $15 wage floor in several cities and the state of California. The protests have also helped compel McDonald’s to raise its baseline pay for workers in corporate-run locations. Still, the movement is a long way from winning $15 per hour for all workers. Republicans in Congress have not allowed a vote on a minimum wage bill, and even many Democrats have balked at the number at the core of the Fight for $15. That includes the likely occupier of the White House next year. Clinton has not supported a nationwide minimum wage of $15, instead embracing a $12 plan put forth by congressional Democrats."

In an op-ed published in The New York Times on Monday, former Richard Nixon counsel John Dean slammed attempts by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to paint investigations of his opponent’s private email server as a bigger disgrace than Watergate.The Watergate investigation implicated President Richard Nixon and several others for involvement in a 1972 break-in and robbery at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex, and its subsequent cover-up. The political scandal ultimately led to Nixon’s resignation and the imprisonment of dozens of Nixon insiders, including Dean.Trump’s ongoing efforts to equate Watergate with Clinton’s use of a private email server ― as he did at a rally on Friday when FBI Director James B. Comey announced that new emails had been found ― are “nonsense” and something that “only someone who knows nothing about the law” would put forth, Dean wrote in The Times.“Whatever mistakes Mrs. Clinton made, her actions bear no similarities whatsoever to Nixon’s criminalization of his presidency, and his efforts to corrupt much of the executive branch,” Dean said.The federal investigation of Clinton’s emails found that she, like many other politicians, did not fully grasp the security risks of using her old email account when she entered the executive branch ― but also found no criminal intent in her actions. The Watergate investigation, Dean wrote, revealed that Nixon had a hand in “other illegal break-ins and burglaries; illegal electronic surveillance; misuses of agencies of government like the I.R.S., C.I.A. and F.B.I.; the practice of making political opponents into enemies and using the instruments of government to attack them; and then employing perjury and obstruction of justice to cover it all up.” “None of this is to say that Mrs. Clinton did not make mistakes with her email server,” Dean continued. “But to compare them to Watergate is more than historical ignorance. It distorts our understanding of what actually constitutes an abuse of power, and raises the risks that we will someday install another leader who is all too happy to misuse historical memory to indulge a dark and nasty nature.”Dean is only the latest figure associated with the Nixon scandal to disparage Trump’s comparisons. Carl Bernstein, one of the journalists who helped expose Watergate, tweeted and went on CNN on Friday to shoot down Trump’s claims. “Watergate was about a criminal president of the United States who presided over a criminal administration from the day he took office to the day he left,” he said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said Comey's decision to tell Congress about new emails related their investigation of Hillary Clinton without providing more context is ""not fair to Congress, the American people, or Secretary Clinton.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581797d9150000b700530dbe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Top Republicans are questioning FBI Director James Comey’s decision to notify Congress that the bureau is investigating new emails that may or may not be relevant to Hillary Clinton’s handling of sensitive information while she led the State Department.  Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, head of the House Freedom Caucus ― a far-right faction of House Republicans that have been the most vocal in labeling Clinton persona non grata ― doubted Comey’s judgment on Monday.  “I think this was probably not the right thing for Comey to do — the protocol here — to come out this close to an election,” Jordan told Fox News in an interview.He added that Comey mishandled the investigation from the beginning, which left him no choice but to send a letter to Congress.  “I would argue all of this has been wrong from the get-go in the way it’s been handled,” he said.In a letter to Comey on Monday, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) defended the decision to alert Congress, but in the same breath criticized the director for not going far enough in his disclosure. “Unfortunately, your letter failed to give Congress and the American people enough context to evaluate the significance or full meaning of this development,” Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote to Comey. “Without additional context, your disclosure is not fair to Congress, the American people, or Secretary Clinton.”“In the absence of additional, authoritative information from the FBI in the wake of your vague disclosure, Congress and the American people are left to sift through anonymous leaks from Justice Department officials to the press of varying levels of detail, reliability, and consistency. The American people deserve better than that.”Grassley requested in the letter that Comey answer by Nov. 4 whether the new emails have been read by the FBI or contain any information pertinent to the investigation. He previously called on the FBI to release more information about the Clinton probe. Comey’s unprecedented decision to disclose such information also has a number of Republican former prosecutors speaking out, with many of them signing onto an open letter criticizing Comey’s handling of the case.“Comey is nominally a Republican, but this doesn’t have to do with politics, it has to do with policy,” said Stuart Gerson, a man once described in The New York Times as “ardently Republican.” Gerson said Comey’s decision violated “longstanding and well-conceived” traditions at the Justice Department. “This has to do with the fact that the Department of Justice has been compromised,” Gerson said. “It’s a bad thing, it’s a terrible precedent.”Donald Ayer, who served as deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, noted that Justice Department officials have “incredible power” to prosecute people and send them to prison for long periods of time. But what they don’t have the right to do, Ayer said, is what Comey did back in July when he announced the FBI would not recommend prosecuting Clinton.“You don’t turn around and share with the world the evidence in the case and talk about all the bad things that the person did even though you’re not going to indict them. It’s just not done,” Ayer said in an interview.“It’s just a uniform reality that prosecutors have to either put up or shut up. You either make a case or you stop talking,” Ayer said. “I am confident that he felt that he was trying hard to do the right thing and giving his best fair assessment, what in fact he did was misuse and abuse his power as a government official.”Even former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, a man who had his own ethical issues during his time at the Justice Department and who worked with Comey, has criticized Comey’s actions."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5814180a150000b70053083c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whether you believe it or not, climate change is here. Communities around the United States, from Miami to Shishmaref, Alaska, are beginning to feel ― and prepare for ― its fury.And while cutting carbon emissions is the obvious solution, preparing for rising seas, extreme weather and other impacts will prove critical as the planet inevitably changes.The White House-chaired Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience released on Monday a report that paves the way for building a more climate-resilient nation. In addition, the Obama administration announced the launch of a collaborative effort to support communities in their resiliency planning, as well as a partnership among universities that have pledged to train the next generation of design and building professionals.These moves in the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration are a bid to cement the president’s already considerable climate legacy.John Holdren, the president’s chief science advisor, says that in the face of climate change, humans have three options: reducing emissions, building resilience or suffering.“Society is already doing some of all three,” he told The Huffington Post. “What’s really up for grabs is the future mix, and if we want ― as all humans should ― to minimize human suffering,” mitigation and adaptation will be key, he said. The lengthy report, titled “Opportunities to Enhance the Nation’s Resilience to Climate Change,” is among the fruits of Obama’s Climate Action Plan. The council, created via a presidential executive order three years ago, includes senior officials from all of the federal agencies.“We have come a long way in understanding the effects of climate change, organizing communities, strengthening infrastructure, protecting our natural and cultural resources, developing technology, and planning for the future,” the report reads. “Climate change impacts will continue to manifest for a long time to come, and we have more work to do to ensure that we prepare, we adapt, and we respond and recover quickly.”In the last decade, extreme weather and wildfires alone cost the federal government $357 billion. That figure, however, “represents a small fraction of the true economic cost of climate change” ― a cost that is expected to grow significantly in the coming decades, according to the report. “Protecting the economy requires protecting the climate,” Holdren told HuffPost. The report offers a detailed look at Obama’s history on climate, including nine executive actions, and highlights opportunities for advancing science-based technology, integrating climate resilience into the federal system and supporting communities as they deal with the effects of climate change.Christy Goldfuss, managing director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the document takes into account everything that’s been accomplished under Obama and provides “a path forward.”“It really is one of those slow-moving catastrophes, because it’s hard to say any one storm is the result of climate change, but every record-breaking temperature or extreme weather event raises more awareness,” she told HuffPost. And the records continue to fall. Last month was the warmest September ever recorded, and 11 of the past 12 months have set new high-temperature records. NASA predicts that 2016 will go down as the hottest year ever on record.Along with the resiliency report, the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy announced “Resilience Dialogues,” a public-private collaboration aimed at helping communities “build a better understanding of their climate risks and identify the locally relevant information, tools, programs, and other resources that can help them in resilience planning.” A group of 97 colleges, universities, associations, and academic centers around the country have also committed to training the next generation to design and build for the impacts of climate change, the White House announced. Holdren told HuffPost that, as people have experienced climate change in their own communities, acceptance, awareness and willingness to face the problem head has gone up.In Baltimore, Maryland, for example, Kristin Baja, the city’s Climate and Resilience Planner, is “employing groundbreaking outreach techniques to engage underserved populations in climate resilience planning to prepare for natural disasters,” the report states. Earlier this year, the White House recognized Baja for her leadership. Since taking office, Obama has been a champion on climate. And now his administration has given the country a playbook to guide climate resiliency efforts moving forward. But as Obama himself acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times last month, those achievements could be undone if, say, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump were to replace him in the oval office. As the president says in Leonardo DiCaprio’s new climate change documentary “Before The Flood,” there are “some folks on the other side.”“Even if somebody came in campaigning on denying climate science, reality has a way of, you know, hitting you in the nose if you’re not paying attention,” Obama says in the film. “And I think that the public is starting to realize the science, in part because it’s indisputable.” View the full resiliency report here."
52,POLITICS,How A State Bail Reform Measure Lost The Support Of Bail Reformers,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-mexico-bail-reform_us_580a7885e4b0cdea3d8784e5,Will an upcoming ballot initiative in New Mexico actually keep people from being jailed just because they’re poor?,2016-10-31,"As of the end of August, 60 percent of all bondable inmates in custody at the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Detention Center in Albuquerque were being held on bonds of $2000 or less.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580ff32a1800002d00dc427c.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New Mexicans will vote on a constitutional amendment next month that would change the state’s bail system ― a system that often keeps poor defendants in jail for extended periods while they await trial, while wealthier people walk free almost immediately.Under the current system, judges can set a defendant’s bail high to keep him or her in custody. But this doesn’t guarantee that a truly dangerous defendant won’t be able to bail out, and others remain locked up simply because they can’t afford bail. New Mexico’s Constitutional Amendment 1 would give judges the authority to deny bail when prosecutors provide “clear and convincing evidence” that a defendant is too dangerous to be out while awaiting trial. It also explicitly prohibits the detention of defendants who aren’t deemed dangerous or a flight risk “solely because of financial inability” to pay bail.On its face, the constitutional amendment appears to be in line with efforts to reform or eliminate the cash bail system. But many reformers question how much it would really accomplish. They say the measure protects for-profit bail bond companies and leaves the interpretation of protections for poor defendants up to judges ― the same judges who have made cash bail standard practice, despite questions about its legality.“If left to their own devices, I have seen no evidence that the people who have constructed and have been profiting from and have grown used to this system are all of a sudden going to create a much more fair system for the poor,” said Alec Karakatsanis, founder of Civil Rights Corps, a nonprofit that has mounted a number of legal challenges to money bail schemes.Reforming the bail system has become part of the broader campaign to overhaul criminal justice policies that disproportionately disadvantage people of color and the poor. New Mexico’s initiative would follow statewide efforts in Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey and Oregon.Bail reformers say the very premise of requiring a defendant to pay for his or her freedom violates the promise of equal access to justice under the U.S. Constitution and conflicts with federal standards that require judges to impose the least restrictive release conditions that assure community safety and a defendant’s return to court. Bail also forces many people facing nonviolent or low-level charges to remain in jail when they could be released.The cash bail system has contributed to jail overcrowding, with an increasing number of people spending longer periods behind bars without being convicted of a crime. It costs U.S. taxpayers an estimated $9 billion each year to incarcerate people who haven’t been convicted. Here’s how the cash bail system typically works in New Mexico and around the country: After a person is arrested and booked into jail, a judge or other judicial officer assigns a bond amount, which can range from $100 to hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, depending on the alleged crime. Many courts assign preset bond amounts based on the charge, without considering an individual’s ability to pay or whether he or she is dangerous or poses a flight risk. (A bond is the money or other assets that a defendant must provide in order to make bail.)Wealthier defendants may end up going free almost immediately, on the condition that they’ll forfeit their bond money permanently if they fail to appear in court. Other defendants secure release through for-profit bail bond companies, which charge a nonrefundable premium (usually 10 percent of the bond) that can be paid over time.There’s lots of money to be made off of people who could not otherwise pay for their freedom, and the quest for profits has led to some troubling business practices. Earlier this year, VICE documented a bail bondsman’s marketing efforts in Baltimore, which included handing out free merchandise in poor neighborhoods and opening an office near one of the most dangerous intersections in the city. Critics say bail bonds companies exploit crime and poverty to boost their bottom line, and in fact have a vested interest in preserving and further normalizing them.But in many cases, poorer defendants can’t post a bail of any amount, so they stay in jail until trial. These defendants may be left to languish in jail for weeks, months or even years. A recent county review of a detention center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, illustrates the problems with this type of bail system. As of the end of August, the facility was holding a total of 74 people, or about 16 percent of all bondable inmates, on bond amounts of $100 or less. More than 100 others were being held on bonds between $101 and $500. Of all bondable inmates, more than 60 percent were being held on bonds of $2,000 or less.In 2010, unsentenced New Mexico inmates stayed in jail for a median of 147 days, according to a report from the New Mexico Association of Counties ― an increase from 112 days in 2003. People arrested on a misdemeanor stayed behind bars for a median of 80 days in 2010, while people booked on probation violations but not yet been sentenced stayed a median of 70 days. The length of jail stays increased substantially for inmates with documented mental health problems, the report found.Beyond the inherent hazards of confinement, incarceration can lead to a cascading set of consequences. If defendants can’t show up to work, they may get fired and lose access to benefits. If they receive public assistance for housing, that can get taken away. They can fall behind on house or car payments, or be cut off from health care or family support networks ― whether or not they are guilty and regardless of the crime they’re charged with. All of those problems can increase the odds of future criminal behavior and incarceration. In some cases, just getting booked into jail ends up being fatal.Some defendants end up serving the full sentence for a charge before the trial is completed, and are given the option to simply plead guilty and go free. Others, facing the prospect of indefinite detention, may feel pressured to plead guilty much earlier in the process. While this may give a defendant their freedom, it can cost them a conviction for a crime they may not have committed.The Justice Department took a stand against this type of bail system earlier this year, calling the practice “unconstitutional” and “bad public policy.”“Bail practices that do not account for indigence result in the unnecessary incarceration of numerous individuals who are presumed innocent,” the Justice Department wrote in an amicus brief supporting a lawsuit that challenged cash bail in Georgia, one of many filed around the country.New Mexico’s constitutional amendment is a response to a 2014 state Supreme Court decision that criticized the widespread use of cash bail, even when less restrictive conditions of release would have been appropriate to protect the community and ensure that defendants made it to their court date. As part of that ruling, the court set up an advisory committee of judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys and bondsmen to review the state’s bail practices and present alternatives.The panel suggested a constitutional amendment to address the issue, which New Mexico Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Daniels drafted and sent to the state legislature for approval, according to state laws on amending the constitution. Reform advocates in New Mexico have long been seeking to change a judicial system that relies so heavily on cash bail ― but they are skeptical that Constitutional Amendment 1 will get to the heart of the problem.“To achieve real bail reform, we believe that the bonding industry needs to be eliminated,” said Matthew Coyte, president of the New Mexico Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. “Our organization would prefer and advocate for a more direct way of changing the culture by creating laws that simply eliminate monetary bonds, or remove the profit incentive from the system and instead run on a system where bonds are administered by courts.”The NMCDLA, American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico and other groups supported an earlier version of the amendment, which passed in the state Senate. But when the legislation moved to the state House, the bail bonds industry tried to kill it with a campaign of aggressive lobbying and political contributions.House members watered down the amendment’s protections for the poor and added language stating that defendants must be determined not to be a flight risk to be exempt from the bail requirements. Reformers worry that the definition of what makes someone a “flight risk” is vague and could be used broadly against groups like immigrants or defendants who have previously failed to appear in court.“Particularly when it concerns a constitutional change, the instruction has to be absolutely crystal clear, and this ballot measure language is anything but,” said Peter Simonson, executive director of the ACLU of New Mexico. “We think the bail bond industry ultimately corrupted the original language in a way that opens up loopholes for the same worrisome situation to continue into the future.”Lawmakers also introduced a process by which indigent defendants “may file a motion with the court requesting relief from the requirement to post bond.” Requiring poor defendants to file a motion to prove their poverty could mean they still end up waiting in jail, reformers argue. Still, both chambers passed this revised version of the amendment, and voters will consider it on Nov. 8. Although there’s no public polling on the initiative, most observers ― including those who oppose it ― expect it to pass.Reformers’ trepidation is understandable, said Daniels. Even though he was one of the most vocal proponents of the amendment, he’s unhappy that the approved version doesn’t take a stronger stance against cash bail. But the document’s ambiguity is advantageous, the judge argues, because his court will create the rules and mechanisms that ultimately determine how the constitutional changes are implemented.When it comes to determining who has the ability to pay bail, for example, Daniels said the process could be conducted during the initial hearing to set bail. This would mean poor defendants wouldn’t have to sit in jail before filing a motion.“As inartful as that language ended up being at the end of our amendment, the functional effect of it was to give us everything, everything that had been in our original proposal,” said Daniels. “I fully expect a couple of years from now that [bail reform groups] will be inviting me to some banquet to tell me, ‘We were wrong, you were right.’”Although Daniels is confident that he and his colleagues will use the amendment to aggressively overhaul money bail practices, bail reformers aren’t giving him the benefit of the doubt.“Is it possible that a great rule is created? Sure,” said Coyte. “But our organization cannot rely on a rule we haven’t seen yet to make a decision on whether we oppose the amendment or not.”Groups like the NMCDLA and ACLU favor more sweeping alternatives to the cash bail system in which judicial officers make release decisions based on formal risk assessments conducted by pretrial experts. These holistic reviews take into account a defendant’s likelihood to jump bail or get re-arrested before trial, and provide judges with an objective analysis to consider when setting non-financial conditions of release.A system like this is in place in Washington D.C., where it’s paired with a robust pretrial services program that monitors defendants who require supervision while awaiting trial. Between 85 and 90 percent of people arrested in the nation’s capital are released without financial conditions. Around 90 percent of defendants show up for their court dates and 91 percent make it through their trials without getting re-arrested.But changes of this magnitude would require a more forceful campaign against the commercial bail bonds companies that profit from the current system.And the bail bonds industry, which handles about $14 billion in bonds nationwide each year and brings in $2 billion in revenue, doesn’t seem too interested in changing. Bail bondsmen claim they save the government costs that would be incurred if someone were to skip out on a court-administered bond, because companies put up private capital to bail out their clients. And because bail bonds companies assume responsibility for ensuring that their clients appear in court, they argue it saves the state the trouble of having to hunt down anyone who absconds.“Many of the people who are pushing the idea of amending the constitution are saying that people are in jail because they’re too poor and it’s really not true,” said Gerald Madrid, president of the Bail Bond Association of New Mexico.“Many people are in jail because they are poor in relationships,” he added. “They have already burned Grandma and Mom and Dad and everybody down the line they’ve already taken advantage of. The family is glad they’re in jail in many of the cases because these people are abusive. They have drug problems, they’re stealing, they’re drinking and that’s why they’re in jail, more than they don’t have money.”Despite this vastly different view of the criminal justice system and the factors that keep people behind bars, the Bail Bond Association of New Mexico has come out in support of Constitutional Amendment 1. Reformers say this only proves their concerns are valid.“The very reasons the bonding industry is in favor of this is why we would be against it,” said Coyte."

Joe Walsh (R-Ill.), a frequent critic of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, said it was “wrong & unfair” for FBI Director James Comey to write a letter to Congress about newly discovered emails pertaining to Clinton so close to Election Day.Walsh laid out the criticism of Comey in a series of tweets Sunday night:Walsh is no fan of Clinton, having just days ago encouraged protests and acts of civil disobedience “to get our country back” if Clinton wins the presidency.“On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket,” he tweeted.Comey’s move has prompted criticism from people on both sides of the aisle as well as government officials and former prosecutors. Many have called for Comey to release more information, including whether he’s even seen the emails in question, which came from a computer owned by former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) ― who is currently under investigation for allegedly sexting with a minor ― and his estranged wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin. "

But across the country, state and local candidates are campaigning on some of the most progressive platforms in American history. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called these down-ballot candidates “the living spark of the progressive movement” in August 2015, at the annual candidate training hosted by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an organization that fights for progressive reform.The PCCC endorsed 30 of these candidates in its 2016 Power List, which recognizes rising stars in state and local politics. Twenty-one of them are women and half are people of color — two groups that are consistently underrepresented in public office. The Huffington Post interviewed three of these promising candidates to learn more about why they’re running for office and what issues they’ll address first if they’re elected.When Ilhan Omar was a young girl, she imagined what it would be like to move to the United States — the land of “liberty and justice for all.” After growing up in Somalia and living in a refugee camp in Kenya for four years, that single phrase was about all she knew of the country she would soon call home. But when Omar arrived in the U.S. at age 12, she was discouraged to encounter racial, sexual and religious intolerance. Where was the justice she had longed for?After defeating a 44-year incumbent in the primary election, Omar, now 34, is running for a seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives. If she wins in November, she will become the first Somali-American Muslim woman to hold public office in the United States.Her platform is built around the same vision she had for America when she moved here over two decades ago: liberty and justice for all. Omar lives in one of the most diverse, liberal districts in the state, encompassing Minneapolis. She believes her platform — which advocates for environmental, racial, criminal and economic justice — resonates with people in the district.After serving her local community through a city council position, Omar realized that to do more, she needed to expand her base.“I decided to run to, number one, work with people in our district and uplift our voices, build power together for each other, get our progressive platform and agenda through,” she told HuffPost. “And number two, to create a cohesive community that can see themselves as champions for issues that are not for a particular group, but for all of us.”Omar said her priority is criminal justice reform, “making sure we get rid of mandatory sentencing, abolish the grand jury process for police-involved shootings, get rid of abject stops by police officers for having a broken taillight or something hanging out of your window.”Over the summer, a police officer in Minnesota shot and killed Philando Castile, who was black, after pulling him over for a busted tail light. That’s the kind of injustice Omar hopes to end.She said her first bill in office would be automatic voter registration for Minnesotans on their 18th birthday or when they get a driver’s license. As someone who got involved in politics at age 14, Omar thinks automatic registration will allow Americans to “focus on talking about the real issues.”The mother of three has accomplished a lot since she first arrived in the United States, and her candidacy has given her a new perspective on the country.“It is the land of liberty and justice for all, but we have to work for it,” she said. “Our democracy is great, but it’s fragile. It’s come through a lot of progress, and we need to continue that progress to make it actually ‘justice for all.’”Sammi Brown contradicts every stereotype of West Virginia politics. She is a progressive Democrat in a deeply red state. She is a woman of color looking to join a House dominated by white men. And she is a young professional — just 31 years old — looking to bring bold new ideas to her home state. “There will literally be no one else like me on both sides,” Brown told HuffPost. “I will stand alone in the House and the Senate. Just being elected is progressive in and of itself.”Despite being different from other politicians in the state, Brown’s platform is one she thinks every West Virginian can connect with — politics and party affiliations aside. “What I found in having actual conversations with people is they’re not actually opposed to what I believe in at all,” Brown said. “What they needed to hear was that this was an investment in them. I want to make sure they ... can thrive here. I want them to have a real life here. It’s hard for people to see past that when politics is so polarizing and compartmentalized.”After working in the radio industry, where she felt like she wasn’t reaching her potential, Brown decided to focus her career on the people of West Virginia. “This is the very best way I could — to be, very much, a fighter for people.”In office, Brown wants to bridge the achievement gap in West Virginia’s education system. She wants to understand and fight the opioid epidemic in the state — without using mass incarceration as a Band-Aid solution. She wants to update infrastructure across the state so the roads are more accessible. She also wants West Virginians to be paid a living wage — Brown supports the Fight for $15. “Asking for these wages, for compromise and quality of life, is not too much to ask,” Brown said. “I want to give people what they need to be successful.”Brown is also determined to block West Virginia’s so-called “bathroom bill,” the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It resembles the North Carolina bill passed earlier this year that requires transgender people to use the bathrooms that correspond to the sex listed on their birth certificates. “I will fight like hell to make sure that doesn’t pass,” Brown said. “It’s an awful, awful bill and can only detract from the ultimate goal, which is making sure that we can grow and we can thrive here as a holistic community.”Motivated by injustices in her state and across the nation and led by an all-female campaign team, Mari Cordes is running to make a lasting, positive change in Vermont. Inspired by the work of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cordes, a 57-year-old grandmother and registered nurse, is seeking public office after decades of advocating for individuals and families.In her state, she has helped secure paid sick leave, pass anti-discrimination legislation for transgender people and expose systemic racism. She has also provided medical and disaster relief to earthquake survivors in Haiti and refugees passing through Greece. Cordes believes it’s our responsibility to help anyone who is negatively impacted by U.S. policy, including Syrian refugees and communities affected by the climate crisis.If she wins the House seat, Cordes wants to prioritize health care reform, climate change and race relations.

They also erect altars in their homes in honor of loved ones who have passed away.Lourdes Berho, chief executive of Mexico’s tourism board, has said that “Spectre,” in which Bond chases a villain through a parade of people dressed up as skeletons, has raised expectations for large-scale Day of the Dead festivities.Tourism officials have said they hope the new parade will attract tourists to Mexico City.A version of this piece originally appeared on HuffPost Mexico.

Each time, the militants hiding in the shadows would grab them as they ran and force them to leave the dead and dying behind. Each time, ISIS took what hard-earned money they had left and whipped the men traveling with them into submission.“I can’t explain the feeling,” Umm Khaled said, describing the memory of comforting a female relative after ISIS dragged her away from the corpse of her 15-year-old son. One fatal step took her son’s life when they had tried to flee Hawija through a minefield. “There was madness,” Umm Khaled said, shaking her head.It was before the sixth attempt that Umm Khaled decided enough was enough. (She is a mother in her thirties who asked not to give her real name and instead go by what translates in Arabic to “mother of Khaled,” her son.)Umm Khaled and several women from Hawija who fled with her made a heartbroken choice: separate men from women ― husbands from wives, brothers from sisters ― to give the women a better chance to flee near-starvation, brutal ISIS rule and U.S.-led coalition airstrikes targeting ISIS in Hawija. They left their men behind, not knowing if they’d ever see each other again. This time, guided by a masked smuggler, Umm Khaled and her children made it to safety. As it had in past attempts, the trip cost $500 per adult, though kids were smuggled for free.“It was so exciting,” she said, speaking of the moment she crossed into territory controlled by the Kurdistan Regional Government during a nine-hour journey. “But if we knew what the situation was here, we wouldn’t have been so happy.”Umm Khaled says she and her family are essentially prisoners, just as they were under ISIS. But now, she says, their fates ― and the fates of thousands of other Sunni Arabs ― rest in the hands of Kurdish and predominantly Shiite Iraqi forces who view them as terrorist sympathizers.Thousands of civilians are fleeing as a massive U.S.-backed and Iraqi led offensive, launched Oct. 17, pushes towards ISIS’ last major Iraqi stronghold of Mosul. Cash-strapped and overwhelmed aid groups worry there could be a humanitarian disaster as civilians try and flee Mosul. But men, women and children fleeing ISIS areas who survive landmines and the threat of kidnapping arrive in Iraqi Kurdistan, in the north, to find what they describe as prison-like conditions and people being unlawfully detained.“Psychologically, we’re sick,” she said, sitting in filth at Debaga camp in northern Iraq, as flies buzzed around her wailing infant son. His body was covered in itchy scabs, his belly distended from sickness.When Umm Khaled arrived at Debaga, she found that her husband was locked in what security forces called a “screening center.” The KRG-run camp is roughly 25 miles south of Erbil ― supported by the United Nations refugee agency and other organizations ― and provides water, shelter, education and medical support.Families are split up when displaced Iraqis ― mainly Sunni Arabs from ISIS-controlled territory ― arrive at Debaga. The men are taken to a “screening center” managed by the KRG’s security forces known as Asayesh, while women and most children are able to enter the camp directly.The Asayesh claim that no boys under the age of 18 have to go through screening. But during several visits to Debaga, The WorldPost saw young men and boys held in a fenced-in area around Debaga’s screening center who were clearly younger than 18. Human Rights Watch recently said boys as young as 15 are detained for weeks at a time without access to lawyers. ISIS has recruited children, often by force, to fight and die for their cause.After two weeks and no word from her husband in detention, Umm Khaled sold all her jewelry and paid a “broker” to facilitate her husband’s release. It remains unclear if this money served as a bribe for the Asayesh, or otherwise.Some men are released after a few days, but others are held for weeks. And then there are those who simply disappear.“We want our men back!” screamed another woman who introduced herself as Umm Zeinab, a 41-year-old mother also from Hawija. Her husband was also in detention, she explained. And sitting next to her, a woman holding her sleepy daughter explained that her husband had been transferred from Debaga’s screening center ― a bad sign. He’s being held at an undisclosed location in Erbil, camp authorities told her.Some men who had successfully passed the screening process at Debaga slammed the interview process as horribly unfair.“Many people were arrested after investigations,” said Abdel Hamid, a 37-year-old teacher from Shirqat. “Some were innocent.”“‘Why didn’t you fight back?’ they ask,” he said. “‘Why did you sell things to [ISIS]?’ But you can’t do anything.”Another man next to him said he was asked why he served ISIS fighters tea. The reason, he said, was simply because he did not want to die. In some areas, like Mosul, overrun by ISIS in 2014, many locals welcomed the fighters as liberators, not invaders. They despised Iraq’s then Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki and his Shiite-led government, slamming their policies as increasingly authoritarian and violently sectarian.One man, Raed, a 22-year-old former student, said that when ISIS drove into his northern Iraqi city of Baji with its heavily armed pickups and black flags fluttering, it was a revolution for Sunni Arabs. But that support quickly faded, he said, when they realized ISIS was no better than the government they so loathed and feared.Supposed support for ISIS is exactly what the Asayesh at Debaga ― and in other camps and former ISIS-controlled areas ― are searching for, according to officials.“Twenty-five percent of the people in this camp support ISIS,” said Captain Zerar Majid, a member of the Asayesh at Debaga, not elaborating on how he determined that number. As he spoke, the television in front of him blared news of the bloody Oct. 21 ISIS attack on the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.“If there are Arabs in a place, then ISIS can enter,” he said frankly.He writes off the accounts of Umm Khaled and Umm Zeinab ― who claim their husbands had nothing to do with ISIS and were victims ― as pure lies. “We cannot believe them,” he said.Another key part of the KRG security plan is making sure displaced Iraqis coming from ISIS areas cannot move about freely, out of fear that ISIS supporters or sleeper cells will infiltrate civilian areas and launch attacks.If displaced Iraqis want to leave Debaga camp, he says, they need to have a local sponsor ― a family member or a friend ― vouch for them. But people coming from places like Hawija often don’t know anyone in Erbil, Kirkuk or other major cities under KRG control.“It’s a prison,” shouted Raed, the student, when asked if he could leave the camp, though others in the camp showed some support for the screening procedures, saying it help secures the camp. “It’s just one prison to another,” Raed said.While some civilians are being driven out of certain areas, others living outside the camps say they are, essentially, trapped.“The people are trying to leave, but the Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi forces won’t let them leave unless they have a sponsor in the KRG,” said a medical assistant and resident of Qayyarah, where the air is so toxic people are seeking medical attention en masse.ISIS lit oil wells ablaze in August, and months later, they’re still burning. And more recently, the militants torched sulphur piles at the nearby Mishraq sulphur plant, leading to over a hundred people seeking medical attention there. At least two civilians died.And yet, many say they cannot leave.ISIS infiltrating the civilian population is a major concern in the KRG, and the recent attack on Kirkuk ― which left around 100 civilians and security forces dead, in addition to 81 ISIS fighters ― has only inflamed tensions between Kurds and Sunni Arabs.“We know ISIS changes clothes, shave their beards and comes with families,” Kirkuk governor Dr. Najmaldin Karim said in a recent interview with The WorldPost in his heavily fortified government office. He believes the militants come from Mosul, passing through Hawija.“We have suffered a lot with these internally displaced people,” he lamented, explaining how they drained electricity and other essential resources. Locals, he said, are afraid and fed up.His offered solution: “These people have to go back.”At least 250 displaced families living in Kirkuk were forced out following the attack, according to the U.N. refugee agency. The families ― reportedly living in mainly Kurdish areas ― received “forced return notifications” instructing them to leave.While Karim denied any official involvement in those cases, he did compare the presence of thousands of displaced Sunni Arabs in Kirkuk to house guests who have overstayed their welcome.Standing next to Debaga’s screening center, a Kurdish camp worker who introduced himself as Hunar glanced over at the young and old men peering out of a wire fence. His distaste towards Sunni Arabs was personal, he explained.“When Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons on us, nobody helped,” said Hunar, referring to the 1988 Halabja chemical attack on Kurds that left thousands of people dead, wounded and sickened. “Why are we helping the Arabs now?”Kamiran Sadoun contributed reporting."

His body was covered in itchy scabs, his belly distended from sickness.When Umm Khaled arrived at Debaga, she found that her husband was locked in what security forces called a “screening center.” The KRG-run camp is roughly 25 miles south of Erbil ― supported by the United Nations refugee agency and other organizations ― and provides water, shelter, education and medical support.Families are split up when displaced Iraqis ― mainly Sunni Arabs from ISIS-controlled territory ― arrive at Debaga. The men are taken to a “screening center” managed by the KRG’s security forces known as Asayesh, while women and most children are able to enter the camp directly.The Asayesh claim that no boys under the age of 18 have to go through screening. But during several visits to Debaga, The WorldPost saw young men and boys held in a fenced-in area around Debaga’s screening center who were clearly younger than 18. Human Rights Watch recently said boys as young as 15 are detained for weeks at a time without access to lawyers. ISIS has recruited children, often by force, to fight and die for their cause.After two weeks and no word from her husband in detention, Umm Khaled sold all her jewelry and paid a “broker” to facilitate her husband’s release. It remains unclear if this money served as a bribe for the Asayesh, or otherwise.Some men are released after a few days, but others are held for weeks. And then there are those who simply disappear.“We want our men back!” screamed another woman who introduced herself as Umm Zeinab, a 41-year-old mother also from Hawija. Her husband was also in detention, she explained. And sitting next to her, a woman holding her sleepy daughter explained that her husband had been transferred from Debaga’s screening center ― a bad sign. He’s being held at an undisclosed location in Erbil, camp authorities told her.Some men who had successfully passed the screening process at Debaga slammed the interview process as horribly unfair.“Many people were arrested after investigations,” said Abdel Hamid, a 37-year-old teacher from Shirqat. “Some were innocent.”“‘Why didn’t you fight back?’ they ask,” he said. “‘Why did you sell things to [ISIS]?’ But you can’t do anything.”Another man next to him said he was asked why he served ISIS fighters tea. The reason, he said, was simply because he did not want to die. In some areas, like Mosul, overrun by ISIS in 2014, many locals welcomed the fighters as liberators, not invaders. They despised Iraq’s then Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki and his Shiite-led government, slamming their policies as increasingly authoritarian and violently sectarian.One man, Raed, a 22-year-old former student, said that when ISIS drove into his northern Iraqi city of Baji with its heavily armed pickups and black flags fluttering, it was a revolution for Sunni Arabs. But that support quickly faded, he said, when they realized ISIS was no better than the government they so loathed and feared.Supposed support for ISIS is exactly what the Asayesh at Debaga ― and in other camps and former ISIS-controlled areas ― are searching for, according to officials.“Twenty-five percent of the people in this camp support ISIS,” said Captain Zerar Majid, a member of the Asayesh at Debaga, not elaborating on how he determined that number. As he spoke, the television in front of him blared news of the bloody Oct. 21 ISIS attack on the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.“If there are Arabs in a place, then ISIS can enter,” he said frankly.He writes off the accounts of Umm Khaled and Umm Zeinab ― who claim their husbands had nothing to do with ISIS and were victims ― as pure lies. “We cannot believe them,” he said.Another key part of the KRG security plan is making sure displaced Iraqis coming from ISIS areas cannot move about freely, out of fear that ISIS supporters or sleeper cells will infiltrate civilian areas and launch attacks.If displaced Iraqis want to leave Debaga camp, he says, they need to have a local sponsor ― a family member or a friend ― vouch for them. But people coming from places like Hawija often don’t know anyone in Erbil, Kirkuk or other major cities under KRG control.“It’s a prison,” shouted Raed, the student, when asked if he could leave the camp, though others in the camp showed some support for the screening procedures, saying it help secures the camp. “It’s just one prison to another,” Raed said.While some civilians are being driven out of certain areas, others living outside the camps say they are, essentially, trapped.“The people are trying to leave, but the Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi forces won’t let them leave unless they have a sponsor in the KRG,” said a medical assistant and resident of Qayyarah, where the air is so toxic people are seeking medical attention en masse.ISIS lit oil wells ablaze in August, and months later, they’re still burning. And more recently, the militants torched sulphur piles at the nearby Mishraq sulphur plant, leading to over a hundred people seeking medical attention there. At least two civilians died.And yet, many say they cannot leave.ISIS infiltrating the civilian population is a major concern in the KRG, and the recent attack on Kirkuk ― which left around 100 civilians and security forces dead, in addition to 81 ISIS fighters ― has only inflamed tensions between Kurds and Sunni Arabs.“We know ISIS changes clothes, shave their beards and comes with families,” Kirkuk governor Dr. Najmaldin Karim said in a recent interview with The WorldPost in his heavily fortified government office. He believes the militants come from Mosul, passing through Hawija.“We have suffered a lot with these internally displaced people,” he lamented, explaining how they drained electricity and other essential resources. Locals, he said, are afraid and fed up.His offered solution: “These people have to go back.”At least 250 displaced families living in Kirkuk were forced out following the attack, according to the U.N. refugee agency. The families ― reportedly living in mainly Kurdish areas ― received “forced return notifications” instructing them to leave.While Karim denied any official involvement in those cases, he did compare the presence of thousands of displaced Sunni Arabs in Kirkuk to house guests who have overstayed their welcome.Standing next to Debaga’s screening center, a Kurdish camp worker who introduced himself as Hunar glanced over at the young and old men peering out of a wire fence. His distaste towards Sunni Arabs was personal, he explained.“When Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons on us, nobody helped,” said Hunar, referring to the 1988 Halabja chemical attack on Kurds that left thousands of people dead, wounded and sickened. “Why are we helping the Arabs now?”Kamiran Sadoun contributed reporting."
59,POLITICS,James Comey's Clinton Email Announcement Leaves Voters In The Dark,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-clinton-james-comey_us_5816b6b7e4b0990edc31e263,The FBI director's move has put the Democratic nominee in an awkward position.,2016-10-31,Hillary Clinton was left in an awkward position following the FBI director's letter on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5817413b170000b3045baba5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Three days have passed since FBI Director James Comey made the unprecedented decision to insert the bureau into the 2016 presidential campaign. There’s just over a week left until Election Day. Yet voters trying to determine the potential impact of a newly uncovered trove of emails that may or may not implicate Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton have virtually nothing to go on other than reports sourced to anonymous law enforcement officials with differing agendas.Comey told bureau employees on Friday that he felt obligated to send his now-famous letter to Congress out of an “abundance of caution.” Comey’s three-paragraph missive stated the bureau had not yet determined “whether or not this material may be significant,” meaning that the news that has tossed the presidential campaign into chaos may ultimately have no impact on the investigation whatsoever. (Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid wants Comey to release information on the investigation the FBI may or may not be pursuing into the Donald Trump campaign’s potential connections to the Russian government, a request Comey is unlikely to fulfill.)And so, with eight days until the election, the world waits on the word of James Comey. There’s been no indication so far that he’ll say much more before Election Day. In the meantime, voters are left to decipher news stories mostly based on anonymous sources inside the FBI and the Department of Justice. The sources have widely varying agendas. There are the Clinton-supporting political appointees inside the DOJ who think Comey’s decision was inappropriate and broke with tradition; there are the Comey defenders within the FBI who are seeking to protect his reputation as an independent-minded investigator; and there are the law enforcement officials inside the bureau who still believe Clinton should have been prosecuted or further investigated.While initial polling has shown little impact on Clinton’s substantial lead over Trump, that could change as Comey’s letter continues to dominate the news cycle. Voters who are on the fence or still undecided in one of the longest and most divisive presidential campaigns in modern history seem unlikely to delve into the nuances of the FBI’s investigative process, so the basic narrative that Clinton is under federal investigation will likely be the one that sticks in their mind. That’s left Clinton in the awkward position of condemning the actions of the man whose 10-year stint as FBI director could last until 2023, near the end of a theoretical second Clinton term. Comey’s move left her with little choice but to portray the FBI director as simply a political actor seeking to bring down her campaign.A selective reading of Comey’s biography makes it pretty easy to paint him as a partisan trying to take down Clinton. He was a registered Republican for most of his adult life, he served as the No. 2 official in the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration, and he donated to John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008 and Mitt Romney’s campaign in 2012. While he disappointed conservatives when he announced in July that the FBI would not recommend charges against Clinton, he didn’t leave Republicans totally empty-handed. He took the unusual step of publicly condemning Clinton’s behavior as “extremely careless” and suggesting that a lower-ranking employee who engaged in similar conduct would have possibly been subject to disciplinary action. Furthermore, Comey testified about the decision before Congress, and the bureau has dripped out troves of internal documents on the Clinton investigation over the course of the campaign. Comey’s decision to disclose a detail of an investigation to Congress this close to the election is without precedent, and it seems more likely it was a move intended to protect the bureau’s reputation (and his) rather than throw the election to Trump. But the disclosure has the potential to undermine the reputation of both the bureau and Comey as Democrats take aim at the FBI, painting their actions as political. While much of the criticism of Comey has broken on partisan lines, some have crossed the aisle. Almost 100 former federal prosecutors and Justice Department officials of both parties signed onto an open letter on Comey’s decision to release information about an ongoing inquiry just days before Election Day. “Many of us have worked with Director Comey; all of us respect him,” the letter stated. “But his unprecedented decision to publicly comment on evidence in what may be an ongoing inquiry just eleven days before a presidential election leaves us both astonished and perplexed.” Former Attorney General Eric Holder, a Clinton supporter, wrote a piece for The Washington Post saying he respected Comey and considered him a “man of integrity and honor.” But he made a mistake, Holder said. “In this instance, he has committed a serious error with potentially severe implications. It is incumbent upon him — or the leadership of the department — to dispel the uncertainty he has created before Election Day,” Holder said. “It is up to the director to correct his mistake — not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the American people.”Comey undoubtedly would have faced criticism from Republicans had he not disclosed the fact that the FBI had potentially relevant information before Election Day. And despite the panic Comey’s disclosure has caused now, some believe it was ultimately better for Clinton that the information was disclosed, assuming it doesn’t severely damage her campaign.“If Clinton wins, Comey’s controversial pre-election step will have saved her from the charge that the election was tainted because the FBI did not reveal the Weiner letters before the election,” Jack Goldsmith and Benjamin Wittes wrote in a post on Lawfare. “If she becomes president, and regardless of whether the Weiner emails prove embarrassing to her or worse, she should be grateful for the pain now, for it will have precluded a lot more pain later.”Ryan Grim contributed reporting.CORRECTION: A quote from Holder’s Washington Post op-ed was originally attributed to Comey.

60,POLITICS,Iceland Blows The U.S. Away When It Comes To Women In Politics,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iceland-women-in-politics_us_581771b3e4b0390e69d16b17,First female president? They did that in the 20th century.,2016-10-31,The U.S. might elect this woman to be its first female president. Iceland cleared the whole female leader hurdle a few decades ago.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58177506170000c3045bac95.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You might have heard something about how the U.S. could soon have its first female president. Iceland cleared that hurdle several decades ago. The country blows the U.S. away when it comes to equal representation of the sexes, as Claire Zillman notes in Fortune.com.This weekend, Iceland elected a record number of women to its Parliament. Women will now hold 48 percent of the seats. That’s the largest percentage of women in a legislative body in the world, excepting those countries that have quotas for gender representation.In the United States, women hold a sad 19 percent of the seats in Congress.Last week, for the eighth straight year, Iceland came in first on the World Economic Forum’s list of countries ranked by gender equality in politics, education, health and economic opportunity.The U.S. ranked 45th.Iceland is far ahead of us for a number of reasons. First, as the Guardian notes, women there have a long history of self-reliance. For generations, while the men went to sea, women were the ones running things back home.“Without men at home, women played the roles of farmer, hunter, architect, builder. They managed household finances and were crucial to the country’s ability to prosper,” The Guardian writes.Then during the feminist wave of the 1970s, Iceland’s women did something amazing: They went on a massive strike. On Oct. 24, 1974, some 90 percent of the women stopped work ― at home or on the job ― and took to the streets.That show of power radically changed the country. Five years later Iceland elected its first female president, Vigdis Finnbogadottir. She held office for 16 years ― so long that you can find many stories of Icelandic kids who thought men simply weren’t qualified for the position. Vigdis tells The Guardian that she wouldn’t have been elected if it hadn’t been for that strike. Some might quibble that Iceland’s president plays more of a ceremonial role than the U.S. president does. But they have that covered too: Johanna Siguroardottir became Iceland’s first female prime minister in 2009.Feminist policies come more quickly when women actually hold office.Iceland passed an excellent parental leave law in 2000. Each parent can take three months of non-transferable leave. That means most fathers actually take paternity leave. And working mothers return to their jobs relatively quickly after having kids ― instead of ramping down their careers or dropping out of the workforce entirely.The country has not achieved total equality, though. There’s a gap in pay: Icelandic women make 14 percent less than men on average. So, of course, last week they left work and took to the streets to protest."

The cards claimed that voters must have lived in their precinct for at least 30 days in order to be eligible to vote. The requirements were strict, the cards warned, and voter fraud could result in jail time.But the mailers left out key information about how people who have recently moved can still vote. Ronald Brown, then chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called on the Justice Department to investigate the “fraudulent” postcards.Democrats argued that the cards were a deliberate attempt to deter black voters, who were vital in North Carolina’s Senate race that year. Republican Sen. Jesse Helms was running against former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt, a Democrat who was seeking to become the first black senator elected from the South since Reconstruction. The campaign was widely seen as “racially tinged” with advertising from the Helms campaign, for instance, featuring photos of the two men alongside commentary describing Gantt as “extremely different.”Helms, notorious for his own long, racially tinged battle against civil rights, won re-election in 1990 and would wind up his three decades in the Senate in 2003. But the racial tactics that boosted his long career live on in his home state. Those 1990 “ballot security” mailers are the forerunners of “voter fraud” efforts in North Carolina today.On Monday, the North Carolina NAACP filed a federal lawsuit seeking to prevent local election boards from canceling voter registrations merely because one mailer sent to the voters’ address was returned as undeliverable.The lawsuit argues the cancellations violate the National Voting Registration Act, which bars states from removing voters from the rolls 90 days or less before a federal election. The NVRA provides that states can cancel registrations only if the voter confirms an address change via written notice, or if a voter does not respond to a notice for two election cycles and fails to vote for two federal election cycles.Black voters are being disproportionately targeted by the registration cancellations. Republican-dominated county election boards also reduced early voting hours in 23 precincts following a memo from the North Carolina GOP encouraging officials to make “party line changes to early voting.” Nine of the boards eliminated Sunday voting entirely.So far this year, black voters in North Carolina have not turned out for early voting at their 2012 rates.North Carolina’s current status as a swing state heightens the stakes. Rev. William Barber, the North Carolina NAACP president, noted during an Oct. 27 press call that Republicans can control 26 members of the Senate, 30 percent of the House and over half of the Electoral College if they win majorities across the South.“If you fundamentally shift any of those 13 states ― and they begin to vote in more progressive ways ― then you fundamentally change the American democracy and the landscape,” Barber said. Voter turnout in North Carolina has historically been lower than in Northern states. This links back to the Jim Crow era when many African-Americans could not vote. But black voter turnout has been growing, with around 70 percent of black registered voters casting ballots in 2012.The following year, North Carolina enacted one of the most stringent voter ID laws in the country. Republican lawmakers implemented tougher ID requirements, sliced days off the early voting period and altered registration processes ― all with the apparent intent to lessen the number of ballots cast by black voters.

64,POLITICS,Former Attorney General Eric Holder: FBI Director James Comey 'Violated' Justice Department Policies,Nico Pitney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-comey-backlash_us_5816d31ce4b0390e69d0ecf7,And the first member of Congress called on the FBI director to resign.,2016-10-31,FBI Director James Comey is at the center of a national political storm.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5816d38a150000b700530b78.jpeg?cache=9AKacNBCtw&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Criticism of FBI Director James Comey ratcheted up dramatically late Sunday as he faced both a rare public rebuke by the former attorney general who once oversaw him and the first call for his resignation by a member of Congress.Comey has been at the center of a political storm since issuing a vaguely worded letter on Friday ― 11 days before the election ― that indicated the FBI was reviewing more emails that could be related to its probe of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.In an op-ed for The Washington Post, former attorney general Eric Holder charged that Comey’s letter had “violated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition,” and he called on the FBI director to “dispel the uncertainty he has created before Election Day.”Prior to resigning as attorney general last year, Holder directly oversaw Comey’s work as FBI director, a relationship Holder referenced in his op-ed.“I served with Jim Comey and I know him well,” he wrote. “This is a very difficult piece for me to write. He is a man of integrity and honor. I respect him. But good men make mistakes. In this instance, he has committed a serious error with potentially severe implications.”Also on Sunday evening, Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) became the first member of Congress to call on Comey to step down.The FBI director’s letter was a “plainly premature, careless and unprecedented in its potential impact upon a Presidential election,” Cohen wrote, “without a speck of information regarding the emails in question, their validity, substance or relevance.”“I’m sure upon reflection of this action he will submit his letter of resignation for the nation’s good,” the congressman concluded.Taken together, the pair of public statements were further evidence of a clear two-pronged political strategy that Democrats have been executing since Comey’s letter first became public.Clinton and her highest-profile campaign representatives have avoided direct attacks on the FBI director. They’ve described his letter as “vague” and “unprecedented,” but their demands have focused on Comey releasing additional information so as not to leave a cloud of impropriety hanging over the Democratic nominee as voters head to the polls.At the same time, in statements not linked to Clinton’s presidential campaign, other senior Democrats are increasingly lobbing rhetorical bombs in an effort to discredit Comey.Senator Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Sunday accused the FBI director of “partisan actions” that “may have broken the law.” (Reid cited the Hatch Act, which requires someone to act with the intent of interfering with an election.)Reid also claimed that Comey was refusing to release “explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government,” although he did not offer any evidence."
65,POLITICS,James Comey Just Unmasked Himself,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-comey-political_us_58167b1ee4b064e1b4b31cf7,His carefully maintained nonpolitical image is now starting to fray.,2016-10-31,"James Comey, then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, stands behind Attorney General John Ashcroft as he announces a series of indictments on April 9, 2002.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581680e3190000a502c2fdea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― You have to be extremely political here in the nation’s capital if you want to acquire a reputation for being nonpolitical.James Comey, as shrewd and politically attuned a player as this city has seen, had accomplished that feat ― until it all fell apart on Friday.Seeking to protect his reputation for impartiality, the FBI director instead revealed his obsession with politics: the politics of his own image.He sent Congress a vaguely worded letter about how the bureau had come across new information that “appeared to be pertinent” to the “completed” investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails.It soon became clear what he was talking about: emails, the contents of which the FBI hadn’t seen, on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin.The decision for a new investigation, he said in an internal letter that was quickly leaking, was an agonizing one ― though not nearly as agonizing as it was to the presidential campaign of the woman he had put back in his sights.The Clinton camp is outraged; Donald Trump’s supporters suddenly have renewed faith in at least one part of the system they claim is “rigged” against them. And some people are shocked, shocked that Comey would ever make such a move. They shouldn’t be.From the beginning, Comey has had his eye on mastering the intersection of law, politics and power in Washington and elsewhere. He is a very tall man (6-foot-8) who began as a younger man with something to prove and a burning desire to prove it.Coming out of school in New Jersey, Harvard, Princeton and Amherst “blew him off,” he told the student newspaper of the school that accepted him, William and Mary. A faculty member said that he was a finalist for a Rhodes, but didn’t get one.But not long after the University of Chicago Law School, he aimed for the Ivy League of prosecution officers, the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York. He excelled there, eventually becoming the boss of that headline machine. No one runs that shop without an exquisite understanding of politics.For example, Comey had prosecuted financier Marc Rich, who later, as a fugitive, received a pardon from President Bill Clinton in his last day in the Oval Office. In the early years of the George W. Bush administration, Comey decided not to pursue the pardon issue.It was a shrewd move. A registered Republican and a GOP appointee, he chose not to move on the Clintons at a time, not long after 9/11, when bipartisanship was still the theme of the day. He augmented those bipartisan credentials by threatening to quit the Bush administration in 2005 if it did not step back from domestic surveillance practices it had put in place after Sept. 11, 2001.Somehow or other, the whole world learned of this brave act, which impressed no less of a rising figure than a new Democratic senator from Illinois named Barack Obama, who also liked to think of himself as above the partisan demimonde of D.C.With that record, which included high-level stints as counsel to the largest defense contractor in the U.S., Lockheed Martin, and a large private hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, Obama chose him to be FBI director in June 2013.The FBI director is nominated and confirmed for one 10-year term, in an effort to shield him or her from the daily or even yearly political winds. But the higher you go at the intersection of law and politics, the more complex the calculations become.The investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails has, from the start, been a test of higher math.His first exam was last July, when, in what he clearly considered an act of even-handedness, Comey announced that, while Clinton had been “extremely careless” with classified material on her private email server, he would not recommend prosecuting her.Republicans didn’t see that as even-handed: they saw it as letting Hillary walk. Recently, it has come out that the D.C.-based FBI leader whom Comey had allowed to be in charge of the case had close ties to the Clinton circle.GOP House leaders had already made it clear that they were going to renew investigations of the entire email matter in the next Congress.Central to their questioning: James Comey.Comey was trapped. He could not risk the possibility that news of the Weiner/Abedin laptop would leak from the FBI ― or so Comey himself said in an internal explanatory letter to the agency.But the fact that he was worried about a leak was itself an interesting commentary on the state of play within the supposedly apolitical FBI.Now he’s trapped even more tightly. He doesn’t yet know what is on the laptop because the agency has yet to search the specific emails that he hints are in question. (The bureau obtained the needed search warrant Sunday.)But he is facing furious demands from the Clinton camp and Democrats ― and even some Republicans ― that he lay his cards on the table, NOW.Speaking to a reporter for his college paper, Comey in 2014 advised students to, “Try to become a quality thinker.... Life is a series of narrowing experiences, so you want to start as broad as you possibly can, before the funnel starts to narrow on you.”Consider the funnel narrowed.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said that Marc Rich unsuccessfully sought a pardon from Bill Clinton; in fact, Clinton pardoned Rich on his last day in office."

The group was also protesting federal control of land, particularly in the Western U.S., where 47 percent of all land is owned by the federal government. Bundy, along with his brother Ryan and his father Cliven, is among the most vocal critics of federal land ownership. In 2014, the trio participated in an armed standoff with law enforcement at Cliven Bundy’s Nevada ranch, after federal officials tried to push Bundy’s cattle off of federal land. Ammon and Ryan Bundy are still facing charges related to that case, and will remain in custody.In Oregon, they sustained a standoff with law enforcement for nearly six weeks, until police arrested the last occupier. One occupier was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop near the refuge in the midst of the standoff. Among the charges the occupiers faced was conspiracy to impede federal officers by force, threat or intimidation. During the five-week trial, defense attorneys argued that the occupiers were exercising their First Amendment right to freedom of assembly. The jury handed down the not-guilty verdicts last Thursday. It deadlocked on a theft of government property charge against Ryan Bundy.That verdict frustrated and disappointed refugee employees, Ashe told The Oregonian/Oregon Live in an interview on Friday. "

The gorgeous cover star opened up her recent world tour and ― close your ears, fans! ― her reluctance to do it again. Adele confessed that she might forgo another long, grueling tour for something like a 20-show residency in Las Vegas. While she stressed how much she loves music and performing, the singer said, “all of my relationships are more important to me than any tour I’ll ever do. If my relationship with Simon or my relationship with Angelo started to flounder a bit now, I would pull out of my tour. My life is more important to me than anything I’m doing because how the fuck am I supposed to write a record if I don’t have a life? If I don’t have a real life, then it’s game over anyway.” The 28-year-old British singer is notoriously private about life with her boyfriend of five years, Simon Konecki. She told Vanity Fair that she’s happy Konecki isn’t in show business and that “he’s not threatened” by her success. “After releasing my first album, all the other people I ever was with were so insecure about themselves — they couldn’t handle it at all,” Adele said. “When I try to describe this to my friends they don’t always get it, because they go out with people that are our age, but Simon is already who he is, and I’m still becoming who I’m going to be. He’s confident. He’s perfect.”The two have a 4-year-old son, Angelo, together. After giving birth to Angelo, Adele said she stopped being as “carefree” as she once was. She also revealed she suffered from postpartum depression after having Angelo and felt that she felt “very inadequate.” “I didn’t talk to anyone about it. I was very reluctant,” Adele said. “My boyfriend said I should talk to other women who were pregnant, and I said, ‘Fuck that, I ain’t hanging around with a fuckin’ bunch of mothers.’ Then, without realizing it, I was gravitating towards pregnant women and other women with children, because I found they’re a bit more patient. You’ll be talking to someone, but you’re not really listening, because you’re so fuckin’ tired.” To read the rest of Vanity Fair’s interview with Adele, head here, or pick up a copy on newsstands Nov. 8.

70,POLITICS,Donald Trump And Mike Pence Have Their Own Issues With Emails And Transparency,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-pence-emails_us_5817470ee4b0390e69d11e71,Both men have acted to shield their own electronic communication from the public eye.,2016-10-31,Donald Trump and Mike Pence have both acted to shield their electronic communication from the public eye.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581754e2150000b700530c54.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republicans are apoplectic over Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state, accusing her of violating the public’s trust by failing to uphold accountability and transparency in government. Donald Trump even says the Democrat belongs in jail for deleting thousands of emails she sent while heading the State Department.On Sunday, the GOP nominee accused Clinton of “willful and deliberate criminal conduct” in the wake of news that the FBI is investigating an additional batch of emails.Yet both Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, have acted to shield their own electronic communication from the public eye.In a deeply reported cover story published by Newsweek on Monday, Kurt Eichenwald detailed how the real estate mogul and his companies hid or destroyed thousands of documents in numerous court cases dating back to at least 1973:Over the course of decades, Donald Trump’s companies have systematically destroyed or hidden thousands of emails, digital records and paper documents demanded in official proceedings, often in defiance of court orders. These tactics—exposed by a Newsweek review of thousands of pages of court filings, judicial orders and affidavits from an array of court cases—have enraged judges, prosecutors, opposing lawyers and the many ordinary citizens entangled in litigation with Trump. In each instance, Trump and entities he controlled also erected numerous hurdles that made lawsuits drag on for years, forcing courtroom opponents to spend huge sums of money in legal fees as they struggled—sometimes in vain—to obtain records.Trump’s demands for transparency from his opponent also fly in the face of his campaign ― he has still not released his tax returns, a tradition followed by every major-party nominee in the last 40 years, and it does not appear he will do so before Election Day. Nor has he provided the public adequate information regarding his health and physical fitness, pertinent data for a 70-year-old candidate.Pence has also tried to skirt Indiana open records laws. In April, his lawyers argued that an Indiana Supreme Court decision shielding state lawmakers from open records requests ought to apply to the governor as well. Kerwin Olson, executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition, called the move troubling because it “further shuts the door to accountability and transparency in government when we should be going the opposite direction.”The comparison isn’t perfect ― Clinton operated a private email server as secretary of state that potentially could have put national security at risk. But when it comes to the issue of transparency, Trump and Pence are throwing stones from glass houses. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aaa82021e000008087aec7a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Oklahoma is aiming to change the state’s primary method of execution by using nitrogen gas instead of lethal injection to kill death row inmates, which would make it the first state to do so.The change pends on the development and finalization of an appropriate protocol, State Attorney General Mike Hunter and Corrections director Joe M. Allbaugh said at a press conference where they announced the decision on Wednesday.The news comes amid a three-year halt on executions following unresolved issues with lethal injections, as well as state officials’ unsuccessful attempts to acquire lethal injection drugs after pharmaceutical companies refused to manufacture them.The state has 49 inmates on death row, 17 of whom have exhausted their right to appeal, Hunter said.“We can no longer sit on the sidelines and wait to find drugs,” he said of alternative methods. He added that using the gas “will be effective, simple to administer, easy to obtain and requires no complex medical procedures.”Breathing in nitrogen, which could be administered through a mask, would cause one to lose consciousness and die within minutes due to the gas starving the body of oxygen, Hunter added. He called it both “an effective and humane manner that satisfies both the constitution and the court system.”Officials argued that the gas has been previously used in assisted suicides. However, the euthanasia is only legal in a few places, where there are strict rules about how to administer it.Oklahoma’s state legislature approved the use of nitrogen gas as a backup method for execution in 2015. It came a year after the state botched an execution using lethal injection, in which an inmate writhed on a gurney for 40 minutes before dying.Sister Helen Prejean, a prominent anti-death penalty advocate, voiced concern about the use of nitrogen on Twitter on Wednesday, calling it “human experimentation.”“The suggestion by authorities that this new method is ‘more humane’ ignores the fact that it is an untried method, human experimentation practiced by the state upon its citizens,” she posted on Twitter. “More importantly, it ignores the unavoidable truths that there is no humane way to kill a conscious, thinking human being, and that the entire apparatus of capital punishment is deeply flawed and deeply wounding to us all.”Dr. Joel Zivot, assistant professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University School of Medicine, expressed similar views to HuffPost in an interview in 2015.“There’s no therapeutic use of nitrogen gas, and there’s no way to ethically or practically test if nitrogen gas is a humane alternative,” Zivot said. Nitrogen gas has been a backup form for execution in Mississippi since 2017, while a similar bill allowing it is pending in Alabama, the Associated Press reported.Arizona, California, Missouri and Wyoming allow the use of a gas chamber as an alternative method of execution, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a capital punishment monitor.Other execution methods authorized by states include electrocution, hanging and death by firing squad.It will likely be some time before Oklahoma’s use of nitrogen goes into effect due to a court-ordered 150-day delay after a protocol is finalized, Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told Reuters, adding that litigation from opponents is expected as well."

Despite all of his gender-bending, Jones doesn’t identify as a drag queen. He has a “tremendous love and respect for drag,” but nonetheless sees Jomama as a spiritual entity, much like Beyoncé’s Sasha Fierce or Lady Gaga’s Jo Calderone.“It’s a little hard for people to believe that she isn’t a character,” Jones told HuffPost. “It’s been an interesting journey for me in terms of gender expression.

The show has earned Jones critical acclaim, both as a performance artist and as a singer-songwriter. The New Yorker called Jomama “an homage to the transformative power of black style,” while the Daily Beast praised Jones’ performance as “a little slice of magic.” Jones’ primary goal with “Black Light” is to entertain, but the current political climate in the U.S. also plays a significant role in the show.“I think what [Jomama]’s asking us to do with this show is to take a very clear look at what’s at stake ― what we’re dealing with emotionally, internally, personally ― and what we might put forward as the questions or the options in front of us,” Jones said. “So it’s kind of a meditation on the crossroads right now.” Jones first began developing ― well, channeling ― his alter ego for 1996’s “Blood: Shock: Boogie.” Jomama, he said, was initially borne out of his nostalgia for “Soul Train” performances of the past, and took cues from Ross, Turner and Warwick, as well as Sade and disco queen Donna Summer.Still, Jones was adamant that Jomama sing original music, not cover songs. He worked with Bobby Halvorson, Laura Jean Anderson, Dylan Meek and Josh Quat to write 12 new songs for “Black Light.” “She has things she wants to express in her own way,” Jones said.Since the debut of “Blood: Shock: Boogie,” Jones has recorded three independent albums as Jomama, including 2017’s “Flowering.” He said his Fordham students love Jomama’s music and are “incredibly supportive” of their professor’s glamorous, downtown persona.“They get her,” he said. “Some were like, ‘Can she come teach our class instead?’ They don’t need to put her in a box; they don’t need to put me in a box.”Jomama, too, has evolved from her 1980s and ’90s pop star heyday to a mature diva; Jones sees her as having decamped to Switzerland, where she lived with goats for a while.

The students held signs saying “Enough is enough” and “Protect us, not guns.” Kennedy, who has received more than $200,000 from the National Rifle Association over the course of his political career, told CNN last month he didn’t believe America needed new gun laws.“I think we need more idiot control,” he said.Kennedy quickly expressed outrage on learning of a dog’s death aboard an airliner. He penned a letter to the president of United Airlines on Wednesday, demanding “an immediate explanation for the number of animals who have died recently” in the airline’s care.According to Department of Transportation data, 24 pets died aboard airliners in 2017, and United had the most of any U.S. carrier ― 18.Seventeen people were killed in the Parkland school massacre."

But as building approvals trickle in to the historic seaside town of Lamu ― Hassan’s hometown and the agreed-on site for the plant ― questions from residents as well as conservationists on the validity and viability of the energy venture refuse to die down.“This is a matter of life and death for us,” Hassan said. “The effects of this plant are much larger than the projected energy needs of the country. If it goes on, we might lose it all.”The Lamu Archipelago rests on the northern coast of Kenya, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) northeast of the coastal resort city of Mombasa, and it faces the Indian Ocean. The archipelago is a valuable marine ecosystem of coastal mangroves that provide a breeding ground for protected sea turtles. “This project will be Kenya’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide and may be Kenya’s single largest emitter of toxic substances,” said David Obura, a U.S.-trained marine biologist and a founding director of Coastal Oceans Research and Development in the Indian Ocean. For him, the coal plant represents a potentially massive loss of flora and fauna within the protected archipelago. And this is what Hassan is afraid of. A future completely altered from his current reality as well as his past.A 2015 report by heritage body UNESCO backs up some of these fears. “There is... a potential of not only marginalising the community but total disruption of a tradition and all sustaining traditional lifestyle developed and nurtured over millennia,” the report says. Lamu Town is also on the World Heritage list as the oldest and best preserved Swahili settlement in East Africa.This history of the area and fears of environmental destruction aren’t the only reasons some oppose the plant. There’s also the apparent overlooking of the country’s burgeoning renewable energy sector.Kenya’s electricity supply is predominantly sourced from hydro, geo-thermal and fossil fuels, including gas and diesel.Ongoing wind, solar and geothermal power projects are all aimed at feeding an energy appetite projected to grow from 1,600 megawatts to between 2,600 and 3,600 megawatts by 2020. “Kenya’s energy mix is remarkably sustainable, with 70 percent of electrical power generated through renewable sources,” said Guillermo Polavieja, a health assessment specialist. “The country’s clean energy potential is immense.” According to Polavieja, Kenya was under no pressure to dive head first into coal-powered energy.Kenya has “enormous potential to expand” its renewable energy sources ― including geothermal, solar and wind ― according to Power Africa, a report on the U.S. government-led partnership with Kenya on the country’s energy needs. The report predicts renewables will supply 83 percent of Kenya’s energy by 2020. The country boasts the largest geothermal plant in the world from a single site, located deep in the Rift Valley, which currently produces 563 megawatts but is projected to produce 1,984 by 2020. Apart from geothermal resources, Kenya is also developing one of the continent’s largest wind farms set on 40,000 acres, powered by 365 turbines and designed to inject an additional 310 megawatts of power into the national grid.“The Kenyan government either acted on poor advice, showed a lack of ambition in trusting the renewables or perhaps surrendered to other economic interests,” Obura said. Nairobi, the seat of the Kenyan government, insists that all precaution is and will be taken to make the coal plant safe. “The newly built power plants of coal right now are environmentally clean. If you look at China, most of their power supply is through coal,” said Charles Keter, Kenya’s energy and petroleum minister, last May at the signing of a $2.6 billion financing deal between Amu Power, a consortium of Kenyan companies that won the initial tender for building the plant, and China Power Global. The Energy Ministry did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. But as Kenya continues its dance with coal, the rest of the world is slowly moving away from the dance floor. Ninety-seven percent of the European Union’s 619 coal plants will be losing money by 2030, according to an analysis from U.K. nonprofit Carbon Tracker, due to factors including falling renewable energy prices and increased regulation. Research from Greenpeace International in 2017 found that more than 25 percent of the 1,675 companies that have owned or developed coal-fired power capacity since 2010 have left the coal business. Most of them were based in India, followed by China and the U.S.Even in the face of this data, Kenya remains undeterred.In just less than two years, Lamu’s coal-fired power plant will roar to life, burning coal from South African mines arriving by ship, before eventually moving to exploit its own deposits about 350 kilometers (217 miles) away.“We hope that it will not come to this,” Omar Elmawi, a member of lobby group Save Lamu says. “Logic ought to prevail.”In spite of Elmawi’s optimism, all indications are that, buoyed by Chinese funding, the project will be pushed through to completion. Currently, China is in charge of many of the country’s major infrastructure developments.In 2009, Beijing financed the construction of a 50-kilometer (31-mile), eight-lane road at the cost of $360 million. In 2013, it financed the construction of a 472-kilometer (300-mile) railway line at a cost of $3.2 billion, with $1.5 billion more for its extension farther west into the country.Just over 20 percent of Kenya’s international debt is owed to China, according to 2018 data from Kenya’s Treasury, making it the biggest bilateral lender, ahead of Japan, Germany and France. With this kind of advantage, it might take a little miracle for Hassan’s newborn son to have a childhood similar to his.For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook group.

80,RELIGION,'Love A Muslim' Day Letter Is A Poignant Answer To Hate Threats,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/love-a-muslim-day-letter-is-poignant-response-to-violent-islamophobic-campaign_us_5aa97bf7e4b0600b82ffa17c,"A letter campaign is encouraging violence against British Muslims. An activist wants to counter that hate with love, coffee and cake.",2018-03-15,"A close-up of a ""Love a Muslim"" letter created by Shahab Adris.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aaa863b1f00002d0016a740.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A British Muslim activist is trying to turn around an anti-Muslim hate campaign that’s mailing letters to addresses across the U.K. Shahab Adris, an activist from Leeds, is encouraging interfaith allies to shower Muslims with love after racist “Punish a Muslim” letters began showing up in mailboxes and calling on people to terrorize British Muslim communities with violence.Adris’ “Love A Muslim” letter mimics the format of the “Punish a Muslim” campaign. But instead of acts of violence, it urges acts of kindness. For example, the letter assigns 10 points for smiling at Muslims, 25 points for buying Muslims coffee with cake, 500 points for fasting with Muslims during Ramadan, and 1,000 points for raising funds to help needy residents of Iraq or Syria.Adris, a regional manager for the advocacy group Muslim Engagement And Development, said he felt “compelled to put something totally positive out there in response to the original vile letter.”“It’s crucial to rid our society from anti-Muslim popular attitudes and the best way we can do this is by engaging and enjoying each other’s company,” Adris told HuffPost in an email. “There is so much we can learn from each other and together we can make our communities a more welcoming and tension-free environment.”British Muslim communities have been alarmed by the “Punish a Muslim” letters reportedly sent to people across the U.K., including at least three Muslim politicians. The letters assign points for terrorizing Muslims on April 3 ― from 25 points for pulling Muslim women’s headscarves, to 1,000 points for bombing a mosque. Counterterrorism police are investigating the “potentially malicious communications,” but haven’t identified those responsible. Adris said the “unusual” nature of the point system encouraging violence has caused significant distress in British Muslim communities. He said he also worries about potential consequences for non-Muslims.“We were getting increasingly concerned because people who are perceived to be Muslim can potentially be a target too, such as the Sikh community, and even the Jewish, Hindu, and even people with beards,” Adris said. He said he’s been encouraged by the positive response after posting his “Love a Muslim” letter to Facebook and Twitter. Some non-Muslims have pledged to take Muslim colleagues out for coffee and cake.Muslim Engagement And Development is considering mailing the letter to “random people,” Adris said. Volunteers plan to set up community events on April 3 to help people celebrate “Love a Muslim” day.Other people say that the “Love a Muslim” effort, though noble, diverts attention from rampant Islamophobia that inspired the hate letter the first place. Faima Bakar, a British Muslim journalist for Metro, wrote that it’s worrying that Muslims “need to go out of our way to show how normal and British we are, and that a whole day has to be dedicated to reversing an already abundant belief that we’re a problem community.”“Are the people that retweet the initiative going to stand up for lesser obvious and tangible evidence of bigotry?” Baker wrote in Metro. “Muslims are human beings too, so why do we need to prove this?”Adris said that in the face of extreme hatred, he believes it’s important to remain positive “and show a level of creativity.”“We must rise above it and actively show a level of compassion and love to our fellow citizens,” Adris wrote.In the meantime, he encouraged fellow British Muslims and their allies to be “on guard” and to contact his group and local police if they encounter evidence of hate crimes.“We understand there is a real cause for concern out there, and we are taking these concerns very seriously” he said.

81,POLITICS,An Underdog In Michigan’s Governor Race Shows Dems How To Run On Climate Change,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/abdul-el-sayed-michigan-environment_us_5aa1b29fe4b086698a9bf815,"Abdul El-Sayed, the 33-year-old former Detroit health commissioner, has a plan to fight environmental racism.",2018-03-15,Abdul El-Sayed has laid out one of the most progressive environmental platforms in 2018.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa1b6501e000008087adef7.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Abdul El-Sayed remembers coughing up black phlegm each night after spending the day in the smog-choked markets of Cairo and Alexandria, Egypt, during summer visits to his grandparents, who were poor vegetable sellers.It was a jolting experience for a kid born and raised in a manicured Michigan suburb. Yet when El-Sayed started working as a doctor in Detroit years later, he realized pollution wasn’t just some distant problem. In the shadow of the Motor City’s infamous trash incinerator ― where some 650,000 tons of garbage is burned annually, much of it from the surrounding suburbs ― El-Sayed saw soaring rates of asthma and lung cancer in majority-black neighborhoods.That’s part of what inspired the 33-year-old physician to enter politics, first as Detroit’s top health official and now as a Democratic candidate for Michigan governor.“In the 30 minutes it took to go from the community I grew up in to the city I worked in, you’d see a 10-year difference in life expectancy,” El-Sayed told HuffPost in a recent phone interview. “I see that as the human cost of failing our environment and failing sustainability.” He pointed to Detroit’s high rates of asthma; to lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan; to the toxic sludge left behind in Kent County by the company behind Hush Puppies shoes.“When we poison our air and water, we are poisoning people,” El-Sayed said. “Nowhere is that more clear than the state of Michigan now. When you talk about Flint, when you talk about asthma, when you talk about Kent County.”In response to those failures, El-Sayed has laid out one of the most progressive environmental platforms of the 2018 election cycle, setting what could be the new standard for a national Democratic Party that has so far failed to rally around serious policies to deal with climate change and water contamination.He has plans to increase environmental agency budgets, replace lead pipes and establish a green infrastructure bank to shore up funding for renewable energy projects. He has vowed to shut down an aging oil pipeline that is putting the Great Lakes at risk and sworn off all donations from fossil fuel companies. And he has articulated his vision in terms of tangible public health benefits, outlining what some see as a template for a populist approach to climate and environmental issues.“This looks like a national model,” said RL Miller, president of the super PAC Climate Hawks Vote.El-Sayed will face a crowded field in Michigan’s Aug. 7 Democratic primary. The eight candidates include former state Sen. Gretchen Whitmer, whose mainstream progressive campaign emphasizing skilled trades and a $15 minimum wage is backed by influential labor unions; by EMILY’s List, which raises funds for Democratic female candidates who support abortion rights; and by former Democratic Gov. Jim Blanchard. Whitmer is widely seen as the front-runner and has already raised over $3 million.El-Sayed may face another challenge as well: whether he’s even eligible to run, due to an obscure state law that requires a candidate to have voted in the state in the four years prior to their run. He was registered to vote in New York from 2013 to 2015, while he attended medical school and taught at Columbia.His campaign has dismissed calls for a legal test of his eligibility as “a racist, insider smear” aimed at kneecapping the most credible underdog challenger to Whitmer, the establishment candidate.El-Sayed’s political brand as the young intellectual of color who could become the nation’s first Muslim governor has prompted some ― to his chagrin ― to call him “the new Obama.” But his grassroots support and embrace of progressive policies put him closer to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whose 2016 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination helped revive a long-dormant fervor on the American left.“He doesn’t talk like consultants say to talk,” Sean McElwee, a progressive policy analyst and researcher who hosted El-Sayed at a gathering in New York last October, told HuffPost. “He combines the sort of populist energy people are excited about with Bernie with detailed knowledge of how to implement policy.”El-Sayed’s proposal to set aside $105 million in his first state budget to establish an infrastructure bank that would fund renewable and energy-efficient projects is the “centerpiece” of his plan to “reinvest in the capital-stock of Michigan,” according to a campaign white paper. His administration would eventually ramp up the institution’s public funding to $1.5 billion, with plans to generate at least $4.5 billion in energy and clean water infrastructure investments over 15 years. The public-private institution, dubbed the Pure Michigan Bank, could generate $3.3 billion in private investment by 2030, according to a Union of Concerned Scientists report.“We want to put Michigan on the path to 100 percent renewable energies,” El-Sayed said. “What we’d be able to do is empower innovative financing that addresses the insecurity of those kinds of big-picture infrastructure projects and empowers individuals to use those mechanisms.”The bank would provide low-risk seven-year loans at 5 percent interest for energy-efficiency projects and similar 10-year loans for renewable-energy plans. It would also offer credits to low- and middle-income homeowners to invest in efficiency upgrades, small-scale solar installations and other clean energy projects. “We can’t just count on the free market to do it all by itself,” said William Lawrence, Michigan organizer for the climate campaign group Sunrise Movement. “We have to put public money behind this kind of infrastructure build-out and also create smart institutions like this infrastructure bank to get some of the private money flowing in the right direction.” (Sunrise endorsed El-Sayed for governor last month.)The bank would operate independently of any state agency, reducing its vulnerability to funding cuts under a future administration. To help pay for it, El-Sayed has proposed instituting a carbon tax and diverting some of that revenue to the bank. Another option is to follow the model of Connecticut’s green infrastructure bank and impose a small ratepayer fee.“The idea of creating an institution, capitalizing it and being designed in such a way that it’s likely to survive even if you have Rick Snyder 2.0 as governor, that’s appealing,” said Jeff Hauser, a veteran progressive Democratic operative, who was referring to the current Republican governor’s history of austerity cuts. “It’s intriguing to me that someone is thinking about how to create change that can entrench and build upon itself. That’s really key.”It should be a popular platform among primary voters. Democratic voters in Michigan overwhelmingly support new rules raising fuel efficiency standards, giving the Environmental Protection Agency power to regulate carbon dioxide emissions and requiring a minimum amount of renewable energy in electricity generation even if that means a small price increase, according to 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Studies data provided by McElwee. El-Sayed also wants a major public investment in clean drinking water. Michigan became the poster child for unsafe tap water four years ago when lead contamination in Flint turned into a long-running crisis and a national disgrace.As a first step, El-Sayed said he would merge the state’s Department of Environmental Quality with its Department of Natural Resources and raise the combined agency’s budget to as much as $950 million a year. That would include restoring funds for the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance to their 2006 levels of about $16 million a year. El-Sayed has suggested raising money for that budget by closing the state’s corporate tax exemptions and loopholes.He has proposed spending at least $690 million annually to replace aging water pipes, which would create 13,800 jobs each year, his campaign has calculated based on data from the BlueGreen Alliance. To raise the money, he suggested issuing $600 million in bonds and passing a ballot proposal to expand the state’s Drinking Water Revolving Fund, which offers low-interest loans for up to 30 years to water suppliers. The ballot proposal would increase the fund’s available money from $36 million to $50 million by reallocating $14 million from the Department of Corrections budget. He also vowed to push the federal government for more funding.El-Sayed distinguished himself on the issue of lead toxicity during his 2015-2017 tenure as Detroit’s Health Department chief, during which he tested all schools and child care facilities for lead contamination. His gubernatorial housing policy would expand on that, by using lead-abatement funds to help renters pay their legal defense in related landlord disputes and to perform full inspections and mitigation on all housing stock, and by fining building owners who don’t comply, as The Nation reported in January.But it’s his plans for dealing with lead in drinking water supplies that have drawn the most local attention. El-Sayed has vowed to set stricter water quality standards by reducing the “action level” for lead, the threshold for government intervention, from 15 parts per billion to 5 parts per billion and pushing for legislation that bars public projects to replace pipes from only partially replacing lead pipes. Outside of urban areas, where wells for drinking water are more common, he has promised to crack down on agricultural pollution. The Detroit Metro Times called his proposal “the most comprehensive water plan of the gubernatorial race.”Another key part of that plan is to protect universal access to water. In Detroit last year, the city began the controversial practice of shutting off water to nearly 18,000 residents who hadn’t paid their bills. El-Sayed has suggested a new tiered pricing system, which would force households that use more water to pay higher rates but would ensure that everyone in the state has basic access to clean water. “Freshwater is going to become, and it’s quickly becoming, the most important resource in the world,” El-Sayed told HuffPost. “The fact that, as a state that’s surrounded by more freshwater than any place in the country, we can’t figure out how to allocate freshwater to folks in places like Flint and Detroit and protect that freshwater from being poisoned ― that’s a political failure.”El-Sayed’s other major plan to protect water rests on decommissioning Line 5, a nearly 65-year-old pipeline that carries 23 million gallons of oil per day through the Straits of Mackinac, where lakes Huron and Michigan connect. The pipeline is operated by Enbridge, the Canadian company responsible for the second-largest inland oil spill in U.S. history, in the Kalamazoo River in 2010. A 2014 University of Michigan study concluded that the Straits of Mackinac are the “worst possible place for an oil spill in the Great Lakes.” A single spill there could pollute more than 700 miles of shoreline, according to a 2016 University of Michigan study.Environmentalists have campaigned for years to shut down Line 5, but Enbridge has cultivated key allies in Snyder and Heidi Grether, director of the Department of Environmental Quality ― who is herself a former oil industry lobbyist. In November, the governor struck an agreement with Enbridge to replace one section of the pipeline. In January, Snyder rejected a recommendation from Michigan’s Pipeline Safety Advisory Board to close the pipeline immediately. Enbridge spent nearly $2.4 million on U.S. congressional lobbying in 2017, more than double its 2016 total. That included lobbying on a federal bill affecting Line 5.Because he swore off all donations from fossil fuel companies, El-Sayed’s supporters argue that as governor, he would be insulated from the influence of Enbridge and its industry advocates. El-Sayed is one of the first major Democratic candidates to take the pledge against accepting fossil fuel money that’s being pushed by Sanders and progressive groups such as 350.org.The pledge is “not as material as the other proposals we’re talking about on the table, but ... it’s a very clear way to show where he stands,” said Lawrence, the Sunrise organizer. “He’ll actually follow through on his proposals on Election Day.”Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify when El-Sayed was registered to vote in New York and what his occupations were during that time."

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/abdul-el-sayed-michigan-environment_us_5aa1b29fe4b086698a9bf815,"Abdul El-Sayed, the 33-year-old former Detroit health commissioner, has a plan to fight environmental racism.",2018-03-15,"The water crisis in Flint, Michigan, drew the nation's attention to lead contamination issues.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa68b992000002d00eb1645.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Abdul El-Sayed remembers coughing up black phlegm each night after spending the day in the smog-choked markets of Cairo and Alexandria, Egypt, during summer visits to his grandparents, who were poor vegetable sellers.It was a jolting experience for a kid born and raised in a manicured Michigan suburb. Yet when El-Sayed started working as a doctor in Detroit years later, he realized pollution wasn’t just some distant problem. In the shadow of the Motor City’s infamous trash incinerator ― where some 650,000 tons of garbage is burned annually, much of it from the surrounding suburbs ― El-Sayed saw soaring rates of asthma and lung cancer in majority-black neighborhoods.That’s part of what inspired the 33-year-old physician to enter politics, first as Detroit’s top health official and now as a Democratic candidate for Michigan governor.“In the 30 minutes it took to go from the community I grew up in to the city I worked in, you’d see a 10-year difference in life expectancy,” El-Sayed told HuffPost in a recent phone interview. “I see that as the human cost of failing our environment and failing sustainability.” He pointed to Detroit’s high rates of asthma; to lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan; to the toxic sludge left behind in Kent County by the company behind Hush Puppies shoes.“When we poison our air and water, we are poisoning people,” El-Sayed said. “Nowhere is that more clear than the state of Michigan now. When you talk about Flint, when you talk about asthma, when you talk about Kent County.”In response to those failures, El-Sayed has laid out one of the most progressive environmental platforms of the 2018 election cycle, setting what could be the new standard for a national Democratic Party that has so far failed to rally around serious policies to deal with climate change and water contamination.He has plans to increase environmental agency budgets, replace lead pipes and establish a green infrastructure bank to shore up funding for renewable energy projects. He has vowed to shut down an aging oil pipeline that is putting the Great Lakes at risk and sworn off all donations from fossil fuel companies. And he has articulated his vision in terms of tangible public health benefits, outlining what some see as a template for a populist approach to climate and environmental issues.“This looks like a national model,” said RL Miller, president of the super PAC Climate Hawks Vote.El-Sayed will face a crowded field in Michigan’s Aug. 7 Democratic primary. The eight candidates include former state Sen. Gretchen Whitmer, whose mainstream progressive campaign emphasizing skilled trades and a $15 minimum wage is backed by influential labor unions; by EMILY’s List, which raises funds for Democratic female candidates who support abortion rights; and by former Democratic Gov. Jim Blanchard. Whitmer is widely seen as the front-runner and has already raised over $3 million.El-Sayed may face another challenge as well: whether he’s even eligible to run, due to an obscure state law that requires a candidate to have voted in the state in the four years prior to their run. He was registered to vote in New York from 2013 to 2015, while he attended medical school and taught at Columbia.His campaign has dismissed calls for a legal test of his eligibility as “a racist, insider smear” aimed at kneecapping the most credible underdog challenger to Whitmer, the establishment candidate.El-Sayed’s political brand as the young intellectual of color who could become the nation’s first Muslim governor has prompted some ― to his chagrin ― to call him “the new Obama.” But his grassroots support and embrace of progressive policies put him closer to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whose 2016 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination helped revive a long-dormant fervor on the American left.“He doesn’t talk like consultants say to talk,” Sean McElwee, a progressive policy analyst and researcher who hosted El-Sayed at a gathering in New York last October, told HuffPost. “He combines the sort of populist energy people are excited about with Bernie with detailed knowledge of how to implement policy.”El-Sayed’s proposal to set aside $105 million in his first state budget to establish an infrastructure bank that would fund renewable and energy-efficient projects is the “centerpiece” of his plan to “reinvest in the capital-stock of Michigan,” according to a campaign white paper. His administration would eventually ramp up the institution’s public funding to $1.5 billion, with plans to generate at least $4.5 billion in energy and clean water infrastructure investments over 15 years. The public-private institution, dubbed the Pure Michigan Bank, could generate $3.3 billion in private investment by 2030, according to a Union of Concerned Scientists report.“We want to put Michigan on the path to 100 percent renewable energies,” El-Sayed said. “What we’d be able to do is empower innovative financing that addresses the insecurity of those kinds of big-picture infrastructure projects and empowers individuals to use those mechanisms.”The bank would provide low-risk seven-year loans at 5 percent interest for energy-efficiency projects and similar 10-year loans for renewable-energy plans. It would also offer credits to low- and middle-income homeowners to invest in efficiency upgrades, small-scale solar installations and other clean energy projects. “We can’t just count on the free market to do it all by itself,” said William Lawrence, Michigan organizer for the climate campaign group Sunrise Movement. “We have to put public money behind this kind of infrastructure build-out and also create smart institutions like this infrastructure bank to get some of the private money flowing in the right direction.” (Sunrise endorsed El-Sayed for governor last month.)The bank would operate independently of any state agency, reducing its vulnerability to funding cuts under a future administration. To help pay for it, El-Sayed has proposed instituting a carbon tax and diverting some of that revenue to the bank. Another option is to follow the model of Connecticut’s green infrastructure bank and impose a small ratepayer fee.“The idea of creating an institution, capitalizing it and being designed in such a way that it’s likely to survive even if you have Rick Snyder 2.0 as governor, that’s appealing,” said Jeff Hauser, a veteran progressive Democratic operative, who was referring to the current Republican governor’s history of austerity cuts. “It’s intriguing to me that someone is thinking about how to create change that can entrench and build upon itself. That’s really key.”It should be a popular platform among primary voters.
