0,POLITICS,Oklahoma Teachers Prepare For Walkout As Red State Revolt Spreads,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oklahoma-teachers-prepare-for-walkout_us_5abe9307e4b0f112dc9c3395,"State legislators fast-tracked a pay raise bill to avoid closures, but teachers say it doesn't come close to adequately funding schools.",2018-03-30,"Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R) speaks at the National Press Club on Jan. 15, 2014, in Washington, D.C. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe983e1f0000270616bf80.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Teachers in Oklahoma still plan to walk off the job next week after state legislators passed an education funding bill that fell apart within hours.Initially it seemed the legislation, signed Thursday by Gov. Mary Fallin (R), would quell the statewide walkout that educators had set for April 2 to demand more money for schools. But not even a day after the state Senate approved the first tax increase package in years, legislators in the state House voted to undo one of its main provisions, a tax on hotel and motel stays.After applauding legislators for approving the funding bill, the state’s leading teachers union, the Oklahoma Education Association, renewed its call late Thursday for teachers around the state to stay out of school and descend on the Capitol in Oklahoma City on Monday.“Yesterday, the Legislature passed a historic education funding increase,” the union said Thursday in a Facebook post. “Today, they started dismantling it by cutting millions out of the plan. Now they’re gone for the weekend. Oklahoma: we’ll see you at 9 a.m. April 2 at the Capitol.”Oklahoma is one of a wave of red states now facing a teacher revolt after years of anemic funding for education. Over the past decade, Oklahoma carried out a series of tax cuts that, combined with falling energy prices, have left the oil- and gas-rich state with little money to steer toward teachers or textbooks. It’s more or less the same story that played out in West Virginia, where tax cuts forced educators to forego raises while their health care costs increased. Teachers there walked off the job for nine days in February and March, prompting the state legislature to fund pay increases for public employees.The historic and successful strike in West Virginia has inspired a burgeoning uprising among austerity-weary teachers around the country. In addition to Oklahoma, Arizona could soon face a strike by teachers, who are demanding the state boost pay by 20 percent and return to pre-recession funding levels for education. (Meanwhile, teachers in Kentucky shut down public schools in 25 counties on Friday to protest proposed cuts to the state pension plan.)Teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona are all among the lowest-paid in the country, with schools facing growing teacher shortages. Republicans control the statehouse and governor’s office in all three states.“After ten long years in a lot of these conservative states, the chicken is finally coming home to roost,” said Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, the 3-million member union with which the Oklahoma Education Association is affiliated. “They’ve given tax breaks to big corporations, defunded public schools, and said, ‘What could go wrong?’” After Oklahoma legislators passed the tax hike, it seemed the walkout could turn instead into a one-day rally on Monday. Now nobody knows for sure what next week will bring. The mixed actions by Oklahoma’s legislature could lead to a situation where some school districts close only for Monday or not at all, while others engage in a work stoppage for days. Many Oklahoma teachers on Facebook have called for keeping schools shut down until all their demands are met.To a certain degree, their walkout will require the cooperation of their largely sympathetic superintendents, who decide whether schools are formally open or closed. If schools are open and teachers refuse to return to work, the state could consider it an illegal strike. Several districts announced Friday that their schools would not be open on Monday.Beth Wallis, an assistant band director who teaches in a Tulsa suburb, said teachers in her district voted unanimously to stay off the job beyond Monday. Although the legislation passed this week includes average pay raises of $6,100, Wallis said the lack of state funding guaranteed in the bill could leave local districts on the hook to pay for them. She also said securing teacher pay raises is secondary to increasing general school funding.“The school funding in the bill is laughably small,” Wallis said. “It’s not enough to buy every kid in my district a single textbook. We have buildings that are falling apart and textbooks that need to be taped together.”Like most states, Oklahoma cut school funding in the wake of the Great Recession. But it also pursued tax cuts during the economic recovery that followed, dropping income taxes and reducing the gross production tax on oil and gas companies. With little money to devote to schools, Oklahoma has led the nation over the past decade in cuts to its education formula funding, which is the main well of state money for individual districts.“They sort of maximized the damage that the recession did to their schools and other public services, and as the economy improved, they kept cutting taxes,” Michael Leachman, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, recently told HuffPost. “You’re just digging your hole even deeper.”With less funding, many cash-strapped schools have gone to four-day weeks, while certifying a growing number of emergency teachers to fill vacant jobs. Such teachers don’t meet the state’s normal minimum requirements to teach in public school. The union says the state will have to increase salaries and school funding significantly if it wants to stop losing teachers to Arkansas and other nearby states that pay better.Reversing course will not be easy. Approving tax hikes in Oklahoma is extraordinarily difficult, requiring a three-fourths supermajority in both chambers. Legislators were barely able to approve the tax package that has already foundered. Legislators had only hours to digest that bill before it was passed, and many apparently did not have time to read it. One state representative argued that the bill had a $75 million hole in it before taking the repeal of the hotel and motel tax into account. “The more the bill has gotten to sit,” Wallis said, “the more people have gotten to read it and find problems with it.”"

Art is now imitating life, with the two supporting each other in the real world as Nixon faces off against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in the state’s primary election, set for September.In response to Parker’s post, Nixon tweeted out a thank you:Previously, Parker’s support of Nixon appeared extremely vague. The New York Post’s Page Six published a statement on Wednesday in which Parker said, “Cynthia has been my friend and colleague since we were little girls. I look forward to talking to her about her New York state gubernatorial bid.”Most of the primary members of the “Sex and the City” cast have shown their support for Nixon. Kristin Davis, Willie Garson, David Eigenberg and Lynn Cohen have all sent their well-wishes or issued public endorsements on social media. Kim Cattrall’s response to Nixon’s campaign has been the most ambiguous:Parker and Cattrall have recently been involved in an ongoing feud, though Nixon seems to have had no part of it.

6,POLITICS,Trump Says Infrastructure Overhaul Will Likely Have To Wait Until After Midterms,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-infrastructure-midterms_us_5abd33f9e4b03c9964e2d5f5,It’s an admission rooted in political reality and the congressional calendar.,2018-03-29,"President Donald Trump delivers remarks on the Infrastructure Initiative at the Local 18 Richfield Training Site in Richfield, Ohio, March 29, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd3d7d1f0000260616bdfd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s long-stalled infrastructure package is unlikely to happen until after November’s midterm elections, he acknowledged Thursday.“We’ll probably have to wait until after the election,” Trump said in Richfield, Ohio, during what administration officials billed as a major speech on infrastructure.It was an admission rooted in political reality and the congressional calendar. Lawmakers are mostly done legislating for the year and are looking to focus on the November elections. Republican leaders, in particular, have been dubious about the prospect of passing another massive spending package.Trump’s infrastructure proposal, which the White House unveiled earlier this year, seeks to leverage $200 billion in direct federal spending over the next decade into an additional $1.3 trillion for infrastructure development with the aid of state and local tax dollars as well as private investment. The administration has not proposed a way to pay for the initiative.If there is to be any compromise between Republicans and Democrats on infrastructure, it’ll likely only happen after the election, retiring House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) said last month.“It could be a lame-duck strategy, that we do it after the election,” Shuster said.In his speech on Thursday, which touched on not only infrastructure but seemingly every other subject as well, including actress Roseanne Barr and her television show, Trump touted new funding Congress had approved for highways, airports, railroads, and waterways. Those funds were included in a $1.3 trillion budget package he signed earlier this month ― a measure he’d called “ridiculous” and had initially threatened to veto.Trump also suggested to Congress that his infrastructure plan doesn’t necessarily have to be taken up in one piece.“It can be passed in one bill, or in a series of measures,” he said. “What matters is that we get the job done.”"

Unfortunately, they say, it isn’t nearly enough.Congress set aside $380 million that will be divvied up among states to shore up election security, including new software, cybersecurity staff and other protections for state registration databases and aging voting equipment. But while the funding is certainly welcomed by local election officials, many of them warn it falls far short of what they need to deal with the potential security challenges of the midterm elections in November.It’s only “a drop in the bucket of what is really needed,” said Jeff Greenburg, the director of elections in Mercer County, Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania is one of 41 states where some counties and cities use election equipment that is more than a decade old, according to the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. Older machines are more likely to malfunction or break down on Election Day, causing long lines and potentially dissuading some people from casting their ballots. Some older machines also are susceptible to wireless malware attacks, even if they are not directly connected to the internet, or have removable memory devices a hacker might manipulate.Pennsylvania is also one of 13 states where some counties use voting machines that lack a paper record. Paper records are essential to having a secure election, said Larry Norden, the deputy director of the Brennan Center’s democracy program. They can ensure an accurate audit if electronic records of vote tallies are compromised. During the 2016 presidential election, Russian hackers targeted election systems in Pennsylvania and 20 other states, according to U.S. intelligence officials. Those officials fear that, during the 2018 midterms, hackers may target state voter registration databases, county websites and official social media accounts to spread misinformation and sow doubt in the U.S. election system.In February, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, directed all counties that are planning to update aging election equipment to buy machines that create a paper trail. However, the directive from Wolf, aimed at machines used by 83 percent of the state’s voters, did not come with funding attached, placing the financial burden on federal or local budgets.It could cost as much as $79 million to replace paperless machines in Pennsylvania, the Brennan Center estimates. With the Trump-signed spending bill, the state is only expected to receive $13.5 million, covering just 17 percent of the estimated costs. Barring a new proposal at the state level, counties would have to foot the rest of the bill.“If they want to make any real dent in the cost to replace an election system,” Greenburg said, “this is woefully insufficient.”His county of 72,000 mostly middle-class registered voters in western Pennsylvania uses paperless voting machines, which officials there purchased in 2006. Replacing its current voting machines would cost between $750,000 and $2.5 million, depending on the type of equipment — a hefty bill for a county like his, Greenburg said.‘It’s Killing Us’Kim McKiernan, the registrar of voters in Rappahannock County, Virginia, knows all too well the burden of replacing election equipment in a very small county without state and federal support.With just two months left in the 2017 gubernatorial race, Virginia’s Board of Elections in September ordered all counties that use touchscreen voting machines to replace them with paper ballots and optical scanners before Election Day. The state provided no financial assistance.Rappahannock County was one of the 22 local jurisdictions in the state that used a paperless voting system. The small community with 5,600 registered voters, nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, quickly set aside $53,000 to purchase eight new machines, calibrate the equipment and train poll workers.McKiernan and her assistant — the only two election officials in the county — pulled off the quick transition, but it was a struggle.“It’s killing us,” she said. “Mentally and physically, it’s killing us.”In California, Debbie Bautista, Tuolumne County’s clerk and auditor-controller, is worried her 13-year-old voting machines won’t last much longer. The ones that still do work often require repairs.It would cost about $200,000 for the small county to update its voting equipment, Bautista said. But the county, which has 32,000 mostly lower-income registered voters, seems unwilling to make that investment, she said, preferring instead to spend money on a new jail and juvenile center.“We don’t have the money,” she said. “Even though people believe elections are important, they have a hard time justifying the money to run them.”Bautista is hopeful some funds may trickle down from the state level in the coming months. In his budget, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown allocated $134 million to help pay for new voting equipment — about half of what counties need statewide. The state Legislature has until June to reach a budget agreement.“There’s just no finish line in this race,” said Neal Kelley, the registrar of voters for Orange County, California.With the investment from the state, Kelley said his county of 1.6 million registered voters may get new equipment in 2019. Though it is wealthy, the county has been using the same 11,000 voting machines since 2004.Finally Getting SupportJoe Gloria, the registrar of voters for Clark County, Nevada, started seeing some of his voting machines break down around five years ago. If the problems continued, he feared, the public might lose confidence in statewide elections.So, in 2015, he began lobbying the state to help fund updated election equipment. His county, the largest in the state, encompasses Las Vegas and has more than one million registered voters.Soon, election officials from all 17 counties in Nevada joined the fight, and in 2017 the state enacted a law setting aside $8 million to update election equipment ahead of the June 2018 primaries.“Not every county has the resources that we do,” Gloria said. “And I only got a small portion of it.”Clark County received $4.5 million in a state grant. New election equipment, including 5,000 new voting machines, would cost an additional $12.5 million, for a total of $17 million.Douglas County, which hugs the southeastern shore of Lake Tahoe, received $250,000 in grant funding from Nevada, which paid for nearly half of the county’s 147 new voting machines. The new machines, which will replace units that have been in service since 2004, produce a secure paper trail.The state grant “means a lot,” said Kathy Lewis, the clerk-treasurer, even if the county of 37,000 registered voters is one of the more affluent counties in Nevada. It means even more, she said, to the many rural counties who may not have been able to afford upgrades. Esmeralda County, the smallest county in Nevada, has just 600 registered voters.“Elections aren’t in a vacuum,” she said. “We have some very small counties. If they fail, the whole state fails. It’s something we all have to work together to make sure the integrity is there.”States such as Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Utah also enacted legislation in 2017 that allocated money for new election equipment.Norden, at the Brennan Center, recently lauded the Trump-signed spending bill as an “important down payment,” but said it provided “only a fraction of the necessary funds” for states. The reality is that in a U.S. election system with more than 10,000 separate jurisdictions, local election officials are working on limited funding to make sure their polls are secure.“Just because a county might be small, it doesn’t mean they don’t matter,” he said in an interview. “When the election system in this country is so decentralized, you’re only as strong as your weakest link.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

Jay Inslee (D) signed a bill Wednesday that bans youth “conversion therapy,” the medically discredited practice of trying to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.The new law means licensed health care providers won’t be allowed to use the so-called therapy on anyone under 18.It’s another win for proponents of LGBTQ rights, who consider the practice to be dangerously abusive.Eleven states and Washington, D.C., now protect children from conversion therapy, according to The Human Rights Campaign. That figure includes New York state, which does not have a full ban but enacted measures in February 2016 to discourage the practice, forbidding health insurance providers from covering it for anyone under 18.The American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics all consider conversion therapy to be ineffective. The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ rights group, says the practice can also increase the risk of suicide for young members of the community. “Banning conversion therapy sends a loud and unequivocal message to LGBTQ youth: there is nothing wrong with you,” Washington state Sen. Marko Liias (D), the openly gay lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said in a statement.“As a community, we love and support every person and we celebrate the diversity that makes us stronger. I am proud that Washington is standing up for our queer youth and I look forward to the day that these monstrous practices are illegal in every state,” he said.An estimated 20,000 LGBTQ teens now ages 13 to 17 will undergo conversion therapy from a licensed health care professional in states with no protections, according to The Williams Institute at UCLA’s School of Law.Similar legislation is pending in other states, with one measure passing the Maryland state Senate on Wednesday."

Footage from both police body cameras and helicopter coverage showed officers opening fire on Clark; they later said they mistook his cell phone for a gun. Clark was shot 20 times.  On Thursday morning, Clark’s funeral in south Sacramento was held open to the public.Long before the funeral was set to begin, mourners had already lined up down the block of the Bayside of South Sacramento Church. Some of the attendees had driven hours to attend the funeral. Many of those in line were Muslim, coming to pay their respects to a fellow member of their religious community.In a funeral program, Clark was described as a young man who loved sports, had a “great sense of humor” and was the “life of the party.”As the funeral began just before noon, several religious leaders took the podium to read from Christian scripture, the Old Testament and the Quran.“Only Stephon could bring together all races and religions in one room,” one speaker said.At one point, a speaker was interrupted by Clark’s brother Stevante, who took to the podium and in an emotional call to the crowd, yelled: “I am!”“Stephon Clark!” the mourners yelled back. As Rev. Al Sharpton took the stage to deliver his eulogy, he began by repeating Stevante’s call: “I am!”“We will never let you forget the name of Stephon Clark until we get justice,” Sharpton said. “Because this brother could be any one of us.”Sharpton had told reporters ahead of the service that the country should think of Clark’s killing as a national issue, not a local one. “The community has come together to say that we cannot have unarmed people shot by the people we trust to protect and serve,” Sharpton continued. “Look at what we’ve seen all over the country. The president needs to address it. Congress needs to address it.”“We need to deal with this issue and deal with it nationally,” he added.De Angelo Wilson and Ken Ken, who are both from Sacramento and attended the service, said they grew up with Clark and remembered Clark fondly as “an energetic kid.”William, a cousin of Clark’s father who declined to give his last name, told HuffPost that Clark was “a good kid,” but that it’s hard to be perfect “when you come from where we come from.”Clark’s death, one of several high-profile killings of black Sacramento men in the last two years, sparked fierce protests across California’s state capital. Alongside local activists, Clark’s family and friends have shut down Interstate 5, blocked entrance to Sacramento Kings games, disrupted city council meetings and demonstrated outside District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert’s office.“They didn’t have to kill him like that. They didn’t have to shoot him this many times,” said Sequita Thompson, Clark’s grandmother, on Tuesday in Sacramento. “If you’re that scared, you don’t need to be a police officer,” Tanya Faison, the founder of the Black Lives Matter Sacramento chapter, said while protesting outside the DA’s office on Wednesday. BLM and members of the Sacramento community are calling for the firing of the two police officers (who are currently on paid administrative leave). They also want more power and resources given to the Sacramento Community Police Review Commission, a community-led group that reviews police policy, standards, and behavior and provides feedback to the city. Activists say Clark’s shooting is indicative of excessive force used against the black community, and the continued lack of justice for victims of police violence and their families. (On Tuesday, for example, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry announced that the police officers who killed Alton Sterling in the summer of 2016 would not face charges.)The Sacramento BLM chapter is calling to change “use of force” laws practiced by the Sacramento Police Department that broadly allow police officers to whatever amount of force they deem “necessary under the circumstances.” According to Faison, they are “too subjective.” Other groups, like the NAACP, have also condemned the practice.Faison and other community members are also calling to re-elect a new DA in this year’s election, saying that Schubert is not doing enough work for the black community. The incident also inspired outcry on a national scale. Protests have sprung up in other cities across the country, including New York and Phoenix. Prominent black celebrities, activists and influencers have amplified the calls for justice for Clark.California’s Department of Justice announced Tuesday that it would join the investigation into Clark’s death, and also review SPD’s policies and practices.“Although we will continue to coordinate with the Sacramento Police Department, we will retain our independence as we conduct this review,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said at a Tuesday press conference.

She returned on Thursday and was removed by a U.S. marshal. Salman, the 31-year-old widow of Pulse gunman Omar Mateen, is charged with aiding and abetting the attack and obstructing justice for allegedly lying to the FBI. She has pleaded not guilty, and maintains she was in the dark about her husband’s plans. Her lawyers say she was another of his victims, not his co-conspirator. The jury is currently deliberating. After closing arguments on Wednesday, Salman’s family stood outside the federal courthouse to address the media. A reporter asked what Salman will do if she is found not guilty.“She will return to California to be with her son,” replied Susan Clary, the family spokesperson. Referring to Salman’s son, the spokesperson added: “He was asking if she was going to be home to color Easter eggs. I’m not sure whether that’s quite possible ― we can be hopeful about that.”Loomer, a conspiracy theorist who was banned from Uber and Lyft in 2017 after she went on an virulent tirade about Muslim drivers, was among the gaggle of reporters. “You said her son wants to color Easter eggs ― but isn’t Noor Salman Muslim? Why is she celebrating Easter?” Loomer asked. “We believe in all religions,” Salman’s cousin, Susan Adieh, said. Loomer continued pushing. “Do most Muslims color Easter eggs?” she asked.“I’m a Muslim and my kids, they color Easter eggs,” Adieh replied.As the family walked across the street and into the parking lot, Loomer followed, recording with her phone. She repeatedly asked them if jihad means an act of Islamic terrorism. Clary, the family spokesperson, said they weren’t making any more comments. “She stuck her phone in their faces,” Clary said of Loomer. An email from the court later in the day said a reporter had lost their media credentials and was banned from the courthouse after engaging “in highly inappropriate behavior with the Defendant’s family members outside the courthouse.”Loomer, who previously worked for conservative activist James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas, is best known for interrupting a New York production of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” last year that featured a President Donald Trump-like character who was assassinated. Loomer has a documented history of preaching anti-Muslim hate speech. Just last year, Loomer, who calls herself a “proud Islamophobe,” photographed random hijab-wearing women in New York and tweeted that Muslims were “out in full force”She did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In tweets about the trial, Loomer called Salman an “ISIS widow” and a “Real Housewife of ISIS.”There is zero evidence that Salman was radicalized, a fact not disputed by prosecutors. Investigators who scoured through her internet history, phone and social media accounts found nothing to suggest she shared her husband’s extremist views. Clary said Salman’s family was shaken by Loomer’s provocation, and canceled a planned interview with the BBC Thursday morning. “There’s enough pressure already to have a loved one charged in federal court,” Clary said. “On top of that, many people in this community think that because Noor was married to a terrorist that she is a terrorist, and they’ve spent the last month in Orlando trying to show people that she had nothing to do with it.” Many of Salman’s supporters worry that her prosecution is rooted in “gendered Islamophobia and patriarchy.” On the last day of trial testimony, more than 80 domestic violence and civil rights groups released a statement, asking for the charges to be dropped. “She is being prosecuted under the guise of guilt by association as a Muslim woman married to a Muslim man who committed mass violence,” they wrote.If convicted, Salman faces up to life in prison.Rowaida Abdelaziz contributed reporting."

It isn’t the first time, either,” the letter reads. The graphic is not some small piece, but a wide-ranging multimedia effort titled “10 Years After The Crisis,” which takes a look at the uneven economic recovery in the decade since the 2008 financial crisis. The piece includes sections called “Revolving Door Still Spins,” “The Biggest Banks Are Still Big,” “For the Bailouts, Many Unhappy Returns,” and “On the Regulatory Front, Lots of Uncertainty.”The project, which had been in the works for months, was originally published on Tuesday at 7:30 a.m. Eastern, according to a timestamp. Soon after, some senior editors decided the story was not complete enough and subsequently tried to see if the project could be pulled from the site, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.After that “failed,” according to the employees’ letter, the senior editor had the graphic removed from “as many places as possible.”On Thursday, ProPublica reporter and former Wall Street Journal columnist Jesse Eisinger tweeted that he’d heard the senior editor in question was none other than Gerard Baker, the editor-in-chief of The Wall Street Journal. Eisinger has subsequently tweeted that Baker is demanding the piece be “redone” because it focused too much on “social/political” issues.When reached for comment, Steve Severinghaus, senior communications director for Dow Jones, the Journal’s parent company, wouldn’t discuss Baker’s level of involvement. He confirmed that the “team will be adding additional reporting and analysis on the crisis and its aftermath,” but noted the project was never taken down.Baker and his newsroom have appeared at odds since the election of President Donald Trump. Last August, Politico published a transcript of an interview Baker did with Trump that appeared unnecessarily cozy. Later that month, Baker reportedly sent an email to reporters and editors working on an article about a Trump rally that said, “Sorry. This is commentary dressed up as news reporting.”He reportedly added, “Could we please just stick to reporting what he said rather than packaging it in exegesis and selective criticism?” Vanity Fair reported a few months later that many people at The Wall Street Journal are privately hoping Baker’s exit will be sooner rather than later. Here’s the letter Wall Street Journal staffers sent: This week a senior editor at the Wall Street Journal attempted to take a graphic offline because the facts it contained were not politically palatable. When that failed, it was “de-surfaced,” or in other terms, taken off the front page and links were removed to it from as many places as possible. After an early flurry of traffic, views plummeted. This is censorship and it is beneath the standards of the Wall Street Journal. It isn’t the first time, either.If you have any additional information, you can email Maxwell Strachan at maxwell@huffpost.com or maxwellhuffpost@protonmail.com. "

Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) hit back at the conservative Red State blog for using a particularly awful phrase in an article attacking her support of Miguel Perez Jr., a veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan but was still deported to Mexico.Last week, Duckworth, a Black Hawk helicopter pilot who received the Purple Heart for her service in Iraq, appealed to the Department of Homeland Security to review Perez’s deportation case, arguing that deporting him would be a “shocking betrayal” of a veteran who fought for the United States.“Unfortunately, Duckworth really doesn’t have a leg to stand on in making this argument,” the article read ― a highly insulting attack on the senator, who lost both her legs fighting in Iraq when her helicopter was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade.The senator, known for her sharp-witted Twitter responses, sent quite the comeback. “Thanks for noticing, Red State, but you’re wrong. I actually have two legs. They’re made of titanium, and they don’t buckle.”She then launched into a discussion about supporting veterans when they return from war, oftentimes with mental health issues like PTSD.Perez, who was diagnosed with PTSD, served seven years for a felony drug conviction in 2008. His lawyer said his citizenship application was denied because of the felony charge.The Department of Homeland Security did not review Perez’s case as Duckworth requested. Instead, he was flown Friday from Indiana to Texas, where he was then escorted across the border to Mexico."

Sanders called the incidents “terrible.”“We want to make sure all law enforcement is carrying out the letter of the law,” Sanders elaborated. “The president is very supportive of law enforcement. But at the same time, in these specific cases and specific instances, those will be left up to local authorities to make that determination and is not something for the federal government to weigh into.” The American Urban Radio Networks correspondent pressed further. Ryan said the mother of Eric Garner, the black man who died in 2014 after repeating “I can’t breathe” while being restrained by a New York City police officer, is still seeking an indictment and asked whether the president has asked for one or knows what is happening in the case. Sanders again said it was a “local matter.”The city of Sacramento has been in turmoil since Clark’s death on March 18. Protesters gathered at Sacramento City Hall on Tuesday to plead for justice and chant, “No justice, no peace.” Clark was shot 20 times by police officers in his grandparents’ backyard. The officers claimed they believed he was armed, though Clark had only a cellphone in his hand.“We want to find ways to bring the country together ― certainly not looking for any place of division,” Sanders told reporters Wednesday.Sanders was also asked whether the president feels the need to do something to address the concerns of African-American mothers fearing for their children’s lives. The press secretary drew a hard line, saying race is not part of the equation.“I think we should do every single thing we can every single day to protect the people of this country,” Sanders said. “I think the president ― whether they’re black, white, Hispanic, male or female, rich or poor ― we look for ways to protect the individuals in this country, particularly children.”Trump has defended police officers throughout his tenure, saying that they “deserve a greater level of respect and gratitude than they currently receive.” He has characterized protests against police brutality as “anti-police sentiment” that “is wrong and it’s dangerous.” And Trump has repeatedly called on the NFL to crack down on players, such as Colin Kaepernick, who have knelt during the playing of the national anthem to draw attention to racial injustice perpetrated by law enforcement."

Here's How To Make Sure Its Agenda Is, Too.",Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/march-for-our-lives-inclusive_us_5abbf6c9e4b04a59a3140efc,The Parkland students have a lot of work ahead to deliver on the vision they laid out on Saturday. Other activists have advice for how they can get it done.,2018-03-29,"Marjory Stoneman Douglas students wave to the crowd during the March for Our Lives to demand stricter gun control laws on March 24, 2018 in Washington.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd49921e0000fb077b0210.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The message at the March for Our Lives rally in Washington this weekend was clear: Gun violence isn’t just a problem of mass shootings like the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last month. Nor is it isolated to the bloodshed that tears through cities on a daily basis, or to other routine shootings often tied to mental health, domestic violence or police intervention.Gun violence is an all of the above issue.As speakers took the stage on Saturday ― none of them above the age of 19 ― they offered differing perspectives on the many ways guns affect individuals and communities alike.This diversity shouldn’t have come as a shock to anyone following the Stoneman Douglas students as they prepared for the event. In the lead-up to the rally, they spoke out about their own privilege and the need to broaden their scope beyond the mass shootings that rarely, but explosively, strike affluent communities like theirs. They met with students from Chicago and Washington to discuss what gun violence looks like to them, and how best to confront it.The lineup of speakers seemed like proof the Parkland students weren’t just talking the talk. They had worked to make their movement genuinely inclusive, both in terms of race and socioeconomic class, and in its embodiment of the varied experiences of gun violence around the nation.But now comes the hard part for the March for Our Lives movement. As it evolves beyond activism and into more concrete advocacy, the students face the challenge of crafting an agenda that continues to embrace inclusivity while working toward solutions to tackle gun violence in all of its forms.“Gun violence is such a local issue,” said Paul John, leader of the New York City chapter of Million Hoodies, a racial justice group. “Whereas some communities may have more of an issue with domestic violence, certain suburbs may have been impacted my mass shootings, others by suicide.”Each of those problems requires a different set of tools to address. When it comes to urban gun violence in particular, which accounts for a disproportionate share of overall shootings, it can be a challenge to get people outside the affected communities to understand how pervasive and deeply intertwined the issue is with other structural inequities that have long plagued inner-city neighborhoods, John said.“It’s going to be important for the young Parkland students to realize how complex gun violence really is and take steps toward being more informed as to how gun violence affects communities around the country,” he said.The March For Our Lives campaign has already identified a number of policy objectives, including universal background checks for gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons like the AR-15 style rifle used in Parkland. But to those who have been actively involved in community-based gun violence prevention efforts, prescriptions like these are far from a catch-all.“We all agree gun laws are a good start, but we really need to look more comprehensively at what it is that causes people to act out violently,” said Miguel Dominguez, director of youth programs at Community Coalition, a social justice nonprofit in Los Angeles.Lamar Johnson, the violence prevention coordinator for BRAVE (Bold Resistance Against Violence Everywhere), based out of St. Sabina Parish in Chicago, sees it similarly.“We have legislation and we have tough gun laws, but what we don’t have is investment in our community,” he said.A decadeslong lack of investment in neighborhoods in Chicago and Los Angeles has helped feed a “culture of violence,” said Johnson. With little funding for schools, businesses and social services, many local kids suffer from a lack of opportunity, which serves as a pipeline into the sorts of criminal activity that often leads to shootings.Both Community Coalition and BRAVE take a holistic approach to violence prevention, providing outreach to youth to give them the skills and resources they need to resist the traps that can lead them down these roads in the first place. Youth leaders from both organizations spoke on Saturday to offer a window into the realities they face. Edna Chavez, a 17-year-old from Los Angeles, recalled learning how to “duck from bullets” before she could read. Trevon Bosley, a 19-year-old from Chicago, reminded the crowd that “everyday shootings are everyday problems.” Chavez and Bosley both lost brothers to gun violence.Johnson said he was happy to see those voices represented at the March for Our Lives, but he noted that initiatives like BRAVE need more than just a larger stage from which to tell their stories.“People figure they gave us a platform to speak so they did their due diligence, which is like a slap to the face, because giving me a microphone means nothing if you’re not going to give me the funding and the resources for my youth program and violence prevention programs,” said Johnson. “We still have to go back into this crime element we live in every day.” St. Sabina has seen an uptick in calls from interested donors since Bosley’s speech, said Johnson. But so far, there have been no celebrities or high-dollar donations ― no Oprah, or George and Amal Clooney, who together donated $1 million to the March for Our Lives.“We’re still pushing for that and we still need that and that’s why we’re trying to publicize it as much as possible to say, it’s not just in Chicago but in all the urban cities across America that have the same issues,” said Johnson.Johnson added that his BRAVE members have remained in touch with the Parkland students, and that they’ve discussed additional events for the summer, when violence in Chicago and in many cities tends to spike.The March for Our Lives students will need to continue actively fostering this collaboration if they want to keep their movement truly inclusive, said Amber Goodwin, founder and executive director of Community Justice Reform Coalition, a national advocacy group focused on gun violence prevention. Goodwin said this sort of cooperation will be mutually beneficial.“Plugging in with groups that are already doing the local work is really important,” she said. “It’s a great way to show partnership, but also to meet people where they’re already at, versus asking people to come to where folks in the gun violence prevention space have been for so long.”A crucial part of this alliance will involve the Parkland kids simply listening to the concerns of other communities and using their input to inform the movement’s agenda, said Goodwin. Policies can have different effects and connotations for different groups of people, and solutions that appeal to some may seem dangerous to others.That disparity was on display in Parkland this week, where a group of black Stoneman Douglas students spoke out, explaining that the increased police presence at school since the shooting made them uncomfortable. They also said they felt they’d been left out of conversations about the local response to the massacre.This sort of oversight has cropped up in the national gun violence prevention movement as well, said Goodwin, who previously worked for the gun control organization launched by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). She said many groups working on the issue been “siloed,” which has meant marginalized communities have sometimes not had “the self-determination and the space” to be able to advocate for their specific needs.The March for Our Lives was an all-too-rare example of what it looks like when these communities are given that opportunity, said Goodwin. She advised the Stoneman Douglas students to continue reaching out to elected officials and organizations that center communities of color, and to take advantage of existing local partnerships and gun violence prevention programs that have already shown tangible results.“This has to be an intersectional issue,” said Goodwin. “But it’s not just a matter of saying that things are not diverse and that we need diversity and inclusion; it’s actually going to be dismantling a lot of the systems that have been built.”That won’t be an easy task, Goodwin admits, which is one reason she believes the young organizers behind March for Our Lives shouldn’t be afraid to lean on adults for their experience and expertise.“Yes, young people should lead, but we should be thinking about how we do this inter-generationally, where we’re looking at the strategies that have worked for more seasoned organizers,” she said.But even if the March for Our Lives students do dedicate themselves to building and strengthening these sort of partnerships, many of the obstacles for local gun violence prevention efforts will remain. Getting the necessary resources and support needed for them to succeed is a constant struggle, said Paul of Million Hoodies.“Many times, the local governments are strapped for funding to implement these strategies ... so being able to bring in private funding and being able to bring in people who are looking to support gun violence prevention organizations on a consistent basis is key,” he said.With a massive platform, the March for Our Lives organizers may be able to help channel resources toward those initiatives.Another way the March for Our Lives movement can champion these causes is through the ballot. Organizers made a big push to register voters at the weekend rallies, and the Parkland students have made the November elections a key focal point in the movement.But activists want young people to know that it’s not just a matter of backing members of Congress who support gun reform. It’s also about mayors, city councilmembers and other local officials who, in some ways, have more direct power to address gun violence in their communities.Although the Parkland students have a lot of work ahead to ensure that their movement can deliver on the promising vision laid out on Saturday, John is cautiously optimistic that they’ll be able to succeed where others have failed.“Generation after generation, you see people become at least a little more radical in their thinking of how to change the world,” he said. “These young folks, I think, are much more willing to work together than I’ve seen historically in this movement.”"

Nor is it isolated to the bloodshed that tears through cities on a daily basis, or to other routine shootings often tied to mental health, domestic violence or police intervention.Gun violence is an all of the above issue.As speakers took the stage on Saturday ― none of them above the age of 19 ― they offered differing perspectives on the many ways guns affect individuals and communities alike.This diversity shouldn’t have come as a shock to anyone following the Stoneman Douglas students as they prepared for the event. In the lead-up to the rally, they spoke out about their own privilege and the need to broaden their scope beyond the mass shootings that rarely, but explosively, strike affluent communities like theirs. They met with students from Chicago and Washington to discuss what gun violence looks like to them, and how best to confront it.The lineup of speakers seemed like proof the Parkland students weren’t just talking the talk. They had worked to make their movement genuinely inclusive, both in terms of race and socioeconomic class, and in its embodiment of the varied experiences of gun violence around the nation.But now comes the hard part for the March for Our Lives movement. As it evolves beyond activism and into more concrete advocacy, the students face the challenge of crafting an agenda that continues to embrace inclusivity while working toward solutions to tackle gun violence in all of its forms.“Gun violence is such a local issue,” said Paul John, leader of the New York City chapter of Million Hoodies, a racial justice group. “Whereas some communities may have more of an issue with domestic violence, certain suburbs may have been impacted my mass shootings, others by suicide.”Each of those problems requires a different set of tools to address. When it comes to urban gun violence in particular, which accounts for a disproportionate share of overall shootings, it can be a challenge to get people outside the affected communities to understand how pervasive and deeply intertwined the issue is with other structural inequities that have long plagued inner-city neighborhoods, John said.“It’s going to be important for the young Parkland students to realize how complex gun violence really is and take steps toward being more informed as to how gun violence affects communities around the country,” he said.The March For Our Lives campaign has already identified a number of policy objectives, including universal background checks for gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons like the AR-15 style rifle used in Parkland. But to those who have been actively involved in community-based gun violence prevention efforts, prescriptions like these are far from a catch-all.“We all agree gun laws are a good start, but we really need to look more comprehensively at what it is that causes people to act out violently,” said Miguel Dominguez, director of youth programs at Community Coalition, a social justice nonprofit in Los Angeles.Lamar Johnson, the violence prevention coordinator for BRAVE (Bold Resistance Against Violence Everywhere), based out of St. Sabina Parish in Chicago, sees it similarly.“We have legislation and we have tough gun laws, but what we don’t have is investment in our community,” he said.A decadeslong lack of investment in neighborhoods in Chicago and Los Angeles has helped feed a “culture of violence,” said Johnson. With little funding for schools, businesses and social services, many local kids suffer from a lack of opportunity, which serves as a pipeline into the sorts of criminal activity that often leads to shootings.Both Community Coalition and BRAVE take a holistic approach to violence prevention, providing outreach to youth to give them the skills and resources they need to resist the traps that can lead them down these roads in the first place. Youth leaders from both organizations spoke on Saturday to offer a window into the realities they face. Edna Chavez, a 17-year-old from Los Angeles, recalled learning how to “duck from bullets” before she could read. Trevon Bosley, a 19-year-old from Chicago, reminded the crowd that “everyday shootings are everyday problems.” Chavez and Bosley both lost brothers to gun violence.Johnson said he was happy to see those voices represented at the March for Our Lives, but he noted that initiatives like BRAVE need more than just a larger stage from which to tell their stories.“People figure they gave us a platform to speak so they did their due diligence, which is like a slap to the face, because giving me a microphone means nothing if you’re not going to give me the funding and the resources for my youth program and violence prevention programs,” said Johnson. “We still have to go back into this crime element we live in every day.” St. Sabina has seen an uptick in calls from interested donors since Bosley’s speech, said Johnson. But so far, there have been no celebrities or high-dollar donations ― no Oprah, or George and Amal Clooney, who together donated $1 million to the March for Our Lives.“We’re still pushing for that and we still need that and that’s why we’re trying to publicize it as much as possible to say, it’s not just in Chicago but in all the urban cities across America that have the same issues,” said Johnson.Johnson added that his BRAVE members have remained in touch with the Parkland students, and that they’ve discussed additional events for the summer, when violence in Chicago and in many cities tends to spike.The March for Our Lives students will need to continue actively fostering this collaboration if they want to keep their movement truly inclusive, said Amber Goodwin, founder and executive director of Community Justice Reform Coalition, a national advocacy group focused on gun violence prevention.

Everybody should want an employee like this. Who would be so loyal, so loyal to your boss that you would protect that person.”The “Today” show conversation continued with Schwartz saying that Cohen had never threatened anyone, specifically former adult film star Stormy Daniels; that Cohen “doesn’t do that”; and that if he were going to do that, “he does it to someone’s face.”Daniels, who took hush money in 2016 to hide an alleged affair with Donald Trump a decade earlier, claims that Cohen ordered a threat against her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011.Schwartz insisted, “He would never do something like that.”Kelly fired back that “Michael Cohen does have a history of making vulgar and allegedly or arguably threatening comments.”“I myself have been on the receiving end of those, as you know,” said Kelly.She then pointed to one instance, after a 2016 election debate, in which Cohen retweeted a series of threatening messages ― one of which included a call to “gut” Kelly.“So you’re not Michael’s favorite person,” said Schwartz. “It’s not a love connection, OK, so all right.” Kelly didn’t like that response. “You make light of it now,” she said, “but I’m telling you, in response to that allegation that I received death threats, I had security guards following me around and that my old boss called Michael Cohen directly to say, ‘If Megyn Kelly gets killed, it’s not going to help your client Donald Trump get elected.’ And Michael Cohen didn’t care.”Schwartz suggested that Cohen was actually “trying to help.” “He was trying to help me!?” said Kelly. “He was trying to help me? By suggesting that I should be gutted?”Schwartz then tried the two-sides-to-every-question approach.“I don’t accept everything that you’re saying, because he has another side to the story. Maybe one day you guys can talk this out,” he said.“Because there are two sides to every story,” he added. “It’s not just Megyn’s side of the story. There are other sides.”“It’s not just my side,” said Kelly. “Read Twitter!”"

The informant, Dan Day, testified that he was driving a truck with militia group member Patrick Stein in February 2016 during a mission to conduct “surveillance” of Somali Muslim immigrants in Garden City, Kansas, when they spotted two dark-skinned women in headscarves walking across a parking lot.“I could knock ’em off, kill ’em right there,” Stein said, according to Day. “Those fucking raghead bitches,” Stein also said, loud enough for the women to hear, as he grabbed a black handgun in the truck. “Did you do anything to possibly stop him?” the prosecutor asked Day in court Wednesday.“As [Stein] was pulling out his weapon, I was actually pulling out my weapon also,” Day recalled. The prosecutor asked why.“Um,” Day responded, choking back tears. “I was not going to let him kill these innocent women because they were who they were, because they were Somalis or Muslims.”“It was very scary,” he added. “I thought I might have to kill somebody. I’m not a killer.”Day said he eventually calmed Stein down and they drove away. He still remembers the “fear” in the eyes of the two women.Stein and two other men — Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright — are on trial this week at a federal courthouse in Wichita, accused of being part of a 2016 terrorism plot to massacre Muslims. Prosecutors say the three men, all members of a militia group called the Crusaders, had planned to bomb a Garden City apartment complex that housed Somali refugees, whom the men referred to as “cockroaches.” Prosecutors say the trio scheduled the attack for the day after the 2016 presidential election, so as not to hurt President Donald Trump’s chances of victory.Their plot was foiled, however, in large part due to evidence collected by Day, whom the FBI recruited as an informant in 2016, the prosecution said.Wednesday marked Day’s first appearance in the trial, which started last week. Stein, Allen and Wright have pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy against civil rights. The trial is expected to last through April, when a nearly all-white jury will determine the militiamen’s fate. If convicted, they face life in prison.As an informant, Day secretly recorded the men openly discussing killing Muslims. “The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim,” Stein said in one taped conversation. “If you’re a Muslim, I’m going to enjoy shooting you in the head.”But the defendants’ attorneys have thus far characterized such talk of slaughtering Muslims as mere bluster. “Locker room talk” is what Allen’s attorney, Rich Federico, called it. “Bull sessions” is how Wright’s attorney, Kari Schmidt, referred to it.But in court Wednesday, Day made it clear that he thought Stein, the ringleader of the group, really wanted to massacre Muslims.“He could be a normal person,” Day said of Stein. But when he talked about Somalis, Day said, Stein “did a total 180. It was like Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. He got angry, very angry.”Day recounted another incident when he and Stein monitored Somali Muslims in Garden City back in 2016. (Anti-government militia groups in America have become increasingly paranoid about, and hateful of, Muslims in recent years. It’s common for such groups to surveil peaceful Muslim communities.) Day says he and Stein were driving by the Somali apartment complex that Stein, Allen and Wright allegedly would go on to target in their bomb plot.“He was irate that there were so many Somalis,” Day recalled.“Muslims are like cockroaches,” Day said Stein told him. “You can’t kill one of them. You have to kill all of them. They keep coming back. You have to exterminate them all.”Day is expected to take the stand again Thursday morning.HuffPost is in Wichita, Kansas, to cover this terrorism trial. Check back for updates. "
22,POLITICS,ICE Ends Policy Of Presuming Release For Pregnant Detainees,Elise Foley and Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-customs-enforcement-pregnant-women_us_5abd07d7e4b03e2a5c7a4262,"Instead, pregnant women will be released from immigrant detention only on a case-by-case basis.",2018-03-29,"Thomas Homan (right), the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, outlined the agency's policy change in a Dec. 14 directive.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd08161f0000270616bd9a.jpeg?cache=IqRRnmOkpQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Trump administration has abandoned a policy of generally releasing pregnant women from immigrant detention, according to a directive publicly shared by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Thursday. Under the new policy, pregnant women will be released from immigrant detention only on a case-by-case basis. Since at least 2011, ICE had implemented a policy that generally favored releasing pregnant women from detention. But the policy also provided exemptions for women facing mandatory detention or security threats. In practice, ICE detained more than 500 pregnant women in 2016, the last full year the policy was in effect.With the change, outlined in a Dec. 14 directive signed by acting ICE Director Thomas Homan, ICE will no longer presumptively release pregnant women from detention. It supersedes a 2016 memo, also signed by Homan, that codified the policy against detaining pregnant women except under “extraordinary circumstances or the requirement of mandatory detention.” Under the new policy, ICE will detain “only those whose detention is necessary to effectuate removal, as well as those deemed a flight risk or danger to the community,” according to a fact sheet obtained by HuffPost. ICE will generally not detain pregnant women during their third trimester.Philip Miller, deputy executive associate director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, told reporters on Thursday that many pregnant women encountered by immigration enforcement are already subject to mandatory detention by law, particularly if they were apprehended at the border and are not deemed eligible to move forward with any claims for relief.Others may be subject to mandatory detention because they committed certain crimes within the U.S. Since the policy went into effect in December, ICE has detained a total of 506 pregnant women, according to ICE, though the agency did not say how many of those women were later deported or released into the U.S. He said that on March 20, the last date for which ICE has the data, there were 35 pregnant women in detention, all of them subject to mandatory detention. “To miscategorize this as some wholesale change or some kind of draconian act is really just hyperbole,” Miller said. “We’re aligning this policy, as we have with all of our policies, with the direction from the president.”The changes, which will apply to pregnant women seeking asylum, bring ICE policy closer in line with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump a week after taking office last year. That order scrapped the Obama-era prosecutorial discretion policy instructing officers to deprioritize detaining and deporting certain immigrants.Several human rights organizations filed a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security in September on behalf of pregnant women detained by ICE. The complaint alleged that ICE was failing to abide by its own policy against detaining pregnant women and that the women were not being given adequate care.Critics maintain that ICE detention centers are ill-equipped to treat the complex medical issues pregnant women face. Two women told HuffPost they lost pregnancies at ICE detention centers last year.Immigrant women in detention are also sometimes the victims of rape, said Kathryn Shepherd of the American Immigration Council, which was one of the groups that filed a complaint last year against the detention of pregnant women.“Being in detention is not an appropriate setting for not just a pregnant woman, but a pregnant woman who may or may not be pregnant as a result of a significant trauma like that,” she said.Michelle Brané of the Women’s Refugee Commission, which was also part of the complaint, said ICE did not notify her organization after the directive in December, even though the two groups have been in communication with each other. Still, she said she was not surprised by the policy change ― it is one that immigrant rights advocates feared was coming after Trump’s executive order last year.  She said it is impossible to know for sure whether the number of pregnant detainees will go up, but “it’s pretty clear that the intent is to reduce the number of pregnant women who are released.” Alternatives to detention, like mandatory check-ins or ankle bracelets, are both more humane and less expensive for taxpayers than detaining pregnant women, she said.“The crazy thing about it is they’re claiming it’s because they should be treated like everyone else and that they’re going to go after everybody who has immigration status issues, but the reality is that those aren’t your only options,” Brané said. “Not detaining a pregnant woman doesn’t mean she won’t have to go through the immigration legal process.”This story has been updated with more details of and reaction to the policy change."

The team had been en route to another excavation site when an outcropping of rocks from the Triassic period caught Gay’s eye. They stopped to investigate and immediately began picking up fossilized chunks of bone.“The entire surface was carpeted with fossil bones,” Gay, the education director at the Colorado Canyons Association, told HuffPost. “Everywhere on the hillside, for 60 meters.” What Gay’s team discovered could be the densest bed of Triassic-era fossils in the nation, and maybe the world. During an initial excavation at the site last year, he unearthed the intact skulls of three long-snouted phytosaurs, a reptile that lived more than 200 million years ago. That’s nearly 120 million years before Tyrannosaurus rex showed up.During the Triassic period, which spanned 251 million to 199 million years ago, dinosaurs and a slew of other bizarre creatures roamed the Earth. There were many crocodile-like reptiles — armored plant-eaters, a two-legged species with a beak, and another with a blowhole on its head — along with “salamanders the size of cars, with toilet bowl lid heads,” Gay said. The period ended with a global extinction event that wiped out some 76 percent of marine and terrestrial species. And thus began the Jurassic period, the age of the dinosaurs.Gay says he’s only scratched the surface of the fossil record at this Utah site, a record he believes could prove key to understanding how dinosaurs were able to respond to rapid climatic changes and came to dominate the landscape.“This is the find of a lifetime,” he said. “I will probably spend the rest of my career working on this site.”HuffPost talked to Gay this week at the first of two public scoping meetings the federal government held to receive input on managing what remains of Bears Ears National Monument. Trump’s December announcement cut Bears Ears by 85 percent, to just over 200,000 acres, opening the door for new mining, drilling and other development on lands now left outside of the monument.Gay still has a permit to work the site, but because it is no longer part of a national monument, he and his team are unable to use the $25,000 grant they received through a special Bureau of Land Management program that funds research on conservation lands. Gay said he can use the funds for other sites still in the monument, but not this one.Work at the site will remain stalled until the team locates another source of funding. Gay has applied for other grants and is exploring partnerships that would allow for his team to continue field work there.The question he’s looking to answer: “Why did dinosaurs come to rule the world?”The latest fossil discovery is one of several important paleontological sites within the area cut from the monument. And Gay, who opposes the monument rollback, said there is much more to be discovered. Bears Ears “preserves a unique slice of American history and pre-history dating back almost to the dawn of life on land,” he said. "

Several national retailers still ran ads during the commercial breaks, including Gillette and Progressive Insurance, although ThinkProgress’ Judd Legum noted that the Ad Council was also featured, possibly as filler material.A spokeswoman for Wayfair, which pulled its ads, told HuffPost that Ingraham’s comments were “not consistent with our values.”“As a company, we support open dialogue and debate on issues,” the Wayfair spokeswoman said. “However, the decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values. We do not plan to continue advertising on this particular program.”The announcements from those three companies and others came a day after Ingraham mocked David Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, for not getting accepted into a few of the colleges he’d applied to.In response, Hogg called on people to pressure a dozen companies to remove their ads from Ingraham’s programs, which include “The Ingraham Angle” and a morning radio show on Talk 1370 AM of Austin, Texas. The companies pulling ads have focused on the Fox program. Hogg also tweeted out a list of advertisers compiled by Media Matters for America, a progressive media watchdog.Ingraham apologized Thursday afternoon on Twitter for “any upset or hurt my tweet caused [Hogg] or any of the brave victims of Parkland.”Hogg dismissed Ingraham’s apology in an interview Thursday with The New York Times.“She only apologized after we went after her advertisers,” Hogg said. “It kind of speaks for itself. ... I’m not going to stoop to her level and go after her on a personal level. I’m going to go after her advertisers.”Ingraham’s apology also did not stem the tide of advertisers pulling back from her show on Thursday.Expedia and Nestlé told HuffPost that they would no longer advertise on her program but did not immediately specify when this decision was made or whether her remarks about Hogg played a role in it.“We have no plans to buy ads on the show in the future,” the Nestlé spokesman said.Johnson & Johnson told HuffPost that it “will pull advertising from Ms. Ingraham’s show.” Stitch Fix also confirmed that it would stop purchasing ads on her program. A representative for Jenny Craig said, “We have decided to take steps to discontinue advertising on this show.”Hulu tweeted Thursday evening in reply to Hogg, saying it would similarly cease such advertising.Jos. A. Bank told The Daily Beast that it had no plans to buy ads on her program in the future.HuffPost reached out to every company on the advertiser lists from Hogg and Media Matters. A representative of Fox News declined to comment beyond Ingraham’s apology on Twitter.This article has been updated as additional companies have spoken out."
25,CRIME,Court Rules Adnan Syed Of 'Serial' Podcast Has The Right To A New Trial,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adnan-syed-serial-podcast-new-trial_us_5abd1f47e4b03e2a5c7a6dd1,But prosecutors could still appeal that decision.,2018-03-29,"Adnan Syed leaves the Baltimore City Circuit Courthouse in Baltimore, Maryland, on Feb. 5, 2016. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd20b32000001311eb3642.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Adnan Syed, whose case was made famous by the 2014 podcast “Serial,” has the right to a new trial, a Maryland court ruled Thursday.Syed has maintained that he was wrongfully convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee as a teenager in 1999. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals upheld Syed’s claim that he received “ineffective assistance of counsel.”Thursday’s decision could go next to the Maryland Court of Appeals. A representative for the office of Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh told The Baltimore Sun that the state’s attorneys are “currently reviewing today’s decision to determine next steps.”“Serial,” which meticulously re-examined the murder in Baltimore and original 2000 trial, helped bring renewed attention to Syed’s case. The case was later reopened. “‘Serial’ was enormously helpful,” a lawyer for Syed, Justin Brown, said at a press conference shortly after the verdict was read. “[Syed] asked me to convey his deep gratitude and thanks from the bottom of his heart to all those who have supported him and believed in him.”Syed’s lawyers may try to secure bail to get him out of prison ― where he has been for 19 years ― as they hope for a retrial. “If we get back in court for a jury trial, we like our chances,” Brown said. “We like them a lot. We think that we would win a trial.”In 2016, a lower court judge in Baltimore vacated Syed’s murder conviction and determined he had the right to a new trial, citing poor legal counsel he received at the time. The podcast had revealed that Syed’s attorney, Cristina Gutierrez, did not contact a key witness, classmate Asia McClain. “‘Serial’ kind of shook the trees and that enabled us to get in contact with Asia McClain,” Brown said.Gutierrez also did not include an expert on cell phone towers, and Syed’s original conviction relied heavily on potentially faulty cell phone data.Prosecutors appealed the lower court’s decision, but, on Thursday, the panel of appeals court judges upheld the original ruling.Brown said the state now has 30 days to file a petition to appeal once more, a move that could result in another year, or more, of legal proceedings. Brown and Rabia Chaudry, a lawyer and family friend who originally brought Syed’s story to the creators of “Serial,” celebrated the news over Twitter. “Serial” creator Sarah Koenig declined to comment when reached by HuffPost.Sara Boboltz contributed reporting.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said “Serial” came out in 2015. It also said the Maryland Court of Appeals had issued the decision on Thursday. Additionally, Hae Min Lee was Syed’s ex-girlfriend at the time she was killed, not his girlfriend. Language has also been amended to reflect that prosecutors could still appeal. "
26,BLACK VOICES,People Want To Know Why Brooklyn Museum's New African Art Curator Is White,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brooklyn-museum-white-curator-african-art_us_5abc09e6e4b06409775cd2d7,"The curator is qualified for the job, but art scholars say people of color are qualified, too.",2018-03-29,The Brooklyn Museum hired a white curator for its African art exhibits.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abc345f1f00002d0016bc3f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Brooklyn Museum is having a “Black Panther” moment.The museum announced on Monday that it had appointed two new curators: Drew Sawyer for photography, and Kristen Windmuller-Luna, who will manage the museum’s African art collections.People are not happy that both curators, but particularly Windmuller-Luna, are white.Most critics of the choice, including scholars who work in the field of art history, wondered why the museum couldn’t find a qualified black candidate as a curator of African art. Some said the hire highlighted a general lack of diversity in the arts, while others suggested the hires were just another sign of Brooklyn’s gentrification.Meanwhile, other Twitter users are comparing the hire to the museum heist scene from the hit film “Black Panther.” The scene begins with antagonist Erik “Killmonger” Stevens browsing through a museum while security watches closely over him. A white female curator eventually approaches Killmonger and gives him the history of the West African artifacts he’s looking at.When Killmonger tells her that one of the artifacts actually originated from the fictional Wakanda and was stolen by British soldiers, the curator looks surprised.“How do you think your ancestors got these,” Killmonger asks the woman, after saying he would take the artifact. “Do you think they paid a fair price? Or did they take it, like they took everything else?” “We as museum professionals need to talk about the inclusion of this scene,” writes Casey Haughin, a Johns Hopkins University art student and editor of The Hopkins Exhibitionist, in an op-ed that went viral in February.“The museum is presented as an illegal mechanism of colonialism, and along with that, a space which does not even welcome those whose culture it displays,” she continued.That scene from the fictional Marvel film, and now the Brooklyn Museum’s latest hire, illustrate the very real lack of diversity in the art world.African-Americans made up a mere 4 percent of all curators, conservators, educators and museum leaders, while Hispanics made up 3 percent and Asians made up 6 percent, according to a widespread museum demographic survey completed by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in 2015. White scholars occupied those roles at overwhelming rates, while people of color were more represented at museums through janitorial or security roles.“Art history, generally, has not always attracted people of color or first-generation students,” Chika Okeke-Agulu, a professor of African art at Princeton University, told HuffPost in an email.“And there is still not enough black and African students in US institutions interested in studying and making a career in ancestral arts of African societies, the sort of art that still form the core of African art collections of museums like Brooklyn.”But Okeke-Agulu, whom Windmuller-Luna studied under while earning her Ph.D., does not think that museums should only hire black curators to oversee African exhibits.“Do I think that museums should only hire black curators to oversee their African art collections? Absolutely not; or we might as well prevent non-black students from studying or seeking a career in the field,” he said.“Should museums make sure that they don’t overlook qualified black curators in their curatorial and senior management job search process? Absolutely.”Mariët Westermann, vice president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, noted in the summary for the foundation’s 2015 survey that underrepresentation of people of color is a well-known phenomenon within museum circles.That’s partly why art scholars of color are angry over the Brooklyn Museum’s hire.“These are fraught issues, and the curator in question is a highly qualified scholar poised to do great work,” Ananda Cohen-Aponte, an art historian who teaches at Cornell University, wrote on Twitter.“But we’re in a complex cultural moment where institutions are being held accountable in unprecedented ways, [especially with] social media bringing many more into the [conversation].”While people are criticizing the museum of hiring Windmuller-Luna, Okeke-Agulu thinks that the Brooklyn Museum has done a fair job of encouraging a diverse staff ― especially considering the art world’s general elitism.“The art world ― as constituted by scholars, curators, critics, collectors, dealers, schools, museums, and art administrators ― has always been elitist, and that won’t be changing anytime soon, largely because of the long-established entanglement of art, money and power,” he told HuffPost, adding that the diversity of “any given society’s elite class has direct bearing [on] the diversity of its art world.”“Still, some museums have done more in diversifying its curatorial staff than others,” Okeke-Agulu added. “And I think that Brooklyn has been much more active in this respect than many of its peers in New York and elsewhere in the US. Take a look at its curatorial staff.”In a statement to HuffPost on April 6, a week after this story was first published, Brooklyn Museum director Anne Pasternak said the museum “unequivocally stands by” its decision to hire Windmuller-Luna.“We were deeply dismayed when the conversation about this appointment turned to personal attacks on this individual,” Pasternak said. “Many respected scholars in the field have expressed the same sentiment.”Pasternak cited Nigerian-American arts leader Okwui Enwezor as a scholar who is disappointed in the backlash against Windmuller-Luna, his former student.“The criticism around her appointment can be described as arbitrary at best, and chilling at worst,” Pasternak quoted Enwezor as saying.According to Pasternak, a museum committee made up of members from several departments completed a yearlong search to fill the position of African art curator and “unanimously selected” Windmuller-Luna due to her expertise and experience.According to several biographies of her published by universities and museums, she has received her Ph.D. in African Art History from Princeton University, worked as an African Arts research specialist at Princeton’s art museum, and is a lecturer at Columbia University.While Brooklyn Museum supports Windmuller-Luna’s hiring, Pasternak said the museum is aware that the “longstanding and pervasive issues of structural racism profoundly affect the lives of people of color.”“It is right to press museums and other institutions to diversify their leadership,” she added. To be sure, Windmuller-Luna is qualified for her new job. But the question many people are asking is whether there was an art scholar of color suitable for the role, too. And, in case the museum couldn’t find one, Cohen-Aponte has started a #POCarthistory Twitter thread filled with exceptionally qualified candidates.This story has been updated with comment from Chika Okeke-Agulu and an April 6 statement from the Brooklyn Museum."

The bodies of three of their adopted children, 19-year-old Markis, 14-year-old Jeremiah and 14-year-old Abigail were recovered nearby.Allman believes the boy from the viral photo, Devonte, 15, and two other siblings, Hannah, 16, and Sierra, 12, were also passengers in the vehicle when it plummeted into the ocean on Monday. Calls to 9-1-1 alerted police.“We know that an entire family vanished,” Allman said at a news conference Wednesday. (Watch it below.)Despite reports of turmoil in the family, Allman said law enforcement believes the tragedy was an accident.In 2014, Devonte provided a unifying moment amid nationwide demonstrations after a police officer escaped indictment for fatally shooting teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. At a protest in Portland, Oregon, a police officer saw Devonte, then 12, holding a “Free Hugs” sign and asked to share an embrace.The two hugged, and the image of the black child and white officer became a sensation on social media."

It’s a notoriously unwelcoming field for women of color, but she’s ready for it. Ideas for apps are already popping into her head, like one to streamline route planning for student bus systems.A few hours each day, in addition to her usual classes at one of the city’s top public high schools, Rayford attends an academic and athletic youth program. She’s taken several tech-focused workshops at the nonprofit Downtown Boxing Gym, located on a stretch of road where many of the buildings have been torn down and greenery is reclaiming the empty spaces.In addition to teaching kids proper combat footwork and punching techniques, the gym also offers free programs for academic achievement and career readiness. It’s where Rayford learned how to set up a wireless network, take apart a computer and test out a 3-D printer. She was failing math when she started at the gym as a sophomore; a tutor helped pull up her scores. Rayford still occasionally trains with a boxing coach, but most days she heads straight to the gym’s computer lab to do homework or write scholarship essays. With no computer at home and unreliable internet, every minute counts. If she doesn’t finish her schoolwork at the gym, she’ll set up shop on a computer at Cass Technical High School, occasionally skipping a class to complete an assignment for another teacher. There are other obstacles: A recent project required Microsoft Word, but the school had stopped paying for the software. So Rayford figured out a workaround, Google Docs, which she now uses to tap out essays on her phone at night. “Everything is so zoomed in, and it’s harder to spell-check and make sure your paragraphs are spaced right,” she told HuffPost. “You know what you’re doing on a computer, compared to a phone.”Cobbling together computer time frustrates Rayford, but it’s an ordinary burden for students in Detroit. The largely African-American city of 675,000 has the lowest rate of internet connection in the country. Nearly 40 percent of households have no home internet and more than 15 percent only have cellular data plans, according to U.S. census estimates. Twenty percent have no computer or smartphone. (Nationwide, 5 million school-age kids don’t have internet at home, according to the Pew Research Center.)Recent research in Detroit indicates that most teens have some kind of access to the internet ― but far fewer have reliable internet and computers at home. Many students have more tenuous connections, relying on schools and libraries to get online, or else hopping on and off public WiFi connections from their mobile phones.As technology becomes increasingly essential for achievement and employment tasks, advocates worry Detroit’s digital divide shuts students out of opportunities they desperately need ― most kids live in poverty, and young adult unemployment is more than double the national rate.  Connectivity is “the gateway to so many pieces of life and the economy that the lack of access to internet is really contributing to many of the disparities that we see in urban areas,” said Vernice Anthony, interim chief executive of Focus: Hope. The civil rights nonprofit offers education programs and job training, including information technology certifications.National figures gloss over the real divide in Detroit’s internet ecosystem, Michigan State University researchers suggested in a January report. Instead of a total lack of internet access, they see a “mobile-only divide.” They mailed surveys about internet use to more than 500 residents in three neighborhoods. Nearly all respondents reported using the internet, which surprised William Dutton, MSU professor of media and information policy and co-author of the report. Dutton told HuffPost he was specifically impressed by teens’ ingenious strategies for getting online ― whether tracking public locations with open networks or befriending classmates with WiFi at home. Nearly half the residents in the survey said they primarily used the internet on their phones. Many of them, particularly teens, don’t see that as a disadvantage ― but those users, with limited device capabilities and data caps, were less likely to report “productive” uses, such as homework and job searches. “The strong dependence on mobile phones ― while it mitigates some of the worst digital divides somewhat ― may be holding Detroiters back,” the report warns.Bridging the digital divide isn’t just about providing cheap, fast internet. Computer access matters, as Dutton explained. And tools aren’t that useful if students aren’t taught how to use them. Qumisha “Q” Goss, who runs tech programs at the Parkman library branch near Focus: Hope, said adults often overlook kids’ digital literacy, assuming they’ll intuit technology they grew up with. But when students, who can be experts in social media, use library computers for school, she finds, they’re unfamiliar with basics like how to fill out a spreadsheet or how to double-space a document. “That part is kind of heartbreaking for me, because I feel like they’re being neglected,” Goss said. One of the classes Goss developed is Parkman Coders. She’s taught kids programming with Minecraft, a popular computer game, and by using cheap, cutting-edge hardware built for learning, like Raspberry Pi mini-computers and micro:bits. When former students rack up fees on overdue coding books, Goss is happy to forgive their fines. Parkman and the Downtown Boxing Gym ignite some students’ untapped passion for tech and give useful digital skills to more. Of the 300 kids who have gone through the gym’s youth learning program, all have graduated high school, compared with a 78 percent graduation rate in Detroit’s public school district last year. And Parkman has students returning summer after summer for the coding programs. A smattering of other local organizations are doing similar work or expanding digital equity. However, community programs ultimately serve only a fraction of Detroit’s disconnected students. (The gym currently serves 185 kids but has more than 800 on its waiting list.) Closing the digital divide on a broader level is more challenging. Nine years ago, Focus: Hope and other partners taught computer skills to 6,000 residents, gave out thousands of discounted computers and worked with an initiative that brought free broadband to a few hundred people. Despite the program’s impact, it ended when federal funding dried up, and residents lost internet after the service provider went bankrupt.Internet providers help some get past the cost hurdle, with $10 monthly plans for low-income families. One in 20 residents gets internet through Comcast Essentials, which also offers cheap laptops, free routers and classes. However, the program’s slow speeds still leave users behind national standards ― it offers subscribers download speeds of 15 megabits per second, lower than the 25 mbps definition for broadband internet used by the Federal Communications Commission. Focus: Hope tried to help people sign up for Comcast Essentials but ended its initiative due to lack of interest ― residents were turned off by the rigorous application requirements.The failure of major internet providers to close the coverage gap spurred a grassroots movement, the Equitable Internet Initiative, in which local residents have built wireless networks serving dozens of families in three neighborhoods.Community efforts could move the needle more if organizers collaborated and shared their knowledge, Goss and others said, and the city needs to take the lead on tackling the digital divide across all neighborhoods. Officials reportedly plan to release recommendations to expand internet access soon. The school district is also looking to improve digital learning.Rayford aims to become one of those collaborators. She’s already envisioning what comes after her high school graduation: She’ll attend Wayne State University’s College of Engineering in Detroit and then plans to start a business using her engineering skills. Later she’ll give back by launching a community organization inspired by her grandmother ― who died of complications from alcoholism ― to support teen girls struggling with mental health issues.

(Nationwide, 5 million school-age kids don’t have internet at home, according to the Pew Research Center.)Recent research in Detroit indicates that most teens have some kind of access to the internet ― but far fewer have reliable internet and computers at home. Many students have more tenuous connections, relying on schools and libraries to get online, or else hopping on and off public WiFi connections from their mobile phones.As technology becomes increasingly essential for achievement and employment tasks, advocates worry Detroit’s digital divide shuts students out of opportunities they desperately need ― most kids live in poverty, and young adult unemployment is more than double the national rate.  Connectivity is “the gateway to so many pieces of life and the economy that the lack of access to internet is really contributing to many of the disparities that we see in urban areas,” said Vernice Anthony, interim chief executive of Focus: Hope. The civil rights nonprofit offers education programs and job training, including information technology certifications.National figures gloss over the real divide in Detroit’s internet ecosystem, Michigan State University researchers suggested in a January report. Instead of a total lack of internet access, they see a “mobile-only divide.” They mailed surveys about internet use to more than 500 residents in three neighborhoods. Nearly all respondents reported using the internet, which surprised William Dutton, MSU professor of media and information policy and co-author of the report. Dutton told HuffPost he was specifically impressed by teens’ ingenious strategies for getting online ― whether tracking public locations with open networks or befriending classmates with WiFi at home. Nearly half the residents in the survey said they primarily used the internet on their phones. Many of them, particularly teens, don’t see that as a disadvantage ― but those users, with limited device capabilities and data caps, were less likely to report “productive” uses, such as homework and job searches. “The strong dependence on mobile phones ― while it mitigates some of the worst digital divides somewhat ― may be holding Detroiters back,” the report warns.Bridging the digital divide isn’t just about providing cheap, fast internet. Computer access matters, as Dutton explained. And tools aren’t that useful if students aren’t taught how to use them. Qumisha “Q” Goss, who runs tech programs at the Parkman library branch near Focus: Hope, said adults often overlook kids’ digital literacy, assuming they’ll intuit technology they grew up with. But when students, who can be experts in social media, use library computers for school, she finds, they’re unfamiliar with basics like how to fill out a spreadsheet or how to double-space a document. “That part is kind of heartbreaking for me, because I feel like they’re being neglected,” Goss said. One of the classes Goss developed is Parkman Coders. She’s taught kids programming with Minecraft, a popular computer game, and by using cheap, cutting-edge hardware built for learning, like Raspberry Pi mini-computers and micro:bits. When former students rack up fees on overdue coding books, Goss is happy to forgive their fines. Parkman and the Downtown Boxing Gym ignite some students’ untapped passion for tech and give useful digital skills to more. Of the 300 kids who have gone through the gym’s youth learning program, all have graduated high school, compared with a 78 percent graduation rate in Detroit’s public school district last year. And Parkman has students returning summer after summer for the coding programs. A smattering of other local organizations are doing similar work or expanding digital equity. However, community programs ultimately serve only a fraction of Detroit’s disconnected students. (The gym currently serves 185 kids but has more than 800 on its waiting list.) Closing the digital divide on a broader level is more challenging. Nine years ago, Focus: Hope and other partners taught computer skills to 6,000 residents, gave out thousands of discounted computers and worked with an initiative that brought free broadband to a few hundred people. Despite the program’s impact, it ended when federal funding dried up, and residents lost internet after the service provider went bankrupt.Internet providers help some get past the cost hurdle, with $10 monthly plans for low-income families. One in 20 residents gets internet through Comcast Essentials, which also offers cheap laptops, free routers and classes. However, the program’s slow speeds still leave users behind national standards ― it offers subscribers download speeds of 15 megabits per second, lower than the 25 mbps definition for broadband internet used by the Federal Communications Commission. Focus: Hope tried to help people sign up for Comcast Essentials but ended its initiative due to lack of interest ― residents were turned off by the rigorous application requirements.The failure of major internet providers to close the coverage gap spurred a grassroots movement, the Equitable Internet Initiative, in which local residents have built wireless networks serving dozens of families in three neighborhoods.Community efforts could move the needle more if organizers collaborated and shared their knowledge, Goss and others said, and the city needs to take the lead on tackling the digital divide across all neighborhoods. Officials reportedly plan to release recommendations to expand internet access soon. The school district is also looking to improve digital learning.Rayford aims to become one of those collaborators. She’s already envisioning what comes after her high school graduation: She’ll attend Wayne State University’s College of Engineering in Detroit and then plans to start a business using her engineering skills. Later she’ll give back by launching a community organization inspired by her grandmother ― who died of complications from alcoholism ― to support teen girls struggling with mental health issues. Rayford wants to teach them tech skills, unlocking the same doors for them that she’s walked through already.For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

The statement did not highlight any of Assange’s offending posts.However, in recent days Assange has tweeted about his disapproval with several countries, including the U.S., for their decision to expel Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy in the U.K. earlier this month.That stipulation is part of Assange’s asylum agreement with Ecuador, which has housed him in its London embassy since 2012 as he sought to avoid extradition to Sweden for an investigation into rape allegations. Though Sweden dropped the case last year, he remains wanted by the U.K. for breaching bail. He has now been living in the embassy for more than five years. Kim Dotcom, a German internet tycoon who has long been vocal of his support for Assange’s freedom, urged other supporters to gather outside the embassy on Wednesday to help Assange regain his Internet connection.On Tuesday, British foreign affairs minister Alan Duncan spoke out against Assange’s ongoing asylum.“It’s about time that this miserable little worm walked out of the embassy and gave himself up to British justice,” he told reporters.

Coons and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) released a bipartisan statement asking Trump to end his attacks on Mueller, saying the ongoing investigation was “in the best interest of the American people.”“We believe that the American people should have confidence in the Department of Justice’s ability to conduct independent investigations and its commitment to the rule of law,” the pair said. “We urge President Trump to allow the Special Counsel to complete his work without impediment.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abbabe82000001311eb3408.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The queer dating and social networking app Grindr reportedly has two major security flaws that put the personal data of its more than 3 million daily users at risk. Trever Faden, who is the CEO of property management company Atlas Lane, told NBC he discovered the issues after creating a new site that allowed Grindr users to discover who blocked them on the app. Faden’s now-defunct site, called C*ckblocked, required Grindr users to enter their username and password to login into the service and had launched earlier this month. However, after entering a Grindr username and password, Faden said he was able to access data not publicly seen on profiles, including unread messages, email addresses, deleted photos and location of individual users. Faden also found that some of the information sent to the company’s servers was not encoded, meaning that user locations could be exposed even if they chose to opt out of sharing their location information.“One could, without too much difficulty or even a huge amount of technological skill, easily pinpoint a user’s exact location,” Faden said. His claims were backed up by two independent cybersecurity researchers, according to NBC. A little more than a week before NBC’s report was published, the app tweeted: Grindr officials told NBC that they were aware of the security issues Faden had uncovered and that they had changed their system to prevent access to data regarding blocked accounts. It’s unknown if further changes were being planned. “Grindr moved quickly to make changes to its platform to resolve this issue,” the company said, according to NBC. “Grindr reminds all users that they should never give away their username and password to any third parties claiming to provide a benefit, as they are not authorized by Grindr and could potentially have malicious intent.”Privacy concerns stemming from the use of popular dating and social networking apps is hardly a new issue. In 2014, cybersecurity firm Synack found that Grindr allowed users to access profiles and locations of others anywhere in the world. That information, researchers wrote, could “ultimately unmask the identities” of Grindr users who wished to remain anonymous and put them at safety risk. That same year, an anonymous tipster reportedly sent messages to Grindr users in countries that have anti-LGBTQ legislation in place or are otherwise hostile to queer people telling them that they could be targeted, persecuted or even murdered as a result of the app’s location sharing data. “As part of the Grindr service, users rely on sharing location information with other users as core functionality of the application, and Grindr users can control how this information is displayed,” a spokesperson told HuffPost at the time. “As always, our user security is our top priority and we do our best to keep our Grindr community secure.”UPDATE: After this story was published, Grindr’s Chief Technology Officer Scott Chen released a statement to HuffPost, which can be found below. As a company that serves the LGBTQ community, we more than many, understand the delicate nature of our users’ privacy. Ensuring safety and security of our users is of paramount importance to Grindr. For many years we have worked with numerous international health, digital rights, and privacy organizations as well as community leaders through our Grindr For Equality program to develop and release many safety and security features specifically to help our users in places where it’s not safe to be LGBTQ.

Three unnamed sources told the Times that Dowd discussed offering presidential pardons for Flynn, the president’s former national security adviser, and Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, as Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election mounted. Dowd had discussions with attorneys for Flynn and Manafort shortly after he took over as Trump’s personal lawyer last summer, according to the Times. Dowd reportedly told Flynn’s attorney, Robert K. Kelner, that Trump felt the case against Flynn was flimsy and that the president was prepared to pardon him.Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government. After news of the plea broke in December, Dowd told The Wall Street Journal that he was “not worried about it.” The former Trump lawyer spoke to Manafort’s legal representation about a pardon in October, before Manafort was indicted on charges of conspiracy and money laundering in connection with the Russia investigation, the Times reported.Read more at The New York Times.Dowd resigned from Trump’s legal team on Thursday as he felt the president was increasingly ignoring his advice, sources told the Times and The Washington Post. When asked about the reports during a Wednesday press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied any conversation of pardons.“I would refer you back to the statement from [White House lawyer] Ty Cobb and the report you’re asking about, in which he said, ‘I’ve only been asked about pardons by the press and have routinely responded on the record that no pardons are under discussion or consideration at the White House,’” Sanders told reporters in the briefing room.The White House has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia in regard to the 2016 election.Trump has attacked Mueller’s investigation a number of times, especially as Mueller increases pressure on the president. Mueller issued subpoenas to the Trump Organization demanding documents referencing Russia earlier this month. The president’s aggression toward Mueller’s investigation has prompted a number of concerns that Trump will push to fire the special counsel. Nine Democratic senators signed a letter Tuesday urging senior officials at the Justice Department to publicly defend Mueller against the White House.  This story has been updated to include comments from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and more background on the Russia investigation."

But in rural areas, librarians say their services remain vital.",2018-03-28,"<p>Children pick out books on the Graves County bookmobile as the librarian, Sandra Hennessee, looks on. Bookmobiles are dwindling but librarians say they are vital to serving their communities. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe920e1f00002a0616bf76.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jen FifieldMAYFIELD, Ky. — The van comes to a stop just as it reaches the hens. A bleating lamb is the first to greet Sandra Hennessee as she opens the van door and lets in the midday sun.To get here, on an Amish farm in rural western Kentucky, Hennessee headed west from the small town of Mayfield and drove for miles on a two-lane road, passing churches, farms and open fields. With every bend and bump in the road, the wooden shelves inside the 27-year-old van creaked. With every stop, the hundreds of plastic-wrapped and paperback books on the shelves shifted.Now on the farm, a woman dressed in a floor-length blue skirt, a black jacket, boots and a bonnet climbs inside. “Hi, honey,” Hennessee says. “What can I help you find?”As the Graves County Public Library bookmobile librarian, Hennessee says she serves some of the most isolated areas of her community. She delivers books to some of the loneliest widows and some of the poorest children, but, according to her, “it’s not really about the books.”“I’m a trash taker-outer, I’m a mail-getter, I’m a mechanic, I’m a social worker, I’m a snake killer,” she said. “You do what needs doin.’”Hennessee, 51, started doing this job in 1995, when bookmobiles — miniature, mobile libraries in the backs of walk-on vans — were in their heyday. At the time, there were nearly 1,000 operating across the United States. Now, there are fewer than 650, according to the most recent data from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a research arm of the federal government.Despite the decline, librarians say their services remain vital, especially in rural areas, where people often live far from their library branch and have limited internet access. Bookmobiles help close this gap by creating a traveling branch, said Michael Swendrowski, a board member of the Association of Bookmobile and Outreach Services and owner of Specialty Vehicle Services, which helps libraries design bookmobiles.“There are tons of populations that don’t have access, who can’t get to the library, can’t get the internet,” he said. “Bookmobiles and outreach services are key to serving those people.”Kentucky has 75 bookmobiles, the most of any state. In Graves County, Hennessee stops at day care centers and schools, bringing books to low-income children whose parents may not have time to stop by the library. She stops at nursing homes, whose residents may not be able to drive. And as access to high-speed internet becomes increasingly essential, she connects residents in remote areas to broadband through the bookmobile’s hotspot.Most importantly, Hennessee says, is the sense of community and friendship she brings to every stop.“Some of them, I’m the only person they talk to, or see,” she said.While the number of bookmobiles has been dropping, librarians say that in some places interest is picking up as libraries look for ways to reach more patrons and prove their worth during tight budget years, and as people become more accustomed to having goods and services delivered to their doors.This is true in urban and rural areas. King County, Washington, which includes Seattle, added most of its 16 mobile service vehicles, including bookmobiles and mobile computer labs, in the past decade, said Christine Anderson, the county library system’s outreach services coordinator. Other counties — in Oklahoma, New York, Louisiana and Virginia — have added more than one bookmobile in that time as well, according to a Stateline analysis of the institute’s data.The King County library system gets a couple inquiries a month from librarians and others interested in getting their own bookmobiles, Anderson said.“I get the sense there is a renaissance of bookmobile service,” she said.Closing the GapEarly on a recent crisp and sunny morning, Hennessee climbed into the 18-foot-long box van and tried to start the generator. It didn’t work. Her next try did. The 1991 Chevrolet van has seen better days. In 2014, it got a new engine and a fresh coat of black paint, but, she said, it still has problems.Her first stop was on the edge of Mayfield at a day care center called the Kidstruction Zone. As she pulled into the driveway, the excited 4- and 5-year-olds’ faces appeared in the window on the day care center door. Soon, the children bounded toward the van — the first of two groups who would climb aboard.This is what Hennessee calls her “bunches, bunches and more bunches.” She makes several stops at day care centers and schools, visiting each about twice a month. “I love my young’uns,” she said.The preschoolers’ chatter filled the small space in the back of the van. A few children at a time climbed onto a step along the bookshelf to study the books. A small boy reached for one with a bus on the cover, called “Bus! Stop!” A girl chose a book of scary stories because, she said, it looked like Halloween. “A Christmas book again?” Hennessee asked another girl. “Oh yes, we love our Christmas stories.”The preschoolers fit their tiny feet into footprint stickers on the floor, where they waited to check out their books. The children swap books with each other so they can have fresh reading material every night, said Nichole Gibson, director of the day care center. This helps encourage parents to read to their children, she said, when some may not make it a priority.Like most rural areas in America, Graves County is a bit less educated and a bit poorer than the U.S. average. Most of the 37,000 county residents live outside of the county seat here in Mayfield, population 10,000. Many county residents work in manufacturing, or agriculture. After long workdays, Hennessee said, not many people here are interested in reading books other than the Bible.About 32 percent of rural Americans said they hadn’t read a book in the past year, compared with about 23 percent of urban Americans, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center survey. (The Pew Charitable Trusts funds both the Center and Stateline.)This may be, in part, due to lack of access to books. Nearly 1 in 5 people who live in non-metro areas live more than six miles from a public library, according to a recent study by Frank Donnelly, a geospatial data librarian at Baruch College at the City University of New York.About 18 percent of bookmobiles operated in a rural area in 2015, according to a Stateline analysis of the Institute of Museum and Library Services data. And more are starting up. The rural library system of Summers County, West Virginia, last summer received $35,000 to buy a new bookmobile, in the form of a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s rural development program. The New Mexico State Library bought two new bookmobiles last month to serve rural areas.Bookmobile RenaissanceLeaving the day care center, Hennessee drives the bookmobile past a yellow sign with a black horse and buggy. “All right, we’re leaving civilization as we know it,” she says. A few Amish families are next on her stops.Graves County is so expansive — one of the largest counties in the state — that Hennessee ends up driving about 500 to 700 miles a month. She’s racked up most of the 191,356 miles on the van over several years. Others have trouble driving the long van, she said, but to her, “it’s like an appendage.”Just before lunch, she pulls in front of the house of Katie Wooley, a retired teacher who isn’t Amish but lives in the area, and starts scanning the shelves for books to take to her. “She likes cozy mysteries,” she said, pulling a book called “Banana Cream Pie Murder.” Hennessee opens the front cover and, when she sees the initials “KW,” puts it back. Her patrons often mark their books so they can remember what they’ve already read.Wooley invites Hennessee in. “You caught me without my clothes on,” she says, dressed in a pink nightgown and slippers. She sits back in a burgundy recliner and Hennessee takes a wooden rocking chair. “So, what’s new in your neighborhood?” Hennessee asks her.More Fun Than WorkIn Graves County, Hennessee waves to other drivers as they pass. It took her a long time to build up relationships around town, she said, especially with the Amish families, who were hesitant to speak to her at first.About a quarter of the library books that get checked out in the county are from the bookmobile. Last year, Hennessee averaged about 1,600 books a month.The bookmobile is costing the county more as it ages, said Deana Gschwind, Graves County’s library director. But it’s such a staple, she said, and it fulfills such a need, it’s worth it.Like all library services, the funding for bookmobiles across the country becomes threatened when budgets are tight, said Swendrowski, with the bookmobile association.In Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, has proposed cutting all funds for local library operations from the state budget. Last year, the state gave about $2.5 million to local libraries, which was split among the 118 library districts in the state, said Dave Schroeder, advocacy chair for the Kentucky Public Library Association.This won’t have a large impact on the Graves County library, or most libraries in the state, Schroeder said, because they receive most of their funding from local sources. But at least three library systems may close if the cuts happen, Schroeder said. The Legislature is still finalizing the budget.Hennessee said she doesn’t cost the county much. Last year, she made about $29,000. But, most days, she considers it more fun than work.On the Amish farm, with the hens and the lamb, the woman climbs on board, followed by three of her children. “I’ve got a request,” she says. “Any books on vegetable gardening?”“I’ll take a look,” Hennessee says. “I got some gardening I just put on here a few days ago.”Hennessee often spends time with the Amish children doing crafts, like painting and building birdhouses. She has an idea for the spring, but wants to run it by their mother first. “We’re gonna make kites,” Hennessee says. “Can you all fly kites?” “Oh, yeah,” the woman responds.For today, she has a smaller craft in mind. “Come on, kiddos,” she says, handing them each a plastic baggie with foam paper that can be tacked together into a tiger. Hennessee says she doesn’t try to be educational — that’s for school.“I try to instill that love of reading,” Hennessee said. “Not, ‘you have to read.’ And if you like to read, you’ll be a lifelong reader.”After she has made all her stops for the day, she pulls off on the side of the road, grabs the broom on the van, and sweeps out clumps of dried mud. Next, she’s headed to an Amish Tupperware party.“Technically, this is not part of my job,” she said a few minutes later, steering the van up the dirt driveway. “Sometimes, you just have to be fluid and cool that way. I guess, in a sense, it’s just being part of the community.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

This includes barring women and families with children from viewing or receiving rental ads, the group says.By allowing these options, Facebook is violating the Fair Housing Act, which protects people from discrimination when renting, buying or securing financing for a housing, the lawsuit alleges.The Fair Housing Act, passed in 1968, specifically covers “discrimination because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability and the presence of children,” according to the Department of Urban Housing and Development.In October 2016, a ProPublica report found Facebook illegally allowed advertisers to discriminate based on race. The NFHA sent Facebook a warning the following month that the platform appeared to violate the Fair Housing Act. In response, Facebook vowed to change its advertising options. But the company didn’t do enough, according to the NFHA lawsuit.Advertisers can still choose to “exclude” certain types of families with children (“parents with preteens,” “parents with toddlers,” etc.), as well as some women (“moms of preschool kids,” “corporate moms,” etc.). Users with certain interests related to “disability” or “national origin” (such as “Disabled American Veterans” and “Telemundo”) may also be excluded.The NFHA, as well as the Fair Housing Justice Center, Housing Opportunities Project for Excellence, Inc. and Fair Housing Council of Greater San Antonio are the four plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in New York City at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.“Facebook’s use and abuse of user data for discriminatory purposes needs to stop,” Lisa Rice, president and CEO of NFHA, said in a statement. “It is already a challenge for women, families with children, people with disabilities and other under-served groups to find housing. ... Facebook ought to be opening doors to housing opportunities instead of closing them.”“There is absolutely no place for discrimination on Facebook,” a spokesman for the company told HuffPost in an email Wednesday. “We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.”The lawsuit comes as Facebook faces mounting backlash over its privacy policies and apparent failure to protect user data. Earlier this month, The New York Times and The Observer reported that the British voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica obtained and exploited more than 50 million Facebook users’ personal data. The social media company reportedly allowed a researcher to gain access to the data and then failed to follow up on how the data was used for more than two years.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the Cambridge Analytica disaster next month.Read the National Fair Housing Alliance’s full complaint against Facebook below:"

Seemingly corroborating that account, Frederick said after he first learned about the alleged misconduct in December 2016, he commissioned an outside auditor to look into it, leading to a May 2017 audit report.The auditor found that university grants were given to employees who also received tuition discounts from 2007 to 2016, resulting in payments that well exceeded the cost of attendance.“An investigation of individual employee actions was completed in September 2017 and as a result, six employees have been fired for gross misconduct and neglect of duties. We will refer this matter for criminal prosecution, as appropriate,” Frederick said in the statement.Frederick added he reported the problem to the Department of Education in July. A Department of Education representative did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment. The Medium blogger cited an unnamed student whistleblower who once worked in the financial aid office and noticed irregularities in grant dispersals. According to the post, a different student employee at the financial aid office allegedly received more than $400,000 in financial aid awards over four years.The Medium post gave the name of a former financial aid office student-employee as Tyrone Hankerson Jr., and said he received need-based tuition aid and a special scholarship. Hankerson later responded through his attorney in a statement shared by ABC News on Twitter, saying, “Please know that I have done nothing illegal or wrong. When the truth comes out it will be confirmed that I followed all rules and protocol with the approval of the, then, financial aid officers in any grants, scholarships or awards given to me as a student who attended class all year round and traveled abroad.”The news sparked an outpouring of anger and frustration from Howard students and alumni, with many asking why it took so long for action to be taken.Juan McFarland, a senior at Howard involved in the student group HU Resist ― which aims to hold administrative officials accountable ― told HuffPost he was “disappointed but not surprised” to learn about the misappropriation of funds.″We’ve had suspicions about mishandling of funds based on how many people always never received their financial aid on time,” McFarland said, “and also based on how many fees were added to our accounts out of nowhere.”“The energy on campus is really high,” he said, adding that more of his classmates have been motivated to demand change at the school.The university has been plagued by a series of administrative issues, leading to mistrust between administrators and swaths of the student body.Frederick was slammed on campus last year for taking meetings with the Trump administration that some saw as a betrayal in light of the president’s past comments about black Americans. In January, school officials postponed classes for more than a week over heating system problems. Earlier this month, Frederick prompted criticisms over his response to a student who emailed him with deep concerns about whether she would be able to secure a spot in university housing ― an reportedly scarce resource. Frederick had told the student her “tone and tenor” was “inappropriate.”HU Resist demanded a number of specific fixes in a letter to Howard administration this week. The group is specifically calling for Frederick and the school’s board of trustees to step down, and it would like students to have more say in administrative affairs. In response to the financial aid scandal, Howard plans to implement several new accountability measures. These include greater transparency in how much aid is awarded, increased oversight of the financial aid office and enhanced training for financial aid employees. “While this has been a very difficult and disappointing situation, I know our campus community deserves better and I am committed to ensuring that each of our campus offices operate with integrity and are the best that higher education has to offer,” Frederick concluded his statement."
38,POLITICS,"Independents Are Shifting To Climate Denial, According To The Latest Gallup Poll",Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gallup-poll-climate-change_us_5aba9129e4b04a59a3121887,Is President Trump to blame?,2018-03-28,Effigies of President Donald Trump have become common at climate marches over the past two years. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba92192000001311eb329e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a sign the White House’s hard-line stance against climate science may be shifting public debate, independent voters have grown more doubtful of scientists’ warnings about climate change over the past year, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday. Between 2017 and 2018, the percentage of independents who understand greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change fell 8 percentage points to 62 percent, while the share of those who believe the effects of global warming have already begun dipped 7 points to 60 percent. Sixty-five percent understand that most scientists believe global warming is occurring, down from 71 percent in 2017. Fewer respondents said they worry a great deal or a fair amount about global warming, down 5 points from last year to 62 percent. But the 45 percent who said global warming poses a serious threat in their lifetimes stayed steady between 2017 and 2018. Public opinion has seesawed slightly over the years, but the long-term trend is overwhelmingly toward the scientific consensus that climate change is real, man-made and dangerous. Gallup found that 66 percent of Americans understand that scientific evidence shows the Earth’s temperatures rising, and 64 percent acknowledge that burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial farming are the cause. The results echo 2016 survey data from Yale University’s Program on Climate Change Communication, which found 69 percent know global warming is happening and 52 percent understand humans are triggering it.Still, the shift, recorded during a week of telephone surveys earlier this month of 1,041 adults across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, mirrors surging climate denialism among Republicans. Just 35 percent of Republicans understand that humans cause global warming, down from 40 percent in 2017, while 34 percent said the effects of climate change have already started, 7 points less than the previous year. The findings come just months after historic hurricanes wreaked havoc on Puerto Rico, Florida and Texas, and California’s largest wildfire on record killed 18 people and scorched more than 280,000 acres of land. Yet the disasters, which scientists said were made worse by warming global temperatures, seem to have stoked further debate over the causes of climate change and the policies to address it. President Donald Trump has repeatedly mocked climate science over the past year, suggesting winter weather disproved long-term warming trends, as his administration gutted funding for climate programs and slashed the few regulations in place to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The Republican Party, the only major political party in the developed world to make rejecting climate science a platform issue, has doubled down on the issue as megadonors such as the fossil fuel magnate Koch brothers and the right-wing billionaire Mercers have increased their political spending.The political debate over climate change, propagated by years of Big Tobacco-style misinformation campaigns funded by the fossil fuel industry, does not mirror the scientific debate. Ninety-seven percent of peer-reviewed research agrees with the conclusion that human-caused emissions are enshrouding the planet in heat-trapping gases, and a research review published in November 2016 found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who concluded otherwise.Perhaps in part because Trump has proved such an agitational avatar for climate denialism, Democrats’ political opinions on global warming trended overwhelmingly toward the scientific consensus. Just 4 percent believed warnings of global warming have been exaggerated, down from 10 percent in 2017. The number of Democrats who said humans caused global warming inched up 2 points to 89 percent, and 82 percent said the effects of climate change have already begun, up from 73 percent the previous year. The share of Democrats who said most scientists believe global warming is occurring stayed steady at 86 percent. That suggests Democrats could run on much more aggressive climate policies, particularly in primary battles. The party, however, has failed to rally around a national strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The two most significant pieces of climate legislation introduced in Congress this year have embraced conservative approaches and gave exemptions to major polluters. Even in liberal states under Democratic control, climate policy has proved hard to pass, as the failure of Washington state’s proposed statewide carbon tax showed. Yet the party’s base appears to be more unified than ever around belief in climate change. Roughly 8 in 10 Democrats fell into the category of “Concerned Believers,” according to Gallup. Women, younger Americans and college graduates, all key demographics for the Democrats, were all more likely than their counterparts to be Concerned Believers. "

The trailer begins with Offred (Elisabeth Moss) sitting in the back of a truck, thinking to herself: “Is this what freedom looks like? What will happen when I get out? There probably is no out. Gilead is within you.” It looks as though Offred has escaped the grips of Commander Fred (Joseph Fiennes) and his evil wife, Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski), possibly with the help of her lover, Nick (Max Minghella).If that wasn’t enough of a plot twist, the trailer is a mashup of scenes including Ofglen (Alexis Bedel) working in a chemical wasteland and Moira (Samira Wiley) rioting presumably somewhere in Canada where she took refuge last season. Oh, and, Offred’s pregnant with Nick’s baby.Season 2 of “The Handmaid’s Tale” comes out April 25, and we cannot wait. "

The demonstrations disrupted a city council meeting and forced a Sacramento Kings basketball game into a lockdown for the second time.Clark’s brother, Stevante Clark, led protesters into Sacramento City Council chambers in the middle of a public meeting held Tuesday evening to discuss concerns surrounding his brother’s death, according to CBS 13 Sacramento.Clark interrupted the meeting by chanting his brother’s name, then took over the microphones to disparage Mayor Darrell Steinberg and ask for the community’s support.“The mayor and the city of Sacramento has failed all of you,” Clark told the crowd after the council offered him a microphone to speak.Stephon Clark was killed on March 18 when two police officers opened fire on him in his own backyard while responding to reports of car break-ins in his neighborhood. The officers said they thought Clark was holding a gun, but they later found he was holding a cellphone.Earlier Tuesday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said his office would oversee the police department’s investigation into Clark’s death to “ensure a fair and impartial investigation.” The Clark family’s lawyer has also hired Dr. Bennet Omalu to perform a second autopsy on Clark’s body, independent of the one being completed by the Sacramento county coroner.Stevante Clark’s disruption Tuesday forced the council to adjourn the meeting for 15 minutes, USA Today reported. Some protesters proceeded to the Golden 1 Center, where a game between the Sacramento Kings and Dallas Mavericks was scheduled.Protesters surrounded the arena and stopped people from entering the game. The Kings were forced to lock down the entrances and offer refunds to ticket holders who did not make it in.Back at Sacramento City Hall, the city council continued its meeting with the community as protesters gathered outside and banged on the windows.The meeting went on for three hours, according to New York Times reporter Jose A. Del Real.“Inside the council chambers, black community leaders are talking about healing, justice and reconciliation,” Del Real tweeted from City Hall. “Outside, angry protesters want to shut the meeting down. A striking juxtaposition.”Tensions escalated as police attempted to detain people for banging on the windows.Clark’s death has sparked unrest throughout Sacramento and across the country for more than a week.Speaking with black community leaders at a City Hall press conference on Monday, Clark’s family called for the two officers to be charged for Clark’s death.Sequita Thompson, Clark’s grandmother who was inside the house during the shooting, demanded justice in an emotional speech at the conference.“They didn’t have to kill him like that,” Thompson said. “They didn’t have to shoot him this many times. Why didn’t you just shoot him in the arm, shoot him in the leg, send the dogs, send a Taser. Why? Why? Y’all didn’t have to do that.”“Our city is at a critical point right now and I believe this will help build faith and confidence in the investigation from our community,” Hahn said.The latest demonstrations come less than a week after protesters took over Interstate 5 in Sacramento and shut down the entrance to another Kings game last Thursday.Meanwhile, protesters at City Hall on Tuesday made clear their pain over Clark’s death. “You’re killing us. You’re killing us. It’s genocide, it feels like genocide,” Black Lives Matter Sacramento leader Tanya Faison told the city council at Tuesday’s meeting, according to The New York Times.“Those officers need to be fired. That’s the only way we’re going to get justice, to start, when you fire those officers.”"

The president announced Shulkin’s termination in a post on Twitter on Wednesday and said he intends to replace him with Adm. Ronny L. Jackson, the presidential physician. Undersecretary of Defense Robert Wilkie will serve as acting director of the department until a new secretary is confirmed.In a statement following the decision, Shulkin said Trump “should have a cabinet member that he is comfortable with.”“I have worked to keep our nation’s Veterans first in everything I did,” he said. “I want you to know that I will always fight for you no matter where I go.”Trump appointed Shulkin in January 2017 despite previously signaling plans to completely shake up and overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs.Shulkin, a physician and former hospital executive, previously served in the Obama administration as the undersecretary of veterans affairs, and he experienced initial success running the agency with the support of veterans groups and bipartisan committees.Shulkin was the subject of an investigation by his department’s inspector general in February and was found to have committed ethics violations on a trip to Europe last summer. His extravagant 10-day trip to London and Copenhagen was planned under the guise of business travel but included only 3½ working days while costing the VA at least $122,334, the report found.Trump’s displeasure with Shulkin may have had more to do with the fact that the secretary had found himself increasingly at odds with conservative administration officials, who have long pushed for increased privatization of veterans’ health care options. Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy, has been the White House physician since 2013 and served under three different presidents.While he briefly came under fire in January for a controversial media briefing on Trump’s health, he has received widespread praise from White House staff in several administrations. Responding to the controversy, former advisers to President Barack Obama called Jackson a “phenomenal doctor” and a “saint and patriot.”Trump himself has long touted Jackson’s ability and nominated him for a promotion just last week.“Admiral Jackson is highly trained and qualified and as a service member himself, he has seen firsthand the tremendous sacrifice our veterans make and has a deep appreciation for the debt our great country owes them,” Trump said in a statement announcing his nomination on Wednesday.However, Jackson appears to have no significant management record. The White House provided reporters with background information about Jackson that touts his expertise in medicine, but there’s little to suggest that would be a likely nominee to run the sprawling Veterans Affairs Department ― a place known for bureaucratic mismanagement.VoteVets, a progressive organization representing veterans affairs, said it was troubled with the lack of information surrounding Jackson’s ability to lead.“Other than a total lack of awareness of where he stands on any issue, we are also concerned that he has never managed an agency like the VA,” Will Fischer, VoteVet’s director of government relations, said in a statement. “Now is not the time for people who need training wheels.”A political moderate, Shulkin favored a more measured approach that involved introducing private care options only to offset long waiting times at veterans hospitals and only with the department’s approval.Shulkin appeared to think that the investigation into his trip spending was an effort by opponents in the administration “to undermine the department from within.”Shulkin is the latest in a string of departures from the Trump administration. On March 22, Trump announced by tweet that national security adviser H.R. McMaster would be replaced by former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. According to a March 22 Politico report citing two top administration officials, the decision surprised White House chief of staff John Kelly, who had been preparing to ax McMaster at the same time as Carson and Shulkin.One week before, the president said he had decided to fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and replace him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo.Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned in September after reports surfaced that he used taxpayer-funded private jets on numerous occasions."

43,ENTERTAINMENT,*Looks Directly Into Camera* John Krasinski Wants A Christmas Special Of 'The Office',Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rejoice-john-kransinski-wants-to-an-office-christmas-special_us_5abbb3c9e4b03e2a5c784da4,NBC is reportedly eyeing a revival of the beloved sitcom.,2018-03-28,"Jenna Fischer and John Krasinski in ""The Office"" finale.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abbdbc81e000008087b0014.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Everybody stay calm: John Krasinski wants “The Office” to return as a Christmas special. The actor weighed in on the beloved NBC series’ revival, which the network is reportedly eyeing for the 2018-2019 television season. Krasinski, who starred as Jim Halpert for nine seasons, says he’s all for reuniting.“I think the U.K. thing that I always have pitched and wanted to do is that Christmas special thing, where we do a Christmas special this year and then two years from now, or three years from now, we do another one,” he told IndieWire. “I love that idea coming back finding out where everybody is. I would totally be down for that.”He added: “It’s one of those things where I’m sure people don’t believe me when I say I would totally do it, because the truth is I would totally do it.”The original U.K. series upon which “The Office” is based aired two Christmas specials as a de facto finale in 2003. Recently revived series like “Gilmore Girls” have also opted for seasonally-themed installments, while others, including “Will & Grace” and “Twin Peaks,” have aired full seasons. Krasinski, who’s on a press tour with wife Emily Blunt for his new movie, “A Quiet Place,” is more keen to do a one-off special, instead of rebooting the series for an entirely new run. “I don’t think anybody in our show sees that we didn’t end it the way we wanted to end it. We’re one of the very lucky shows that got to end when we wanted to, how we wanted to,” he said. “So I don’t know how it exciting it would be to do a run of the show, ’cause you don’t want to retread old things and have people not be as excited about it as they are now.”But his resistance to committing to a full season has nothing to with his former cast members, who he still has a soft spot for. “I remember talking to other people on TV shows and they were like, ‘Fifth season, right? That’s when you all started hating each other?’ and I was like, ‘No, was that when you started hating each other?’ and they were like, ‘Hell yeah, fifth season and I was like nope,’” Krasinski said. “Right until the end, we were a family, we were emotionally connected, we all cried our eyes out on the last day. His partner in crime, Jenna Fischer, who played his love interest Pam, is also ready and willing to get back in business. “I think the idea of an Office revival is a great idea,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “I would be honored to come back in any way that I am able to. I loved playing that character.”"
44,IMPACT,Top Banks Pumped Billions More Into The Dirtiest Fossil Fuels Last Year,Laura Paddison,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/global-fossil-fuels-banks-report_us_5aba989fe4b04a59a3122636,Even as they claimed they were committed to fighting climate change.,2018-03-28,"A tailings pond near the Syncrude tar sands operation in Fort McMurray, Alberta.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba98f12000002d00eb32ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some of the world’s biggest banks continue to lend money to support the dirtiest fossil fuels, despite global commitments to tackle climate change, according to a report published Wednesday, which picks out U.S. and Canadian banks as the worst offenders.Every year a group of nonprofits ― including the Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network and Oil Change International ― releases the Banking on Climate Change report, which grades 36 of the largest banks in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan and China on their financing of “extreme” fossil fuel companies and projects.These firms are defined as those that profit off the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels: They extract tar sands, Arctic and ultra deepwater oil, and liquified natural gas. They mine coal and produce coal-fired power. The environmental groups analyze how much money the banks have pumped into the top 30 companies operating in each category of extreme fossil fuels and grade them from A to F in each category based on an analysis of the banks’ publicly available policies on fossil fuels.This is the ninth annual report, and the news is not good, especially when it comes to U.S. and Canadian banks.“The first year after the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement, was a year of progress. 2017 was a year of backsliding,” the report said.Financing for extreme fossil fuels by the big banks increased 11 percent, from $104 billion in 2016 to $115 billion in 2017, according to the report. Three of them ― Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) and JPMorgan Chase ― were identified as the “biggest backsliders,” meaning they showed the greatest increases in such financing. All three tout their commitments to clean energy and environmental protection.But “every single dollar that these banks provide for the expansion of the fossil fuel industry is a dollar going to increase the climate crisis,” said Stephen Kretzmann, executive director of Oil Change International. U.S. and Canadian dominance in extreme fossil fuel financing may have political roots, suggested Alison Kirsch, climate and energy research coordinator at Rainforest Action Network. “Banks [in these countries] might be emboldened by the political leaders that are pro fossil fuels,” she said.Tar sands received by far the biggest increase, reaching nearly $47 billion in bank financing in 2017 ― a hike of 111 percent on the previous year. The report identified RBC, TD and JPMorgan Chase as the key financial institutions injecting cash into tar sands projects. Those include the embattled Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia, Canada, which indigenous groups are protesting. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) saw $45 billion in bank financing, with Morgan Stanley identified as one of the top lenders. LNG is often pitched by advocates as a weapon in the climate change fight, because it can have lower emissions than coal and oil. However, the fuel is predominantly made up omethane, a very potent greenhouse gas, and it doesn’t take much methane to leak during operations to give LNG a bigger carbon footprint than other fossil fuels.When it comes to coal, Chinese banks remain the top funders, while Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank lead the pack among Western lenders, according to the report.“Coal financing has essentially stagnated,” Kirsch said. But she added that wasn’t good enough. Financing for coal should be dropping “towards a phase-out goal of zero,” she said.The upward tick in extreme fossil fuel financing runs counter to indications that global reliance on fossil fuels may have peaked. The cost of renewables like solar and wind energy has plummeted, and energy storage is burgeoning with the world’s largest lithium ion battery coming online in Australia late last year. Countries such as the U.K., China and France and states including California have all announced plans to move away from combustion engines and embrace electric vehicles.Meanwhile, hundreds of coal plants are shuttering as they become economically unviable. “It’s still far from game over for the fossil fuel industry, but the game has drastically changed,” the report said. There is some good news from the report, said Kirsch, who praised some banks in Europe for “really bold policy movement.” In particular, she pointed to the French bank BNP Paribas, which last year pledged to stop financing shale and oil sands projects.“The financial sector overall is not blind to the weakness of the oil and gas industry ... but we’re just not seeing the action on policies come quick enough,” Kirsch added. She called on banks to take the immediate first step of stopping the financing of fossil fuel expansion. Banks cannot shirk their role in fighting climate change, said Catherine Howarth of U.K.-based nonprofit ShareAction. “The financing decisions of banks are utterly critical to climate outcomes and to the pace of decarbonization in the global economy. Bank boards should be held accountable on the financing of high carbon projects,” she said.For their part, several big banks contacted by HuffPost insisted that they are committed to clean energy. Deutsche Bank referred to its 2016 commitment to no longer finance new coal mining or coal-fired plant construction or expansion.A TD spokeswoman said the bank had committed to provide some $77.5 billion in financing for low-carbon initiatives by 2030. “TD is taking clear steps to help accelerate the development of a low-carbon economy, while recognizing the importance of responsibly developing conventional energy, vital to North America’s economic strength and security,” she said.A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said that the bank “is committed to mobilizing capital to scale up clean energy” and noted that it has provided more than $30 billion in clean energy financing and investment since 2016. She also said Goldman Sachs applies “enhanced due diligence” to coal investments, which includes looking at companies’ environmental track records, evaluating ecological impacts, and considering local community and human rights. RBC and Morgan Stanley did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

45,IMPACT,Top Banks Pumped Billions More Into The Dirtiest Fossil Fuels Last Year,Laura Paddison,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/global-fossil-fuels-banks-report_us_5aba989fe4b04a59a3122636,Even as they claimed they were committed to fighting climate change.,2018-03-28,Protesters in Vancouver march against the proposed expansion of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba991a2000001311eb32ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some of the world’s biggest banks continue to lend money to support the dirtiest fossil fuels, despite global commitments to tackle climate change, according to a report published Wednesday, which picks out U.S. and Canadian banks as the worst offenders.Every year a group of nonprofits ― including the Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network and Oil Change International ― releases the Banking on Climate Change report, which grades 36 of the largest banks in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan and China on their financing of “extreme” fossil fuel companies and projects.These firms are defined as those that profit off the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels: They extract tar sands, Arctic and ultra deepwater oil, and liquified natural gas. They mine coal and produce coal-fired power. The environmental groups analyze how much money the banks have pumped into the top 30 companies operating in each category of extreme fossil fuels and grade them from A to F in each category based on an analysis of the banks’ publicly available policies on fossil fuels.This is the ninth annual report, and the news is not good, especially when it comes to U.S. and Canadian banks.“The first year after the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement, was a year of progress. 2017 was a year of backsliding,” the report said.Financing for extreme fossil fuels by the big banks increased 11 percent, from $104 billion in 2016 to $115 billion in 2017, according to the report. Three of them ― Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) and JPMorgan Chase ― were identified as the “biggest backsliders,” meaning they showed the greatest increases in such financing. All three tout their commitments to clean energy and environmental protection.But “every single dollar that these banks provide for the expansion of the fossil fuel industry is a dollar going to increase the climate crisis,” said Stephen Kretzmann, executive director of Oil Change International. U.S. and Canadian dominance in extreme fossil fuel financing may have political roots, suggested Alison Kirsch, climate and energy research coordinator at Rainforest Action Network. “Banks [in these countries] might be emboldened by the political leaders that are pro fossil fuels,” she said.Tar sands received by far the biggest increase, reaching nearly $47 billion in bank financing in 2017 ― a hike of 111 percent on the previous year. The report identified RBC, TD and JPMorgan Chase as the key financial institutions injecting cash into tar sands projects. Those include the embattled Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia, Canada, which indigenous groups are protesting. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) saw $45 billion in bank financing, with Morgan Stanley identified as one of the top lenders. LNG is often pitched by advocates as a weapon in the climate change fight, because it can have lower emissions than coal and oil. However, the fuel is predominantly made up omethane, a very potent greenhouse gas, and it doesn’t take much methane to leak during operations to give LNG a bigger carbon footprint than other fossil fuels.When it comes to coal, Chinese banks remain the top funders, while Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank lead the pack among Western lenders, according to the report.“Coal financing has essentially stagnated,” Kirsch said. But she added that wasn’t good enough. Financing for coal should be dropping “towards a phase-out goal of zero,” she said.The upward tick in extreme fossil fuel financing runs counter to indications that global reliance on fossil fuels may have peaked. The cost of renewables like solar and wind energy has plummeted, and energy storage is burgeoning with the world’s largest lithium ion battery coming online in Australia late last year. Countries such as the U.K., China and France and states including California have all announced plans to move away from combustion engines and embrace electric vehicles.Meanwhile, hundreds of coal plants are shuttering as they become economically unviable. “It’s still far from game over for the fossil fuel industry, but the game has drastically changed,” the report said. There is some good news from the report, said Kirsch, who praised some banks in Europe for “really bold policy movement.” In particular, she pointed to the French bank BNP Paribas, which last year pledged to stop financing shale and oil sands projects.“The financial sector overall is not blind to the weakness of the oil and gas industry ... but we’re just not seeing the action on policies come quick enough,” Kirsch added. She called on banks to take the immediate first step of stopping the financing of fossil fuel expansion. Banks cannot shirk their role in fighting climate change, said Catherine Howarth of U.K.-based nonprofit ShareAction. “The financing decisions of banks are utterly critical to climate outcomes and to the pace of decarbonization in the global economy. Bank boards should be held accountable on the financing of high carbon projects,” she said.For their part, several big banks contacted by HuffPost insisted that they are committed to clean energy. Deutsche Bank referred to its 2016 commitment to no longer finance new coal mining or coal-fired plant construction or expansion.A TD spokeswoman said the bank had committed to provide some $77.5 billion in financing for low-carbon initiatives by 2030. “TD is taking clear steps to help accelerate the development of a low-carbon economy, while recognizing the importance of responsibly developing conventional energy, vital to North America’s economic strength and security,” she said.A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said that the bank “is committed to mobilizing capital to scale up clean energy” and noted that it has provided more than $30 billion in clean energy financing and investment since 2016. She also said Goldman Sachs applies “enhanced due diligence” to coal investments, which includes looking at companies’ environmental track records, evaluating ecological impacts, and considering local community and human rights. RBC and Morgan Stanley did not immediately reply to requests for comment. JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas declined to comment.For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

Lewinsky called for compassion from the media, citing her own treacherous experience with cyberbullying after her 1998 affair with former President Bill Clinton that took the world by storm. “Just imagine walking a mile in someone else’s headline,” Lewinsky said, according to the Washington Examiner. “We need to communicate online with compassion, consume news with compassion, and click with compassion.”Lewinsky, 44, dubbed the media and onslaught of internet vitriol “our culture of humiliation,” adding that the country needs a cultural revolution to stop it. “Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop. It’s time for an intervention in our culture and on the internet,” she said. “The shift begins with something simple, but it’s actually not easy to do. We need to return to a long-held value of compassion. Compassion and empathy.” The anti-cyberbullying activist kept a relatively low profile after the 1998 scandal that inevitably tore her world apart. She didn’t reappear in the public eye until 2015 when she gave a TED Talk in Vancouver titled “The Price of Shame,” in which she discussed the powerful effects of online harassment and being “patient zero” for cyberbullying. In her Tuesday speech, Lewinsky warned of the “dangerous cycle” internet culture has created. “We’ve become people who are in a dangerous cycle. The more we click on this kind of gossip, the more numb we get to the human lives behind it,” she said. “And the more numb we get, the more we click on these kinds of hate. All the while, somebody is making money off the back of someone else’s suffering.”"

I am a model. And I happen to have Vitiligo,” Harlow wrote in the caption. Harlow has the skin condition vitiligo, which causes the loss of skin color in blotches. She burst onto the modeling scene in 2014 as a finalist on the show “America’s Next Top Model.” “Stop putting these titles on me or anyone else. I AM NOT SUFFERING!” Harlow continued. “If anything I’m SUCCEEDING at showing people that their differences don’t make them WHO they are! All our differences are apart of who we are but they don’t define us! I’m sick of every headline ending in ‘Vitiligo Sufferer’ or ‘Suffers from Vitiligo.’ Do you see me suffering?”Harlow has modeled for brands like Diesel and Desigual and has been featured in Vogue Italia, Ebony, Glamour and Cosmopolitan. In 2016, she was chosen as one of BBC’s 100 Women. The young model has made it clear she’s very comfortable in her own skin, but wishes people would stop defining her as her skin condition. In a 2016 interview with Elle Canada, she explained that she wants to be known for more than just her vitiligo. “I’m very sick of talking about my skin,” she said. “I am literally just a human. I have the same brain as you; there’s a skeleton under my skin just like yours. It’s not that serious.”She said that she’s just “living life,” adding: “And if that inspires you, I’m proud, but I’m not going to put pressure on myself to be the best person in the world and tell everyone I have vitiligo. If you want to know about it, you can do your research. Either way, I’m not in the dictionary under ‘vitiligo.’” Well said, Winnie. "

Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did offer the standard White House blanket denial that Trump or his campaign had done anything wrong.“There was no collusion and we’re confident in that,” Sanders said.Trump has called Mueller’s probe a “hoax” and a “witch hunt” dozens of times since taking office 14 months ago. Of late, he has taken to writing “witch hunt” in all capital letters for emphasis.“The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!” he tweeted on March 17.Two days later, he tweeted, “A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!”The new document, filed late Tuesday, is the most recent tidbit to emerge from Mueller’s closely guarded investigation, which so far has produced five guilty pleas and indictments of 14 others ― including 13 Russians who worked to help elect Trump as well as the former chairman of Trump’s campaign, Paul Manafort.Gates was Trump’s deputy campaign chairman and later the campaign’s liaison to the Republican National Committee.Manafort and Gates were also business partners in efforts to help pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, and their indictments accused them of money laundering in that work. Gates has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with Mueller, while Manafort has vowed to fight the charges.“Person A” is not identified in the court filing, but the description reportedly appears to match Konstantin Kilimnik, who managed a Kiev lobbying office for Gates and Manafort.Last summer, according to The New York Times, John Dowd, who was then the president’s main personal lawyer on the Mueller investigation, discussed the idea of giving pardons to Manafort and to retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser. Flynn has also pleaded guilty in the Russia probe, for making false statements to investigators. Pardons could make it harder for Mueller to gather evidence against Trump personally ― but could make it easier for Mueller to prove obstruction of justice.Dowd denied the pardon story in a brief phone interview with HuffPost on Wednesday. “I didn’t have discussions,” he said, before hanging up.At Wednesday’s press briefing, Sanders referred all questions about any pardon discussions to a statement from Ty Cobb, the lawyer handling the Mueller probe for the White House. His statement also denied that there had been any talk of pardons.The U.S. intelligence community concluded during the 2016 campaign that not only was Russia interfering in the U.S. election, but it was actively trying to help Trump and hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.The FBI began its probe of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians well before Election Day. Control of the investigation was shifted to Mueller after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. Soon after, the president told NBC News as well as senior Russian officials visiting the Oval Office that he had done so because of the investigation."

The reptile snaps her jaw shut and a blue liquid comes gushing out of her mouth, indicating that Kliebert’s baby is going to be a boy.“We have a few gators who like to eat fruit, so I figured fruit was great —let’s get a watermelon, drill a hole in it, add some Jell-O to it, and throw it in the gator’s mouth? Let her bust it open, no big deal, you know?” Kliebert explained. “And what better way to do it than having an alligator that is 61 years old that my grandfather hatched in 1957?”Kliebert said the gator in the video is named Sally and “she’s our movie gator.” She’s appeared in commercials and the TV show “American Horror Story,” and she recently filmed a scene for upcoming movie “Louisiana Caviar.” Kliebert says Sally responds to her name and that she received “a big piece of chicken” as a reward for helping in the gender reveal.“Sally’s not just a gator, she’s not just a pet, she’s part of our family,” he said.The viral video has more than 5 million views on Facebook. It ultimately made its way onto other social media platforms, like Twitter, where many  people  expressed  concern for the animal’s well-being.A Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries spokesman said what happened in the video didn’t appear to harm Sally, but the department doesn’t exactly support bringing an alligator to a party.“It wasn’t harmful to the animal,” the spokesman told HuffPost. “But we discourage and don’t condone anyone using an animal as exhibition piece.”He added, “Also, it is not wise to have a dangerous animal in such a demonstration so close to humans, especially children.”Kliebert said he had prepared for numerous scenarios in which things could have gone wrong.“I know gators better than I know the back of my hand,” he said, noting that Sally had opportunities to hurt him in the video, but didn’t.He added that there were “a dozen other gator handlers on the scene, most of my family are gator handlers.”Those handlers include his pregnant girlfriend, Rebecca Miller, who has been a gator handler for four years, and his 9-year-old son, Blaze. “It’s like having your family brought up on the dairy farm,” he explained. “Except with gators.”"

To deplane is to rejoin a world where you can get up from your seat whenever you want, gulp non-recirculated air, and enjoy more than precisely 10 peanuts at a time. But perhaps the worst thing about air travel — worse than the overpriced snacks and jet-engine noise — is the fact that you’re crammed into a confined space and forced to interact with the other people inside it for hours on end.Planes make us reckon with the fact that humans are gross, virus-carrying, disease-burdened flesh sacs. You can avoid someone coughing in the grocery store, but you can’t escape inhaling the same recirculated air as the man in 14B who sounds like he’s dislodging part of his lung.And that’s why scientists study disease transmission on aircraft. Three billion people fly every year, and studies have shown that several serious illnesses have hitched rides to areas they never could have reached otherwise. The SARS virus jumped from Hanoi to Paris in just 14 hours and 50 minutes. H1N1 influenza hopped from L.A. to Auckland and Birmingham in under 10. These transmissions would never have been possible without air travel.But recent research suggests these may be the exceptions that prove the rule. You actually have to be quite close to a sick passenger to catch their disease yourself, depending on how much movement there is during the flight, and most of the surfaces inside an aircraft are surprisingly clean. That’s according to a new study in the journal PNAS, anyway.“If you are seated further away than a meter from an infected passenger, you are unlikely to get infected during flight,” says Howard Weiss, a mathematics professor at Georgia Tech and one of the lead authors on the paper. Weiss works on modeling disease transmission and collaborated with Boeing, which helped fund the study, to figure out how pathogens might travel on planes.To make a model like that, though, you have to actually catch people in the act of spreading viruses. So that’s exactly what they did. The team from Emory and Georgia Tech flew on 10 total flights between Atlanta and the West Coast, recording literally every interaction the passengers had with each other. Close physical proximity is how many diseases spread, so any contact between flight attendants or seat mates is an opportunity to disseminate a virus. And wow, are there a lot of interactions — though not a lot of coughing.“What most surprised me was that on 10 flights, eight during flu season, only one of 1,500 passengers on 10 flights was coughing,” says Weiss. Which is probably a good thing, since he says the other thing that surprised him was the sheer number of interactions: 5,000 on a four-hour flight.Despite all those points of contact, their mathematical model shows that a sick patient would only be likely to spread illness to people in their own row and one row in front and behind them. Consider this the sneeze splash zone, if you will. Outside of that immediate proximity, it seems passengers are pretty much safe. The researchers even swabbed many of the hard surfaces inside the plane — bathroom door handles, seat belt buckles, and tray tables — all of which came back negative for a panel of 18 respiratory viruses. This either means that either not many sick people were flying on those particular days, or airlines are preternaturally good at disinfecting. No word yet on how clean the fabric seats are.It also seems to show that the air filtration systems in airplanes are actually pretty good. The recirculated air may be unpleasant, but it is sent through a HEPA filter, which removes 99.9 percent of all particulates in the air — it’s what hospitals use in operating rooms and ICUs. Circulating air also stays in a pretty small area, roughly every couple of rows, so any errant viruses probably get trapped in one little air loop.And now comes the point in the story where we note that these results can’t be extrapolated to every flight. These were transcontinental American flights, so it won’t necessarily apply to larger or smaller planes with shorter or longer flight times. It also doesn’t apply to all viruses—measles, for example, is a particularly tiny virus that stays airborne for long periods of time. And of course, while this study did the best it could with the data it had, 10 flights is still a pretty small number. It’s possible that, on average, planes are far dirtier (or carry far sicker passengers). As is always the case in science, we’ll need more data to be sure.Here’s what we do know: being around lots of people, especially while doing something stressful like traveling, makes you more likely to get sick. Weiss’ advice, even after observing so few coughing fits and viruses in the field, is to practice good hygiene and to keep your hands away from your face. Planes aside, we should all probably be washing our hands more. “I suspect that many people do not understand the importance of good hand hygiene,” notes Weiss. And he’s right. Many of us don’t even realize how we get sick: sharing a water glass with a sneezy friend isn’t dangerous because you might drink their backwash, but because you’re liable to touch your face not long after touching the glass (the average person touches their face about 3.5 times every hour) which means you’ll get their virus or bacteria right into your vulnerable mucus membranes.Pathogens love the moist, warm environment inside your nose and lungs, and your hands are the vehicle that gets them there.

A day later, he followed up with a statement explaining that he was stepping away from active ministry because of a “personal failing” that has “embarrassed my family, my Lord, myself, and the Kingdom.”“Out of a desire to protect my family and those I have hurt, I initially announced my retirement earlier today without a complete explanation,” the pastor said in a statement released to Baptist Press on Tuesday. “However, after further wrestling with my personal indiscretion, it became apparent to me that this situation must be acknowledged in a more forthright manner.”Page, 65, added that he’s seeking to rebuild his relationship with his wife and two daughters. No further details have been reported about the nature of the relationship, or who the other party was. The SBC did not respond to a request for comment for this story.Page served as president of the SBC from 2006 to 2008. He was elected as president of the denomination’s executive committee in 2010, and was tasked with overseeing a budget of nearly $200 million, according to The Associated Press.The executive committee is an administrative body that coordinates the national ministries of the SBC and handles its financial affairs. The SBC consists of a network of more than 47,000 independently operating Baptist churches, with a total membership of more than 15 million people.Stephen Rummage, the executive committee’s current chairman, said Page has expressed “deep regret” about how his actions have caused pain for others.Rummage said the executive committee recognized that it needed to share the news about Page’s resignation with the “watching world” and other Southern Baptists “with truth and candor.”“My heart is broken for Dr. Page, his family and everyone affected,” Rummage said in a statement. “I believe I speak for the entire Executive Committee in saying that we are committed to provide them the spiritual and emotional support they need in the coming days.”"

Kelly Trained 14-Year-Old Girl As Sex ‘Pet,’ Ex-Girlfriend Says",Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/r-kelly-trained-14-year-old-girl-as-sex-pet-ex-girlfriend-says_us_5abb6446e4b04a59a312bd82,New sexual misconduct allegations raise the question of whether the R&B star will face a Me Too reckoning.,2018-03-28,"R. Kelly performs at Little Caesars Arena on February 21, 2018 in Detroit, Michigan. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abb6cd1200000d30ceb335d.jpeg?cache=zX382lk7HG&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"R. Kelly faces fresh allegations of sexual misconduct in a new BBC documentary — the latest in a decades-long string of sex abuse claims against the R&B singer. The documentary, “R Kelly: Sex, Girls and Videotapes,” released on Wednesday, features several people who accuse Kelly of predatory behavior. Kelly’s musical career has been relatively unscathed by previous accusations, but the documentary raises the possibility he may finally face a Me Too reckoning. Ex-girlfriend Kitti Jones says in the film that the singer forced her and other women to have sex with him in a “sex dungeon.” She also said Kelly, whose real name is Robert Kelly, groomed an underage girl to be his sex “pet.”“I was introduced to one of the girls [in the ‘dungeon’] that he told me he ‘trained’ since she was 14, those were his words,” said Jones, according to The Guardian. “I saw that she was dressed like me, that she was saying the things I’d say and her mannerisms were like mine. That’s when it clicked in my head that he had been grooming me to become one of his pets. He calls them his pets.”Jones, a radio DJ who dated Kelly for two years starting in 2011, said the singer once made the unidentified woman “crawl on the floor towards me and perform oral sex on me, and he said, ‘This is my fucking pet, I trained her. She’s going to teach you how to be with me.’” The Guardian reported that the age of the woman at the time of the encounter is not known.Lovell Jones, a collaborator of Kelly’s, says in the documentary that the singer’s “liking for young girls” was “common knowledge.” He said Kelly had instructed him to find girls who “looked young” at after-show parties.Kelly has previously denied accusations of sexual and physical abuse.Sexual misconduct allegations date back at least to 1994, when he allegedly married his protégé Aaliyah, who was then 15. In 2008, he was acquitted on child pornography charges after a video showed him allegedly having sex with and urinating on a 14-year-old girl. Kelly reportedly made out-of-court settlements with multiple women, including one who accused him of having sex with her when she was 15.Kitti Jones, in interviews last year, described Kelly’s sex “cult” involving several women.“He controls every aspect of their lives: dictating what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep, and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records,” BuzzFeed writer Jim DeRogatis wrote. Jones told Rolling Stone Kelly forced her to “stand up and greet daddy” every time he walked into a room, physically abused her and forced her into uncomfortable sexual situations. She mentioned the incident in which another woman crawled toward her. “I’ve trained this bitch. This is my pet,” Jones quoted Kelly as saying. Despite the torrent of allegations, Kelly remains a major celebrity who has continued to book concerts, get endorsements and work with top artists. Kelly, described as the most successful R&B singer of the past 30 years, has sold nearly 60 million albums. "

Wriggelsworth declined to say on what charges Strampel, 70, was arrested until the defendant was arraigned at a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday.A jail website listed the former dean of Michigan State’s College of Osteopathic Medicine as an inmate there but gave no other information.The Detroit Free-Press newspaper reported that he faces multiple charges, at least one a felony.An attorney for Strampel, who has been on medical leave from the university since December, could not be reached by Reuters for comment on Monday evening.Michigan State University President John Engler said in February he was moving to revoke tenure for Strampel for failing to enforce 2014 guidelines created for Nassar in treating young athletes after complaints of sexual misconduct against him.The college has been criticized for its handling of complaints about Nassar stretching back for years.Michigan State terminated Nassar in September 2016 for his failure to follow those protocols, including having another person present when he performed the procedures.Numerous women said they were assaulted even after the guidelines were put in place.Nassar was sentenced in February to up to 125 years in prison after some 200 young women testified about decades of abuse at his hands.He had already received a sentence up to 175 years in a neighboring Michigan county, and was sentenced to a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions.Reporting by Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Editing by Sandra Maler and Lisa Shumaker"

By a 2-to-1 margin, 44 percent to 22 percent, they say those actions should disqualify her from becoming the CIA’s director.Opinions are sharply politicized ― most Hillary Clinton voters say that both supervising a black site and destroying tapes should be disqualifying, and a majority of Trump voters say that neither should be.The American public also remains divided about the acceptability of torture as part of the nation’s anti-terrorism efforts, with a significant share unsure of their stance on the subject.Americans are about evenly split on whether torture is ever acceptable in the fight against terrorism, with 36 percent saying that it is, and 37 percent that it is not. But they say, 43 percent to 26 percent, that it’s possible to fight terrorism without the use of torture.Just a quarter say information gained from the use of torture against suspected terrorists is mostly reliable, with a third considering it unreliable and the remaining 42 percent unsure.The public broadly believes waterboarding detainees to be a form of torture. Twenty-seven percent consider its use acceptable, with 44 percent saying it’s unacceptable and the remainder undecided.The views expressed in the most recent poll show little evidence of any significant shift since 2014 when Americans said, 47 percent to 30 percent, that fighting terrorism without torture was possible and were about evenly split on whether information gleaned from its use was reliable.Opinions on torture remain starkly divided along political lines, with Clinton voters more than five times likelier than Trump voters to say torture is never acceptable.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 20-22 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

A Facebook spokesperson reached by HuffPost via email on Tuesday did not elaborate on why the CEO will not appear.“Both Chris Cox and Mike Schroepfer report directly to Mr. Zuckerberg and are among the longest serving senior representatives in Facebook’s 15 year history,” reads the letter signed by Facebook UK’s head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson. “Both of them have extensive expertise in these issues and are well placed to answer the Committee’s questions on these complex subjects.”Collins is chair of the House of Commons’ Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which sent Zuckerberg the request last week. He blasted Facebook’s response during a committee hearing on Tuesday.“I think it is absolutely astonishing that Mark Zuckerberg is not prepared to submit himself to questioning in front of a parliamentary or congressional hearing, given that these are questions of the fundamental importance and concern to Facebook users and as well as to our inquiry as well,” he said. “I think I would certainly urge him to think again if he has any care for people who use his company’s services.”Collins on March 20 asked that Zuckerberg appear and answer questions about how Facebook and other social media companies acquire and retain user data. Lawmakers in the U.S. have made similar requests to the CEO, though he hasn’t declared publicly whether he will testify before Congress.Collins’ letter followed revelations that Facebook users’ private information had been shared without their knowledge to Cambridge Analytica, a U.K.-based company that was hired by political campaigns, including that of President Donald Trump.In his letter, Collins accused Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives of misleading the committee and of understating the risk of users’ data being used without their consent.“It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,” Collins’ letter reads.Though Collins requested that “a senior Facebook executive” appear for questioning, he stressed to Zuckerberg: “I hope that this representative will be you.”The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said Monday it has opened an investigation into Facebook’s privacy practices amid concerns that the company may have violated a 2011 privacy policy agreement during the data’s release.Facebook shares fell more than 5 percent following the FTC’s announcement, a drop of more than 23 percent from their Feb. 1 peak.In advertisements that were printed in newspapers in the U.S. and U.K. on Sunday, Zuckerberg apologized to users for what he called “a breach of trust.”“We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it,” the advertisements read."

Some are calling on allies to participate in a silent march on Wednesday in Paris in memory of the grandmother and other recent French victims of anti-Semitism.“We need more people to feel moved, concerned, and therefore take an active part in this fight,” Simone Rodan-Benzaquen, director of the advocacy group American Jewish Committee (AJC) in Europe, wrote in an op-ed for HuffPost France. “When anti-Semitic violence grows, democracy is at stake.”Knoll was reportedly stabbed 11 times during the attack inside her Paris apartment on Friday. Her body was partly burned after the attackers tried to set her home on fire, The New York Times reported.Two men have been arrested in connection to the killing and face preliminary charges of murder with anti-Semitic motives, according to The Associated Press.The woman’s son, Daniel Knoll, said that his mother had known one of the suspects for a long time and often invited him into her home against the advice of her children. “My mother had a thirst for knowledge and meeting new people and talking to them and that’s what killed her,” he told the AP.Some Jewish leaders reflected on the tragic irony of Knoll’s death, which came decades after the woman fled the Holocaust. In 1942, a then-9-year-old Knoll narrowly escaped being deported to a Nazi concentration camp with thousands of other Parisian Jews. Knoll was able to escape the mass arrest, which became known as the Vel d’Hiv roundup, with the help of a family member with Brazilian citizenship, the AP reported. The family fled to Portugal. Knoll returned to her home country after the end of World War II.Nearly all those who were arrested during the roundup ― more than 13,000 people ― were murdered at Auschwitz. Francis Kalifat, head of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF), an umbrella group for French Jewish organizations, said Knoll was “absolutely massacred.”“This makes one feel something absolutely terrible,” Kalifat told The New York Times. “She escaped the anti-Semitism of the Nazis, but in the end her destiny followed her because she was killed because of anti-Semitism.”France’s Grand Rabbi, Haïm Korsia, said he was “horrified” by Knoll’s death. He compared the murder to that of another Jewish woman in the same Paris arrondissement, Sarah Halimi, last April. The 65-year-old Orthodox Jewish woman was assaulted and thrown out of a window by a suspect of Malian origin. It took months for French prosecutors to classify Halimi’s murder as an anti-Semitic attack.“The horror of crime and the violence of the murderers are identical and remind us of the negative side of humanity,” Korsia wrote in a tweet.France’s Jewish communities have grown increasingly concerned about safety in recent years. In 2015, four people were killed during an attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris. Nearly 8,000 French Jews reportedly moved to Israel in the year after this attack.In 2012, three children and a teacher were murdered outside a Jewish school in Toulouse.Anti-Semitic violence in France increased by 26 percent in 2017, while criminal damage to Jewish synagogues and cemeteries increased by 22 percent, according to a national study.This January, a kosher grocery store near Paris was damaged in a suspected arson attack. Weeks later, an 8-year-old boy wearing a Jewish kippa was beaten up in a northern Paris suburb. Marc Knobel, a historian at CRIF, told The Local France that the deaths of Halimi and Knoll have contributed to a “great feeling of fear and insecurity” in Jewish communities. “People are extremely shocked and very worried,” he said.Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo called on Parisians to join Wednesday’s silent march in honor of Knoll. A wide array of French politicians have promised to attend, the AP reported.In a tweet, French President Emmanuel Macron said he was appalled by Knoll’s murder and expressed his “absolute determination to fight against anti-Semitism.”Rodan-Benzaquen, director of AJC Europe, said that while these declarations for politicians help French Jews “feel less lonely,” more needs to be done by French citizens and society at large. She called on all Parisians to march on Wednesday for “our assassinated grandmother.”“Many French Jews believe that while they have tried to warn their fellow citizens that this hatred will spread and ultimately attack French people everywhere, only few have listened,” she wrote.

Nearly 8,000 French Jews reportedly moved to Israel in the year after this attack.In 2012, three children and a teacher were murdered outside a Jewish school in Toulouse.Anti-Semitic violence in France increased by 26 percent in 2017, while criminal damage to Jewish synagogues and cemeteries increased by 22 percent, according to a national study.This January, a kosher grocery store near Paris was damaged in a suspected arson attack. Weeks later, an 8-year-old boy wearing a Jewish kippa was beaten up in a northern Paris suburb. Marc Knobel, a historian at CRIF, told The Local France that the deaths of Halimi and Knoll have contributed to a “great feeling of fear and insecurity” in Jewish communities. “People are extremely shocked and very worried,” he said.Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo called on Parisians to join Wednesday’s silent march in honor of Knoll. A wide array of French politicians have promised to attend, the AP reported.In a tweet, French President Emmanuel Macron said he was appalled by Knoll’s murder and expressed his “absolute determination to fight against anti-Semitism.”Rodan-Benzaquen, director of AJC Europe, said that while these declarations for politicians help French Jews “feel less lonely,” more needs to be done by French citizens and society at large. She called on all Parisians to march on Wednesday for “our assassinated grandmother.”“Many French Jews believe that while they have tried to warn their fellow citizens that this hatred will spread and ultimately attack French people everywhere, only few have listened,” she wrote.

The 21-car behemoth chugged into Beijing’s central train station, where a military honor guard and a large motorcade of diplomatic vehicles reportedly met it. But senior officials in the U.S., South Korea and China declined to comment on exactly who was thought to be in the carriages.The news of Kim’s visit was only officially confirmed after the same train left Beijing. Yang Jiech, a leading Chinese diplomat, will brief South Korean officials on Thursday about the meeting, South Korea’s government said.President Donald Trump said he heard from Xi on Tuesday night.“His meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency said Kim made the unofficial visit at Xi’s request, just weeks before the North Korean leader is expected to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump. Kim was also accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol-ju, and his senior advisers.The meeting is a new development in the diplomatic saga on the Korean peninsula. Kim met with envoys from South Korea earlier this month, who later said the North Korean government was open to holding talks with the United States.Chinese media reported that Kim expressed a similar willingness for dialogue during his meeting with Xi.“The issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved, if south Korea and the United States respond to our efforts with goodwill, create an atmosphere of peace and stability while taking progressive and synchronous measures for the realization of peace,” Kim Jong Un was quoted as saying in Xinhua News. The outlet also said Kim hoped to “develop friendship” with China following the meeting.It’s unclear where a summit between Kim and Trump would take place. Until this week, Kim had never crossed North Korean borders. A sitting U.S. president has never traveled to the country.This is a developing story. Please check back for updates."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba98a5200000d30ceb32a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ed Butowsky was already facing one lawsuit from the family of Seth Rich ― the slain Democratic National Committee staffer whose death fueled far-right political conspiracy theories that he had leaked thousands of internal DNC emails ― when a second landed at his feet on Tuesday morning.Aaron Rich, Seth Rich’s brother, sued Butowsky and others in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the wealthy Texas financial adviser helped create a “defamatory campaign” against him and his late brother. Earlier in March, the brothers’ parents sued Butowsky and Fox News, alleging that they had “intentionally exploited” Seth’s death “through lies, misrepresentations and half-truths.”“How many family members do they have that want to sue me?” an exasperated Butowsky told HuffPost over the phone on Tuesday afternoon. “I’m waiting for first and second cousins to sue me now.”Asked to confirm he was speaking on the record, Butowsky exclaimed: “Yes! I want it all out there.”“How many Riches are there?” Butowsky continued. “I know there are a couple other Riches in Omaha that haven’t sued me yet. So tell them; everyone sue me and get it over with.”Seth Rich was shot and killed while walking home in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016. Washington police have yet to arrest anyone connected to the case, which they have described as a robbery attempt gone wrong.Butowsky, a Dallas-based financial consultant who has previously made major donations to Republican candidates, reached out to the Rich family in the wake of the murder with an offer to help finance a private investigation into it. That led to the hiring of Rod Wheeler, a former Washington Metro Police Department investigator and Fox News contributor with a history of dabbling in conspiracy theories.Instead of solving the murder, though, the Rich family has claimed that Butowsky only helped fuel the far-right conspiracy that Seth and Aaron Rich were the true culprits behind the hacking of DNC servers that led to the leak of internal emails and memos before the 2016 elections.Seth, in the view of these conspiracy peddlers, delivered the emails to WikiLeaks, and was then killed by Democratic Party operatives in order to keep him silent.Those theories have never had any basis in fact, according to police, the Rich family or American intelligence officials, who issued a report in January 2017 that tied the leaks to Russian hackers.The Daily Beast reported in March that intelligence officials had also tied Guccifer 2.0, the “lone hacker” who has taken credit for the original breach of the DNC’s servers, to the Kremlin itself after he failed to shield his identity with a virtual private networking service.Butowsky, who called the lawsuit from the Rich family “bullshit” and “one of the dumbest things” he’d ever seen, reacted similarly to news of Aaron’s complaint, which claims that Butowsky, conservative newspaper The Washington Times, and internet activist Matthew Couch and his own right-wing media company falsely tied Aaron to the leaks.“I’m not sure what these lawsuits are about, or why they’re doing them,” Butowsky said. “All these people are running around talking about some guy named Guccifer 2. I don’t know what a Guccifer is. I really don’t care about any of this. It’s not a part of my life that matters.”Aaron, the lawsuit states, “has suffered substantial economic harm” and “severe emotional distress” thanks to Butowsky and the other defendants’ “campaign of defamation.”But despite Aaron’s agonies and the lack of evidence supporting the conspiracy theories around Seth’s murder, Butowsky continued to insist that the Rich parents had admitted their son’s involvement when he first spoke to them.“Just tell the darn truth and be honest with this country with what you know and what you said, and let’s move on,” Butowsky said. “They’ve made up this fallacious story, calling me a political operative. What the hell is a political operative? Am I James Bond or something?”Butowsky and the other named defendants “are entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to spread vicious lies about an innocent man,” Aaron’s attorney, Michael Gottlieb, said in a statement. “Those who defame and harass decent American citizens in an effort to advance their personal financial and partisan gain will be held accountable in court.” A spokesperson for the Rich family declined to respond to Butowsky.Butowsky issued his own threat to a family that has said they only pursued legal action “to help prevent this kind of malicious and reckless behavior in the future so that others can be spared the hell the Riches have had to endure.” “If this keeps going, I’ll start filing my lawsuits,” Butowsky said. “Because I’m a little annoyed by the Rich family.”"

Heartbreaking reports of the youngsters’ final moments suggest many were trapped in a cinema where they’d gone to enjoy a screening of a kids movie. Many of them called family members to ask for help or say goodbye as the blaze encroached.One child penned a final message on social media: “We are burning,” wrote 13-year-old Maria Moroz. “I love you all. This is perhaps farewell.”The fire reportedly started on the fourth floor of the “Winter Cherry” shopping center in Kemerovo, Russia, at around 4 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. According to Vladimir Chernov, a deputy governor of the region, the blaze originated in the children’s play area in the mall. The cause of the fire remains unknown, though Chernov suggested a child may have used a lighter to ignite the foam filler of a trampoline in the play area, according to The New York Times.Video shared online by Russian news outlets showed thick smoke rapidly filling the fourth floor as the fire began to spread.Russian authorities confirmed Monday that emergency exits at the shopping center had been blocked and the fire alarm system had been switched off, corroborating eyewitness accounts. Harrowing videos posted on social media showed desperate people jumping from windows to escape the fire. An 11-year-old boy was among those who jumped.Russia’s Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said the child had survived but was in “serious condition.” He lost his parents and a younger sister in the fire, Skvortsova said. At least 64 people died in the inferno, described as one of the worst fire disasters in modern Russian history. Interfax news agency said Monday that at least 41 of those killed were children. Earlier reports said an entire fifth grade class and their teacher had perished in the blaze.The aunt of one of the fifth-graders said her niece, 11-year-old Viktoria, had called her just minutes after the fire began.“She said that everything was in flames, and that the doors were blocked in the cinema. She said she couldn’t escape and couldn’t breathe,” Yevgeniya Oganesyan told the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. “I told her: Vika, take off your clothes and bring them to your nose, breathe through your clothes. She told me, ‘Tell Mummy that I loved her. Tell everyone that I loved them.’” Other families recounted similarly agonizing calls. Alexander Lillevyali told independent news outlet Meduza that his daughters had called him from the movie theater saying the room was filling with smoke but they couldn’t escape because the doors were locked. Lillevyali said he’d accompanied his three young daughters into the theater and had placed them in their seats with boxes of popcorn. He’d then gone downstairs to wait for their movie to finish when he received their desperate call. “As I was running up the stairs, somebody handed me a wet rag, and I used it to cover my nose,” Lillevyali said of his attempt to rescue his children. “When I reached the fourth floor, I broke a window to send the draft upwards. Then I collapsed. I started crawling, but I realized at this point that I’d lost all strength.”One of his daughters “kept calling me and calling me,” he continued, speaking through tears. “I just shouted into the phone that she needed to try to get out of the theater, but there was nothing I could do. In front of me, it was already flames.” Igor Vostrikov said he also lost his three young children in the fire. His wife and sister had also perished, he said ― all of them had been in the cinema when the fire broke out. “[My wife] Lena called from there,” Vostrikov told Komsomolskaya Pravda. “She screamed, ‘Help us, rescue us, we’ve been locked up.’”Russian authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the fire and said they would punish anyone found guilty of negligence. Several people involved in the mall’s operation, including the building’s owner, have reportedly been detained for questioning.Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the scene of the blaze Monday and blamed “criminal negligence” for the tragedy. “What’s happening here? This isn’t war, it’s not a spontaneous methane outburst. People came to relax, children. We’re talking about demography and losing so many people,” Putin was quoted as telling Kemerovo officials, according to The Guardian. “Why? Because of some criminal negligence, because of slovenliness. How could this ever happen?” "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab9d5351f0000270616b89a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BLANDING, Utah — Passionate proponents and ardent critics of Bears Ears National Monument filed into a school gymnasium here Monday evening for the first of two public scoping meetings that the federal government is holding to receive input on how the Trump administration should manage what remains of the protected Utah site. Some called on the bureaus tasked with overseeing the new monument to establish a management plan for the original boundary, arguing the entire archaeologically rich landscape deserves increased protections. Others urged officials to ensure monument lands remain open for grazing, off-road vehicles and other activities. And several questioned if the administration wasn’t getting ahead of itself by moving forward with land-use planning amid numerous legal challenges.Monday’s event in Blanding comes nearly four months after President Donald Trump gutted the 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears National Monument by 85 percent, reducing it to just over 200,000 acres. He described the monument, designated by President Barack Obama in the final weeks of his presidency, as a massive federal land grab that “threatened” local economies and Utahns’ way of life. The new monument is divided into two disconnected sites, named Shash Jaa and Indian Creek, and includes two small satellite units around well-known archaeological sites. Ernie Washee, a resident of Blanding and a member of the Navajo Nation, dismissed the meeting a “big charade.” “They call it a planning process, but the decision has already been made,” he said. His wife, Rebecca Stoneman-Washee, called the recent rollback “tragic” and said the administration shouldn’t do anything until the numerous legal challenges play out in court. Named after a pair of buttes, Bears Ears is home to more than 100,000 Native American archaeological and cultural sites and is considered sacred to many tribes. The Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition — a group of five Native American tribes that petitioned for the area to be given monument status — is among the parties now suing the Trump administration over its recent decision.Monument supporters aren’t the only ones disappointed with the final outcome. For Zeb Dalton, a cattle rancher from Blanding, 85 percent wasn’t enough. He said he appreciates what Trump did — “It’s better,” he said — but hoped the monument would be rescinded altogether. Dalton, who has grazing permits both within the original and new monument boundary, argues the designation does nothing to protect archaeological sites and said he worries the management plan will limit his ability to ranch on the lands, despite the fact that the Obama-era declaration clearly stated that ranching can continue. He said he can’t understand how one person — the president — could have the power to single handedly designate such a large area of land. “If they want to do this, they ought to put it through Congress,” he said.Representatives of the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service stressed to participants that the meetings were the beginning of a long process to draft and ultimately implement a management plan, and that their comments were important and would be considered. It’s understandable why some might be skeptical.Following a months-long review of 27 national monuments, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended that Trump shrink or otherwise weaken protections for 10, including Bears Ears and nearby Grand Staircase-Escalante. In his final report to the White House, Zinke acknowledged that the vast majority of the 2.8 million public comments received by the Interior Department as part of the review favored maintaining the current size of all monuments, but cast them off as part of “a well-orchestrated national campaign organized by multiple organizations.” Leslie Lamont, who attended Monday’s meeting from Carbondale, Colorado, said it’s been frustrating to watch all the input and work that went into having the monument designated be sidelined by Trump’s unprecedented and sweeping cut. “I feel that a process occurred and it never got off the ground,” she said. “It was just chopped off.” Lloyd Nielson, of Blanding, said he’s not for or against the monument. Rather, he finds the designation “pointless,” as he said it created more work for the Bureau of Land Management at a time with resources and federal funding are stretched thin.“There’s no right answer,” he said. “It’s just stupid.” A second meeting to receive input on Bears Ears National Monument is scheduled for Tuesday in Bluff. A pair of meetings to receive input on land use planning for Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument will be held later this week. "

It’s not good for anything,” said attorney Ted Olson, who recently declined to join President Donald Trump's legal team.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab987c61e00003b137afcf4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump seems to be having difficulty finding lawyers to represent him in the widening probe of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Last week, Trump’s lead attorney for the special counsel investigation, John Dowd, tendered his resignation, prompting a White House search that has yet to yield a suitable replacement. At least six lawyers in the last week have turned down an offer to represent the president. Lawyers and legal experts say it’s not hard to see why: Lawyers could place themselves at great risk by working for a client with a reputation for impulsiveness and an inability to heed advice, who tends to undercut legal strategy with haphazard public statements and an itchy Twitter finger and who, as a result, may not be worth the publicity and likely future business associated with representing a president of the United States.“One of the things you always wonder about when you’re asked to replace another lawyer is ‘Why?’” said George Clark, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney specializing in legal ethics. Clark noted that many lawyers endure guilty or ethically challenged clients ― the right to legal counsel being something attorneys strive to uphold ― but erratic clients are a whole different can of worms. Refusing to take advice from counsel, for example, is a common reason why lawyers drop clients.Trump’s difficulties with staffing his legal team come as special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation is said to be entering a critical phase. While the president has publicly embraced the prospect of sitting down for an interview with the special counsel’s team, Trump’s lawyers have been divided on the subject. Dowd reportedly opposed it, and his departure clears a path to begin preparations for an interview.Trump has, in recent days, also escalated his attacks against the Russia probe, leading many to speculate that Mueller’s job itself could be in peril. Last week, the president ignored cautioning from his counsel and lashed out at Mueller by name for the first time.Further complicating the search for lawyers is that representing Trump could present a conflict of interest, since the existing clients of high-profile and seasoned litigators may already be connected to individuals under investigation. Attorneys Joe diGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing, for example, were ultimately unable to represent the president as was previously announced, due to conflicts of interest with the case.Robert Rizzi, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson who also teaches government ethics at Harvard Law School, declined to be interviewed for this story. But he too said there was a “good chance” he had represented or worked with many of the involved parties. Rizzi was one of a number of lawyers at prominent firms with large political practices who declined to comment to HuffPost for that reason.Potential candidates for Trump’s legal team are likely dissuaded by other factors, too ― such as the seemingly unending upheaval in the White House and among the Cabinet agencies.“I think everybody would agree this is turmoil, chaos, confusion. It’s not good for anything,” Ted Olson, who served as solicitor general in President George W. Bush’s administration and who recently declined White House entreaties to join Trump’s legal team, said Monday during an interview on MSNBC. “We always believe that there should be an orderly process, and of course government is not clean or orderly ever, but this seems to be beyond normal.”Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Fordham University, said that representing Trump in the Mueller probe could also threaten one’s professional reputation and may even put one in legal jeopardy.Shugerman pointed to a recent episode involving Dowd and the circumstances surrounding the firing of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. In December, Dowd claimed he drafted a tweet for the president’s Twitter account that said: “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.” The tweet seemed to indicate that Trump was aware that Flynn had lied to the FBI before firing him, an admission that could bolster a possible obstruction of justice case against the president. Dowd’s explanation for why he ― and not the president ― had authored the tweet may have exposed him to questions from the special counsel, as well.“It is difficult for one to maintain one’s appearance of being an ethical lawyer while trying to represent Donald Trump,” Shugerman said. “Any lawyer who has observed those episodes is going to see that joining this team at this stage runs a risk to their professional lives.”"

The company said it will instead provide a senior deputy to testify and answer questions, an offer that was criticized by a Parliament member.Similar requests have been made by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who on Monday invited Zuckerberg, as well as the CEOs of Google and Twitter, to attend a hearing on data privacy and social media.That hearing, scheduled for April 10, “will broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,” Grassley’s office said.Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Kennedy (R-La.) last week sent a letter to Grassley asking that he hold a judiciary hearing with Zuckerberg and fellow social media CEOs.Klobuchar appeared to celebrate news of Zuckerberg’s plans to testify on Twitter on Tuesday.“Next up, Cambridge Analytica must testify,” she tweeted.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Zuckerberg’s testimony plans.This post has been updated with comment from a House Energy and Commerce Committee spokeswoman."

72,POLITICS,Establishment-Backed Democrat Leaves Congressional Race Under Threat Of Ballot Challenge,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christina-hartman-withdraws-pennsylvania-house-race_us_5aba78f3e4b06409775ab459,Christina Hartman previously ran in an adjacent district.,2018-03-27,"Democrat Christina Hartman, who had deep pockets and high-profile endorsements, has announced her withdrawal from a race for Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba797a1e0000fb077afe44.jpeg?cache=R8URaJYdnI&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A well-funded Pennsylvania Democrat with deep establishment support withdrew from the state district’s Democratic primary Tuesday, after reports that she was going to face a challenge to her eligibility to appear on the ballot.Christina Hartman was running in Pennsylvania’s 10th Congressional District. Her decision to leave the race follows news that her rival Democrat George Scott planned to join a complaint questioning whether she received the required number of signatures under state law to appear on the ballot. The deadline for ballot challenges is Tuesday.A separate forthcoming challenge was also going to call into question the ballot signatures, as well as the veracity of an affidavit saying Hartman lived in the district, according to a Pennsylvania Democrat familiar with the challenge.“There appears to have been a larger and much more broad challenge coming from other candidates in the race that may have indicated the beginning of the end for Christina’s campaign,” the Democrat said.Hartman’s departure opens up the field in a newly competitive district that includes the Pennsylvania capital of Harrisburg.Hartman had raised over $350,000 for a run in the neighboring 11th Congressional District, which includes Lancaster. But after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court ordered the redrawing of the state’s congressional districts, the 11th district became much more Republican and the 10th became more favorable to Democrats.Seeking to remain in a district where she would be competitive, Hartman announced in late February that she would be moving to the new 10th district and running there.“When the new districts were announced, I had to make a quick and difficult decision to continue my campaign in a new district,” Hartman said in a statement. “After further consideration, I’ve decided that this is not the right time for me, and I will support the Democratic nominee in November.”Four Democrats remain in the race for Pennsylvania’s 10th: Scott, a former U.S. Army officer; Eric Ding, a public health scientist; Alan Howe, a retired career Air Force officer; and Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson, a former Obama administration official.The winner of the May 15 primary will take on three-term incumbent Rep. Scott Perry (R).The Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s February decision to draw new congressional district boundaries, after concluding that the previous lines were unconstitutionally gerrymandered, has roiled the Keystone State’s politics.For the most part, the changes have benefited Democrats, making the party more competitive in several districts, including the 4th Congressional District, which was redrawn to become the current 10th district.President Donald Trump won Rep. Perry’s 4th district by 21 percentage points, but he would have won the new 10th district by just 9 points.Pennsylvania’s 11th Congressional District, by contrast, went from a district that Trump won by 7 percentage points to one where he would have won by 26 points.Prior to moving to the new 10th district, Hartman’s bid had already attracted national scrutiny as an example of what some activists considered questionable Democratic establishment intervention in primaries.Despite underperforming Hillary Clinton’s margin in the district in 2016, Hartman had lined up the support of national and state-level Democratic leaders, as well as fundraising powerhouses like EMILY’s List and End Citizens United PAC. Some progressive activists lamented that the party was trying to stifle the bid of Jess King, a well-funded Lancaster-based nonprofit leader who was battling Hartman from the left.But if Hartman came to the 10th district seeking greener pastures, she encountered stiff resistance from the get-go. Corbin-Johnson’s campaign blasted Hartman in early March for a phone call in which Hartman allegedly offered Corbin-Johnson a job if she withdrew from the race. Although Hartman denied that characterization of the call, Corbin-Johnson’s team maintained that the call was the “disrespectful” gesture of a well-heeled carpetbagger.Corbin-Johnson’s status as an African-American heightened the symbolism of the flap. Collective PAC, which backs black Democratic candidates, argued that the affair reflected the national party’s unwillingness to empower black candidates like Corbin-Johnson.Even before Hartman formally withdrew, EMILY’s List told HuffPost Tuesday that it had re-opened its endorsement process in light of the new district boundaries. The pro-abortion rights group left open the possibility that it would endorse Corbin-Johnson.“Given the change in Pennsylvania’s district lines, we are taking a new look at every district with fresh eyes to determine our involvement,” an EMILY’s List spokesperson said.For its part, the National Republican Congressional Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the House, hailed Hartman’s departure as win for the GOP.“Democrats’ chances of picking up this seat just went from slim to none,” said NRCC Spokesman Chris Martin."
73,IMPACT,This German Teen Is Leading A Global Plan To Plant A Trillion Trees,"John Vidal, On assignment for HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tree-planting-felix-finkbeiner_us_5ab3b850e4b0decad0478b8c,"Felix Finkbeiner, 19, has already planted 15 billion saplings.",2018-03-27,"An aerial view of the Amazon Rainforest at the Bom Futuro National Forest in Port Velho, Brazil.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab8d5c31e00008e0b7afbb4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Felix Finkbeiner is a young man in a hurry to get the world to plant trees. The 19-year-old from a small Bavarian village near Munich, now studying at a university in London, has founded a global youth movement, Plant For The Planet, which has spearheaded the planting of over 15 billion saplings, signed up 75,000 children as climate ambassadors.Alongside setting up Change Chocolate, a successful fair-trade chocolate company to raise money, the tall, spectacled teenager has joined with three of the world’s biggest conservation charities to launch the most ambitious reforestation project in history.The Trillion Tree campaign aims to get the world to plant 1 trillion trees in the next 30 years. To put that into context, scientists calculate there are currently 3 trillion trees growing worldwide.Each mature tree absorbs about 22 pounds of carbon dioxide per year, Finkbeiner says, “so one trillion could capture 25 percent of all human-made CO2 emissions and help to keep global temperature rise below the crucial 2-degree C limit. It does not replace the need to avoid carbon emissions, as agreed in Paris, but is a necessary addition.”Finkbeiner thinks big. He has spoken at the United Nations and European Parliament, and reels off numbers like the politicians, who he says have mostly failed to act.No one paid him much attention back in 2008, when, at age 9 and inspired by Kenyan Nobel Peace Prize winner and tree-planter Wangari Maathai, he announced at his primary school assembly that he intended to get children to plant 1 million trees in every country.But his motto, “Stop talking, start planting,” went viral. Competition between schools, “pester power,” and slick social media saw the million-tree target reached within two years.Since then, Plant for the Planet has grown into a well-funded NGO backed by the World Wildlife Fund, the German government and others, and has taken over a U.N. environmental campaign to get the world to plant 1 billion trees. An estimated 15.2 billion trees have been planted since 2006 by individuals, governments and businesses. While adults talk about addressing climate change, Finkbeiner says, young people act. “Children could plant 1 million trees in every country on earth and offset CO2 emissions all on their own, while adults are still talking about doing it,” he says.Some people doubt it is possible to plant so many trees in such a short time. In Mexico last month, talking at a world sustainable development conference, Finkbeiner was challenged by journalists about the practicalities of planting on such a scale, and was questioned whether it would mean giant plantations and a reduction in the amount of land available for growing human food.Some researchers point to the social consequences of planting on such a vast scale, and say the massive, managed plantations of trees needed to hold temperatures below the 2-degree C limit from pre-industrial levels could trigger potentially irreversible changes in the planet. Lena Boysen, now a researcher with the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany, is lead author of a study investigating the potential of trees as carbon sinks. Extensive tree plantations “would require a major fraction of the global land surface with intolerably large environmental and social costs,” Boysen says. “Our results showed that extensive terrestrial carbon dioxide removal measures are unable to counteract business‐as‐usual emissions without eliminating virtually all natural ecosystems and compromising food production and biosphere functioning.”But Finkbeiner is undeterred, and says he is also backed by science. Research shows the world has space for up to 589 billion mature trees without competing with agricultural lands, he says.“We need to plant at least a trillion trees to get 600 billion, since many will not survive,” he says. “Additionally, we must protect the 170 billion trees in imminent risk of destruction.” Most of the planting, says Finkbeiner, should be in the so-called Global South, because trees generally grow faster than in Europe or North America, and are cheaper to plant and maintain.Tom Crowther, a professor at Swiss university ETH, who led the Yale University study that calculated the number of trees on the planet and advises the U.N. environment program, says the trillion-tree target is a good goal. “Given enough support from the thousands of restoration efforts around the world, it is possible to make a massive dent in this goal,” Crowther says. “They must understand which soils to restore, which species to plant, how to manage the ecosystem following restoration, along with many other ecological questions.” Trees are far more than CO2 sinks, says Finkbeiner. “They can provide millions of jobs and other benefits. The use of local timber-intensive materials in construction substitutes CO2-intensive materials like steel and concrete, and the timber industry can create hundreds of millions of additional jobs and wealth in the Global South, thus reducing population growth and migration.”Besides, he says, the initiative’s timing is good. One-quarter of all the emissions reductions pledged by countries in the 2015 Paris agreement will come from tree planting and land restoration. Countries, including the U.S., U.K. and Germany, have promised to plant and restore large areas of degraded forest and other land as a response to the climate crisis.The U.N. has set a target to restore 350 million hectares by 2030 – an area bigger than India. A single province in Pakistan has just planted 1 billion trees. China plans to create forests the size of Ireland. And many Latin American countries have pledged to reforest on a large scale. Meanwhile, Ethiopia, Niger, Mali and other African countries are strongly backing agroforestry and the reforestation of degraded land.Finkbeiner is immensely proud of the 13,500-hectare (33,359-acre) Plant for the Planet ranch in Campeche province, near Cancun, Mexico, which his foundation bought in 2014 and which now employs 78 people. The land had been deforested, and the aim is to plant 10 million trees there by 2020.The climate crisis does not need technological intervention to resolve it because trees are by far the simplest and most efficient way to absorb the world’s emissions, Finkbeiner says. “Why not use them? Sometimes adults are really difficult to understand.”In Mexico last month, he pressed his argument: “We know it is a complex challenge and no, we don’t have all the answers. But in the end, If we follow the scientists and we act and in 20 years find out they were wrong, well we didn’t make any mistakes. But if we follow the skeptics and in 20 years we find out that they were wrong, it will be too late to save our future.”For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.

75,CRIME,Larry Nassar's Longtime MSU Boss Arrested On Sexual Misconduct Charges,Doha Madani and Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/william-strampel-larry-nassar-arrested-sexual-misconduct-charges_us_5ab98f93e4b054d118e615c4,William Strampel is also accused of willfully mishandling the abuse claims against Nassar.,2018-03-27,A snow-covered sign on the campus of Michigan State University shows support for the survivors of Larry Nassar's abuse.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab9c1c11f0000270616b889.jpeg?cache=OAJdBz3pwo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"William Strampel, former dean of Michigan State University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine and longtime boss of convicted child molester Larry Nassar, was arrested Monday in relation to accusations of sexual misconduct during his tenure at the university. Strampel, 70, “used his office to harass, discriminate, demean, sexually proposition, and sexually assault female students,” according to an affidavit filed by the Michigan Attorney General’s Office.He was arrested Monday night and held at the Ingham County Jail, HuffPost confirmed. Michigan District Court Judge Richard Ball of East Lansing authorized a criminal complaint and warrant against Strampel on Tuesday morning detailing four criminal charges, including misconduct of a public official, which is a felony punishable by five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. He was also charged with fourth-degree criminal sexual misconduct and two misdemeanor counts of willful neglect of duty. The two counts of willful neglect of duty relate directly to the way Strampel handled a 2014 Title IX investigation into sexual abuse accusations against Nassar. Strampel allowed Nassar to continue working throughout the investigation, during which time the former doctor abused at least a dozen athletes.Four female MSU medical students are accusing Strampel of sexual misconduct dating back to 2010. The former dean allegedly groped multiple female students, solicited them for nude photos and sexual acts in exchange for favorable treatment, and repeatedly made sexually charged comments. Investigators also found pornographic images and videos on Strampel’s work computer.Michigan State Police Lt. Ryan Pennell said in the affidavit that among the videos on Strampel’s computer was one of Nassar sexually abusing a young female athlete during one of his “treatment sessions.”One of Strampel’s accusers alleges that in 2011 he asked her to come to his office after she fell asleep in his class. During the meeting, he allegedly asked her to turn around in a circle twice “so that he could observe her body” and proceeded to berate her about her appearance, telling her she was “never going to make it in the profession if she did not dress sexier.” The same woman said Strampel repeated his behavior during a 2013 meeting about her surgical residency, during which he advised her to learn her place in life and asked, “What do I have to do to teach you to be submissive and subordinate to men?” Another woman told investigators that Strampel once declared that “it was good when women were drunk, because then it was easy to have sex with them.” She said that Strampel also grabbed her butt during a College of Osteopathic Medicine ball in 2010. One woman told police that she “was not surprised Nassar had been able to victimize so many women under the supervision of Strampel.” Strampel’s lawyer did not immediately answer HuffPost’s request for comment. MSU’s interim president, former Michigan Gov. John Engler, responded to Strampel’s arrest in a statement to HuffPost:One of the first actions I took upon my appointment as interim president of Michigan State University in early February was to pursue revocation of tenure and removal of former Dean William Strampel. As explained then, it was plainly evident he had not acted with the level of professionalism expected of an MSU employee, particularly one holding an office that involves student and patient safety.Attorney Jamie White, who represents several Nassar survivors, told HuffPost that he was not surprised by Strampel’s arrest.“The University has been grossly negligent in its investigation of these matters,” White said, adding, “We will never know how much evidence has been lost, tampered with, and destroyed over the course of the last several years. But, based on the complaint issued against Dr. Strampel, it appears that attempts to conceal and/or delete evidence continued up until very recently.” Strampel supervised Nassar, then MSU’s team doctor, for almost 15 years, during which time Nassar sexually abused hundreds of athletes. He stepped down as dean last year, officially due to medical reasons but under pressure for how he handled complaints about Nassar. Strampel is still an MSU employee and is named as a defendant in several civil lawsuits against MSU.Engler began the process of terminating Strampel’s employment in February, although a spokeswoman for MSU told HuffPost earlier this month that the termination process could take up to a year. Strampel is scheduled to be arraigned at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Special Prosecutor Bill Forsyth, who has been tasked with investigating the university’s role in Nassar’s case, is set to comment on the charges at an afternoon press conference.Olympic gymnast and Nassar survivor Aly Raisman reacted to the news of Strampel’s arrest on Tuesday afternoon.Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Strampel said during a 2016 university meeting that he thought some of the athletes then accusing Nassar of sexual abuse were lying. Nassar abused at least 265 children and young women during his time at MSU and as the USA Gymnastics team doctor. His victims include Olympians Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles. Last year, he was sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. This year he was handed two separate sentences of up to 175 years for sexual abuse.

76,CRIME,Larry Nassar's Longtime MSU Boss Arrested On Sexual Misconduct Charges,Doha Madani and Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/william-strampel-larry-nassar-arrested-sexual-misconduct-charges_us_5ab98f93e4b054d118e615c4,William Strampel is also accused of willfully mishandling the abuse claims against Nassar.,2018-03-27,More than 250 women and girls have said they were abused by Larry Nassar.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba61861e00003b137afe1c.jpeg?ops=crop_0_16_4212_2599%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"William Strampel, former dean of Michigan State University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine and longtime boss of convicted child molester Larry Nassar, was arrested Monday in relation to accusations of sexual misconduct during his tenure at the university. Strampel, 70, “used his office to harass, discriminate, demean, sexually proposition, and sexually assault female students,” according to an affidavit filed by the Michigan Attorney General’s Office.He was arrested Monday night and held at the Ingham County Jail, HuffPost confirmed. Michigan District Court Judge Richard Ball of East Lansing authorized a criminal complaint and warrant against Strampel on Tuesday morning detailing four criminal charges, including misconduct of a public official, which is a felony punishable by five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. He was also charged with fourth-degree criminal sexual misconduct and two misdemeanor counts of willful neglect of duty. The two counts of willful neglect of duty relate directly to the way Strampel handled a 2014 Title IX investigation into sexual abuse accusations against Nassar. Strampel allowed Nassar to continue working throughout the investigation, during which time the former doctor abused at least a dozen athletes.Four female MSU medical students are accusing Strampel of sexual misconduct dating back to 2010. The former dean allegedly groped multiple female students, solicited them for nude photos and sexual acts in exchange for favorable treatment, and repeatedly made sexually charged comments. Investigators also found pornographic images and videos on Strampel’s work computer.Michigan State Police Lt. Ryan Pennell said in the affidavit that among the videos on Strampel’s computer was one of Nassar sexually abusing a young female athlete during one of his “treatment sessions.”One of Strampel’s accusers alleges that in 2011 he asked her to come to his office after she fell asleep in his class. During the meeting, he allegedly asked her to turn around in a circle twice “so that he could observe her body” and proceeded to berate her about her appearance, telling her she was “never going to make it in the profession if she did not dress sexier.” The same woman said Strampel repeated his behavior during a 2013 meeting about her surgical residency, during which he advised her to learn her place in life and asked, “What do I have to do to teach you to be submissive and subordinate to men?” Another woman told investigators that Strampel once declared that “it was good when women were drunk, because then it was easy to have sex with them.” She said that Strampel also grabbed her butt during a College of Osteopathic Medicine ball in 2010. One woman told police that she “was not surprised Nassar had been able to victimize so many women under the supervision of Strampel.” Strampel’s lawyer did not immediately answer HuffPost’s request for comment. MSU’s interim president, former Michigan Gov. John Engler, responded to Strampel’s arrest in a statement to HuffPost:One of the first actions I took upon my appointment as interim president of Michigan State University in early February was to pursue revocation of tenure and removal of former Dean William Strampel. As explained then, it was plainly evident he had not acted with the level of professionalism expected of an MSU employee, particularly one holding an office that involves student and patient safety.Attorney Jamie White, who represents several Nassar survivors, told HuffPost that he was not surprised by Strampel’s arrest.“The University has been grossly negligent in its investigation of these matters,” White said, adding, “We will never know how much evidence has been lost, tampered with, and destroyed over the course of the last several years. But, based on the complaint issued against Dr. Strampel, it appears that attempts to conceal and/or delete evidence continued up until very recently.” Strampel supervised Nassar, then MSU’s team doctor, for almost 15 years, during which time Nassar sexually abused hundreds of athletes. He stepped down as dean last year, officially due to medical reasons but under pressure for how he handled complaints about Nassar. Strampel is still an MSU employee and is named as a defendant in several civil lawsuits against MSU.Engler began the process of terminating Strampel’s employment in February, although a spokeswoman for MSU told HuffPost earlier this month that the termination process could take up to a year. Strampel is scheduled to be arraigned at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Special Prosecutor Bill Forsyth, who has been tasked with investigating the university’s role in Nassar’s case, is set to comment on the charges at an afternoon press conference.Olympic gymnast and Nassar survivor Aly Raisman reacted to the news of Strampel’s arrest on Tuesday afternoon.Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Strampel said during a 2016 university meeting that he thought some of the athletes then accusing Nassar of sexual abuse were lying. Nassar abused at least 265 children and young women during his time at MSU and as the USA Gymnastics team doctor. His victims include Olympians Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles. Last year, he was sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. This year he was handed two separate sentences of up to 175 years for sexual abuse. The Michigan Attorney General’s Office launched an investigation into MSU after news broke that a number of Nassar’s victims had told school authorities about the abuse. The Detroit News reported that 14 school officials, including Strampel, were warned of the doctor’s behavior over the course of two decades. Lou Anna K. Simon, also named in the investigation, resigned as MSU president days after Nassar’s conviction in January. The NCAA and the U.S. Department of Education have launched their own investigations into how MSU handled reports of sexual abuse.This story has been updated with comments from MSU interim President John Engler and Aly Raisman.

77,BLACK VOICES,Louisiana Attorney General Won't Charge Cops In Alton Sterling Killing,David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/louisiana-attorney-general-wont-charge-cops-in-alton-sterling-killing_us_5aba5453e4b054d118e733da,Baton Rouge is bracing for more protests.,2018-03-27,"The Triple S Food Mart where Alton Sterling was fatally shot and killed by Baton Rouge police officerson May 3, 2017, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba55991f00002d0016b99a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Louisiana attorney general said Tuesday he won’t charge two white police officers in the fatal shooting of a black man that sparked heated protests across the country.Attorney General Jeff Landry said at a news conference in Baton Rouge that Alton Sterling, 37, had a loaded gun, fought with officers and continued struggling even after he was shot with a Taser stun gun. “Both officers acted in a reasonable and justified manner in the shooting death of Mr. Sterling,” the prosecutor said, explaining his decision not to bring charges in the 2016 killing outside a convenience store, where police had been summoned to investigate a report of a man with a gun. He said one of the officers fired six shots, hitting Sterling in the chest and back. Landry’s office took over the probe 11 months ago, when the Justice Department, citing a lack of evidence, decided not to pursue federal civil rights charges against the officers.Baton Rouge officials were bracing for potential protests, according to The Advocate. The attorney general told his office staff not to report to work on Tuesday, and state police activated a mobile force.“We all out of tears,” Quinyetta McMillon, mother of Sterling’s oldest son, said at a news conference that followed the prosecutor’s announcement. “We have nothing else to cry about.” Sterling’s aunt, Sandra Sterling, called the killing murder, and said Landry should be ashamed.“You put a killer back on the streets,” she said of the attorney general. She added: “I’m going to get justice from a higher power.”The family will continue to pursue a civil rights lawsuit against the city, said lawyer L. Chris Stewart. “This wasn’t justice,” he added. Landry acknowledged Sterling’s family likely will disagree with his decision.“I’m asking that everyone consider the family in the coming days,” he said. “I pray that God blesses and keeps the Sterling family during this difficult time.” Sterling, a father of five, was fatally shot July 5, 2016, outside a Baton Rouge store where he frequently sold CDs. Officer Howie Lake II wrestled Sterling to the ground, and Officer Blane Salamoni shot him multiple times at close range in the back and chest.It’s unclear from cellphone videos whether Sterling was a threat. Store owner Abdul Muflahi told HuffPost in July 2016 that he witnessed the shooting, but didn’t see Sterling with a gun. He said he did see officers remove a handgun from Sterling’s pocket. Landry said Tuesday the gun was loaded, and said the officers repeatedly tried to control Sterling without using deadly force.Salamoni, a four-year veteran, and Lake, a three-year veteran, have been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. With the federal and state investigations concluded, police Chief Murphy Paul can decide whether to discipline or fire the officers.Paul said at an afternoon news conference that a disciplinary panel will hold a hearing this week, and will allow the two officers and their attorneys an opportunity to speak. The chief said he planned to release evidence gathered during the shooting investigation, including videos and police recordings, after the hearing concludes.Cellphone videos of events surrounding the killing went viral on social media and sparked heated protests in Baton Rouge and elsewhere. The Baton Rouge protests led to nearly 200 arrests.Demonstrators criticized Baton Rouge police for displays of military-style equipment and use of ear-splitting sirens. Officers also were accused of haphazardly pointing assault rifles at protesters and journalists.Less than two weeks after Sterling was killed, Gavin Long, a former Marine from Missouri, opened fire in Baton Rouge, killing city police officers Montrell Jackson, 32, Matthew Gerald, 41, and East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Deputy Brad Garafola, 45. Long wounded three other officers before he was fatally shot.The protests eventually ceased, and national media attention began to drift away in August 2016, when torrential rain in southeastern Louisiana caused massive flooding that claimed more than a dozen lives.The co-founder of the group Black Lives Matter, which has been calling attention to police violence since 2014, when police outside St. Louis shot an unarmed black teenager to death, said she was “saddened and sickened” that officers still aren’t held to account for fatal shootings.“Black people continue to be betrayed by this country. A country that claims liberty and freedom for all. Yet continues to allow for the murders of black people with impunity,” Patrisse Khan-Cullors said in a statement.The ACLU deplored the attorney general’s decision as “yet another example of police brutality against people of color and our country’s systemic failure to hold law enforcement accountable for that brutality.”“Justice will not be served until we end this epidemic of police violence against people of color once and for all,” Jane Johnson, interim executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana, said in a statement calling on the police chief to fire the two officers, release video evidence and respect the rights of demonstrators to peacefully protest.Read the Louisiana attorney general’s report on the shooting investigation below.Read Attorney General Jeff Landry’s statement on his decision not to charge police officers in Sterling’s killing below.This article has been updated to include comments from the police chief, Black Lives Matter co-founder, and ACLU of Louisiana interim head.Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.

78,ENTERTAINMENT,"The 'Roseanne' Revival Catches Up To Our Thorny Political Mood, For Better And Worse",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roseanne-revival-review_us_5ab3a497e4b054d118e04365,"What begins with an unrefined, heavy-handed tone eases into a show that again tackles American affairs with humor and candor.",2018-03-27,"Roseanne Barr, Sara Gilbert and John Goodman on ""Roseanne.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab4307d2000003800eb2b90.jpeg?cache=z4MZD54dI0&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The “Roseanne” that existed two decades ago didn’t have to remind us that it was topical. From 1988 to 1997, the show built its foundation on the everyday plight of a working-class family struggling to stay afloat in small-town America. The verisimilitude was often searing, and always rollicking. Even in the titular matriarch’s loudest moments, no one preached about current events in such a way that politics superseded the actual situations greeting characters in this situational comedy.But today’s rendition, returning to ABC on Tuesday, is jonesing to announce its topicality, figurative megaphone in hand, almost as quickly as the opening credits roll. Face-to-face with the Donald Trump era, the inaugural episode’s politics are thundering, confrontational and ham-fisted. Early on, a svelte Dan (John Goodman) returns from the pharmacy to report that the Conners’ health insurance no longer funds all the medicine they need ― their “candy,” as Roseanne (Roseanne Barr) calls it. Dan and Roseanne are left to divide what’s left of their statins, anti-inflammatories and pain pills as if playing a game to see who lands the bigger stash. After the next commercial break, Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) arrives at the Conners’ comfortingly cluttered home wearing a pink “Nasty Woman” shirt and pussy hat, estranged from her sister because Roseanne pulled the lever in Trump’s favor.“How could you have voted for him?” Jackie demands before we’ve even been reintroduced to the whole clan. Their argument turns to talk of “snowflakes” and “making America great again” ― the same polarization that plays out ad nauseam on social media and during cable-news cage fights.That transition, from medical woes to tired retorts about an election we’ve spent a year and a half mourning, epitomizes the shift in woke sitcom writing that has occurred in the years since “Roseanne” first signed off. The original program was founded upon situational concepts that couched real-world issues in primetime banter, while the reboot opens with a showboating scheme that borrows low-hanging ideological fruit to paint a heavy-handed divide across party lines. Despite her feminism, it makes some sense that Roseanne Conner would have voted for Trump. Discounting the messy final season that aired in 1996 and ‘97, in which the Conners won the lottery and imploded the series’ spirit, the eight years Roseanne spent assembly-lining at a plastics factory, sweeping a beauty-parlor floor, telemarketing, working a fast-food joint and eventually co-owning a small luncheonette, all the while fretting about bills and taxes and college funds, make her a fitting figurehead for toiling middle-class parents who felt ostracized by the proverbial establishment and lashed out in the 2016 election. Trump “talked about jobs,” she insists. Alas, watching Roseanne and Jackie bark clichés at each other in 2018 is already stale, as if the writing team ― spearheaded by Bruce Helford (who also oversaw one previous season) and Whitney Cummings ― took too many notes from the virtue signaling that attracts retweets and viral headlines. “Roseanne” was already the most political sitcom in history; must it be so literal and loudmouthed about it now?But, as a longtime disciple who thinks the Conners’ living room is among popular culture’s greatest hallmarks, I’m pleased to report that this bug is not a feature of the entire season ― at least it isn’t so glaring in the third and seventh episodes, which, oddly enough, were the only other installments ABC provided to press ahead of the premiere. In fact, once we get past the unrefined, rhythm-less debut, what I’ve seen of the show is downright wonderful. We can exhale. “Roseanne” is indeed back. It must be hard, anyway, to revive characters left dormant for 20 years, especially for someone as erratic as Barr, who hasn’t maintained much of an acting career beyond guest spots on “The Office,” “Portlandia” and the short-lived “Cristela.” But by Episode 3, she’s restored her brassy groove. Everything about Roseanne’s repartee with Jackie, along with her hard-edged but ultimately loving parenting tactics, feel plucked right out of the “Roseanne” we once knew, with one golden difference: Where her own mother (Estelle Parsons) was once the out-of-touch try-hard, it’s now Roseanne who has to play catchup with the world her children (and grandchildren) occupy. As such, the banter between them is laugh-tracked and whip-smart, the punchlines are pithy and purposeful, and the politics aren’t reduced to ersatz sermonizing. “Roseanne” does a splendid job recontextualizing its characters. A divorced and jobless Darlene (Sara Gilbert, who orchestrated this reunion) moves back in with Roseanne and Dan, bringing along her teenage daughter (Emma Kenney) and gender-probing 11-year-old (Ames McNamara), who identifies as a boy but prefers to wear skirts and nail polish. These are the sort of politics at which “Roseanne” excels: Through the lens of their underemployed daughter and nonconforming grandchild, Dan and “Granny Rose” are forced to examine their own prejudices. They want to protect their beloved from schoolyard bullying but encourage his self-acceptance, opening up a conversation about identity that need not to underscore its message with platitudes or homilies. The rest of Episodes 3 and 7 operate with the same delicate blend of comedy and domestic drama. Jackie spouts the canned advice she now doles out as a life coach ― Metcalf again nails Jackie’s mania with supercharged precision ― while a waitressing 43-year-old Becky (Lecy Goranson) sparks when a woman (Sarah Chalke, the other Becky) offers her $50,000 to serve as a surrogate mother. And tender D.J. (Michael Fishman) has just returned from military duty in Syria, caring for his young mixed-race daughter Mary (Jayden Rey) while his wife serves overseas. Meanwhile, Roseanne can’t afford surgery to fix a bad knee, so she’s hogging those analgesics her insurance will hardly pay for. When she and Dan attempt to cash in on rewards points for their anniversary by spending a night at a hotel, the credit card they’re required to log upon check-in is declined, thwarting their respite and shoving them back out into the jungle. (“I just want to go home, and if you saw where we live, you would know what an insult that is,” Roseanne quips.)There’s even a peanut-allergy subplot thrown in, proving just how down and dirty this reboot is willing to get.Through it all, the writing is faithful to the Conners we knew in the pre-internet age, letting the show be woke without proclaiming itself as such. Maybe that’s the hurdle in expunging a series’ plot points, as “Roseanne” did with Dan’s death and “Will & Grace” did with the title pair’s parenthood: There’s so much exposition to establish and history to redraft that preaching about the corrupt election we can’t stop stressing about simply adds another layer of bulk. Why are our characters debating Trump’s candidacy now? Well, because that’s when their TV show is airing ― a poor excuse that convinces some sitcom writers they have a duty to address the national mood head-on.Roseanne and Jackie’s feud probably sounds familiar to many American families, sure, but let’s see them experience the world, not just argue about it like a half-baked Facebook debate. That dynamic may have worked for Archie Bunker on “All in the Family,” but, 40 years later, we need characters who will do more than regurgitate media buzzwords.By most accounts, it looks like “Roseanne” will, eventually, return to its nuanced roots, crocheted afghan and all. And if it’s able to depict a Trump supporter who has more to offer than verbal trolling, well, it might just make us stronger. "
79,QUEER VOICES,Aaron Carter Says News About Being Bisexual Was 'A Little Misconstrued',Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aaron-carter-sexuality-misconstrued_us_5aba53aae4b0decad04e4e05,"""I see myself being with a woman,"" the pop star said.",2018-03-27,"""I want to have a family,” Aaron Carter said. “I keep telling people that."" ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba543c1f0000260616b995.jpeg?cache=E8aA3YJRbm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Aaron Carter appeared to backpedal on remarks he made about his sexuality last summer, saying reports he’d come out as bisexual were “misconstrued.” In a Hollywood Life podcast interview last week, the pop singer was asked about an emotional note he posted to Twitter last August. In the tweet, which has since been deleted, he said he’d “started to find boys and girls attractive” as a teen, and had “an experience with a male” whom he “worked with and grew up with.”Carter, however, set the record straight March 23, and told Hollywood Life’s Bonnie Fuller he doesn’t see himself in a relationship with another man anytime soon. “It was more so just a story that happened when I was, like, 17 with somebody,” he said on the podcast. (Carter’s comments on sexuality start at about 19 and a half minutes into the interview.) “I can find men and women attractive, but when it comes down to it, I think it was a little misconstrued. I see myself being with a woman and having kids.”“I want to have a family,” he added. “I keep telling people that. I don’t want it to be misconstrued too much.” It’s a head-scratching clarification from Carter, who is currently on tour in support of his new album, “LØVË.” The singer has spoken about his sexuality in numerous interviews since the original tweet, but made no effort to shrug off the “bisexual” label. Just days after his original tweet, he told morning radio show “The Bert Show,” “All I can say is that I’m really looking forward to the future right now, and whether I choose to be with a woman or a man is my decision ― no one else’s. It was something that I just felt like was important and I needed to say.”At the time, he hinted that his relationship with girlfriend Madison Parker ended because of his admission. Carter told TMZ, “If someone loves you enough, they’ll never leave you. They’ll never leave you over you saying that ‘I want to be honest’ about whether it’s about me being bisexual, bicurious, being gay, or anything.” (Parker denied Carter’s claims.)Later in the TMZ interview, however, Carter said he was “going to be pursuing relationships with women.”"

But fellow Democrats say she ""softened the ground"" for Franken's resignation.",2018-03-27,Lindsey Port had to drop her bid for the Minnesota state House after Democratic donors began blaming her for Al Franken's resignation from the U.S. Senate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab92c3a1e0000fb077afc85.jpeg?cache=BsdKSSQtl8&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Lindsey Port, 35, doesn’t really know Al Franken. She met the Minnesota Democrat in passing at political events, but that’s about it. And she never even called on him to resign from the Senate after a number of other women accused him of sexual harassment.But for some reason, she’s being blamed for his downfall.Port has spoken out about sexual harassment. In November, as a Democratic candidate for the Minnesota state House, she and state Rep. Erin Maye Quade (D) accused state Sen. Dan Schoen (D) of harassing them. Schoen eventually stepped down, and Port became one of the most visible faces of the Me Too movement in Minnesota.She initially received a flood of goodwill for speaking out. But the reaction changed when the Franken allegations surfaced.Port’s willingness to call attention to sexual harassment went from being applauded to being questioned. Members of her own party said she had “softened the ground” for Franken’s resignation in early January, and some people even wondered if she was secretly a conservative operative who had planned to take down the popular senator all along.On social media, Port saw comments that questioned her identity, motives and truthfulness.This Facebook commenter above was right that it wasn’t just a “coincidence” that the Schoen and Franken scandals happened so close together ― but it’s not because there was a large GOP conspiracy to bring them down. The country was in the middle of the Me Too moment, when powerful men like Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer were facing a reckoning for their years of abuse, and more women were feeling emboldened to speak up.That the backlash came from within her own community is particularly disheartening for Port.“I honestly think the most frustrating part of it has been not only Democrats ― this is our team, these are the people who are supposed to be with us ― but it has been primarily women. There’s definitely a generational divide, 100 percent. But it has primarily been women pushing this,” she said of the criticism she’s faced.Speaking out has cost Port financially. About a week after Franken’s resignation, she dropped her state legislative bid because donors began pulling their contributions, and she felt she couldn’t focus on the district and its priorities.Port also co-operates a nonprofit, Blueprint Campaigns, that helps progressive individuals from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds run for office. The nonprofit also lost donations.“We had $70,000 pulled the week that Al Franken said he was going to resign,” Port said. “In that same window, I also lost $6,000 from my own campaign.”One person asked that her contribution to the campaign be returned. The rest of the unhappy donors, to both the campaign and the nonprofit, pulled their pledges. One donor told Port that she was “too controversial” to support at that time, as MinnPost reported. Port had never had any contributions taken back before.Meredith Stacey, Port’s partner at Blueprint, said she also noticed that after the allegations against Franken broke, people weren’t reaching out or returning their phone calls quite as frequently. “Democratic donor doors are very shut to me right now,” Port said. As evidence, she noted that Ken Martin, the chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (the state’s version of the Democratic Party), unfriended her on Facebook ― an accusation that he denies. “God’s honest truth, I’ve never unfriended anyone,” Martin said. “So to be honest with you, I don’t even know how to do it.”“I guess what I am concerned by is any kind of insinuation that me personally or the state party hasn’t stood by Lindsey. We’ve been very supportive of her in these efforts. We believe her,” he added. “We think that at the end of the day, if there’s any retaliation going on ― as I mentioned to her the other day ― I want to know about it. Because I will call those donors myself.”Port said she hasn’t been able to get Martin on the phone to tell him about the problems she’s had and the donations that were pulled. She also said she’s asked him to raise money to replace the sums that Blueprint Campaigns lost, and he hasn’t followed up. Martin said that he hadn’t heard from Port about any request to help her raise money and that he has tried to be as helpful as possible in supporting her.Feelings about the Franken scandal are still raw in Minnesota. The issue remains so divisive that a number of state Democrats were only willing to give their opinion about the situation off the record. The former senator’s Facebook page is filled with people saying how much they miss him:“I am still incredibly bitter that you were forced to resign. You were/are one of the good guys.”State Rep. Erin Maye Quade has also heard the insinuations that she and Port were part of some grand conspiracy to oust Franken or that they’d put party members in a difficult position because after denouncing Schoen, Democrats then were forced to weigh in on Franken.“I’m the one who gets harassed, and all of a sudden I face all the consequences,” Maye Quade said. “No matter who it is, it’s always about the fall of men and never about the women who were just trying to work and do their job and have to endure this over and over and over.” “I was more surprised about how much my story was never really about me after that,” the lawmaker added. “It was always about the men and their downfall.” Port and Maye Quade aren’t the only women who have faced the ire of Franken supporters. At least one major Democratic donor has said she’ll reconsider her support for senators who called for Franken to quit ― including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who was one of his toughest critics. (Recall that Port never actually urged Franken to resign.)MinnPost first reported on Port’s decision to drop her state legislative bid because of the backlash she received after the Franken scandal. The story received surprisingly little pickup, especially compared to the attention her initial allegations against Schoen garnered.But one person who did notice was Laura Flynn, a member of the advisory board for the Movement Voter Project, which raises funds for nonpartisan and progressive groups around the country that are mobilizing and doing voter engagement work. In February, Flynn mobilized other MVP donors and so far, they’ve raised $26,000 for Blueprint.“Yes, this is a story about an individual woman facing backlash because of what she did, because of speaking out. ... But secondly, it’s a real question for the Democratic Party,” Flynn said. “If you’re going to turn on the most forward-thinking young people who can actually go out there and run grassroots campaigns and win elections ― it’s very clear here in Minnesota, we’re not going to be able to win the statehouse if we’re going to silence or quash those voices.”Another person who has supported Port has been state Rep. Ilhan Omar (D), who made history in 2016 when she became the first Somali-American legislator in the country.“I think that for women, we’ve always known what is at stake,” Omar said. “It’s really important for people to realize that once you take that step, yes, there are people who are going to be against you, but there are going to be people ― if not as much, but more ― who will stand by you, who will uplift you, who will celebrate you for living your truth, for being brave and for continuing to widen the door for other women to step through.”"

About a week after Franken’s resignation, she dropped her state legislative bid because donors began pulling their contributions, and she felt she couldn’t focus on the district and its priorities.Port also co-operates a nonprofit, Blueprint Campaigns, that helps progressive individuals from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds run for office. The nonprofit also lost donations.“We had $70,000 pulled the week that Al Franken said he was going to resign,” Port said. “In that same window, I also lost $6,000 from my own campaign.”One person asked that her contribution to the campaign be returned. The rest of the unhappy donors, to both the campaign and the nonprofit, pulled their pledges. One donor told Port that she was “too controversial” to support at that time, as MinnPost reported. Port had never had any contributions taken back before.Meredith Stacey, Port’s partner at Blueprint, said she also noticed that after the allegations against Franken broke, people weren’t reaching out or returning their phone calls quite as frequently. “Democratic donor doors are very shut to me right now,” Port said. As evidence, she noted that Ken Martin, the chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (the state’s version of the Democratic Party), unfriended her on Facebook ― an accusation that he denies. “God’s honest truth, I’ve never unfriended anyone,” Martin said. “So to be honest with you, I don’t even know how to do it.”“I guess what I am concerned by is any kind of insinuation that me personally or the state party hasn’t stood by Lindsey. We’ve been very supportive of her in these efforts. We believe her,” he added. “We think that at the end of the day, if there’s any retaliation going on ― as I mentioned to her the other day ― I want to know about it. Because I will call those donors myself.”Port said she hasn’t been able to get Martin on the phone to tell him about the problems she’s had and the donations that were pulled. She also said she’s asked him to raise money to replace the sums that Blueprint Campaigns lost, and he hasn’t followed up. Martin said that he hadn’t heard from Port about any request to help her raise money and that he has tried to be as helpful as possible in supporting her.Feelings about the Franken scandal are still raw in Minnesota. The issue remains so divisive that a number of state Democrats were only willing to give their opinion about the situation off the record. The former senator’s Facebook page is filled with people saying how much they miss him:“I am still incredibly bitter that you were forced to resign. You were/are one of the good guys.”State Rep. Erin Maye Quade has also heard the insinuations that she and Port were part of some grand conspiracy to oust Franken or that they’d put party members in a difficult position because after denouncing Schoen, Democrats then were forced to weigh in on Franken.“I’m the one who gets harassed, and all of a sudden I face all the consequences,” Maye Quade said. “No matter who it is, it’s always about the fall of men and never about the women who were just trying to work and do their job and have to endure this over and over and over.” “I was more surprised about how much my story was never really about me after that,” the lawmaker added. “It was always about the men and their downfall.” Port and Maye Quade aren’t the only women who have faced the ire of Franken supporters. At least one major Democratic donor has said she’ll reconsider her support for senators who called for Franken to quit ― including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who was one of his toughest critics. (Recall that Port never actually urged Franken to resign.)MinnPost first reported on Port’s decision to drop her state legislative bid because of the backlash she received after the Franken scandal. The story received surprisingly little pickup, especially compared to the attention her initial allegations against Schoen garnered.But one person who did notice was Laura Flynn, a member of the advisory board for the Movement Voter Project, which raises funds for nonpartisan and progressive groups around the country that are mobilizing and doing voter engagement work. In February, Flynn mobilized other MVP donors and so far, they’ve raised $26,000 for Blueprint.“Yes, this is a story about an individual woman facing backlash because of what she did, because of speaking out. ... But secondly, it’s a real question for the Democratic Party,” Flynn said. “If you’re going to turn on the most forward-thinking young people who can actually go out there and run grassroots campaigns and win elections ― it’s very clear here in Minnesota, we’re not going to be able to win the statehouse if we’re going to silence or quash those voices.”Another person who has supported Port has been state Rep. Ilhan Omar (D), who made history in 2016 when she became the first Somali-American legislator in the country.“I think that for women, we’ve always known what is at stake,” Omar said. “It’s really important for people to realize that once you take that step, yes, there are people who are going to be against you, but there are going to be people ― if not as much, but more ― who will stand by you, who will uplift you, who will celebrate you for living your truth, for being brave and for continuing to widen the door for other women to step through.”"

She met the Minnesota Democrat in passing at political events, but that’s about it. And she never even called on him to resign from the Senate after a number of other women accused him of sexual harassment.But for some reason, she’s being blamed for his downfall.Port has spoken out about sexual harassment. In November, as a Democratic candidate for the Minnesota state House, she and state Rep. Erin Maye Quade (D) accused state Sen. Dan Schoen (D) of harassing them. Schoen eventually stepped down, and Port became one of the most visible faces of the Me Too movement in Minnesota.She initially received a flood of goodwill for speaking out. But the reaction changed when the Franken allegations surfaced.Port’s willingness to call attention to sexual harassment went from being applauded to being questioned. Members of her own party said she had “softened the ground” for Franken’s resignation in early January, and some people even wondered if she was secretly a conservative operative who had planned to take down the popular senator all along.On social media, Port saw comments that questioned her identity, motives and truthfulness.This Facebook commenter above was right that it wasn’t just a “coincidence” that the Schoen and Franken scandals happened so close together ― but it’s not because there was a large GOP conspiracy to bring them down. The country was in the middle of the Me Too moment, when powerful men like Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer were facing a reckoning for their years of abuse, and more women were feeling emboldened to speak up.That the backlash came from within her own community is particularly disheartening for Port.“I honestly think the most frustrating part of it has been not only Democrats ― this is our team, these are the people who are supposed to be with us ― but it has been primarily women.

The network and Schneider, who’ve worked together since the late ’80s, mutually agreed not to extend a production deal with his company, Schneider’s Bakery.“Following many conversations together about next directions and future opportunities, Nickelodeon and our long-time creative partner Dan Schneider/Schneider’s Bakery have agreed to not extend the current deal,” Nickelodeon and Schneider said in a joint statement to HuffPost. “Since several Schneider’s Bakery projects are wrapping up, both sides agreed that this is a natural time for Nickelodeon and Schneider’s Bakery to pursue other opportunities and projects.”Neither Nickelodeon nor Schneider gave a reason for the split. Deadline reports the decision was years in the making due to “multiple complaints of abusive behavior” by members of Schneider’s staff, and “well documented temper issues.”The report says Schneider worked “under a cloud of suspicion” because of relationships with young stars on his shows, and notes he shared photos of actresses’ toes on social media. Over the past 20 years, Schneider has been behind some of the network’s most successful shows, launching the careers of breakout stars like Arianna Grande, Jamie Lynn Spears, Amanda Bynes and Victoria Justice.“Dan and his Schneider’s Bakery team have created a string of lasting, groundbreaking hits over the years including ‘iCarly,’ ‘Drake & Josh,’ ’Victorious, ‘Kenan & Kel’ and the current number-one hit show on Nickelodeon, ‘Henry Danger,’ the Nickelodeon-Schneider statement continued. “We thank Dan and his Schneider’s Bakery producers, executives and social media team for their immeasurable contributions to Nickelodeon, and we wish them the best in their future endeavors. And Dan and Schneider’s Bakery are proud of the work they did together with Nickelodeon and will always remain big fans of the network.”Schneider’s series “Game Shakers” also reportedly has been canceled. “Henry Danger,” his only remaining franchise on Nickelodeon, is expected to continue for a fifth season. Schneider is the latest showrunner to part ways with Nickelodeon following abuse accusations. Chris Savino, creator of the hit animated series “The Loud House,” was fired after multiple sexual harassment allegations. "

The campaign ― dubbed “Project Ripon” ― continued even after an attorney warned the firm to obey U.S. election laws, which mandate foreigners cannot “directly or indirectly participate in the decision-making process” in a political campaign.Despite the warning, at least 20 non-Americans were sent to advise congressional and legislative campaigns in 2014, and helped to decide who to target with political messages, the Post reported. Such voters were dubbed “hidden Republicans.”Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and worked at the firm until 2014, sparked a firestorm earlier this month when he revealed that the company had misused the private information of more than 50 million Facebook users. He told the Post that the use of foreigners on the ground often led to legal discussions about U.S. election laws between Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix and then-vice president Steve Bannon.“Its dirty little secret was that there was no one American involved in it, that it was a de facto foreign agent, working on an American election,” Wylie told the Post.Earlier this week he told NBC News that “it was not just me.”“Like 20 other people were. We had Canadians, British, Eastern Europeans, Lithuanians, Germans, Romanians, Greeks,” Wylie said. “We weren’t just working on messaging. We were instructing campaigns on which messages go where and to who.”The use of foreign nationals in U.S. elections was first detailed in a memo Wylie supplied to media outlets earlier this month. In the document, a lawyer for the data firm warned Nix that he would need to refrain from “substantive management” due to his citizenship and that Cambridge Analytica would need to find U.S. citizens or green card holders to make any larger decisions.Two other employees at the firm, speaking anonymously, told the Post that they worried about violating U.S. law and echoed that such concerns were regularly discussed in 2014.“We knew that everything was not above board, but we weren’t too concerned about it,” one of the employees said. “It was the Wild West. That’s certainly how they carried on in 2014.”Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and the acting chief executive has said the company “in no way resemble[s] the politically-motivated and unethical company that some have sought to portray.”"

Eleven states now provide a legal remedy for relatives who have been barred from visiting their ailing family members.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab9075b1e000056107afc21.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Michael OlloveToby Davidow was always tight with her mother, Elaine, a part-time nursery school teacher who was “a very kind, nurturing mother and was very optimistic,” according to her daughter. Elaine and Dennis, Toby’s father, were single-minded in their devotion to their only child.All of which makes the story of their relationship during the last years of Elaine Davidow’s life so surprising.Toby Davidow, a program coordinator in the student affairs office at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., lays the blame on her parents’ live-in caregiver, 58-year-old Ann Fry. With Toby’s father’s cooperation, Fry barred Toby and the rest of her family, including Elaine’s only surviving sister, from seeing or speaking to her for the last three years of her life, from late 2014 until her death in October, at age 72.Toby Davidow said she didn’t even know that for the last three months of her life, her mother, who had multiple sclerosis and dementia, was in hospice care, first in her Cherry Hill, New Jersey, home and then in a nearby facility.Nobody bothered to tell her or other relatives that her mother had died until a week later. By then, Elaine Davidow had been cremated, against the wishes she had expressed before her cognition began failing, according to her daughter.The events over the past years have devastated Davidow.“Especially in the later years, Mom and Dad would travel down to my home in Virginia every 6 to 8 weeks from New Jersey, so that Mom and I could go to the spa together,” she recalled in an email. “We’d both get manicures and pedicures done together, giggle over magazines, and share stories. Mom really loved those visits, so much so that I even got a two-bedroom apartment so that my parents had a place to stay when they visited.”Experiences like Davidow’s have prompted at least 11 states to enact laws that would provide a legal remedy, besides seeking guardianship, which can be costly and complicated, for relatives who have been prevented from seeing infirm or disabled family members.Under the laws, relatives can seek a court order permitting visitation and communication. The order must be granted, unless the ailing relative is found to be mentally competent and objects to contact.Celebrity Children TestifyThe Maryland House this month passed a visitation bill unanimously, sending it to the Senate. The vote came a few weeks after the children of a trio of celebrities appeared before a House committee to recount experiences similar to Davidow’s.They were led by a daughter of the late disc jockey Casey Kasem. Through public appearances and her foundation, Kasem Cares, Kerri Kasem has spearheaded largely successful efforts to enact visitation laws throughout the country. Her father, creator and host of radio’s “American Top 40,” a countdown of popular hits, died in 2014 at 82, kicking off a round of wrongful death claims and counterclaims between his widow and his children. Before his death, there had been highly publicized legal squabbles about his guardianship.Joining Kasem in Annapolis were Travis Campbell, son of the country music legend Glen Campbell, who died at age 81 last summer of complications from Alzheimer’s disease, and Kelly Rooney, the eldest of Mickey Rooney’s eight children. Rooney, the movie star whose career spanned nine decades, died at age 93 in 2014.Davidow joined them to testify about efforts by stepparents or caregivers to keep them from seeing or communicating with ailing parents or siblings with disabilities.“He was in a guardianship for the last 18 months, and we never saw him again,” Kelly Rooney said in an interview. At age 90, Mickey Rooney appeared before a U.S. Senate committee and claimed he had been a victim of physical, emotional and financial abuse at the hands of his eighth and last wife and her adult children. His conservator, another term for “guardian,” continued to keep her father from his biological children until his death, Kelly Rooney said.Travis Campbell also was denied visits with his father. He only found out through media reports that his father, who lived in California, had been transferred to an Alzheimer’s facility in Tennessee. Once he found out, he said, his stepmother still severely curtailed his ability to spend time with his father, whose most famous songs included “By the Time I Get to Phoenix” and “Wichita Lineman.”“If there had been a law in effect,” Campbell said, “I would have had the most precious gift of all — time with my father.”In Maryland, the visitation bill has not attracted a great deal of opposition. But Ria Rochvarg, a Maryland attorney who practices guardianship law, testified against it.“I’m not against the idea, but it doesn’t do what supporters say it does,” she said in an interview. The legislation, Rochvarg said, would require another, possibly expensive judicial process involving lawyers.“I want people to get visitation without a lengthy process and without lawyers,” she said. “This bill doesn’t do that.”IsolationCatherine Seal, the immediate past president of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys, said the underlying concern in such cases is that somebody is exerting “undue influence on the senior.”“One of the classic hallmarks of undue influence is to isolate the person in question by limiting both in-person and phone contact,” said Seal, who practices in Colorado Springs, Colorado. “They convince the person that all these outside people, even family members, are a threat.”Seal is sympathetic to the intentions behind the new visitation laws, but she prefers her organization’s model guardianship legislation, which would prevent guardians from restricting access to family members the ward wishes to see or communicate with. Critics point out, however, that Seal’s approach doesn’t address the many situations where there is no appointed guardian, or cases in which the caregiver is manipulating the ward into thinking poorly of family members. No state has yet enacted NAELA’s model legislation.The Maryland bill, like laws that have passed elsewhere, contains provisions beyond visitation. It also would require guardians or caregivers to quickly notify family members when their wards have been hospitalized or when they have died.Not all of those hoping for passage of the Maryland bill have elderly parents in mind.Kim Ruszala of New Market, who also testified at the Capitol in Annapolis, has been fighting with her stepmother to gain unfettered access to her 44-year-old brother, Chris Asher, the youngest of her three siblings, who is developmentally delayed. From December 2015 to February 2017, a period after the death of their father, Ruszala said, she wasn’t allowed to see Asher except for a single brief visit at a McDonald’s. The guardianship agreement now permits Ruszala to visit with Asher twice a month.“I just wanted to see my brother on a regular basis,” Ruszala said in her testimony.On a recent Friday afternoon, Chris’ stepmother, Constance Asher, brought him to see Ruszala at a Cheesecake Factory in Columbia, Maryland, so the siblings could spend the weekend together. Chris joked happily with Ruszala and her boyfriend, Glenn Weigle, reminiscing about their times together, going camping, thrilling to amusement park rides, and that day he had his face painted for a Baltimore Ravens game.“The biggest frustration for me,” Ruszala said, is “there’s no avenue to get into the court system to ask for visitation for someone who has a guardian.”In November, Constance Asher alleged in a court filing that Ruszala’s visits with Asher were “damaging Christopher’s social and emotional well-being.” Asher told the court that Ruszala gave her brother alcohol and cigarettes.Ruszala told Stateline she allowed Chris to have an occasional beer, as did his father, and that her brother had once stolen a pack of cigarettes from her and smoked one. At the Cheesecake Factory, Chris backed up his sister’s story.Asher did not respond to several phone and email requests for comment.If a visitation law had been in place in New Jersey, Davidow might have been able to spend time with her mother. Until the caregiver appeared around 2010, Davidow said, she was also close to her father, a school administrator in New Jersey for 30 years. “We were friends my entire life,” she said.But he became a man she didn’t recognize, hostile to a daughter he had once showered with affection. He wouldn’t let Davidow in the house and hung up on her when she called. Toby hasn’t seen her father in four years and has spoken to him for about 15 minutes in that time, she said.She also said that her father and Fry refused to open the door when she came several times to her parents’ home. And she was unable to get her mother on the phone.In 2013, Fry’s name was added to the deed of a property Dennis and Elaine Davidow owned in Atlantic City. Her father also gave Fry his power of attorney and made her his health proxy.Davidow said Fry sold her mother’s jewelry, purses and other possessions on eBay.She said the reason Fry gave for shutting off contact was that she was “mentally unstable and a big stressor to my mom and dad.” Davidow said she has never been diagnosed with a mental illness.Fry is now Davidow’s stepmother, having married her 75-year-old father in New Jersey in January. Fry did not respond to several email requests for comment, and Dennis Davidow did not respond to several phone messages.Toby says her father’s behavior is so at odds with their previously warm relationship that she believes he is mentally unfit. But earlier this month, when Davidow attempted to gain guardianship over him, a doctor determined that he was capable of making his own decisions. Davidow fears she has reached a dead end.“It has been so crushing to come to the realization that I may never see my father again,” she said.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said the Maryland House voted 137-1 to pass the visitation bill. The vote against was switched, making it a unanimous vote in favor.Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "
