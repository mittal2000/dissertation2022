She also knows the significance of having kids see themselves in movies, on TV, and in certain careers.“It means making sure that people get those images that show they have those things available to them,” Jemison told HuffPost. Jemison is collaborating on “Science Matters,” an initiative to encourage kids of all ages and backgrounds to pursue agricultural science from pharmaceutical and life science company Bayer and youth development organization National 4-H Council. Jemison, a physician and chemical engineer, knows the field of agricultural science can sound intimidating, but she and Jennifer Sirangelo, CEO and president of the National 4-H Council, have set out to change that. Digging into agricultural science can be as simple as asking, “Where does my food come from?” An increasingly popular way to kick-start this sort of interest is through urban gardens, Jemison explained.“There’s nothing more exciting to see something growing ― and you can eat it!” Jemison said. “That’s something parents can do with their kids as well.”Sirangelo agreed, noting that agricultural science is more than horticulture and animal science and has huge applications for our future.“The need to produce more food with fewer resources over the coming decades is going to push our science even further,” she told HuffPost. As Jemison put it, we need to prepare our kids “to not just survive, but thrive.”Bringing more children into STEM topics like agricultural science isn’t enough, though. Diversity is imperative, especially for women and people of color, groups underrepresented in these fields, Jemison said.“We’re losing talent and we’re losing capability by not including them,” she told HuffPost. “When people think about why it is important to have a diversity of talent in a field, they think of it as a nicety. No, it’s a necessity. We get better solutions.”“It’s not about just making girls continuously jump over these hurdles that we put in place in front of them. It’s about us taking those hurdles down,” Jemison said of guaranteeing diversity in STEM ― science, technology, engineering and math.Jemison advocates for agricultural science in the classroom, and teachers seem to agree that it’s a valuable goal. According to Bayer and the National 4-H Council’s survey of 1,640 high school science teachers in honor of National Ag Day on March 20, more than 80 percent said they think it’s important to include agricultural science in their lesson plans. Only about half of teachers feel qualified to teach the subject, however. In a 2015 paper from AGree, a group that focuses on food and agriculture policy, Stephanie Mercier, former chief economist of the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee, wrote that there are “relatively few in-school food and agricultural education programs” for elementary school students, as teachers at public schools “tend to focus on subject areas covered in state standards and testing.” Mercier also pointed out that most of these programs take place in rural areas, not urban and suburban settings.The good news is that out of 1,004 parents surveyed by Bayer and 4-H, more than 75 percent want their kids (ages 13 to 17) to see agricultural science as exciting and interesting. So how do we make this happen?Sirangelo encouraged parents to consider devoting as much time to their kids’ science activities as they do for their sports, while Jemison noted the importance of making sure teachers feel comfortable teaching these ideas in the classroom. The chemical engineer and trailblazer also reminded parents to teach their girls that it’s OK to pursue their interests, even if they’re typically not marketed to women.“Spend as much time with them on curriculum science and other things that [you] would spend on helping them get their nails and hair done,” she said. “It’s OK to get dirty. Sometimes, in order to make a good mud pie, you gotta get dirty.”"

2,POLITICS,Horrifying Videos Show Racist Moms Teaching Kids To Be 'Patriots' By Vandalizing A Mosque,Rowaida Abdelaziz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-videos-mosque-vandalism-women-children_us_5aa9a121e4b0600b82ffe195,The disturbing Facebook live video captures a troubling excursion in which two women and three children trespass and vandalize a mosque.,2018-03-15,The children are shown climbing on the mosque’s funeral van as they are warned about “dead Muslims” and “sex goats.”,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa9a65d1e000008087aeb62.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: March 15 ― Tahnee Gonzales and Elizabeth Dauenhauer were arrested on Thursday on suspicion of felony third-degree burglary. A hate crime will also be considered during sentencing, Det. Liliana Duran of the Tempe Police Department told HuffPost.PREVIOUSLY:A disturbing Facebook live video has recently surfaced of a troubling excursion in which two women take a group of children to vandalize and steal materials at a mosque in Tempe, Arizona, in an attempt to “expose the evil that is happening in our backyards.” In three bizarre videos published March 4 by Facebook user Tahnee Gonzales, she and another woman take three unidentified children on a trip to the mosque in order to “collect as much information” and “expose mosques” in order to teach the children how to be “American patriots.”In one outlandish scene, Gonzales and the second woman, identified as Elizabeth “Liz” Dauenhauer, lead the children to trespass onto the mosque’s private property after Gonzales delivers a hateful lecture on Muslims during the car trip there.“They smell like goat,” exclaims a girl in the background once the group enters through the gated fence and walk around a play area at the Islamic Community Center of Tempe. Both women immediately laugh. Gonzales then tells the group and the viewers on camera that Muslims are destroying America and are “devil Satan worshippers.” Once back in the parking lot, after having stolen flyers and other items from the mosque, the women praise the girl and two boys for their racist comments and for participating in the burglary.The women then circle the property and take photos of the kids standing in front of the mosque. The little girl instructs one of the boys to put his “thumbs down” and pouts as the group poses for a photo.“Be careful, because Muslims are waiting to rape you,” the young girl is heard telling the boy.The children are then seen climbing upon the mosque’s funeral van while one of the women warns one of the boys about the “dead Muslims” and “sex goats” that she says were once stored in the truck. One of videos posted by Gonzales has since been taken down but was reposted on a number of other accounts, including a Facebook page under the name Naui Ocelot that has accumulated over 10,000 views. The other two videos are still on Gonzales’ personal Facebook page. HuffPost has also obtained copies of the videos.The Tempe Police Department confirmed to HuffPost the identities of Tahnee Gonzales and Elizabeth Dauenhauer. HuffPost also matched the women in the video to their individual Facebook pages based on their appearances. In addition, the Facebook page Naui Ocelot, which reposted the now deleted video, included links to both Gonzales’ personal Facebook page and to Dauenhauer’s Facebook page.Local news reports said Wednesday morning that the women were part of the Patriot Movement AZ, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has deemed a “fringe group being energized and influenced by the president’s over-the-top rhetoric on immigrants and Muslims.”The video begins with the two women in the front of a car with the three children in the back. The women have brought flags for the children and call them “little infidels.”Gonzales rallies her viewers to “get off their butts” to fight Islamic religious law. She then calls Deedra Abboud, a Muslim woman running as a Democratic candidate in Arizona for the U.S. Senate, a threat to America.Abboud posted on Facebook her condemnation of the pair’s actions, saying they are “not ‘standing up for America’ or representing American values in any way.” Abboud told HuffPost that Patriot Movement AZ told her it removed Gonzales from the group before the incident. The group, however, denied to HuffPost that Gonazles was ever a member.HuffPost spoke to the imam of the Islamic Community Center of Tempe, where the incident occurred. Ahmad Al-Akoum reviewed the footage and delivered evidence to the Tempe Police Department the same week. The Islamic Community Center is working with the Tempe police to investigate charges against Gonzales and Dauenhauer. This isn’t the first time the mosque has been on the receiving end of a hate crime, but it was shocking for the community to see young children participating in the vile attacks, Al-Akoum said.“What really affected me the most is seeing those young children getting real-life lessons in hate, that was the thing that made me really, really upset with those people. Those innocent 5-, 6-year-old children are now really learning hate from their parents. It’s really disheartening,” Al-Akoum, the operations director and acting imam of the center, told HuffPost. The Tempe Police Department says it is investigating trespass reports against Dauenhauer and Gonzales on behalf of the Islamic center, the police department’s media relations officer, Det. Liliana Duran, told HuffPost. More charges are likely to be filed, she said. The two women are not now charged or in custody, however.HuffPost reached out to to Gonzales but did not hear back. HuffPost was unable to contact Dauenhauer, and she has since deleted her Facebook page. HuffPost reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to inquire about both women’s employment status after Dauenhauer claimed on Facebook that she worked for the agency. CBP confirmed to HuffPost that neither women is employed by the agency.In one of the videos posted on the same day after the trip, Gonzales asks her daughter for her thoughts about sharia, or Islamic law, and the child responds, “F it.” When her mom asks to explain more, the young girl says sharia allows “old men ... to marry young kids at my age.”The litany of disinformation repeated by the young children in the video has alarmed the Muslim community in Arizona.“The most jarring thing about the video is clearly the fact there are children involved, indoctrinated to hate people based off their belief system or what they look like or the color they are. You can see that unfolding in real time,” said Imraan Siddiqi, the executive director of the Arizona chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “Ironically about all of this is that the trope exists among these people that Muslims teach their children to hate. Yet they are right there on camera, telling the children just extremely inflammatory false information about this group of people that is definitely going to shape their perspectives about Muslims as they grow older. My hope for these children is that they are able to overcome the hate that is being taught to them by their parents.The series of videos, thought to all have been taken on the same day, is filled with dangerous Islamophobic rhetoric about the Muslim community, stating that Muslims “use our Constitution against us” and “get everything for free,” such as food, assistance and housing. In reality, Muslims have consistently contributed to American society since the birth of this nation. Muslims comprise 10 percent of American physicians, are leaders in politics and activism, and give more to charity than any other religious group. The statements made by Gonzales and Dauenhauer are a common ploy by far-right activists to vilify the Muslim-American community.During the longest video of the three, viewers can follow the family trip from the car ride to the mosque. The group’s first stop is a strip mall that includes a store and Muslim-owned restaurants that offer halal food ― food prepared according to Islamic customs ― that is next to the Islamic Community Center of Tempe. There, Gonzales discusses the “illegal invasion of Muslims” while showing the children the storefronts, speculating that the restaurants were closed because Muslims were busy “worshipping the anti-Christ.” The children follow Gonzales closely everywhere she goes, listening to every word.Once at the mosque, the two women and the three children let themselves into the mosque’s gated outdoor play area. Gonzales notices the “No firearms” sign at the gate and at first hesitates to enter, acknowledging in the video that she is carrying a weapon. “I have to take my gun out of my bag back.” “Go take it back,” she instructs the young boy who is out of the camera frame. She then proceeds to enter the gated area that has a “No trespassing” sign. “I had Betty on me. So I had to put Betty away,” she tells Dauenhauer, laughing. It’s unclear whether Dauenhauer enters the premise with the gun or whether it was given to the boy to place somewhere else.Once inside, the women, led by Dauenhauer, begin tearing pamphlets off a bulletin board as the children watch. The women then instruct the kids to grab as many of the flyers as they can. The family then continues the hateful and bizarre tour toward the mosque and try to enter the prayer space. Instead, they bump into a worshipper who is exiting at the same time. The man is seen attempting to engage the family in a dialogue, clearly shocked, but the group instead accuses him of wanting to eat their dog and engage in pedophilia.  “We’re coming after you. We, the people. We’re exposing you. You guys stand for evil and nothing but evil,” Gonzales is heard yelling at the stunned worshipper. “We’re trying to be peaceful,” the man is heard responding. “You have no idea what you’re talking about.”In a separate video, posted by Gonzales on the same day, the group is gathered back in the car, singing along to a song known as the Donald Trump song. “Build a wall. Ten feet, 20 feet, 100 feet tall,” they all sing. “Look at these patriots!” Gonzales says as she points to her children. “Raise your kids to love your country. Get involved with your children. You only have a certain amount of time before they leave you and become adults. You raise great patriots and you get great Americans. Raise your kid right to love your country, and we’re going to have a great country in the end, working with our president, Donald J. Trump. We’re winning 2020 again. What’s up. 2020 President Trump.”This incident, although alarming, does not come as a shock to the Muslim community. Islamophobia is at an all-time high in the United States. “This is not happening in a vacuum. It’s a troubling trend. We live here in the intersection of gun culture and Islamophobia in Arizona, where you have very lax open-carry laws,” said Siddiqi. “It’s not acceptable for people to encroach on a house of worship like this, to harass worshippers and to take materials from the mosque. There needs to be perimeters that are there and clearly laid out, and these types of things need to be prosecuted.”Al-Akoum and his congregants are optimistic that justice will be served. They have received a letter of support from a member of the Humanist Society of Greater Phoenix condemning the hateful attack on the mosque and offering solidarity. “While we may disagree on matters of religion, you deserve nothing less than respect and recognition of your basic human dignity. You are welcome here,” the letter said. Al-Akoum, touched by the gesture, also has hope for the children brought along by Gonzales and Dauenhauer.“My hope is that those kids will grow up and be more engaged in the community and meet some Muslims and see what they did learn is not true about Muslims.”This story has been updated to include further comments from Abboud, as well as comments from Patriot Movement AZ.Clarification: A previous version of this story indicated the Islamic Community Center of Tempe had received a letter of support from the Humanist Society of Greater Phoenix. While the letter was from a member of the society, it did not represent the whole group."

She chaperoned while some 800 of the school’s 1,100 students participated in the National School Walkout, spending 30 minutes in silence in a nearby field.Around the country, at least 3,000 other schools and communities participated in the event, an effort to honor the 17 lives lost at Marjory Stoneman Douglas and agitate for stricter gun control. The hundreds of teens were hushed as a small group of students and teachers alternated reading the names of the victims of the Parkland shooting over a megaphone. Each victim was given a minute of silence. Stillman tearfully looked on as teens held signs displaying the students’ names and messages of protest against the National Rifle Association.Kathy Ling, a senior at Townsend Harris, helped plan the student-led event as president of the student union. The walkout is one of several events the students have planned to help honor Parkland and its victims over the next few months. The school’s administration, she said, has been supportive and helpful.Ling was proud of the respect her fellow students showed during the event, which was meant to act more as a memorial than a protest, she said.Watching members of the MSD theater community gain national prominence as spokespeople for a gun control movement has been heartwarming, but not surprising, Stillman says, given the public speaking skills necessary for drama. The eloquence and composure the Parkland students have exhibited remind Stillman of her own students at Townsend Harris, whom she describes as “politically aware” and “articulate.” Stillman sported a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School sweatshirt at the walkout. On Wednesday evening, she plans to participate in an “Evening of Action” with fellow MSD alumni and high school students around New York.“I never in a million years anything like this would happen in that town,” Stillman said earlier this week of Parkland. “Hopefully it doesn’t happen anywhere, but to have it happen in a place you know so well, so intimately ― it was like losing somebody in your own family.”"

5,POLITICS,Several Schools Cancel Planned Walkouts Amid Threats Of Violence,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/schools-cancel-walkouts_us_5aa95b7ee4b0f4aaa112f14b,"Most of the threats ended up being illegitimate, but schools weren't taking any chances.",2018-03-14,Demonstrators at a rally outside the Capitol on Wednesday as they call on Congress to act on gun violence prevention. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa9740c1f0000150316a5dd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As thousands of students across the country participated in walkouts on Wednesday to protest gun violence, several schools received threats that forced them to cancel planned events.Walkouts were set to begin at 10 a.m. in each time zone and last 17 minutes ― one minute for each person who was killed in last month’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.But just minutes before it struck 10 a.m. on the West Coast, Righetti High School in Santa Maria, California, received a threat that forced the school to go into lockdown, preventing students from leaving the building.“They weren’t able to participate in the walkout because [the lockdown] happened at the same time,” Kelly Hoover, a public information officer for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, told HuffPost. Hoover could not offer additional details about the nature of the threat, but she noted that no injuries had been reported.Police were still investigating the potential threat by mid-morning, well after many of the walkouts in the state had already started winding down.Also in California, Atascadero High School temporarily went on lockdown around 9:40 a.m. in response to a threat that had been posted on social media. A juvenile suspect was quickly identified and taken into custody, the Atascadero Police Department said in a statement. The “shelter in place” order was lifted at 10:30 a.m.“School safety is our number one priority and AUSD is committed to ensuring the safety of our students and staff,” superintendent Tom Butler said in a message to parents. “We absolutely honor our students’ voices and their First Amendment Rights, yet not at the risk of compromising school safety.”Two Illinois schools ― Bradley-Bourbonnais Community High School and Romeoville High School ― announced on Tuesday night that threats had led them to cancel planned walkouts. The Bradley Police Department received a phoned-in threat that officials ultimately deemed to be “unsubstantiated,” but that led the district superintendent to cancel the walkout. “We were going to have a few thousand kids out on North Street, and we couldn’t be wrong,” superintendent Scott Wakeley told the Daily Journal on Wednesday morning. “Even though it’s a rumor for a 17-minute walkout, if we are wrong, I couldn’t live with myself. While it’s disheartening that we couldn’t support the kids in doing the walkout, we need to live to see another day.”Some students, however, said they planned to go ahead with the walkout without the school’s consent.Romeoville police received messages from students and parents on Tuesday regarding a social media post depicting a male student holding a firearm.The weapon pictured turned out to be an air-soft gun, and police determined that the post did not constitute a real threat. But the school decided to keep students indoors and postpone the show of solidarity for a later date.In Wisconsin, Mukwonago High School and Pewaukee High School also canceled their walkouts due to potential threats.The Mukwonago Area School District said in a statement posted on Facebook on Wednesday morning that police were investigating a rumor that someone was planning to open fire at the high school during the walkout. The threat was deemed invalid, but the school canceled the walkout to be safe.Pewaukee High School closed for the day after police arrested a student early Wednesday morning in connection with a threat. Officials at Hackensack High School in New Jersey canceled a walkout after receiving reports of potential violence, so students held a presentation to show their solidarity with protesters across the country. Schools across the country also received intimidating messages and threats in the days immediately following the Parkland shooting ― a phenomenon that is common in the wake of many gun tragedies.“Copycat threats” in the days after the Florida massacre led officials from Maryland to Hawaii to lock down campuses, close entire school districts and arrest dozens of students. Kids who make threats after a mass murder reflect what psychologists say is an epidemic of poor mental health in young people and a fundamental lack of resources. Some may be seeking help and attention, while others lash out because the shooter’s anger mirrors their own frustrations. Exhaustive media coverage may also play a roll, according to a scientific study on mass shootings published earlier this year. “Essentially, one attack appears to induce another,” the researchers wrote. “There is an imitative or ‘contagion’ effect.” "

The on-air apology stemmed from a Feb. 13 conversation on “The View” during which Behar mused that Pence must have a “mental illness” if he believes Jesus talks to him.After an uproar from conservative viewers of the ABC show, Behar called Pence to personally and privately apologize, The Washington Post reported. But Pence, who has called himself a “born-again, evangelical Catholic,” told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday that he believes Behar should also apologize publicly to “tens of millions of Americans, who were equally offended by what was said.”“I think Vice President Pence is right,” Behar said on the show Tuesday, speaking directly to the camera. “I was raised to respect everyone’s religious faith, and I fell short of that. I sincerely apologize for what I said.”A clip of Behar’s apology was posted separately to the YouTube page of “The View.”The Feb. 13 conversation began as a discussion about former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman and her thoughts about whether Pence would make a better president than Donald Trump. “I’m Christian. I love Jesus,” Manigault Newman said in a clip played from “Celebrity Big Brother.” “But [Pence] thinks Jesus tells him to say things. I’m like, ‘Jesus ain’t saying that.’”“It’s one thing to talk to Jesus,” Behar said in the ensuing discussion. “It’s another thing when Jesus talks to you. That’s called mental illness, if I’m not correct, hearing voices.”Co-hosts Megan McCain and Sherri Shepherd pushed back, saying they believe Jesus also talks to them.Later on in the same conversation, Behar defended Pence, saying that she thought he would be a better president than Trump.“I don’t think he’s mentally ill, even though he’s hearing voices,” Behar said.Pence went on the offensive after Behar’s comments, claiming on C-SPAN that they were an insult to “the vast majority of the American people who like me cherish their faith.” He said it demonstrated how “out of touch” the mainstream media is about religion.According to The Washington Post, ABC received at least 40,000 protest phone calls about “The View” segment by the end of last Friday. Pence confirmed to Sean Hannity that Behar had apologized personally to him during a phone call. “I give Joy Behar a lot of credit,” he said. “She picked up the phone. She called me. She was very sincere. And she apologized. One of the things my faith teaches me is grace. Forgive as you have been forgiven.”"

She was then elected governor in a special election in 2016 to finish Kitzhaber’s term, and will run for re-election this year.Speaking with me on Monday on SiriusXM Progress, Brown underscored how Oregon has been at the forefront among the states on LGBTQ rights. “I’m very proud of the work that we have done in Oregon to ensure that we prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity,” she said. “Obviously we achieved marriage equality as well in 2014. And we’ve been able to move forward under my leadership.” Brown then mentioned recent measures the state has taken to protect transgender students, and allow residents to obtain gender-neutral driver’s licenses and birth certificates that reflect their gender identity.As governor, Brown has also done what’s in her power at the state level to battle President Donald Trump’s attempt to ban transgender people in the military.“I’ve made it very clear to the adjutant general, the head of our National Guard — I am the commander in chief ― but I made it very clear to him that we would continue to allow folks in the trans community to serve,” she said. “We see their service as instrumental and critical to making sure that we keep Oregonians safe, and their service is instrumental to the nation as well.”Brown has helped make history in other ways, and views the issues she’s worked on as integral to one another. As secretary of state, she spearheaded Oregon’s first-in-the-nation automatic voter registration system in which Oregonians are registered when they obtain or renew a driver’s license, ID card or permit ― what she calls the “nudge principle,” since people have to opt out in order not to register ― which has made it much easier for residents to participate in the democratic process in Oregon.And she views voting as among the most powerful ways for LGBTQ people and others who feel threatened in the Trump era to fight back.“I think it’s critically important [for people to have] their voices be heard,” she explained. “I am extremely ― I’m gravely concerned about what’a happening across this country in terms of providing barriers for people to participate in their most fundamental right, and that’s the right to vote. I crafted the automatic voter registration [as Oregon’s secretary of state] and, in a weird twist of fate, I signed it into law as governor. We’ve been able to increase the number of young people participating in elections as well as communities of color and I think it’s really critical that we make the right to vote as accessible as possible to every single American.”Early last week, Brown was the first governor to sign an expansive gun safety law in the aftermath of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting. The law will further protect women from becoming victims of gun violence.“Closing what we call the intimate partner loophole will keep guns out of the wrong hands, out of the hands of stalkers and domestic abusers,” she said of the legislation, which expands existing legislation aimed at barring gun purchases and possession among individuals with a domestic violence or stalking conviction.“It was a priority for me this legislative session because of the impact of guns in domestic violence situations,” she said. “The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation makes it five times more likely that a woman will be killed. And in my last two years as governor, we had more than 60 deaths due to domestic violence, and more than half of those were due to guns. So it was absolutely imperative that the legislature move forward and close this loophole.”In a time when women are standing tall, speaking out against sexual assault and physical abuse, and running for office in record numbers, one role Brown sees for herself is as a leader who encourages others to get involved. “I think we can only make change ― and change that is resilient and respectful of the communities and continues to reflect the communities — when you have a diversity of voices at the leadership table,” she explained. She pointed to the work ahead, noting that that she is one of only six women in the country who, as governors, are members of the National Governors Association. “I like to say it’s the malest, straightest, whitest organization that I’ve been a part of,” Brown said. “And it’s really important that that organization reflects the diversity and experiences of people across the country.”With her determination and record of effectiveness, Kate Brown no doubt will play a part in making that happen.

DeGeneres, however, wasn’t fazed by Hayes’ cheeky jab, and pointed to the fact that her series is widely credited for having paved the way for “Will & Grace” and other queer-inclusive TV programming. “That’s right, I had to come out first for you all to do that sitcom,” she replied, as seen in the clip above. “Go ahead!” Of course, there’s no true rivalry between the two stars.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa88dfb1e0000fb077ae95b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ELIZABETH TOWNSHIP, Pa.― Democrat Conor Lamb held a slim lead over Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone Wednesday in a race likely headed to a recount.With 100 percent of precincts reporting and all of the absentee ballots counted, Lamb led Saccone by a mere 627 votes. Provisional ballots were still being tallied. The Associated Press said late Tuesday it was not declaring a winner because the race was too close to call. Still, Lamb declared victory early Wednesday.Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) and Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto (D) on Wednesday congratulated Lamb.There is no automatic recount on the congressional district level in Pennsylvania, according to state law. Candidates can, however, petition for a recount within five days after counties complete their vote computations.“I would rather be in Lamb’s shoes right now,” former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) said late Tuesday on CNN.About 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, Saccone came downstairs from the war room with his wife, Yong, his son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. “I just came down to let you know, we’re still fighting the fight,” he said. “It’s not over yet.”At one point a woman in the crowd yelled out, “There was some monkey business going on at the voting polls, Rick!”Saccone thanked his supporters and let them know they could go home, because his campaign would be working late into the nightYet, win or lose, the result represents massive progress for the Democratic Party. It reflects the heightened enthusiasm of the party’s liberal base ahead of the 2018 congressional midterms, and it also signals dissatisfaction of many voters with President Donald Trump. The commander in chief carried the district by nearly 20 percentage points in the 2016 election.“The congressional map for potentially competitive races has just gotten a whole hell of a lot bigger,” said Mike Mikus, a western Pennsylvania-based Democratic consultant. “If I’m the Republicans, I’m terrified. If I’m the Democrats, I’m very energized looking toward November.”The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee claimed victory Tuesday night before a winner had been declared. Ben Ray Luján, the chair of the group, said the results should “terrify Republicans” who spent millions to defeat Lamb.“We have incredible candidates with deep records of service running deep into the map this year, and it’s clear that these Republican attacks are not going to stick,” he said.Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District opened up in October, when eight-term incumbent Republican Tim Murphy resigned under pressure. Murphy, who publicly opposed abortion rights, was caught encouraging a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair to get an abortion during a pregnancy scare.Murphy enjoyed a virtually unshakable hold on the southwestern Pennsylvania district, running unopposed in the two previous elections. The district, which was heavily gerrymandered to favor Republicans, covers a vast swath of southwestern Pennsylvania.Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said Tuesday’s result served as a warning sign for the GOP come November even if Saccone retains the seat.“Regardless of who ultimately wins, this is not a good result for the GOP. Look for more retirements to come,” Heye tweeted, referring to the growing number of Republican lawmakers headed for the exits.Much of the national commentary on Lamb’s race has centered on how he used his Catholic faith, background as a Marine and moderate positions on guns, coal and fracking to find favor with the district’s culturally conservative voters.But Lamb also had a laser-like focus on kitchen-table economics, particularly with his promises to protect Social Security and Medicare. And in a district where nearly one in four voters is a union member, Lamb made his support for organized labor a leading theme of his campaign. He promised to protect collective bargaining rights, signed onto a bipartisan fix for the underfunded coal miners’ pensions and supported efforts to “level the playing field” for American manufacturing.In his courtship of union voters, Lamb had a helpful foil in Saccone. Although former Rep. Tim Murphy enjoyed a solid working relationship with unions, Saccone had a resolutely anti-union record, which included a host of controversial state House votes and support for the so-called “right-to-work” laws that are a third rail for unions.Labor unions, which have sometimes been divided in their electoral efforts, united passionately behind Lamb. They conducted a massive effort to inform their members why they believed Lamb was the right candidate and Saccone was unacceptable. The United Steel Workers alone contacted all 20,000 of its members in the district at least once, according to the union’s political director Tim Waters.“It’s a good win for the labor movement,” Waters said. “This is a union district and Republicans decided that because of the [district] lines they could come here to our backyard and run a blatantly anti-union candidate.”The nature of the district made the race something of a “litmus test” on the political resonance of unions ― and unions passed that test with flying colors, according to Waters.Although there is not detailed enough data to document exactly how votes broke down based on union membership, several working-class precincts where labor has a large presence went from voting for Trump to voting for Lamb.In Burgettstown, a hamlet in a Washington County school district where just 15 percent of residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher, 56 percent of residents voted for Trump in 2016. On Tuesday, the exact same percentage of the town’s residents voted for Conor Lamb.Likewise, in a part of the rural coal mining town of Waynesburg, where Lamb held one of his final rallies, 57 percent of residents voted for Trump and 54 percent backed Lamb.“If you look at his win and what happened recently with teachers unions in West Virginia, the labor movement is resurgent,” said Krystal Ball, founder of the People’s House Project, which recruits and advises candidates in GOP-held districts in the Midwest and Appalachia. “I hope the Democratic Party is smart enough to know their best friends and allies are in the labor movement.”This article has been updated to include Lamb’s lead after absentee ballots had been counted."

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he'll oppose President Donald Trump's nominees to head the State Department and CIA.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa946c11f00002d0016a587.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Wednesday he intends to oppose President Donald Trump’s nominees to head the CIA and the State Department.Trump on Tuesday announced the ouster of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and said he was replacing him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Trump also said he plans to nominate Gina Haspel, now deputy CIA director, to replace Pompeo as head of the spy agency. Haspel helped oversee the agency’s controversial torture program, and allegedly played a part in the destruction of video recordings that captured torture sessions.Paul, a libertarian-leaning critic of U.S. military intervention, said he was “perplexed” by both nominees, and called them “the wrong fit for America.” He added that he feared Pompeo and Haspel both would push for military force in Iran because they supported nearly two decades of war in Iraq that followed the U.S. invasion.Paul criticized Haspel for what he called her “gleeful enjoyment” torturing detainees. “I find it amazing that anyone would consider this woman as the head of the CIA,” he said at a press conference.Paul’s opposition could imperil both nominations in what is likely to be a heated confirmation process. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is still recovering in his home state after being diagnosed with cancer, leaving Pompeo and Haspel with as few as 49 GOP votes in the Senate.Paul’s position on the Foreign Relations Committee could threaten Pompeo’s nomination early in the process. Republicans hold a one-seat majority on the panel, and Pompeo’s nomination could stall if Democrats on the committee decide to oppose it.Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, one of the architects of the Iraq War, defended Haspel on Twitter and accused Paul of “defending and sympathizing” with terrorists.It’s unclear, however, how many Democrats will end up supporting either nomination. Pompeo was confirmed as the CIA director by a bipartisan 66-to-32 vote. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who blocked Haspel’s promotion to acting head of the CIA’s clandestine service in 2013 for her involvement in the torture program, offered some praise for the nominee on Tuesday, but did not say how she planned to vote.“Well, I have spent some time with her, we’ve had dinner together, we have talked ... everything I know is, is that she has been a good deputy director of the CIA,” Feinstein said. “I think hopefully the entire organization learned something from the so-called enhanced interrogation program. I think it’s something that can’t be forgotten. And I certainly can never forget it. And I won’t let any director forget it.”Other Democrats, meanwhile, are calling on the administration to declassify information surrounding Haspel’s management of the CIA torture program. “We should not be asked to confirm a nominee whose background cannot be publicly discussed and who cannot then be held accountable for her actions. The American public deserves to know who its leaders are,” Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said in a statement.This article has been updated with Cheney’s comments."
16,POLITICS,Trump’s Visit To Wall Prototypes Shows The Hubris And Absurdity Of The Idea,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-border-walls-visit_us_5aa88967e4b018e2f1c2b2ee,"As the president inspected 8 slabs at the border, familiar campaign chants echoed again.",2018-03-14,President Donald Trump speaks at an installation of U.S.-Mexico border wall prototypes near the Otay Mesa Port of Entry in San Diego on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa889bc2000003800eb1ccf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN DIEGO ― It could have been a victory lap. On a foggy Tuesday, President Donald Trump traveled to the desert outside of San Diego to visit eight wall prototypes constructed in service of his signature policy goal: his “big, beautiful” southern border wall. Trump, ever the showman, examined eight contestants in his wall pageant, a contest in which he hopes to one day pick a winner. Which one would he pick? Would the fans know before the first-term series finale? The visit also marked Trump’s first trip to California since winning the presidency. It could have been the perfect moment to troll the state that so forcefully rejects him and his policies. And it was all going so well. In the hours before Trump’s arrival just before noon, the handful of pro-wall, pro-Trump rallies around Otay Mesa, the southern San Diego community that backs right up to the U.S.-Mexico border, brought together hundreds of supporters of the president and his proposed expansion of the border wall. The crowd chanted familiar Trump rally refrains ―“Build that wall!” “Lock her up!” ― while flying “Make America great again” flags. Shortly after Air Force One touched ground at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station, a Trump supporter grabbed the microphone: “Trump has landed!” she shouted. The crowd erupted with excitement. The fans were ready for their hero. But the thrill quickly died down. Then, a car drove by and yelled “Fuck Donald Trump!” As the crowd was shaking off the insult, a man in a passing car waved a Mexican flag, which fell off his pole and into the street. Suddenly a group of Trump supporters found their courage. They raced to the flag and snatched it up. “Burn it!” they chanted. They settled for shredding it. At last the motorcade arrived. Trump, flanked by federal and local law enforcement, was finally here to see his wall prototypes. Within hours of Trump’s visit, federal authorities were charging three rural Illinois men ― one of whom was a bidder on Trump’s border wall contract ― for the bombing of a Minnesota mosque last year and the attempted bombing of a women’s health clinic in Illinois.Touring the site, Trump explained he preferred “see-through” walls. “You have to know what’s on the other side of the wall,” he explained. He is partial to taller walls, arguing some of the people who cross the border are “like professional mountain climbers.” “They’re incredible climbers,” Trump said. “They can’t climb some of these walls. Some of them they can. Those are the walls we’re not using.”Unlike most of Trump’s campaign promises, many of which were drafted in a matter of weeks or months, the promise of a southern border wall has been part of his policy platform since he first announced his candidacy in June 2015. The idea of a newly fortified border wall electrified his base, who have gleefully chanted “Build the wall!” at his rallies. It also has become a rallying cry for racists, middle school and teenage bullies, and college students on spring break in Mexico.“We have a lousy wall now,” Trump said Tuesday. “When we put up the real wall, we’re going to stop 99 percent [of illegal crossings], maybe more than that.”The cost estimates for Trump’s “real wall” vary wildly. In January, Trump said he wants $25 billion for border security efforts, including for his wall. He’s said at various points that he believes the wall can be built for $8 billion to as much as $12 billion. Senate Democrats have said it would it would be far costlier, closer to $70 billion. Independent analysts have pegged the cost at anywhere between $15 billion and $40 billion. Trump has long promised that Mexico will pay for the wall, whatever the cost, while Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has rejected those claims.What is clear is that Trump’s wall, if it is actually ever constructed, will represent the culmination of decades of hardening of the U.S.-Mexico border zone. Throughout the 20th century, barbed wire, then fencing, then some observation towers, then more fencing have been constructed in and around various border towns, ranches and expanses of border land in an attempt to deter traffic. By 2006, President George W. Bush ushered in the construction of the more than 650 miles of fencing and barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border that exists today.The structures that now make up the border barrier consist of iron fencing, stretches of vehicle barriers and barbed wire, as well as natural barriers, such as the Rio Grande. The border fencing has long been full of gaps and stops and starts along the way. The border barrier has been fairly effective at deterring illegal crossings. Apprehensions at the southwest border, which represent nearly 98 percent of total illegal crossings nationwide, fell to just over 300,000 in 2017, less than one-fifth of the 1.6 million apprehensions in 2000. But the barrier has the negative effect of pushing vulnerable people into more dangerous environments, cleaving communities and being profitable for human smuggling networks. Most Americans appear to have an understanding of this. Numerous polls have consistently shown that the majority of Americans oppose the construction of a border wall. Moreover, most experts and historical record agree that Trump’s wall will not be effective in securing the southern U.S. border. Trump, undeterred by these realities, examined the proposed wall slabs for about an hour. At a smaller gathering overlooking the wall prototypes, a couple of dozen people gathered. Wearing Trump gear, they listened to music, held signs expressing support for Trump and his wall, and waited for the president to inspect the prototypes in the distance. One Trump supporter shouted “President Trump, we love you.” Another chanted, “Build that wall!”Trump, a mile or two away, couldn’t hear them.

17,POLITICS,Trump’s Visit To Wall Prototypes Shows The Hubris And Absurdity Of The Idea,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-border-walls-visit_us_5aa88967e4b018e2f1c2b2ee,"As the president inspected 8 slabs at the border, familiar campaign chants echoed again.",2018-03-14,A pro-Trump rally in Otay Mesa near the wall prototypes the president visited Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa88a3d1e000008087ae95a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN DIEGO ― It could have been a victory lap. On a foggy Tuesday, President Donald Trump traveled to the desert outside of San Diego to visit eight wall prototypes constructed in service of his signature policy goal: his “big, beautiful” southern border wall. Trump, ever the showman, examined eight contestants in his wall pageant, a contest in which he hopes to one day pick a winner. Which one would he pick? Would the fans know before the first-term series finale? The visit also marked Trump’s first trip to California since winning the presidency. It could have been the perfect moment to troll the state that so forcefully rejects him and his policies. And it was all going so well. In the hours before Trump’s arrival just before noon, the handful of pro-wall, pro-Trump rallies around Otay Mesa, the southern San Diego community that backs right up to the U.S.-Mexico border, brought together hundreds of supporters of the president and his proposed expansion of the border wall. The crowd chanted familiar Trump rally refrains ―“Build that wall!” “Lock her up!” ― while flying “Make America great again” flags. Shortly after Air Force One touched ground at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station, a Trump supporter grabbed the microphone: “Trump has landed!” she shouted. The crowd erupted with excitement. The fans were ready for their hero. But the thrill quickly died down. Then, a car drove by and yelled “Fuck Donald Trump!” As the crowd was shaking off the insult, a man in a passing car waved a Mexican flag, which fell off his pole and into the street. Suddenly a group of Trump supporters found their courage. They raced to the flag and snatched it up. “Burn it!” they chanted. They settled for shredding it. At last the motorcade arrived. Trump, flanked by federal and local law enforcement, was finally here to see his wall prototypes. Within hours of Trump’s visit, federal authorities were charging three rural Illinois men ― one of whom was a bidder on Trump’s border wall contract ― for the bombing of a Minnesota mosque last year and the attempted bombing of a women’s health clinic in Illinois.Touring the site, Trump explained he preferred “see-through” walls. “You have to know what’s on the other side of the wall,” he explained. He is partial to taller walls, arguing some of the people who cross the border are “like professional mountain climbers.” “They’re incredible climbers,” Trump said. “They can’t climb some of these walls. Some of them they can. Those are the walls we’re not using.”Unlike most of Trump’s campaign promises, many of which were drafted in a matter of weeks or months, the promise of a southern border wall has been part of his policy platform since he first announced his candidacy in June 2015. The idea of a newly fortified border wall electrified his base, who have gleefully chanted “Build the wall!” at his rallies. It also has become a rallying cry for racists, middle school and teenage bullies, and college students on spring break in Mexico.“We have a lousy wall now,” Trump said Tuesday. “When we put up the real wall, we’re going to stop 99 percent [of illegal crossings], maybe more than that.”The cost estimates for Trump’s “real wall” vary wildly. In January, Trump said he wants $25 billion for border security efforts, including for his wall. He’s said at various points that he believes the wall can be built for $8 billion to as much as $12 billion. Senate Democrats have said it would it would be far costlier, closer to $70 billion. Independent analysts have pegged the cost at anywhere between $15 billion and $40 billion. Trump has long promised that Mexico will pay for the wall, whatever the cost, while Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has rejected those claims.What is clear is that Trump’s wall, if it is actually ever constructed, will represent the culmination of decades of hardening of the U.S.-Mexico border zone. Throughout the 20th century, barbed wire, then fencing, then some observation towers, then more fencing have been constructed in and around various border towns, ranches and expanses of border land in an attempt to deter traffic. By 2006, President George W. Bush ushered in the construction of the more than 650 miles of fencing and barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border that exists today.The structures that now make up the border barrier consist of iron fencing, stretches of vehicle barriers and barbed wire, as well as natural barriers, such as the Rio Grande. The border fencing has long been full of gaps and stops and starts along the way. The border barrier has been fairly effective at deterring illegal crossings. Apprehensions at the southwest border, which represent nearly 98 percent of total illegal crossings nationwide, fell to just over 300,000 in 2017, less than one-fifth of the 1.6 million apprehensions in 2000. But the barrier has the negative effect of pushing vulnerable people into more dangerous environments, cleaving communities and being profitable for human smuggling networks. Most Americans appear to have an understanding of this. Numerous polls have consistently shown that the majority of Americans oppose the construction of a border wall. Moreover, most experts and historical record agree that Trump’s wall will not be effective in securing the southern U.S. border. Trump, undeterred by these realities, examined the proposed wall slabs for about an hour. At a smaller gathering overlooking the wall prototypes, a couple of dozen people gathered. Wearing Trump gear, they listened to music, held signs expressing support for Trump and his wall, and waited for the president to inspect the prototypes in the distance. One Trump supporter shouted “President Trump, we love you.” Another chanted, “Build that wall!”Trump, a mile or two away, couldn’t hear them. And his supporters couldn’t hear him, either.Shortly after 1 p.m., Trump was loaded back into his caravan to return to Miramar Air Station. Next up was Los Angeles, where the president would spend about four hours at the private residence of a Republican National Committee fundraiser. As he headed north, a few dozen Trump supporters stood on one side of a street while a few dozen Trump protesters stood on the opposite side. They pointed their signs at each other and waved their flags near the entrance of a shipping facility where Trump’s motorcade would drive by. The motorcade was met with the requisite cheers and boos, but that soon faded away."

In an email dated Aug. 8, 2017, Coressel invited Candy Carson to meet with a designer for ideas on “redecorating the Secretary’s office and bringing in new furniture.”“Are you available on any of those dates and would you like to come in and have input on the redecorating?” it asks her.A response from Candy Carson was not included in the string of emails.HUD chief of staff Sheila Greenwood sent an email Feb. 20, 2017, in which she suggested showing Candy Carson some furniture choices during a planned visit the following day.In a Facebook post last week, the Carsons denied allegations that they were responsible for the purchase of the $31,000 dining set. “I did not request new furniture, but asked if it could be remediated. I was subsequently told that it was beyond repair and needed to be replaced,” the post states. “I made it clear that I was not happy about the prices being charged and that my preference would be to find something more reasonable,” it continues. “I left this matter alone to concentrate on much bigger issues. I was as surprised as anyone to find out that a $31,000 dining set had been ordered.”It’s not clear whether anyone attempted to fix Carson’s office furniture. One email published by American Oversight indicates that HUD received an estimate that said fixing a chair would cost about $1,100.The emails show that Carson asked to see photos of previous secretaries’ offices, as well as to examine furniture being stored in a basement.Former HUD official Helen Foster filed a complaint with department’s special counsel late last year, in which she claimed she had been demoted because she raised concerns about the purchases. She said she argued that any redecorating efforts that cost more than $5,000 would require congressional notification.The newly published emails show she told fellow staffers about this concern. They also show that staffers discuss spending $24,666 on a collection of items, including a dining table, desk and chairs, despite that $5,000 limit. One email sent on Aug. 29, 2017, by Aida Rodriguez, an administrative officer in the secretary’s office, summarizes that $24,666 quote as “a very reasonable price,” adding “the funds are available.”"

20,POLITICS,Senators Rebuke EPA Plan To Let Kids Handle Pesticides Again,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senators-rebuke-epa-plan-to-let-kids-handle-pesticides-again_us_5aa943f5e4b0f7a689ce9b11,"If regulators remove the age restrictions, minors could work with pesticides that aren't even sold to the general public because of how toxic they are.",2018-03-14,Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt is considering rolling back age requirements to protect minors working in the agricultural industry. A group of senators is urging him not to.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa9444b1e00008e0b7aeaab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of 28 senators sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt on Tuesday urging him not to roll back restrictions on the use of dangerous pesticides by young workers.HuffPost first reported that EPA leadership was considering undoing age requirements put in place in 2015 to protect minors working in agriculture and other industries. Those rules required workers to be at least 18 years old if they are going to handle pesticides on farms or get certified to work with “restricted use” pesticides, such as arsenic and methyl bromide. RUPs, as they are known, are not sold to the general public because of how toxic they are.The EPA issued two notices in the Federal Register late last year indicating it might lower or do away with the age requirements implemented under former President Barack Obama. Public health groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics had called for the restrictions, pointing out that young teenagers aren’t mentally and emotionally sophisticated enough to evaluate the long-term risks of handling chemicals that could affect brain development. Many of the young workers on farms are also migrants who speak little English and may not understand their rights.In their letter, the 27 Democrats and one independent said “the lives of children and families across the country are at stake.”“These rules protect not only the workers that handle and are exposed to the pesticides, but also areas around agricultural land and the children who may incidentally come in contact with the pesticides,” they wrote.According to disclosure records, the American Farm Bureau lobbied Trump’s EPA on the rules after Obama’s EPA finalized them, suggesting they weren’t happy with the tighter regulations. Supporters of the age restrictions told HuffPost in January that growers probably want to remove them because work performed by minors tends to be cheaper than work done by adults. (The immediate family members of farm owners are already exempted from the rules so that children could still use pesticides on family farms.)So far, the Trump administration has repealed or stalled a host of workplace protections at the behest of employers, and the EPA has been one of the most aggressive agencies in wiping away Obama-era regulations. Before he came to run the agency, Pruitt sued the EPA 13 times as attorney general of Oklahoma. “I think that there’s a pretty strong likelihood that if the minimum age is eliminated or lowered, there will be more people getting sick,” William Jordan, a former EPA official who worked on developing the tighter pesticide rules, previously told HuffPost.In addition to the age minimums, regulators are also considering scrapping what’s known as the “right to know” provision of the pesticide rule. That stipulation guarantees that a farmworker can designate a third party, such as a lawyer, to obtain information from the grower about what chemicals the worker has been exposed to. Supporters of that provision suspect the farm lobby wants it scuttled to avoid litigation.Read the letter below:"

Like so many other newly developed areas of American cities, it is filled with glass-clad condos stretching dozens of stories into the sky.But as Osborne and I walk around, she points out what isn’t there: no Starbucks, no CVS, no Chase Bank. Instead, on the ground floor of Osborne’s building, there’s an independent coffee shop called Beechwood Cafe, a hair salon, a public school and Downtown Pharmacy ― where Osborne picks up a packet of jalapeño-flavored Mary’s Gone Crackers, her new favorite snack.“They don’t carry this kind of stuff at CVS,” she says. The 39-year-old digital strategist can also get an omelet with whatever she wants at Beechwood and treats for her dog, things she couldn’t grab at a Starbucks.“It’s little things,” she says. “But they’re indicative of the fact that they understand the neighborhood.”There is a reason for the absence of big chain stores, also known as formula businesses, in this part of Jersey City. In May 2015, the Jersey City Council ― with the help of Osborne, who was on the council at the time ― voted on an amendment to the city’s development code that in effect banned most chains from newly developed areas of the city. Unsurprisingly there was pushback, with pharmacy giant CVS threatening to sue the city after being denied the right to open a branch near Osborne’s building under the new rules. But the local residents and businesses I spoke to when visiting the area support the restrictions, saying they’ve been successful at helping keep out big business.The area certainly feels a lot less like a bedroom community and more like a neighborhood. On our 10-block walk around the Paulus Hook neighborhood, for example, we bumped into three people, all small-business owners, with whom Osborne is friendly.“It feels like a small town,” Terri Acosta, who owns Canine Canteen, tells us. “It’s like everybody knows each other.”I envy Osborne. I grew up directly across the Hudson River, in Manhattan’s West Village. There, nearly every independent business has been replaced by high-end chains, and I no longer know most of the people I used to interact with. It feels dead.Chain stores have taken over cities in the past few decades. In the 1980s, independent businesses ― defined as those with fewer than 10 locations ― accounted for about half the goods sold to Americans. Today that number has fallen to about one-quarter, according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR), which helps develop and lobby for policies that support strong local economies and challenges concentrated corporate power.As that number has declined, towns and cities have found innovative ways to push back, including through the kind of “formula business restrictions” implemented in Jersey City. Those guidelines limit the number of chain stores that can operate in a particular area.Jersey City’s restriction is limited: It applies only to newly redeveloped areas, and it still allows up to 30 percent of retail space to go to chains. But that doesn’t mean it hasn’t had an effect.Ariel Zaurov, who owns the two Downtown Pharmacies in Osborne’s neighborhood, believes he would likely be out of business without the protection. “When they passed the law, it was the first time I believed regular people could have a voice,” Zaurov says.Even Zaurov’s competitor Bellande Jean-Baptiste, who owns a smaller pharmacy a few blocks away in a part of the city not protected by the chain restriction, appreciates it.“CVS is a threat. They try to come in, buy out your patients, and then you go away or you go work for them,” he says. “I would rather have Ari, because we’re in the same predicament.” According to the ILSR, more than 30 municipalities have implemented formula business restrictions in the U.S. One of the big pioneers is San Francisco, where restrictions were enacted in 2004 and won the support of a public ballot measure in 2006. Chains are limited in nearly every neighborhood in the city apart from its downtown business district. And while the city’s rule doesn’t ban chains outright, it requires each one to go through an application process during which locals can voice their opinions and vote on whether the chain will add anything to the neighborhood. The city planning department gets a say too.“Let’s say it’s a Subway, and they want to come into a low-income neighborhood, and there are only expensive independent sandwich shops, then that [Subway] is serving a unique niche,” says AnMarie Rodgers, San Francisco’s director of citywide policy.While most of the chain applications end up being approved, the restrictions are still “very effective,” says Rodgers, in part because the application process deters chain businesses from applying to move in in the first place: A 2014 study found that only 12 percent of stores in San Francisco are chains, compared with 32 percent nationally.Norma Garcia, policy director at the Mission Economic Development Agency, grew up in the historically Latino and now rapidly gentrifying Mission neighborhood of San Francisco.“If you don’t leave San Francisco, you don’t realize how homogenous the rest of the world is,” she says. “If you leave, you see mall after mall, and realize what a wonderful city [San Francisco] is, and that’s because people have taken care to protect it.”However, there may be some unintended consequences of the restriction. Sean Quigley, president of local neighborhood group Valencia Corridor Merchants Association, says that while it has helped keep chains out, rents are still rapidly rising, so businesses are skewing toward serving the wealthy.Tom Angotti, a professor of urban planning and policy at Hunter College, agrees formula business restrictions are not a panacea, especially for small businesses that serve lower-income residents.“U.S. cities have very little planning for commercial establishments,” he says. “All they do is zone enormous swaths of the city and let the chips fall where they may. They leave it to the market.”Angotti says urban planning departments could exert more control over exactly what kinds of businesses go into any given commercial space, or allow local communities more of a say over which businesses are allowed to move in and which are not. Commercial rent control ― i.e., limiting the amount landlords can charge tenants ― could also help, he adds.According to Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the ILSR, chains often win out over local businesses not only because they can afford more rent but also because banks will often finance lease deals only with companies they know, and big real estate firms will often approach only chain tenants to fill vacant spaces. Still, Mitchell believes formula business restrictions can go a long way toward keeping small businesses alive. “There are all these complicated things going on behind the scenes with bank financing and commercial brokers that disadvantage independent businesses, and [these restrictions] can help rebalance the market a little,” Mitchell says. “And rebalancing that market can have a big effect.”For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.

23,IMPACT,Chain Stores Are Taking Over U.S. Cities. It Doesn't Have To Be Like This.,"Peter Moskowitz, On Assignment For HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/local-business-jersey-city-chain-stores_us_5aa1a7e7e4b01b9b0a3986ea,This New Jersey neighborhood refuses to be overrun by Starbucks and CVS.,2018-03-14,Empty storefronts in a West Village neighborhood in New York City.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa1beff1e000008087adf06.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you’re not looking for it, you might not notice what makes Candice Osborne’s Jersey City neighborhood different. Like so many other newly developed areas of American cities, it is filled with glass-clad condos stretching dozens of stories into the sky.But as Osborne and I walk around, she points out what isn’t there: no Starbucks, no CVS, no Chase Bank. Instead, on the ground floor of Osborne’s building, there’s an independent coffee shop called Beechwood Cafe, a hair salon, a public school and Downtown Pharmacy ― where Osborne picks up a packet of jalapeño-flavored Mary’s Gone Crackers, her new favorite snack.“They don’t carry this kind of stuff at CVS,” she says. The 39-year-old digital strategist can also get an omelet with whatever she wants at Beechwood and treats for her dog, things she couldn’t grab at a Starbucks.“It’s little things,” she says. “But they’re indicative of the fact that they understand the neighborhood.”There is a reason for the absence of big chain stores, also known as formula businesses, in this part of Jersey City. In May 2015, the Jersey City Council ― with the help of Osborne, who was on the council at the time ― voted on an amendment to the city’s development code that in effect banned most chains from newly developed areas of the city. Unsurprisingly there was pushback, with pharmacy giant CVS threatening to sue the city after being denied the right to open a branch near Osborne’s building under the new rules. But the local residents and businesses I spoke to when visiting the area support the restrictions, saying they’ve been successful at helping keep out big business.The area certainly feels a lot less like a bedroom community and more like a neighborhood. On our 10-block walk around the Paulus Hook neighborhood, for example, we bumped into three people, all small-business owners, with whom Osborne is friendly.“It feels like a small town,” Terri Acosta, who owns Canine Canteen, tells us. “It’s like everybody knows each other.”I envy Osborne. I grew up directly across the Hudson River, in Manhattan’s West Village. There, nearly every independent business has been replaced by high-end chains, and I no longer know most of the people I used to interact with. It feels dead.Chain stores have taken over cities in the past few decades. In the 1980s, independent businesses ― defined as those with fewer than 10 locations ― accounted for about half the goods sold to Americans. Today that number has fallen to about one-quarter, according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR), which helps develop and lobby for policies that support strong local economies and challenges concentrated corporate power.As that number has declined, towns and cities have found innovative ways to push back, including through the kind of “formula business restrictions” implemented in Jersey City. Those guidelines limit the number of chain stores that can operate in a particular area.Jersey City’s restriction is limited: It applies only to newly redeveloped areas, and it still allows up to 30 percent of retail space to go to chains. But that doesn’t mean it hasn’t had an effect.Ariel Zaurov, who owns the two Downtown Pharmacies in Osborne’s neighborhood, believes he would likely be out of business without the protection. “When they passed the law, it was the first time I believed regular people could have a voice,” Zaurov says.Even Zaurov’s competitor Bellande Jean-Baptiste, who owns a smaller pharmacy a few blocks away in a part of the city not protected by the chain restriction, appreciates it.“CVS is a threat. They try to come in, buy out your patients, and then you go away or you go work for them,” he says. “I would rather have Ari, because we’re in the same predicament.” According to the ILSR, more than 30 municipalities have implemented formula business restrictions in the U.S. One of the big pioneers is San Francisco, where restrictions were enacted in 2004 and won the support of a public ballot measure in 2006. Chains are limited in nearly every neighborhood in the city apart from its downtown business district. And while the city’s rule doesn’t ban chains outright, it requires each one to go through an application process during which locals can voice their opinions and vote on whether the chain will add anything to the neighborhood. The city planning department gets a say too.“Let’s say it’s a Subway, and they want to come into a low-income neighborhood, and there are only expensive independent sandwich shops, then that [Subway] is serving a unique niche,” says AnMarie Rodgers, San Francisco’s director of citywide policy.While most of the chain applications end up being approved, the restrictions are still “very effective,” says Rodgers, in part because the application process deters chain businesses from applying to move in in the first place: A 2014 study found that only 12 percent of stores in San Francisco are chains, compared with 32 percent nationally.Norma Garcia, policy director at the Mission Economic Development Agency, grew up in the historically Latino and now rapidly gentrifying Mission neighborhood of San Francisco.“If you don’t leave San Francisco, you don’t realize how homogenous the rest of the world is,” she says. “If you leave, you see mall after mall, and realize what a wonderful city [San Francisco] is, and that’s because people have taken care to protect it.”However, there may be some unintended consequences of the restriction. Sean Quigley, president of local neighborhood group Valencia Corridor Merchants Association, says that while it has helped keep chains out, rents are still rapidly rising, so businesses are skewing toward serving the wealthy.Tom Angotti, a professor of urban planning and policy at Hunter College, agrees formula business restrictions are not a panacea, especially for small businesses that serve lower-income residents.“U.S. cities have very little planning for commercial establishments,” he says. “All they do is zone enormous swaths of the city and let the chips fall where they may. They leave it to the market.”Angotti says urban planning departments could exert more control over exactly what kinds of businesses go into any given commercial space, or allow local communities more of a say over which businesses are allowed to move in and which are not. Commercial rent control ― i.e., limiting the amount landlords can charge tenants ― could also help, he adds.According to Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the ILSR, chains often win out over local businesses not only because they can afford more rent but also because banks will often finance lease deals only with companies they know, and big real estate firms will often approach only chain tenants to fill vacant spaces. Still, Mitchell believes formula business restrictions can go a long way toward keeping small businesses alive. “There are all these complicated things going on behind the scenes with bank financing and commercial brokers that disadvantage independent businesses, and [these restrictions] can help rebalance the market a little,” Mitchell says. “And rebalancing that market can have a big effect.”For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.

On Sunday, it said it would begin to provide “rigorous firearms training” to schoolteachers and other school personnel who volunteer to be armed. The administration also formally endorsed a bill to tighten the federal background checks system.Consider this: In response to a HuffPost report on a 25-year-old social studies teacher who had been secretly hosting a white nationalist podcast and bragging about teaching her views the classroom, dozens of readers pointed out this teacher is a perfect example of why teachers shouldn’t be armed. That last sentiment by Daily Kos’ Wagatwe Wanjuki is highly important to note.Previously, DeVos has said she believes many historically black colleges and universities, which were formed in response to systemic discrimination, were a great example of “school choice.” She is also a staunch supporter of private school choice programs, where students learn Christian fundamentalist doctrine and leave with “racist, sexist and intolerant views of the world.” She has also been the impetus for an upswing in activism within teachers over the last year. One advocacy group countering her policies, the Network for Public Education, saw membership shoot up to 330,000 members, compared to 22,000 members before DeVos was nominated."
25,POLITICS,Libertarian Candidate Embraces His Role As Spoiler In Pennsylvania Election,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drew-miller-libertarian-spoiler-special-election_us_5aa98129e4b0600b82ffaa03,Drew Miller says he's the most hated man in America.,2018-03-14,"Drew Gray Miller, a Libertarian candidate in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, faces accusations that he ""spoiled"" Republican Rick Saccone's chances.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa9827a1e00008e0b7aeb39.jpeg?cache=jW7A7CodGz&ops=crop_7_82_1141_866%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Until Tuesday night, Drew Gray Miller, the Libertarian candidate for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District, was treated like an afterthought by Democrats, Republicans and most news outlets.Miller jumped through numerous bureaucratic hoops just to get his name on the ballot. His $2,000 campaign haul was below the threshold requiring him to report it to the Federal Election Commission but just enough for some social media outreach to his target demographic of high school seniors and college students. Thanks to a January story in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the best-known fact about the south Pittsburgh energy lawyer seemed to be that he lived outside the district’s boundaries. He was not invited to the televised candidate debates, and on Election Day he was still publicly pestering CNN, which he had provided with a photo of himself, to mention him as one of the choices on the ballot. Then the election results came in. Miller had received 0.6 percent of the vote ― accounting for far more than the 0.2 percentage point lead Democrat Conor Lamb ended up holding over Republican Rick Saccone at the end of the night. (Lamb has declared victory, but Saccone is challenging the results.)Suddenly Miller was the man of the hour, as pundits discovered that Miller’s candidacy might have cost Saccone the race.When CNN finally flashed Miller’s photo on screen, his 20-person election watch party at Fat Head’s Saloon erupted in cheers. They high-fived one another and took selfies in front of the TV as the party took a rowdier turn.“I wouldn’t call it a Cinderella story. But this is what the founders of our country wanted ― for an average person to run for Congress who’s not backed by anybody financially,” Miller told HuffPost.Miller embraced the “spoiler” moniker on Twitter, gleefully predicting late Tuesday that he would soon be the “most hated man in America.”But he rejects the underlying premise that any one candidate can be an actual spoiler.“No candidate is entitled to somebody’s vote. You have to earn somebody’s vote,” he said. “If you have to silence a third-party candidate because your candidate cannot win otherwise, that tells me that you either have a crappy candidate or a crappy message. And in the case of Lamb and Saccone, it’s probably both.”For now, though, Miller appreciates the “notoriety” that comes with the label, he said. “This idea that I’m a spoiler or I took votes away from somebody essentially is ridiculous, but as long as it’s getting me media coverage, I’m not going to argue with it.”It’s attention that he hopes to use to spread the Libertarian gospel of individual liberty in all facets of life, including freedom from high taxes, marijuana prohibition and an overbearing surveillance state.Ironically, up until Election Day, most of the emails Miller got from district political activists came from Democrats who were adamant that he would scuttle Lamb’s chances at victory.And there is not yet any available evidence that the people who voted for Miller would not have opted for Lamb ― or stayed home ― had Miller not been on the ballot.Miller, 37, lives with his wife, Terri Butler, in south Pittsburgh. They have a French bulldog named Mugsy, and a chug (Chihuahua-pug mix) named Frankie.Miller grew up in the northern suburb of Hampton, where he gradually identified more with the Republican views of his father than the Democratic leanings of his mother. However, a stint on the staff of then-state Sen. Jane Orie (R) several years ago soured him on the two-party system. In 2010, Orie was charged with theft and other criminal violations for using taxpayer resources on her sister’s campaign for state Supreme Court justice. Miller had to testify against her.On the face of it, the Libertarian combination of social liberalism and fiscal conservatism does not have a natural constituency in the largely Roman Catholic, union-heavy 18th District. Lamb, for example, thrived with a message that was in some ways the inverse of Libertarianism, pairing economic populism with moderation on social issues.Miller emphasizes that he is a “pragmatic” Libertarian, however. He backs having the government make birth control free and provide housing for homeless people, because he is convinced that the policies are empirically proven to save money over the long term.And while he considers Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” and is “not thrilled” with the idea of Medicare, he realizes that immediately eliminating them would be a disaster. He prefers “weaning people off” of the social insurance programs.Miller is not sure what his next step is. Libertarian activists want him to run for the state legislature.Thanks to court-ordered redistricting, Miller’s home will be in the new 18th District in the November midterm election. He might decide to challenge Pittsburgh’s veteran Rep. Mike Doyle, a popular progressive Democrat in his eighth term in Congress.For now, though, he is just happy to have landed even the slightest of blows against the dominance of the two major political parties.“If you go into the voting booth and you’re upset with the Republicans and you vote Democrat, what you’re doing is rewarding bad behavior,” he said. “If you want to send a real message to Washington, the only way to do that is to vote for a third-party Libertarian candidate.”"

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andrew-mccabe-trump-fbi_us_5aa958b4e4b0004c040691f6,"Andrew McCabe's pension would be in question if Jeff Sessions fires him before Sunday, his official retirement date.",2018-03-14,"FBI acting Director Andrew McCabe speaks during a news conference, July 20, 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa959181f0000180316a5a7.jpeg?cache=rUHtrHqk94&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Andrew McCabe, who took over as acting head of the FBI after President Donald Trump fired former Director James Comey last year, may soon be fired by the Trump administration just ahead of his formal retirement date on Sunday, putting his pension in peril after more than two decades at the bureau.McCabe ― a lifelong Republican ― has a strained relationship with the president. Trump has complained about the Democratic political affiliation of McCabe’s wife, and criticized his oversight of FBI investigations into Hillary Clinton.Trump has pressured Attorney General Jeff Sessions ― another frequent target of Trump’s wrath ― to get rid of McCabe. As first reported Wednesday by The New York Times, Sessions is now reviewing a recommendation to fire McCabe for alleged lack of candor in his discussions with the Justice Department’s inspector general in the course of an investigation into how the Justice Department and the FBI handled the Clinton investigation.Trump’s statements about McCabe put pressure on Sessions to fire him, and would create an appearance of impropriety even if Sessions’ decision to fire McCabe were backed by a formal recommendation. The Justice Department said no formal decision has been made on McCabe’s fate.“The Department follows a prescribed process by which an employee may be terminated,” Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. “That process includes recommendations from career employees and no termination decision is final until the conclusion of that process. We have no personnel announcements at this time.”Reporters had been chasing down leads about McCabe’s fate in the past few days as he approached his official retirement date. McCabe formally stepped down from his position at the end of January, but was using accrued leave to carry him past his official retirement date of March 18.While Trump has suggested that McCabe was a Clinton supporter, the justification for firing him ― ironically ― has to do with a decision he made that was damaging to Clinton and Obama appointees in the Justice Department.In 2016, McCabe evidently authorized a top aide and the FBI’s chief spokesman to speak with a Wall Street Journal reporter for a story indicating that McCabe battled with Obama appointees within the Justice Department to allow an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation to continue. The FBI isn’t supposed to disclose information about ongoing criminal investigations, but the Oct. 30, 2016, story went into an extraordinary level of detail about turf wars between the FBI and the Justice Department over the handling of the Clinton Foundation probe.That article came on the heels of a Wall Street Journal story suggesting ― to McCabe’s displeasure ― that McCabe had a conflict of interest because his wife’s political campaign had received money from groups tied to Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe. The chat with then-Wall Street Journal reporter Devlin Barrett was evidently intended to push back on the suggestion that McCabe was in Clinton’s pocket. The chat was referenced in text messages between two FBI employees that Republicans, as well as The Hill’s John Solomon and conservative media outlets, attempted to use to imply the FBI was leaking to hurt Trump ahead of the election.In reality, the FBI’s actions ahead of the election indisputably harmed Clinton. DOJ’s inspector general is conducting a broader investigation of the FBI’s handling of the Clinton probe that is expected to examine Comey’s actions.The IG’s findings on McCabe ― issued in a separate report ― started up the internal disciplinary process at the FBI. McCabe declined to comment through a spokesperson. A representative of the inspector general’s office declined to comment when reached by HuffPost this week, and the office has generally been tight-lipped about the forthcoming reports.But their decision to issue a separate report focusing solely on McCabe is somewhat unusual, and has enabled Sessions to take disciplinary action before McCabe’s retirement date, if he chooses.McCabe and his attorney recently signed nondisclosure agreements that allowed them to read the results of the investigation but banned them from discussing its contents.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

29,POLITICS,A Different Kind Of Gender Gap: 7 Places Where Women Earn More Than Men,"Stateline, Editorial Partner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-different-kind-of-gender-gap-seven-places-where_us_5aa96b69e4b00a0ab2f587f2,"By Tim Henderson CHAMBLEE, Ga. — This Atlanta suburb is a lot like other metropolitan suburbs around the country. A manufacturing",2018-03-14,"<p>Lindsey Cambardella, CEO of a translation and interpretation company in Chamblee, Georgia, one of the few cities where women make more than men. She earns more than her husband, who is Atlanta’s director of urban agriculture.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa96ba3200000d50ceb1e85.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Tim HendersonCHAMBLEE, Ga. — This Atlanta suburb is a lot like other metropolitan suburbs around the country. A manufacturing economy is giving way to new apartments and tech enterprises built around a quick commute to Atlanta.And as in other communities, there’s a measurable pay gap between its working men and women. But there’s something different about Chamblee: Here it’s the women who earn the higher wages, typically $1.37 for every dollar brought home by a man.That’s astonishing in a country where — nearly universally and in nearly all of the 2,700 locations reviewed by Stateline — men earn more than women. Nationally, the pay gap is wide: Women still earn less than 80 cents for every dollar men take home.Of the 2,700 locations in the United States with more than 10,000 workers, Stateline found, there are just six municipalities and one county that flip the script in a statistically significant way.A Stateline review of census data on earnings across the country found that women also make more in Lake Worth, Florida; the cities of Plainfield and Trenton in New Jersey; Inglewood, California; the village of Hempstead on Long Island, New York; and the Washington, D.C., suburb of Prince George’s County, Maryland.Most are diverse suburbs in large metro areas. All are majority-minority, and many have low-income neighborhoods as well as the economic benefits of proximity to vibrant cities.The reasons for the pay differences are complex and uncertain: Pay may be relatively higher for young millennial women who have landed jobs in big cities and found affordable housing in commuter suburbs such as these. And the communities’ high numbers of single male laborers, many of whom are immigrants working without documentation, can also hold down male income, which makes female income relatively higher.But there are also some hopeful signs for all women in these places: Women in Chamblee, for instance, earn more than women in the Atlanta area as a whole, and out-earn men in some lucrative, male-dominated fields, such as computers and engineering, with the help of female business entrepreneurs sensitive to the need for flexibility to attend to family responsibilities.In Chamblee, one of those women is Lindsey Cambardella, an attorney who grew up in the area and yearned to run a business. She applied last year for her dream job, running a national language interpretation and translation firm. She was married, in her 30s, with no kids — and worried about that impression.“I was very up front,” Cambardella recalled recently. “I said, ‘I’m planning to have children — and soon. I don’t want you to have any surprises.’”Fortunately, the business owner was also a woman, one who had built the firm up by herself over 20 years after a career in sales and state government, while also raising a son.“She immediately shot back: ‘That doesn’t scare me at all,’” Cambardella, 34, recalled. “I think I was lucky in that she was open-minded and not worried about it.”Cambardella now makes more than her husband, an urban landscape architect who took a step down in pay recently to take a job with the city of Atlanta.Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University economist, argued in a 2015 paper that more flexible hours would go a long way toward solving the gender pay gap, which she said is often caused in part by women working fewer hours and stopping work at times, often to raise children.That’s one reason Shear Structural, an engineering firm started by three women in Chamblee, prioritizes flexibility, said co-founder Malory Atkinson.“They say a lot more women study STEM fields than actually end up working in it,” she said, “so we’re very cognizant of that, and we do whatever it takes to be accommodating.”The gender pay gap is especially wide for women with children and women who are married (because employers suspect they will have children). Men, by contrast, tend to get paid more after marriage based on the assumption it will make them more ambitious.“Marriage adds a premium to a man’s income, and it’s a drag on women’s income,” said Ariane Hegewisch, study director for the Institute for Women’s Policy Research in Washington.More Men in Low-Paying JobsBut the reason women make more than men in the seven places on Stateline’s list is not entirely a reflection of their own success. Many of the places on the list have low-wage male workers, often unauthorized immigrants, and that alone can bring down the median male wage to a point where it is lower than that of women.“All low-paying jobs have similar pay for all,” Goldin said. “If everyone got the minimum wage, then the gaps would disappear.”In Chamblee, a city shared by professionals commuting to Atlanta and immigrants working locally, women make more than the typical Atlanta metro worker, but men make far less.Yet even in this town, the gender pay gap that exists between people working in the same professions still tends to favor men.A majority of Chamblee’s female employees work in management, science and arts jobs, where their typical pay is about $57,000 — less than men working in the same fields. Women make more than men in the city as a whole, across professions, because immigrant men working in low-paying service or labor jobs bring down the median pay for men.Chamblee has long been a destination for immigrants. The city has a dense housing district called “the Triangle” where Chinese and other Asian immigrants once lived and worked in nearby factories. Asian institutions and restaurants remain, and the name “Chinatown” is still on many facades — but most of the factories have closed, and the city’s immigrants are now mostly men from Latin America.Most men in Chamblee work in service jobs, construction, factories or moving and shipping jobs, where they typically earn $20,000 to $25,000 a year, the equivalent of $10 to $12 an hour.Census data shows that Chamblee’s immigrants are mostly from Mexico and Guatemala, and those who are not citizens are predominantly men, by a nearly 2-1 ratio.Those men typically arrive alone in their 20s, work for three to five years, and go back home to enjoy the money they’ve saved, said Julio Penaranda, who manages Plaza Fiesta, a Hispanic-themed shopping center in Chamblee.“Their earning potential is very limited,” he said, “because these workers are unskilled and undocumented.”Diversity and High IncomeAnother reason women might earn more than men in some predominantly black suburbs, like Prince George’s County along with Trenton, New Jersey, and Inglewood, California — is that black women tend to be better educated than black men, said Nicole Smith, chief economist at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce and co-author of the center’s 2018 report on the pay gap.Prince George’s County has only a modest boost for women’s pay at 103.5 percent of men’s earnings. But it’s the only county on the list and by far the most populous area, with about 900,000 residents.Tonia Wellons, 46, lives comfortably there, in a 3,200-square-foot home in Upper Marlboro. Wellons is a vice president at the Greater Washington Community Foundation, and has held high-ranking positions in the Peace Corps and at the World Bank.She makes “a little more” than her husband, Lyndon Joseph, an electrician with his own home improvement business. They have four children, including one in college.Wellons said many of her neighbors moved there from neighboring Washington, D.C., in search of a more serene setting to raise children. The county is known for its prosperous black community — it has by far the highest household income, about $76,000, of any majority-black county. The second is DeKalb County, Georgia, where Chamblee is located.Some of the factors that stand out in Prince George’s County: a large minority population and a lot of people who work for the federal government, which has civil service rules that discourage discrimination in hiring and promotions.Nationally the pay gap between black and Hispanic women and men of the same group is smaller than that between white women and white men, according to census data. White women earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by white men, and a gender gap exists across all racial groups.Prince George’s has the third-most full-time federal workers — about 65,000 — of any county in the nation, more than half of whom are women. Another 32,000 residents work for nonprofits, and two-thirds of them are women too, including Wellons.The importance of federal and other government employment is clear, said several experts on pay inequity.The fact that all seven places are majority-minority is harder to explain.Race alone is not enough to explain why women make more in some majority-minority communities, Hegewisch of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research said.“The few places with no gap or reverse gap do tend to be urban and majority-minority,” said Kevin Miller, senior researcher at American Association of University Women. “What’s happening there is that white men, the group with the most disproportionately high salaries, are more absent from those areas.”Wellons has a theory about why racially diverse areas may see more equity in pay by gender.“There’s more [racial] equity here. There really is. I can feel it,” she said. “Maybe racial equity encourages other kind of equity too.”What Now?Working to reduce the pay gap is an ongoing issue for women, even in those communities where overall they make more compared with men.Wellons got her first lesson in pay discrimination in one of her first jobs out of graduate school 20 years ago. She learned that a male colleague with the same job and qualifications was making $7,000 a year more.“Back then, that was significant. I was making $27,000 and he was making $34,000. So it was a lot,” Wellons said. She approached her bosses, who argued with her and threatened to invite others to apply for her job as a test of its market value, but she prevailed and got the raise.In her career, she said, she’s also been surprised at the difference between male and female attitudes toward pay. At the World Bank, she spent years negotiating pay for new hires.“Men always wanted to negotiate,” she said. “The women would just say, ‘Thank you.’ They were so happy to be offered fair pay.” Women don’t negotiate for their own pay as aggressively as men, said Hegewisch, but that’s partly because they’re judged more harshly than men for doing so.“When women do negotiate as assertively as men,” she said, “they do not get the same results.”In Chamblee, Cambardella said she was surprised that a male family friend with a good job negotiated when he was offered a raise a few weeks ago.“I would have just said ‘Thank you!’” she said. “He said, ‘Oh I have a different figure in mind.’”Cherlee Rohling, a 28-year-old Chamblee resident who is engaged to be married, said she thinks the pay gap sometimes favors young women because they’ve had to work hard for the success they get. An operations manager for a manufacturer, she makes more than her fiance.“Women have had to start working 10 times harder than men, and we don’t give up,” Rohling said. “I’m sure I make more than some men, but not because of youth — because I’m a hard worker.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

But don’t let superficial differences between Gwyneth Paltrow and Wayne LaPierre fool you. Members of their respective communities are actually seeking the same kind of existential comfort: safety and security in a fallen, dangerous world, where the only person you can really count on is yourself. Whether it’s wielding a weapon to protect your family against home invaders or taking natural supplements to protect your body against invasive toxins, the allure of the fantasy is identical — and it explains the profound appeal of both when empirical evidence doesn’t.I’ve spent the last four years studying how people end up believing in a range of medical pseudoscience, including reversing cancer with a raw vegan diet and avoiding vaccines in favor of homeopathic medicine.

Their discontents metastasize rapidly, eventually causing severe emotional pain that demands to be addressed. This process is often catalyzed by tragedy — a devastating medical diagnosis in oneself or a loved one — and the realization that standard approaches can’t guarantee a solution. As a consequence, the afflicted immerse themselves in personal narratives of redemption outside mainstream medicine, which come paired with reassuringly detailed instructions on how to defend yourself against suffering when the authorities can’t, or won’t, help.The result is what I call an “empowering epistemology”: a way to make sense of the world based not on the best possible evidence but rather on the evidence that gives you the strongest feeling of control. The communities that embrace it share some structural features with archaic aspects of traditional religion: Like-minded people gather and testify to the power of their rituals and talismans, be they “empowering coconut oil” or energy crystals. The power is all the more real for being denied by “conventional” wisdom.I’ve always associated this way of thinking with medical pseudoscience, so I was shocked to see textbook signs of it in the least likely place: a recent essay on gun culture for The Atlantic by the conservative writer David French. Then, less than a week later, I saw those same signs in a New York Times op-ed, “I Wanted to Be A Good Mom. So I Got A Gun,” by Bethany Mandel. A visit to the magazine section of my local Barnes and Noble confirmed it: Gun culture and wellness culture are both built on an empowering belief system.***French and Mandel open their explanations of gun culture with stories of personal trauma. In his essay, French tells readers that his wife was a victim of sexual abuse and that his family has received multiple threats. In her op-ed, Mandel recalls a spate of burglaries in her neighborhood just after her father left her home, when she was only 3 years old. Were they writing about wellness culture, the stories might have described the sudden onset of chronic pain or an autism diagnosis. French generalizes the power of these experiences perfectly: “It starts with the consciousness of a threat. Perhaps not the kind of threat my family has experienced. Some people experience more. Some less. And some people don’t experience a threat at all — but they’re aware of those who do. With the consciousness of a threat comes the awareness of a vulnerability.” It’s how Dante’s archetypal tale of redemption begins: In the middle of our life’s journey, I found myself in a dark wood.The need for empowerment comes from a place of intense disempowerment, and the rhetoric of gun culture, like that of wellness culture, reinforces it with endless terrifying anecdotes. “We all know someone whose home has been violated,” reads a typical article in Recoil magazine. “We see stories on the news with increasing frequency about families being brutalized by home invaders.” Once you’ve heard enough of those stories, even experienced them yourself, the conclusion is inevitable. “There are evil men in this world, and sometimes they wish to do you harm,” says French grimly. Whereas wellness magazines emphasize an environment polluted by toxins, gun culture emphasizes souls polluted by evil. In both cases, the magnitude of real dangers is exaggerated far beyond the evidence by showcasing anecdotes instead of data.These anecdotes are a key part of any empowering epistemology. Does the establishment say vaccine-related illness is rare? It’s harder to believe that when you’ve heard how your friends’ child fell sick after being immunized. Are there no natural alternatives to chemotherapy? Websites list countless personal testimonials to the contrary.Studies about the inefficacy of guns as protective measures are overcome in the same way. In Mandel’s essay, she tells the story of her “heroic mother” driving away a home intruder with a gun and uses it to undermine official studies. “Our incident won’t show up in the statistics about gun use in self-defense scenarios. I doubt my mother ever reported it to the police.” Likewise, French argues that one’s opinions on guns are shaped by personal experiences and stories shared by members of the in-group, which are far more important than “any study.”In both communities, the rejection of data and statistics is tied to a broader suspicion of established authority. French can’t imagine relying on a sometimes “shockingly incompetent government” for his family’s security (“the police can only protect the people you love in the most limited of circumstances”). Mandel slams federal law enforcement as “bearing some responsibility” for mass shootings. The parallel in the medical world is unscrupulous physicians and government regulators in the pocket of Big Pharma who can’t be trusted with our health — just look at the opioid epidemic. No matter that the NRA actively suppressed federal research on gun danger. No matter that “natural” supplement companies lobby to exempt themselves from the same regulations that apply to pharmaceuticals, just as guns are the only product that cannot be recalled by the government if they’re defective. The supposed downsides of these exceptions are likely to be mainstream disinformation. The only people you can really trust are your friends, and yourself. It’s no coincidence that the word “empowerment” is ubiquitous in wellness culture and gun culture. When you are dedicated to an empowering epistemology, the ability to secure your life needs to be in your hands, not someone else’s. “In our house we saw [guns] as tools of protection and empowerment,” writes Mandel. Her words echo French, who explains succinctly: “People want to be empowered. That’s how gun culture is built.”Once you want to be empowered, cultural ambassadors are ready to meet your needs. Physicians may not have time for your life history; they may not be sympathetic to your fear of toxins. But alternative medicine practitioners tend to be empathic listeners, with ample time and openness to a wide range of therapies. They will talk you through a multifaceted approach to wellness that puts you in charge, and they will be extremely confident in its success rates. The same is true for gun store owners. “The first thing you’ll notice — and I’ve seen this without fail,” says French, “is that the person behind that counter is ready to listen. They want to hear your experience. They’ll share their own. They’ll point you immediately to a potential solution.” Suddenly you’re on your way to conquering those existential fears with no more than a kind ear, a few new purchases and a detailed plan of action.That plan of action is key, because it functions as a script in safety fantasies. When the thought of an imminent threat makes you feel vulnerable — cancer, an intruder — you can mentally rehearse the steps you’ll take to ward it off. Mandel’s story of her heroic mother using a gun to ward off a burglar becomes your own story; the guns themselves become talismans of protection. “Your thought-process starts to change,” as French puts it, and that change is exhilarating. No longer are you a helpless victim “dependent on the state for your personal security.” You don’t need doctors, or the police. You have your empowering narrative and the props to act it out.The importance of this narrative cannot be overstated — it is completely transformative. French describes it in language reminiscent of religious conversion: “Your life has changed for the better. Your community has expanded to include people you truly like, who’ve perhaps helped you through a tough time in your life, and you treasure these relationships. You feel a sense of burning conviction that you, your family, and your community are safer and freer because you own and carry a gun.”It’s easy to see why gun owners are so angered, and threatened, by the rhetoric of gun control advocates. Owning a gun for self-defense springs from a deep-seated desire to protect yourself and your family, no different from the motivations of parents who reject vaccines or try unproven experimental stem cell therapies. Yet detractors call you a murderer, a terrorist, an idiot, someone who wants children to die. They label you the villain and threaten to force you into vaccination or giving up your guns. But those aspects of your life are the keystone in the architecture of your security, your personal identity — they define you not as a villain but as a hero. “Support for gun rights is motivated precisely by our devotion to protecting our kids,” says Mandel. Why can’t others see that?***In a 1993 advertisement that is either comedic or profoundly chilling, depending on who you are, Mel Gibson hides in his kitchen clutching a bottle of vitamin C as armed government agents swarm the premises. “The federal government is actually considering classifying most vitamins and other supplements as drugs,” warns the ad. “Could raids on individual homes be next?” The melodrama will seem absurd to anyone who doesn’t depend on supplements for talismanic protection. But in light of the anxieties just beneath the surface of an empowering epistemology, it makes perfect sense. It’s as if the government were trying to regulate your religion. Or maybe it’s more than that, since concealed weapons and nutritional supplements become a literal extension of yourself: It’s as if the government were trying to regulate your body.Wellness culture and gun culture exploit truths for their persuasiveness. Guns really do save some people’s lives, and certain aspects of wellness culture are legitimate ways to improve health. There’s no denying that the medical establishment has serious flaws, as does law enforcement, and the world is filled with danger and tragedy. But both of these cultures exaggerate the extent of the problems, overstate their ability to help and distract us from the root causes. Economic and social injustice is a far greater threat to people’s health than medical error or malfeasance — just as it is by far the greatest risk factor in gun violence — but this does not fit neatly into an empowering epistemology. Nor does it fit to acknowledge that friends and family are more likely to attack you than some random home invader and that no matter how well-trained you are with guns or how securely you store them, those precautions won’t save you from using one to kill yourself if you’re depressed.But once you understand the foundations of gun culture, it becomes obvious that statistics won’t convince anyone to give up an AR-15 purchased for home defense. That gun is part of a larger set of beliefs and rituals that, in French’s words, make “you feel more ‘free’ than you’ve ever felt before.” Without them you feel scared, helpless and dependent. Moreover, these beliefs and rituals are sustained by anecdotes, community and personal experience, not logic and establishment statistics.Instead, the best approach is the one that pediatricians and other experts have laid out for dealing with vaccine hesitancy. First, don’t vilify. Like parents who are hesitant to vaccinate, gun owners are genuinely trying to be good parents, and good citizens — dismissing them as irrational and dangerous will only serve to alienate them. Second, lead by listening. “Attentiveness to parents’ concerns is important,” notes the American Academy of Pediatrics in its clinical report on countering vaccine hesitancy. This is the best way to earn trust and respect, especially when engaging with someone who feels threatened and disempowered. Lastly, make sure to acknowledge gun owners as a diverse community of individuals, each with their own story and reasons for behaving the way they do. Talking about “gun nuts,” like talking about “anti-vaxxers,” is counterproductive. It reinforces us-vs.-them, which makes it difficult to reach persuadable members of each culture, further cementing their loyalty to a community that provides affirmation instead of condemnation.I still get incensed when I see NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch shilling for guns (or for some new superfood). It scares me that people take her seriously, whether about AR-15s or about SuperBeets. But I also understand that those people are trapped by their need for an empowering epistemology. They’re scared, too, probably even more scared than I am. Any effort to make the world safer, for all of us, has to begin there — with the fear at the heart of gun culture and with the faith-like structures built around that fear.

No matter that “natural” supplement companies lobby to exempt themselves from the same regulations that apply to pharmaceuticals, just as guns are the only product that cannot be recalled by the government if they’re defective. The supposed downsides of these exceptions are likely to be mainstream disinformation. The only people you can really trust are your friends, and yourself. It’s no coincidence that the word “empowerment” is ubiquitous in wellness culture and gun culture. When you are dedicated to an empowering epistemology, the ability to secure your life needs to be in your hands, not someone else’s. “In our house we saw [guns] as tools of protection and empowerment,” writes Mandel. Her words echo French, who explains succinctly: “People want to be empowered. That’s how gun culture is built.”Once you want to be empowered, cultural ambassadors are ready to meet your needs. Physicians may not have time for your life history; they may not be sympathetic to your fear of toxins. But alternative medicine practitioners tend to be empathic listeners, with ample time and openness to a wide range of therapies. They will talk you through a multifaceted approach to wellness that puts you in charge, and they will be extremely confident in its success rates. The same is true for gun store owners. “The first thing you’ll notice — and I’ve seen this without fail,” says French, “is that the person behind that counter is ready to listen. They want to hear your experience. They’ll share their own. They’ll point you immediately to a potential solution.” Suddenly you’re on your way to conquering those existential fears with no more than a kind ear, a few new purchases and a detailed plan of action.That plan of action is key, because it functions as a script in safety fantasies. When the thought of an imminent threat makes you feel vulnerable — cancer, an intruder — you can mentally rehearse the steps you’ll take to ward it off. Mandel’s story of her heroic mother using a gun to ward off a burglar becomes your own story; the guns themselves become talismans of protection. “Your thought-process starts to change,” as French puts it, and that change is exhilarating. No longer are you a helpless victim “dependent on the state for your personal security.” You don’t need doctors, or the police. You have your empowering narrative and the props to act it out.The importance of this narrative cannot be overstated — it is completely transformative. French describes it in language reminiscent of religious conversion: “Your life has changed for the better. Your community has expanded to include people you truly like, who’ve perhaps helped you through a tough time in your life, and you treasure these relationships. You feel a sense of burning conviction that you, your family, and your community are safer and freer because you own and carry a gun.”It’s easy to see why gun owners are so angered, and threatened, by the rhetoric of gun control advocates. Owning a gun for self-defense springs from a deep-seated desire to protect yourself and your family, no different from the motivations of parents who reject vaccines or try unproven experimental stem cell therapies. Yet detractors call you a murderer, a terrorist, an idiot, someone who wants children to die. They label you the villain and threaten to force you into vaccination or giving up your guns. But those aspects of your life are the keystone in the architecture of your security, your personal identity — they define you not as a villain but as a hero. “Support for gun rights is motivated precisely by our devotion to protecting our kids,” says Mandel. Why can’t others see that?***In a 1993 advertisement that is either comedic or profoundly chilling, depending on who you are, Mel Gibson hides in his kitchen clutching a bottle of vitamin C as armed government agents swarm the premises. “The federal government is actually considering classifying most vitamins and other supplements as drugs,” warns the ad. “Could raids on individual homes be next?” The melodrama will seem absurd to anyone who doesn’t depend on supplements for talismanic protection. But in light of the anxieties just beneath the surface of an empowering epistemology, it makes perfect sense. It’s as if the government were trying to regulate your religion. Or maybe it’s more than that, since concealed weapons and nutritional supplements become a literal extension of yourself: It’s as if the government were trying to regulate your body.Wellness culture and gun culture exploit truths for their persuasiveness. Guns really do save some people’s lives, and certain aspects of wellness culture are legitimate ways to improve health. There’s no denying that the medical establishment has serious flaws, as does law enforcement, and the world is filled with danger and tragedy. But both of these cultures exaggerate the extent of the problems, overstate their ability to help and distract us from the root causes. Economic and social injustice is a far greater threat to people’s health than medical error or malfeasance — just as it is by far the greatest risk factor in gun violence — but this does not fit neatly into an empowering epistemology. Nor does it fit to acknowledge that friends and family are more likely to attack you than some random home invader and that no matter how well-trained you are with guns or how securely you store them, those precautions won’t save you from using one to kill yourself if you’re depressed.But once you understand the foundations of gun culture, it becomes obvious that statistics won’t convince anyone to give up an AR-15 purchased for home defense. That gun is part of a larger set of beliefs and rituals that, in French’s words, make “you feel more ‘free’ than you’ve ever felt before.” Without them you feel scared, helpless and dependent. Moreover, these beliefs and rituals are sustained by anecdotes, community and personal experience, not logic and establishment statistics.Instead, the best approach is the one that pediatricians and other experts have laid out for dealing with vaccine hesitancy. First, don’t vilify. Like parents who are hesitant to vaccinate, gun owners are genuinely trying to be good parents, and good citizens — dismissing them as irrational and dangerous will only serve to alienate them. Second, lead by listening. “Attentiveness to parents’ concerns is important,” notes the American Academy of Pediatrics in its clinical report on countering vaccine hesitancy. This is the best way to earn trust and respect, especially when engaging with someone who feels threatened and disempowered. Lastly, make sure to acknowledge gun owners as a diverse community of individuals, each with their own story and reasons for behaving the way they do. Talking about “gun nuts,” like talking about “anti-vaxxers,” is counterproductive. It reinforces us-vs.-them, which makes it difficult to reach persuadable members of each culture, further cementing their loyalty to a community that provides affirmation instead of condemnation.I still get incensed when I see NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch shilling for guns (or for some new superfood). It scares me that people take her seriously, whether about AR-15s or about SuperBeets. But I also understand that those people are trapped by their need for an empowering epistemology. They’re scared, too, probably even more scared than I am. Any effort to make the world safer, for all of us, has to begin there — with the fear at the heart of gun culture and with the faith-like structures built around that fear.

Rick Saccone (R) was trashed by his own party as a weak candidate. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa89597200000d30ceb1cd8.jpeg?cache=pOM6kOyTiB&ops=crop_9_117_4696_2832%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"ELIZABETH TOWNSHIP, Pa. ― A special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District was still too close to call Tuesday night, although the fact that it was this close at all was bad news for Republicans. It was a district that Donald Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016, and the GOP should have easily held on to it. According to some Republicans, the fact that they were on the verge of losing wasn’t because their messaging was weak or the president had created an incredible backlash effect. And it certainly didn’t mean that Democrats were going to dominate at the polls in November.All it means, at least according to these strategists, is that their candidate running in Pennsylvania’s 18th District sucked. State Rep. Rick Saccone was horrible, and it’s his fault the GOP was embarrassed nationally.“He came across as establishment. And I think that’s part of the problem,” said Jason Miller, a former aide to Trump’s campaign, in a CNN interview Tuesday. “He’s in the Statehouse. He very much sounds like he’s already part of Washington. You flip on the TV there ... and a lot of it looks really cookie-cutter, like, we’re Washington, and we’re here to help.”But other Republicans thought he could have used a bit more polish. “This may not be nice to say: The fact is that the Saccone campaign was a joke. If we had a candidate who could walk and chew gum at the same time, we would have [easily] won the race,” said Corry Bliss, executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC, in a statement. An anonymous Pennsylvania GOP strategist told The Washington Examiner they had a very specific complaint about Saccone: His moustache was disgusting.″It’s a porn stache,” the strategist said.  Saccone was overwhelmingly favored to win the race. The district was so solidly Republican that Democrats didn’t even field a congressional candidate here in 2014 and 2016. GOP groups dumped nearly $11 million into the campaign on advertising and media messaging ― an astounding amount for a district that will not exist due to redistricting next year.But instead, Democrat Conor Lamb gained momentum. The 33-year-old political novice left his job as an assistant U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh to run in the special election, and he significantly outpaced Saccone in fundraising throughout the race ― another mark against the GOP candidate.“When candidates don’t raise as much in hard dollars, it’s very difficult to run these things from afar,” Mike DeVanney, a Pittsburgh-based Republican political consultant told HuffPost. “Candidates and campaigns matter, and that’s why it’s a race,” said a national Republican operative active in the race who asked not to be named. “You have one candidate that’s out of central casting, Conor Lamb, and then you have a candidate on the Republican side who, it was expected, would be lackluster in fundraising.”Many of Saccone’s supporters who came to his election party in the Youghiogheny Country Club on Tuesday night were close friends from Elizabeth Township. Saccone grew up there and now lives there with his family. Some of them said they were frustrated that the national Republican Party chose to spend almost all of its resources on negative ads rather than ads highlighting the character traits of the humble and generous man they say they know from their neighborhood.  “I feel like when the national party got involved and they put out the advertising and everything, it doesn’t focus on Rick. Rick is freaking amazing,” said Lesa DeMaio, 52, who runs a tutoring business in town. Shar Tibbitt, 56, Saccone’s office manager at the state House, provided a similar assessment. She teared up recounting the moment she told Saccone that she had undergone a double mastectomy to remove breast cancer. Saccone broke down crying and then prayed with her. “I know Rep. Saccone doesn’t like to do attack ads. I wish [the national groups] would have promoted Rick more and stopped attacking the opponent,” Tibbitt said. When these same Saccone partisans were asked what they then made of Republican operatives blaming Saccone and his campaign for the close nature of the race, they were very frustrated. “That’s unfortunate. I don’t understand how they can blame him. They’re the ones who made the ads,” Tibbitt said.But Bryer Cochenour, an 18-year-old student at Westminster College who cast the first vote of his life for Saccone, was not particularly ruffled by GOP criticism of Saccone. He saw it as the typical behavior of political operatives in both parties trying to pass the buck.“They threw Hillary under the bus,” he said of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. “Anyone who sees that a race might be close or might not be in their favor, they throw them under the bus.”Trump made a last-minute campaign appearance for Saccone, although he spent very little time actually talking about the race itself. The president has reportedly trashed Saccone in private, considering him a ”weak″ candidate.But there was far more going on than just whether or not Saccone was a strong candidate. Nationwide, Democrats have dominated at the ballot box since Trump took office, flipping 39 state legislative seats from red to blue ― along with the governor’s mansion in New Jersey and a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. Republicans, meanwhile, have taken over just four state legislative seats previously held by Democrats. A number of voters who backed Trump but decided to support Lamb said they did so not because Saccone was an unpolished or incompetent candidate but simply because they didn’t like his policy views on issues like labor rights ― a major factor in this union-heavy district. The Republicans’ marquee legislative achievement just didn’t play well here either. The GOP intended to make passage of the tax cut law the centerpiece of its strategy in the 2018 midterms. But Republican groups stopped airing ads mentioning tax cuts toward the end of the Pennsylvania race after realizing the issue wasn’t moving voters. And, of course, there was that much-mentioned energy that has been fueling the Democratic side and grassroots groups in the age of Trump. Stunned by losses in 2016, the left has mobilized in a way that even Republicans acknowledge could portend a blue wave in November. Although Trump likes to boast that his supporters will never desert him, results like the Pennsylvania special election show that his appeal is limited. At least some members of his base have no problem rejecting Republican candidates ― even ones he supports.Amanda Terkel and Igor Bobic reported from Washington.

But he thought that participating in a protest at the White House would be a bigger show of support for gun violence victims.“Coming to D.C., coming to the White House, is a whole other thing to get our point across,” he said. “Power in numbers, right?”Vasiliki Frantzis, from Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, Maryland, said that she remembered the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, which she said made her think about why people “would try to bring a gun into school.”Rohan Kurup, from Northwood High School in Montgomery County, Maryland, said that he normally has not taken part in student protests, but was inspired this time.“Maybe I should,” he said. “I don’t want to get shot at school.”Most of the students who spoke to HuffPost said that school administrators and teachers seemed sympathetic toward students’ participation in Wednesday’s walkout, although they couldn’t publicly express that support. In fact, many schools nationwide have said they will penalize students with unexcused absences. Callie Newburgh and Chloe Appel, from Magruder High School in Rockville, Maryland, said some administrators were worried that “pro-gun people would put us in harm’s way.”Appel estimated that about half of her school’s students were active in the protests, some at the White House and others at a lunchtime moment of silence at their school.“The other half thinks it’s useless because we’re minors,” Appel said. “There are so many minors being affected by this. We can really make a difference, even if we’re not 18.”Some students held signs noting that they would soon be old enough to vote, and their many chants included “Rock the vote.”“We’re the next generation,” Scott said."

He was 76.The world-renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist was best known for his work on black holes. Hawking theorized that, contrary to the prevailing scientific belief that black holes were inescapable for all forms of matter and energy, they actually emitted a form of radiation ― now known as Hawking radiation. He also played a key role in the mathematical effort to unify Einstein’s general theory of relativity with the emergent field of quantum physics. Hawking used his position as one of the world’s most famous scientists as a platform to discuss a wide range of issues, from the existence of extraterrestrial life to the nature of philosophy. He skyrocketed to public prominence in 1988, when he published his first general-audience book, A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes. The cosmology treatise has sold approximately 10 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling science books of all time. In 1963, when he was just 21 years old, Hawking was famously diagnosed with the debilitating motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Though 80 percent of those with ALS die within five years of diagnosis, and Hawking’s own doctors gave him roughly two years to live, he survived for decades, perhaps longer than any other patient with the disease in medical history. Hawking used a wheelchair to move around and a sophisticated computer system to speak for much of his time as a public figure. The physicist’s inspiring ― and turbulent ― personal story was dramatized in the 2014 movie “The Theory of Everything,” which was based on a memoir by Hawking’s first wife, Jane Wilde. Actor Eddie Redmayne’s portrayal of Hawking in the film won him an Oscar for best actor.Hawking was born on Jan. 8, 1942 ― the 300th anniversary of Galileo’s death ― in Oxford, England, to Frank, a physician specializing in tropical disease, and Isobel, a medical secretary. He and his three younger siblings grew up mostly in the town of St. Albans, just north of London, in what has been described as a highly intellectually-engaged home.At the St. Albans School, Hawking was an indifferent student, preferring to spend his time playing board games and tinkering with computers. But he nonetheless gained admittance to his father’s alma mater, University College at Oxford University, in 1959, at the age of 17. Upon arriving at Oxford, Hawking toyed with the idea of studying either math or medicine before eventually settling on physics. His attitude toward academic work remained lackadaisical in college. He rarely attended lectures and has said that he spent only 1,000 hours on studies during his three years at Oxford, or just an hour a day.Still, Hawking’s natural brilliance started to shine through as an undergraduate ― and he apparently felt that his tutors resented him for doing so well with so little work. When he submitted his final thesis, it was given a grade on the border between first-class honors and second-class honors, so Hawking had to face an oral exam that would determine his grade. Knowing his reputation, he reportedly told his examiners, “If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First.”He got a First. And, as promised, Hawking enrolled in graduate school at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1962, studying under the physicist Dennis Sciama and the famed astronomer Fred Hoyle. He became interested in the then-nascent study of black holes and singularities, the existence of which had been implied by Einstein’s general theory of relativity. While studying at Cambridge, Hawking met Wilde, a fellow St. Albans native who was a student in modern languages at Westfield College in London at the time. Before the two started dating, Hawking collapsed while ice skating and couldn’t get up. His mother made him go to the doctor, who diagnosed him with ALS and estimated he had just over two years to live.Years later, during a symposium at Cambridge on his 70th birthday, Hawking reflected on how much he struggled to stay motivated after his diagnosis. Why work so hard for a Ph.D. when you could be dead in two years?“Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet,” he said. “Try to make sense of what you see and about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up.”Hawking’s motor control deteriorated rapidly; he was soon walking to class on crutches. Yet the disease spurred him to deepen his relationship with Wilde quickly. They married in 1965.After receiving his doctorate in cosmology, Hawking stayed at Cambridge to continue studying some of the most essential questions about the structure of the universe. In 1968, a year after Jane gave birth their eldest son, Robert, Hawking took a post at the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge and began the mature phase of his academic career. Over the next decade, Hawking published a string of groundbreaking papers on cosmology and theoretical physics that made him a celebrity in the scientific community.He and English mathematician Roger Penrose wrote key papers in the late 1960s that related the Big Bang ― the event that created the universe ― and black holes, proving that both were the result of singularities in the fabric of space-time. In the early 1970s, Hawking and several other physicists co-wrote a proof of the hypothesis that all black holes can be described in terms of just their mass, angular momentum and electric charge. It was in 1974 that Hawking proposed what is widely considered his most significant theory: that black holes can emit subatomic particles, now known as Hawking radiation. Prior to his paper, physicists had been sure that nothing could escape the crushing gravity of a black hole. The existence of Hawking radiation also implies that black holes can eventually wither away and die, something that had previously been inconceivable to scientists. Soon after publishing his paper, Hawking, just 32 years old, was named a fellow of the prestigious Royal Society. He briefly taught at the California Institute of Technology before assuming the position of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, a post dating back more than 400 years that was once held by Isaac Newton. Though Hawking’s family life flourished during this time ― he and Jane Hawking went on to have two more children ― his health did not. He reluctantly started using a wheelchair in 1969, and by the mid-70s, he could no longer feed or clothe himself.In 1985, Hawking contracted pneumonia while on a trip to Switzerland. Doctors performed a tracheotomy that allowed him to breathe but rendered him unable to speak naturally. At first, he communicated using word cards, which was agonizingly slow. But in 1986, computer scientist Walter Woltosz gave him a device that would vocalize words he typed using a joystick. Hawking called this system, which has since been upgraded several times, “The Computer.” Its electronic voice was an integral part of the physicist’s public image.Hawking first came up with the idea of writing a book about cosmology for a general audience in 1982. He said he conceived of the project to “earn money to pay [his] daughter’s school fees.” The first draft of A Brief History of Time was finished in 1984, but Hawking’s publisher felt it was too difficult for laypeople to understand, so he went back to work. The revision process became more complicated after Hawking lost his voice in 1985, but he managed to publish the book in 1988. It was a massive hit: The book was on The New York Times’ best-seller list for three years and The Sunday Times’ U.K. best-seller list for nearly five. Its publication propelled Hawking to international fame that’s endured to this day. He published five additional general-audience books on science, plus one memoir and four children’s books. He also guest-starred on both “The Simpsons” and “Star Trek: The Next Generation.” Stephen and Jane Hawking separated after several years of tension in 1990, which Jane said was exacerbated by her husband’s newfound “fame and fortune.” The physicist began a relationship with Elaine Mason, one of his nurses. After his divorce from Jane Hawking, he married Mason in 1995.Hawking and his ex-wife did not speak for several years, but they started communicating again after he and Mason got divorced in 2007. Stephen and Jane Hawking later began living around the corner from one another in Cambridge.In 2011, Hawking appeared on the Discovery Channel TV series “Curiosity,” in which he reflected on the origins of the universe and rejected the likelihood of both a God and an afterlife. (He once dismissed the latter as “a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.”) Only in confronting the finite nature of death, he said, do we appreciate the remarkable beauty of life in the present.“There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either,” Hawking said. “We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful.”In addition to his two former wives, Hawking is survived by three children and three grandchildren.

He was 76.The world-renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist was best known for his work on black holes. Hawking theorized that, contrary to the prevailing scientific belief that black holes were inescapable for all forms of matter and energy, they actually emitted a form of radiation ― now known as Hawking radiation. He also played a key role in the mathematical effort to unify Einstein’s general theory of relativity with the emergent field of quantum physics. Hawking used his position as one of the world’s most famous scientists as a platform to discuss a wide range of issues, from the existence of extraterrestrial life to the nature of philosophy. He skyrocketed to public prominence in 1988, when he published his first general-audience book, A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes. The cosmology treatise has sold approximately 10 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling science books of all time. In 1963, when he was just 21 years old, Hawking was famously diagnosed with the debilitating motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Though 80 percent of those with ALS die within five years of diagnosis, and Hawking’s own doctors gave him roughly two years to live, he survived for decades, perhaps longer than any other patient with the disease in medical history. Hawking used a wheelchair to move around and a sophisticated computer system to speak for much of his time as a public figure. The physicist’s inspiring ― and turbulent ― personal story was dramatized in the 2014 movie “The Theory of Everything,” which was based on a memoir by Hawking’s first wife, Jane Wilde. Actor Eddie Redmayne’s portrayal of Hawking in the film won him an Oscar for best actor.Hawking was born on Jan. 8, 1942 ― the 300th anniversary of Galileo’s death ― in Oxford, England, to Frank, a physician specializing in tropical disease, and Isobel, a medical secretary. He and his three younger siblings grew up mostly in the town of St. Albans, just north of London, in what has been described as a highly intellectually-engaged home.At the St. Albans School, Hawking was an indifferent student, preferring to spend his time playing board games and tinkering with computers. But he nonetheless gained admittance to his father’s alma mater, University College at Oxford University, in 1959, at the age of 17. Upon arriving at Oxford, Hawking toyed with the idea of studying either math or medicine before eventually settling on physics. His attitude toward academic work remained lackadaisical in college. He rarely attended lectures and has said that he spent only 1,000 hours on studies during his three years at Oxford, or just an hour a day.Still, Hawking’s natural brilliance started to shine through as an undergraduate ― and he apparently felt that his tutors resented him for doing so well with so little work. When he submitted his final thesis, it was given a grade on the border between first-class honors and second-class honors, so Hawking had to face an oral exam that would determine his grade. Knowing his reputation, he reportedly told his examiners, “If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First.”He got a First. And, as promised, Hawking enrolled in graduate school at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1962, studying under the physicist Dennis Sciama and the famed astronomer Fred Hoyle. He became interested in the then-nascent study of black holes and singularities, the existence of which had been implied by Einstein’s general theory of relativity. While studying at Cambridge, Hawking met Wilde, a fellow St. Albans native who was a student in modern languages at Westfield College in London at the time. Before the two started dating, Hawking collapsed while ice skating and couldn’t get up. His mother made him go to the doctor, who diagnosed him with ALS and estimated he had just over two years to live.Years later, during a symposium at Cambridge on his 70th birthday, Hawking reflected on how much he struggled to stay motivated after his diagnosis. Why work so hard for a Ph.D. when you could be dead in two years?“Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet,” he said. “Try to make sense of what you see and about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up.”Hawking’s motor control deteriorated rapidly; he was soon walking to class on crutches. Yet the disease spurred him to deepen his relationship with Wilde quickly. They married in 1965.After receiving his doctorate in cosmology, Hawking stayed at Cambridge to continue studying some of the most essential questions about the structure of the universe. In 1968, a year after Jane gave birth their eldest son, Robert, Hawking took a post at the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge and began the mature phase of his academic career. Over the next decade, Hawking published a string of groundbreaking papers on cosmology and theoretical physics that made him a celebrity in the scientific community.He and English mathematician Roger Penrose wrote key papers in the late 1960s that related the Big Bang ― the event that created the universe ― and black holes, proving that both were the result of singularities in the fabric of space-time. In the early 1970s, Hawking and several other physicists co-wrote a proof of the hypothesis that all black holes can be described in terms of just their mass, angular momentum and electric charge. It was in 1974 that Hawking proposed what is widely considered his most significant theory: that black holes can emit subatomic particles, now known as Hawking radiation. Prior to his paper, physicists had been sure that nothing could escape the crushing gravity of a black hole. The existence of Hawking radiation also implies that black holes can eventually wither away and die, something that had previously been inconceivable to scientists. Soon after publishing his paper, Hawking, just 32 years old, was named a fellow of the prestigious Royal Society. He briefly taught at the California Institute of Technology before assuming the position of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, a post dating back more than 400 years that was once held by Isaac Newton. Though Hawking’s family life flourished during this time ― he and Jane Hawking went on to have two more children ― his health did not. He reluctantly started using a wheelchair in 1969, and by the mid-70s, he could no longer feed or clothe himself.In 1985, Hawking contracted pneumonia while on a trip to Switzerland. Doctors performed a tracheotomy that allowed him to breathe but rendered him unable to speak naturally. At first, he communicated using word cards, which was agonizingly slow. But in 1986, computer scientist Walter Woltosz gave him a device that would vocalize words he typed using a joystick. Hawking called this system, which has since been upgraded several times, “The Computer.” Its electronic voice was an integral part of the physicist’s public image.Hawking first came up with the idea of writing a book about cosmology for a general audience in 1982.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa1714d2000007d06eb11cc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ORLANDO ― Noor Salman, widow of the Pulse nightclub shooter, gave her husband the “green light” to commit terrorism, a federal prosecutor told jurors on Wednesday.“None of the victims that night knew the horrific events that were about to unfold. No one knew ― except for two people,” Assistant U.S. Attorney James Mandolfo said. “Omar Mateen and his wife.” Salman, 31, is charged with aiding and abetting her husband’s 2016 attack on Pulse nightclub in Florida and obstructing justice. She has pleaded not guilty. In the courtroom, she sat between her two defense attorneys with a blanket in her lap, occasionally taking notes and sipping water.The attack claimed the lives of 49 people, making it the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history at the time. Salman is the only one charged in the crime. Mateen died in a shootout with police after pledging allegiance to ISIS.During opening statements, attorneys for both sides painted competing portraits of the defendant.Mandolfo told jurors that Salman was aware that her husband planned to attack Pulse, and nonchalantly shopped for leather biker jackets online while he sprayed bullets into club-goers. Defense attorney Linda Moreno countered that far from being a conspirator, Salman was completely in the dark about her husband’s twisted plot, and was herself a victim of his violence.“Her only sin was that she married a monster,” she said. “She was unknowing and unaware of his plans.”Mandolfo laid out a timeline of events that he said would prove Salman not only knew about her husband’s plan but would show she encouraged and assisted him.He told jurors that Salman joined Mateen on trips to scout potential locations and to buy ammunition. The couple planned extensively for Mateen’s death, he said, by adding Salman as the death beneficiary of Mateen’s bank account and by purchasing assets, such as jewelry, which she could later sell. In an 11-day period, the couple spent around $30,000, he said.The government doesn’t have to prove that the steps Salman allegedly took to further the crime were as big as her husband’s, he added.The prosecution’s strongest piece of evidence is a statement Salman gave FBI agents in the hours following the massacre in which she said she knew about Mateen’s plans to attack Pulse.Moreno, Salman’s attorney, described Salman as “simple” and easily manipulated, and said her client was coerced into a false confession by FBI agents trained in the Reid technique, a popular method of interrogation that some say intentionally misleads suspects. Forensic evidence will prove that the claims made in the alleged confession are false, she said.She roundly rejected the government’s depiction of Salman, describing her as an apolitical, devoted mother who was abused by Mateen throughout their marriage. Salman has alleged that Mateen physically assaulted her, raped her, threatened to kill her and controlled her daily activities.“She was not his partner, she was not his peer, and she certainly was not his confidant,” she said, calling Mateen a sadist and a compulsive liar who often cheated on his wife.Salman, who has a 5-year-old son, has been incarcerated since her arrest in January 2017. She is in protective custody and spends 23 hours a day alone, family spokesperson Susan Clary said. She has not seen her son, though she is allowed to speak to him on the phone each day. “Her son knows that his father is dead. He knows that his father was bad and killed a bunch of people. He doesn’t understand why his mother is in jail for something his father did,” Clary told HuffPost on Tuesday, standing across the street from the facility where Salman is currently being held. Salman’s family says the version of her presented by federal prosecutors is wildly inaccurate.Her aunt, Susan Adieh, called Salman “sweet” and nonviolent, and said she is traumatized by her violent marriage to Mateen.“We know she’s no part of this,” she said. “None.” Melissa Jeltsen will be reporting from the trial. Follow her for updates."
42,BUSINESS,Facebook Defends Its Use Of Secret Courts To Handle Sexual Harassment Cases,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-sexual-harassment-arbitration_us_5aa7efb0e4b04042d27e9c75,"The tech giant is standing behind its use of forced arbitration, a practice criticized for silencing women.",2018-03-14,Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg in Brussels earlier this year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa7f2bd1f0000150316a361.jpeg?cache=ZT2LWG0EtJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Facebook isn’t typically shy about proclaiming its support for women. After all, chief operating officer and “Lean In” author Sheryl Sandberg built her brand on feminism. Last year, the tech giant even took the rare step of publicizing its own rules and practices on sexual harassment.But on one critical policy, Facebook is awfully wishy-washy: forced arbitration. Facebook is one of many companies that requires employees to take legal disputes, like discrimination or wage claims, to private courtrooms. The process has come under fire for its role in silencing victims of sexual harassment, especially in the wake of the Me Too movement.In a series of conversations with HuffPost over the past few weeks, Facebook representatives took part in a strange dance: They defended the company’s use of forced arbitration, but also said Facebook was considering its position on a bipartisan bill that would make forced arbitration illegal in sexual harassment cases.“We’re studying it and haven’t taken a position,” a Facebook spokesman told HuffPost. Adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, put arbitration back in the headlines this month, after an arbitrator ordered her to stay silent about her alleged affair with President Donald Trump.The arbitration process Facebook uses is very “official and appropriate,” a spokeswoman told HuffPost. She pointed out that although the social networking giant uses arbitration, it doesn’t require that participants keep silent, as other employers often do. (HuffPost could find no evidence of any employee speaking publicly about litigation against the company.) Arbitration is good for employees because matters are kept private, she said. She also argued that arbitration is a neutral practice, pointing out that the company and its accuser both have a say in which judge they use.She emphasized that Facebook takes harassment seriously and has an in-depth training process for employees. “Our philosophy is to prevent these claims in the first place,” she said.In a statement issued on Wednesday, hours after HuffPost published this story, the company’s head of employment law, Heidi Swartz, wrote, “Facebook does not use ‘secret courts’ to handle sexual harassment cases as alleged by HuffPost. That claim is false and misleading. We have never had an employee file a sexual harassment arbitration.” If the past year or so has taught us anything, it’s that even companies with the best intentions and the most sensitive executive leaders don’t catch every bad actor. Opponents of forced arbitration say that getting rid of such secretive practices is key to combating sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace.“The easiest mistake any employer can make is to assume that ‘this could never happen here,’” Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a December blog post announcing that the company would no longer send harassment to arbitration. “While it’s natural to hope and believe that’s the case, one of the fundamental lessons of recent months is that people’s voices need to be heard if their problems are to be addressed.” (Microsoft is currently in the middle of a gender discrimination suit filed by a former female technical employee.)Microsoft is the one major tech company that’s thrown its support behind the the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Act. The bill, introduced by Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) in December, would make it illegal to force employees to take sexual harassment suits to private arbitration. Instead, employees would have a choice in the matter, giving them more leverage in going up against a deep-pocketed corporation.“I’m glad Facebook says they feel they’re taking harassment seriously, but I had hope that they’d actually Lean In and lead by example on this,” Bustos told HuffPost, using Sandberg’s book title to make her point. “All businesses need to take a look at this issue. Time’s up on letting companies use legal tools to sweep harassment under the rug,” she said.It’s unclear where the other tech giants stand on the issue: Google and Apple did not respond to HuffPost’s requests to talk about the bill. Amazon would only say that it doesn’t use arbitration.But the bill actually has some bipartisan support, cosponsored in the House by Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and in the Senate by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson is also pushing for the legislation, helping announce it on Capitol Hill at the end of the year. Carlson drew attention to forced arbitration in 2016 by maneuvering around her employment contract and suing her harasser directly in court.“The bill gives women (and men) a choice: do they want a harassment claim to go to secret arbitration, or utilize their 7th amendment right and go to a public court?” Carlson said in a message to HuffPost. “Any company outwardly lobbying against this bill makes one wonder what they may have to hide.”Because of the secrecy of the arbitration process, it’s difficult to say how many women it silences. In one egregious example, The Washington Post was able to learn about hundreds of women accusing Sterling Jewelers, the multibillion dollar company behind Kay Jewelers and Jared, of widespread discrimination. Bustos said that the Sterling story was the first time she’d even heard of forced arbitration, and it inspired her to craft this legislation.For every journalistic scoop, however, many more cases are forever buried.Facebook has spent thousands of dollars lobbying on the arbitration bill, according to public records. But there’s no indication in the record of where the company stands on the bill. Facebook, for its part, said that the money was spent to research the legislation, not to argue a particular stance. As of publication, Facebook’s lobbying firm had not amended its lobbying disclosure.“Facebook has hundreds of lawyers and lobbyists advising them on law and policy. We are talking about a two-page bill that was introduced last year on an issue that is in the news every day,” said Andrew Rogers, the director of legislative affairs at the American Association of Justice, a nonprofit advocacy group for plaintiffs lawyers that opposes arbitration.“Any company that says it is still ‘mulling it over’ isn’t acting in good faith, and is just hoping the movement quietly fades away,” Rogers said. Microsoft endorsed the bill last year, he pointed out.Another sign that the bill has momentum: In February, all 50 state attorneys general took the rare step of joining together to call companies to end the practice and for Congress to pass the bill.“Ending mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims would help to put a stop to the culture of silence that protects perpetrators at the cost of their victims,” the letter says.About 60.1 million workers in the U.S. are beholden to mandatory arbitration clauses, according to a study released last year by the progressive Economic Policy Institute. Many of them have no idea; you can agree to give up your right to file a lawsuit simply by accepting an employee handbook.Employees win in arbitration only 21 percent of the time, according to an earlier paper from EPI ― a much lower rate than you’d find in state or federal court. And if they win, monetary damages are far lower as well ― less than half of what a victim would be awarded in court. If a victim loses, many companies will require her to pay arbitration fees.Many employee complaints never even make it to arbitration, because the deck is so stacked against them. For one thing, lawyers are reluctant to take on clients in arbitration where payouts are much lower, writes NYU law professor Cynthia Estlund in a working paper published in February called “The black hole of mandatory arbitration.”Almost half of companies that use arbitration clauses also include language in them that prevents employees from joining together in class action suits, Estlund notes. That means that if a group of female employees were all harassed by the same man, they would each have to sue the company individually. That’s a huge disadvantage to employees, who are already far less empowered than the company they’re fighting. The issue is currently before the Supreme Court.Former Facebook engineer Chia Hong sued Facebook for sexual harassment and discrimination in 2015. Hong alleged she was frequently ignored and belittled in meetings where she was sometimes the only woman, was admonished for taking a personal day each month to volunteer at her kid’s school, and was ordered to serve drinks to male colleagues. Her case was dismissed that year, but it’s not clear why. Facebook would only say that it didn’t go to arbitration.Meanwhile, with or without Facebook’s support, it remains unlikely that the bill will be brought to the floor in the Republican-majority House anytime soon.Bustos has been tweeting at House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) every day this month, asking him to bring the bill to a vote. “This is in his hands. He could make a decision or he could take the side of sexual harassers,” she said.Last week, on International Women’s Day, her tweet to Ryan was particularly poignant. “Instead of sending Congress home before noon on #InternationalWomensDay, we should have been voting on our bipartisan bill to drive #SexualHarassment out of the workplace,” Bustos wrote.Also on International Women’s Day, Sandberg wrote a passionate Facebook tribute to women. “I’m more dedicated than ever to creating a more equal world that will also be a better world,” she wrote at the end of a long status about women’s rights.Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that it was Facebook’s lobbying arm, and not Facebook itself, that had not amended its lobbying disclosure by publication time.Sign up for Emily Peck’s newsletter on women’s issues or follow her on Twitter @EmilyRPeck."
43,BUSINESS,Facebook Defends Its Use Of Secret Courts To Handle Sexual Harassment Cases,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-sexual-harassment-arbitration_us_5aa7efb0e4b04042d27e9c75,"The tech giant is standing behind its use of forced arbitration, a practice criticized for silencing women.",2018-03-14,"An arbitrator ordered adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, to keep silent about her alleged affair with President Donald Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa7f216200000d30ceb1be8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Facebook isn’t typically shy about proclaiming its support for women. After all, chief operating officer and “Lean In” author Sheryl Sandberg built her brand on feminism. Last year, the tech giant even took the rare step of publicizing its own rules and practices on sexual harassment.But on one critical policy, Facebook is awfully wishy-washy: forced arbitration. Facebook is one of many companies that requires employees to take legal disputes, like discrimination or wage claims, to private courtrooms. The process has come under fire for its role in silencing victims of sexual harassment, especially in the wake of the Me Too movement.In a series of conversations with HuffPost over the past few weeks, Facebook representatives took part in a strange dance: They defended the company’s use of forced arbitration, but also said Facebook was considering its position on a bipartisan bill that would make forced arbitration illegal in sexual harassment cases.“We’re studying it and haven’t taken a position,” a Facebook spokesman told HuffPost. Adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, put arbitration back in the headlines this month, after an arbitrator ordered her to stay silent about her alleged affair with President Donald Trump.The arbitration process Facebook uses is very “official and appropriate,” a spokeswoman told HuffPost. She pointed out that although the social networking giant uses arbitration, it doesn’t require that participants keep silent, as other employers often do. (HuffPost could find no evidence of any employee speaking publicly about litigation against the company.) Arbitration is good for employees because matters are kept private, she said. She also argued that arbitration is a neutral practice, pointing out that the company and its accuser both have a say in which judge they use.She emphasized that Facebook takes harassment seriously and has an in-depth training process for employees. “Our philosophy is to prevent these claims in the first place,” she said.In a statement issued on Wednesday, hours after HuffPost published this story, the company’s head of employment law, Heidi Swartz, wrote, “Facebook does not use ‘secret courts’ to handle sexual harassment cases as alleged by HuffPost. That claim is false and misleading. We have never had an employee file a sexual harassment arbitration.” If the past year or so has taught us anything, it’s that even companies with the best intentions and the most sensitive executive leaders don’t catch every bad actor. Opponents of forced arbitration say that getting rid of such secretive practices is key to combating sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace.“The easiest mistake any employer can make is to assume that ‘this could never happen here,’” Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a December blog post announcing that the company would no longer send harassment to arbitration. “While it’s natural to hope and believe that’s the case, one of the fundamental lessons of recent months is that people’s voices need to be heard if their problems are to be addressed.” (Microsoft is currently in the middle of a gender discrimination suit filed by a former female technical employee.)Microsoft is the one major tech company that’s thrown its support behind the the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Act. The bill, introduced by Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) in December, would make it illegal to force employees to take sexual harassment suits to private arbitration. Instead, employees would have a choice in the matter, giving them more leverage in going up against a deep-pocketed corporation.“I’m glad Facebook says they feel they’re taking harassment seriously, but I had hope that they’d actually Lean In and lead by example on this,” Bustos told HuffPost, using Sandberg’s book title to make her point. “All businesses need to take a look at this issue. Time’s up on letting companies use legal tools to sweep harassment under the rug,” she said.It’s unclear where the other tech giants stand on the issue: Google and Apple did not respond to HuffPost’s requests to talk about the bill. Amazon would only say that it doesn’t use arbitration.But the bill actually has some bipartisan support, cosponsored in the House by Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and in the Senate by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson is also pushing for the legislation, helping announce it on Capitol Hill at the end of the year. Carlson drew attention to forced arbitration in 2016 by maneuvering around her employment contract and suing her harasser directly in court.“The bill gives women (and men) a choice: do they want a harassment claim to go to secret arbitration, or utilize their 7th amendment right and go to a public court?” Carlson said in a message to HuffPost. “Any company outwardly lobbying against this bill makes one wonder what they may have to hide.”Because of the secrecy of the arbitration process, it’s difficult to say how many women it silences. In one egregious example, The Washington Post was able to learn about hundreds of women accusing Sterling Jewelers, the multibillion dollar company behind Kay Jewelers and Jared, of widespread discrimination. Bustos said that the Sterling story was the first time she’d even heard of forced arbitration, and it inspired her to craft this legislation.For every journalistic scoop, however, many more cases are forever buried.Facebook has spent thousands of dollars lobbying on the arbitration bill, according to public records. But there’s no indication in the record of where the company stands on the bill. Facebook, for its part, said that the money was spent to research the legislation, not to argue a particular stance. As of publication, Facebook’s lobbying firm had not amended its lobbying disclosure.“Facebook has hundreds of lawyers and lobbyists advising them on law and policy. We are talking about a two-page bill that was introduced last year on an issue that is in the news every day,” said Andrew Rogers, the director of legislative affairs at the American Association of Justice, a nonprofit advocacy group for plaintiffs lawyers that opposes arbitration.“Any company that says it is still ‘mulling it over’ isn’t acting in good faith, and is just hoping the movement quietly fades away,” Rogers said. Microsoft endorsed the bill last year, he pointed out.Another sign that the bill has momentum: In February, all 50 state attorneys general took the rare step of joining together to call companies to end the practice and for Congress to pass the bill.“Ending mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims would help to put a stop to the culture of silence that protects perpetrators at the cost of their victims,” the letter says.About 60.1 million workers in the U.S. are beholden to mandatory arbitration clauses, according to a study released last year by the progressive Economic Policy Institute. Many of them have no idea; you can agree to give up your right to file a lawsuit simply by accepting an employee handbook.Employees win in arbitration only 21 percent of the time, according to an earlier paper from EPI ― a much lower rate than you’d find in state or federal court. And if they win, monetary damages are far lower as well ― less than half of what a victim would be awarded in court. If a victim loses, many companies will require her to pay arbitration fees.Many employee complaints never even make it to arbitration, because the deck is so stacked against them. For one thing, lawyers are reluctant to take on clients in arbitration where payouts are much lower, writes NYU law professor Cynthia Estlund in a working paper published in February called “The black hole of mandatory arbitration.”Almost half of companies that use arbitration clauses also include language in them that prevents employees from joining together in class action suits, Estlund notes.

The group will be the subject of a documentary series launching on paid streaming service YouTube Red, the group’s management company BigHit Entertainment confirmed on Tuesday. The eight-episode series, entitled “BTS: Burn The Stage,” is slated for a March 28 release and already, fans are finding it hard to contain their excitement. The docuseries will follow the band through its 2017 sold-out international “The Wings Tour,” during which BTS stopped by 20 cities across Asia, South America, and the United States. The videos will delve into the more personal sides of the band members, BigHit Entertainment mentioned in a press release, adding that they will include behind-the-scenes interviews and footage of the band’s performances. Viewers in the U.S. and Korea are eligible for a special promotion to watch the series and get two months’ worth of the platform free rather than the typical one-month offer, the press release mentioned. The release of “Burn The Stage” comes after the band’s immense success and swift rise, as BTS not only built fierce fandoms in Asia, but also garnered recognition in Western countries. The band’s achievements have quickly added up and just this year, the Recording Industry Association of America awarded the K-pop group gold certifications for songs “DNA” and “Mic Drop” Remix. They also took home two IHeartRadio Music Awards last week in addition to several other accolades they’ve earned this year. "

His victory is a monumental pickup for Democrats.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa82c441f0000150316a3f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ELIZABETH TOWNSHIP, Pa. ― Democrat Conor Lamb defeated Republican Rick Saccone in a special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District, a GOP-held seat where Donald Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points.Lamb’s projected win comes the day after polls closed, as initial counts were too close to call on Tuesday night. As of Wednesday evening, Lamb held a narrow 627-vote lead, according to both The New York Times and NBC. There are still 500 outstanding provisional, military and absentee ballots to be counted between the four counties in the district, but it appeared unlikely that the election results could change absent further unexpected developments.Pennsylvania does not have an automatic recount in elections on the congressional-district level, but Saccone can still petition for one within five days of the counties completing their vote tabulations. The win is a massive upset by Democrats reflecting the heightened enthusiasm of the party’s liberal base and the general dissatisfaction of many voters with the Trump presidency.The party now has the wind at its back ahead of the midterm elections in November when Democrats hope to wrest control of Congress from the GOP.“The congressional map for potentially competitive races has just gotten a whole hell of a lot bigger,” said Mike Mikus, a western Pennsylvania-based Democratic consultant. “If I’m the Republicans, I’m terrified. If I’m the Democrats, I’m very energized looking toward November.”Republicans have downplayed the broader significance of the race, arguing that it could be explained almost entirely by Saccone’s flaws as a candidate, or more recently, Lamb’s alleged willingness to run a Republican-lite campaign.But the election results show that the GOP needs to do more to appeal to moderate suburban voters, regardless of who the candidate is, said Mark Harris, a Pittsburgh-based Republican strategist.“It’s not a good sign,” he said. “We have to run better campaigns that have messages that are going to resonate with voters regardless of their opinion of the president.”Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District opened up in October when eight-term incumbent Republican Rep. Tim Murphy resigned under pressure. Murphy, who publicly opposed abortion rights, was caught encouraging a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair to get an abortion during a pregnancy scare.Murphy enjoyed a virtually unshakable hold on the southwestern Pennsylvania district, running unopposed in the two previous elections. The district, which was heavily gerrymandered in 2011 to favor Republicans, covers a vast swath of southwestern Pennsylvania. It reaches across four counties and includes the affluent, center-left suburbs of Pittsburgh in the north, the solidly Republican bedroom communities to the east, and the increasingly conservative coal towns by the West Virginia border.But Democrats hoped that in a year marked by liberal fury with Trump, the right candidate could at least be competitive in a special election where turnout was bound to be lower than normal.Lamb, 33, a square-jawed Marine veteran who resigned his assistant U.S. attorney post to run for office, fit the bill like a charm. In addition to his military service, Lamb’s devout Catholic faith and more conservative stances on guns, coal and fracking made him the kind of Democrat that blue-collar voters in the district’s union strongholds would at least be open to supporting. Saccone, a 60-year-old state representative, political science professor and former Air Force counterintelligence officer, is a staunch Tea Party conservative famous for sponsoring a bill that would permit public schools to display the motto “In God We Trust.” After beating three Republican competitors for the party nomination at a closed convention in November ― including state Sen. Guy Reschenthaler, a younger and more moderate up-and-comer ― Saccone made clear that his strategy would be to focus almost exclusively on turning out the right-wing GOP base. “I was Trump before Trump was Trump,” he declared.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s redrawing of the congressional district boundaries in February lowered the immediate stakes of the special election. The 18th District will only exist in its current form until the end of year. Lamb’s hometown of Mt. Lebanon has been moved into the new 17th District, enabling him to subsequently run again in November a place where Trump would have won by just 3 percentage points.But given the symbolic power that a loss in such red territory would have, the official national GOP organs and aligned super PACs poured over $10.7 million into the district to help Saccone win.Initially, those groups blasted Lamb for his opposition to the Republican tax cuts. But Lamb argued in a February debate that he had “always been for middle-class tax cuts,” he simply opposed the GOP legislation because the vast majority of the savings would accrue to the rich and corporations, all while adding $1.5 trillion to the national debt.In apparent recognition that the tax cut line of attack was not working, Republicans began cycling ads about the issue off of the airwaves by the end of February.“Republicans have said the tax issue is gonna be what propels them to victory in November and Lamb showed Democrats how to combat that,” Mikus said.Republicans also struggled to pin Lamb as a liberal stooge for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) ― who is unpopular in the district ― despite featuring her in virtually every attack ad against Lamb.Lamb neutralized the claim by promising in January that he would not vote for Pelosi as leader.“My opponent wants you to believe that the biggest issue in this race is Nancy Pelosi,” Lamb said in a 30-second television ad. “It’s all a big lie.”Distancing himself from Pelosi was one of several ways that Lamb ran as a moderate unafraid to be independent from the national party. When the federal government briefly shut down in January over a dispute about the status of undocumented immigrants, Lamb broke with Senate Democrats to oppose the impasse, insisting that his experience as a Marine would help him build bridges with his Republican colleagues.Lamb occasionally faltered in his attempts to balance the priorities of his liberal base and the swing voters he needed to win. Following the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, Lamb sparked progressive ire with what sounded like Republican talking points. He warned that the “emotions that a lot of us are feeling right now” were not a good reason to adopt new gun restrictions. He favors expanded background checks, but not an assault weapons ban and other more stringent measures.At the same time, Lamb ran as a pro-union economic progressive, promising to protect Social Security and Medicare, shore up coal miners’ distressed pensions and defend collective bargaining rights. Lamb told the progressive Social Security Works PAC that he supported expanding Social Security and Medicare. And while he stopped short of endorsing single-payer health care, Lamb supports empowering Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.Lamb likewise stuck to his support for abortion rights, despite his personal view that life begins at conception and the district’s large Catholic community. With a population that is 93 percent white, Pennsylvania’s 18th is not representative of the country, let alone the districts in which Democrats must generally compete.But in the larger national debate over Democrats’ best routes to victory, Lamb’s win has a little something to offer multiple sides. Like most of the victorious Democratic candidates in recent elections in Virginia and Alabama, Lamb’s base of support is in the educated and affluent suburbs, a locus of Democratic activists and moderate Republicans disgusted with Trump. Yet he also won back some of the working-class voters in outlying counties who historically voted for Democrats, but turned out in droves for Trump in the 2016 election.In the latter task, Lamb relied heavily on the region’s mighty labor unions, which claim nearly a quarter of the district’s voters as their members.Although former Rep. Murphy had a strong working relationship with unions, backing enough of their priorities to elicit their periodic support, Saccone established himself as a major foe of organized labor while serving in the state capitol. He is a supporter of anti-union right-to-work laws and had not made clear whether he would join bipartisan legislation to shore up the troubled union mine workers’ pension fund.Unions mobilized their voter education and turnout machine to inform members and retirees that Saccone was not the kind of Republican they should back. In conversations across the district, union members who voted for Trump and Murphy cited appeals from their unions as a reason why they planned to vote for Lamb.“I can’t cut my own throat,” said Dwight Harris, a 40-year-old Republican coal miner who was voting for Lamb out of concern for his pension.Recognizing that a loss for Saccone would reflect poorly on his political coattails, Trump held a packed rally for the Republican candidate at the Pittsburgh airport on Saturday night. In a speech that focused mostly on his own policy priorities, Trump made the case that he needed Saccone to enact his agenda.“I need people who can help me and this guy can really help me,” he said.But not enough Trump voters saw a vote for Lamb as a betrayal of Trump. Lamb’s lead grew in the final days after enthusiasm for Saccone dropped, according to a Republican official familiar with the polling data.And while Saccone fashioned himself as a copy of Trump, he both lacked the president’s bombastic oratory and ideological flexibility on contentious right-wing social causes.At a Monday rally at a VFW Hall with Donald Trump Jr., Saccone launched into an inflammatory rant against the political left, which he said has a “hatred for our country” and a “hatred for God.”During a Lamb rally at the Greene County fairgrounds on Sunday deep in coal country, Lars Lange, a 64-year-old miner-turned-attorney, thought Lamb was the candidate in the race who most approximated Trump’s political knack for showering attention on economically neglected areas.“He’s coming down to these areas where nobody thinks a Democrat is gonna get supporters and he’s getting all these big crowds,” Lange said. “That he might have taken from Trump’s playbook.”"

In conversations across the district, union members who voted for Trump and Murphy cited appeals from their unions as a reason why they planned to vote for Lamb.“I can’t cut my own throat,” said Dwight Harris, a 40-year-old Republican coal miner who was voting for Lamb out of concern for his pension.Recognizing that a loss for Saccone would reflect poorly on his political coattails, Trump held a packed rally for the Republican candidate at the Pittsburgh airport on Saturday night. In a speech that focused mostly on his own policy priorities, Trump made the case that he needed Saccone to enact his agenda.“I need people who can help me and this guy can really help me,” he said.But not enough Trump voters saw a vote for Lamb as a betrayal of Trump. Lamb’s lead grew in the final days after enthusiasm for Saccone dropped, according to a Republican official familiar with the polling data.And while Saccone fashioned himself as a copy of Trump, he both lacked the president’s bombastic oratory and ideological flexibility on contentious right-wing social causes.At a Monday rally at a VFW Hall with Donald Trump Jr., Saccone launched into an inflammatory rant against the political left, which he said has a “hatred for our country” and a “hatred for God.”During a Lamb rally at the Greene County fairgrounds on Sunday deep in coal country, Lars Lange, a 64-year-old miner-turned-attorney, thought Lamb was the candidate in the race who most approximated Trump’s political knack for showering attention on economically neglected areas.“He’s coming down to these areas where nobody thinks a Democrat is gonna get supporters and he’s getting all these big crowds,” Lange said. “That he might have taken from Trump’s playbook.”"
48,POLITICS,Jeff Sessions Has Power To Shape Asylum Policy. He Could Be Gearing Up To Use It To Deny Relief To Domestic Violence Victims.,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sessions-asylum-deportations_us_5aa9729fe4b0600b82ff93b4,The attorney general has criticized the asylum system. Now he's taking steps that could make getting relief tougher.,2018-03-14,Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said the asylum system is rife with fraud.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa973bb2000003800eb1e9c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Attorney General Jeff Sessions is taking steps toward reshaping asylum policy, potentially in a way that keeps victims of domestic violence and other crime from receiving relief. As attorney general, Sessions has broad powers over immigration courts, which are part of the Department of Justice, not the judicial branch. Sessions has the authority to refer cases to himself, overturn decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals and set precedents.Now, Sessions is set to personally decide the fate of a Salvadoran woman the appeals board deemed eligible for asylum more than a year ago. If Session rules against the woman, he could ensure that she is deported instead of being granted asylum — and that future immigrants seeking asylum on similar grounds meet a similar fate.Sessions has already referred three immigration cases to himself this year — an uncommonly high rate that alarmed experts who fear he is gearing up to dramatically shrink the parameters for who can be spared from deportation. “Are they sitting around the Justice Department looking at every pro-immigrant [Board of Immigration Appeals] decision and trying to figure out a way to gut it?” immigration attorney Hassan Ahmad said, referring to the appeals board that Sessions can supersede. In two of the three cases, Sessions is still in the review stage and has yet to make a final decision. He has indicated that he believes the asylum system is rampant with fraud and that more should be done to remove those cases from overcrowded court dockets. The question now is whether he will change policies in a way that keeps people from receiving asylum even if they do have what is currently considered to be a legitimate case for it, including the large number of Central Americans seeking asylum based on domestic violence and criminal gang persecution. The most recent case Sessions took up for review is for a woman referred to as A.B. in court documents. She is seeking asylum in the United States based on domestic violence she suffered for years under her ex-husband in El Salvador, which was corroborated by two protective orders and affidavits of former neighbors who witnessed the abuse, according to court documents. She says her ex-husband raped her in 2014, a year after they were divorced and three years after she left him. She says she received threats from both her ex-husband’s brother, who is a police officer, and his friend, who said her ex would kill her and he would help him dispose of her body, according to the filings. Her attorney argued that she was eligible for asylum. Not everyone who has been persecuted or fears persecution can receive asylum in the U.S.; they must show they were targeted for a reason, one being membership in a particular social group. Since a landmark Board of Immigration Appeals decision in 2014, some victims of domestic violence have been able to get asylum as members of one such specific social group: “married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship,” a precedent judges have also applied to women from other countries with similar circumstances.North Carolina-based immigration Judge V. Stuart Couch rejected A.B.’s asylum claim in December 2015. He denies most asylum cases ― from fiscal years 2012 to 2017, he rejected about 86 percent of such claims, according to data collected by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. That puts him well above average for denial rates. Nationwide, immigration judges denied nearly 53 percent of asylum claims during the same period, according to TRAC. A.B. took her case to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which disagreed with Couch’s ruling. In December 2016, the board issued a order concluding that A.B. met her burden of proof for being in need of asylum. But Couch didn’t follow through and grant A.B. asylum. Instead, her case sat for months, even after she passed her background check. That’s because Couch disagreed with the Board of Immigration Appeals. Eight months after the board said A.B. should receive asylum, Couch sent her case back to the board to consider it again, arguing she was ineligible because of other court orders rejecting asylum claims, including one from months after the board instructed him to grant A.B. relief pending a background check.In light of other courts’ rulings, the precedent that the board cited to say A.B. was eligible for asylum may not be legally valid in his jurisdiction, Couch wrote in a document returning the case to the Board of Immigration Appeals.The attorney general hasn’t yet made a final decision. But if Sessions ultimately decides that A.B. shouldn’t get asylum, he could also choose to set precedent that makes it harder for other domestic violence victims to receive it. Sessions also indicated he may be looking at asylum more broadly for people who are victims of private criminal activity ― something that could implicate asylum-seekers who were persecuted by gangs. “The concern is, is this some type of reversal of the hard-fought gains that have been made over the last two decades in the specific world of domestic violence?” said Jeremy McKinney, national secretary for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.Sessions is flexing his power over the immigration courts elsewhere, too. In January, Sessions requested briefs on a case related to the power of immigration judges to administratively close cases, which is effectively a pause on removal proceedings, often while an individual has a pending application for a visa or other relief. Sessions asked for briefs to also address what should happen to the roughly 350,000 cases that are currently administratively closed, should he determine that judges did not have the authority to close them. The Department of Justice declined to comment on his considerations for that case.Last Monday, Sessions referred another case to himself. This time, he didn’t ask for briefs to make a decision later ― he scrapped a prior decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals holding that applicants for asylum have the right to a full hearing before a judge. Supporters of the board’s decision argue it is important for immigrants to get a chance to explain their asylum request rather than being rejected based on an application they may have filled out with no legal representation or understanding of what is relevant based on complex asylum law. Sessions and his backers say these hearings aren’t necessary ― if someone’s application isn’t legally viable, they argue, why spend the time on a full hearing, especially when courts are backlogged.“Bad asylum cases prevent good asylum cases from being heard in timely manner,” said Andrew R. Arthur, a former immigration judge who is now a fellow for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels.The way Sessions made the move procedurally didn’t quite instruct judges to deny asylum without hearings, experts said. He didn’t reverse the board’s decision formally, but instead just rendered it moot because the individual in the case had withdrawn his asylum application.This creates a “legal vacuum,” said McKinney of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Some judges may take the decision to mean they can and should reject certain asylum claims without a hearing; if they do, attorneys will likely appeal, potentially putting the entire question back before the Board of Immigration Appeals.Sessions’ power over the immigration courts extends to hiring, too, and he plans to do more of it. The idea of expanding immigration court resources is fairly non-controversial ― people on all sides agree that getting cases processed more efficiently would be a good thing, so long as immigrants’ due process is respected.Sessions announced his intent in February to expand the Board of Immigration Appeals from 17 members to 21, something that will allow him to add more judges who potentially share his views on immigration policy.Whether judges align with Sessions or not, he, like other attorneys general, will have the power to supersede them in a way that couldn’t happen in other types of courts.“Even apart from Jeff Sessions, I’ve never liked the idea that the attorney general can review a decision of the BIA [Board of Immigration Appeals[ at all,” said Stephen Legomsky, a former lead counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under the Obama administration. “When the attorney general substitutes his decision for that of the BIA, it would be analogous to a prosecutor in a criminal case deciding the case.”"
49,POLITICS,Senate Does Equifax A Favor As A Former Executive Is Charged With Insider Trading,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/equifax-senate-bill_us_5aa98af6e4b0004c0406dc60,They decided to pass a bill that could boost the financial fortunes of credit reporting firms.,2018-03-14,Sen. Mark Warner co-authored a provision that could upend FICO to the benefit of the three credit reporting firms.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa9af7f1e000057107aeb65.jpeg?cache=awWqxEnelk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― On the same day federal prosecutors announced criminal charges against a former Equifax executive, the Senate passed legislation that would benefit the troubled company.Prosecutors said Wednesday that former Equifax executive Jun Ying engaged in illegal insider trading by selling company stock last year before the company publicly announced a massive data breach in which hackers had stolen millions of Americans’ personal financial information. Ying allegedly saved thousands of dollars by dumping the stock before that announcement.Also on Wednesday, by a vote of 67-31, the Senate passed a bank deregulation bill containing several sections that affect credit monitoring firms.The legislation would require Equifax, Experian and TransUnion to allow American consumers to freeze their credit reports at no charge and to provide free credit monitoring to members of the armed services. But consumer advocates have complained that these provisions also pre-empt more favorable state laws and limit the ability of customers to sue the companies.Another provision gives Equifax and its peers an advantage in the housing finance industry.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed companies that purchase mortgages from lenders, currently use the Fair Isaac Corporation’s FICO score as part of their evaluation of borrowers’ ability to repay loans. The scores are based on credit reports compiled by the three credit monitoring firms.The Senate bill would require Fannie and Freddie to solicit applications for new credit scoring models that would be evaluated according to a public process. Financial industry experts say the only viable competition to FICO is VantageScore, a product created by a subsidiary of Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.“These are the incumbent players in a highly consolidated industry,” said Chris Whalen, an investment banker focused on mortgage finance.Consumer advocates note that the Federal Housing Finance Agency has already been considering alternatives to FICO, which is just one part of a broader evaluation that also looks at borrowers’ pay stubs and bank accounts. It’s unclear how the agency’s decision-making process will be affected if the bank bill is signed into law, as is expected to happen.“The FHFA still needs to do that, continue with that process, but we pointed out there are other tools that are out there in the marketplace,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who co-authored the provision with Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), told HuffPost.Scott has argued that FICO scores disadvantage minorities and people with limited credit histories because they ignore data on rent, utility and phone payments. In a press release earlier this month, he said the provision would “help credit-invisible Americans be more competitive for mortgage lending and homeownership.”The housing finance agency declined to comment.A Republican aide told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that the provision was added specifically out of concern that the agency would stick with FICO. “We are now trying to enact a law that dictates what path” the agency takes, the aide said.The Federal Housing Finance Agency had noted in a December request for public comment that switching from FICO would have limited benefits for potential homebuyers with weak credit histories, but potentially major consequences for everybody else. “The entire mortgage finance industry will incur operational and transition costs that could result in higher borrowing costs for consumers,” it said.The provision could “bottleneck the mortgage market,” Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of liberal groups, wrote in a letter opposing the broader bill.“I know it’s popular and cool to talk about disrupting markets, but it was disruption and innovation that led to the mortgage meltdown,” said Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, which is part of the coalition.It’s not just liberal groups that are skeptical of opening up credit score competition in the mortgage market. The conservative National Taxpayers Union opposes the provision and has said letting VantageScore into the process would increase the risk of subprime government lending. The organization argued in a letter to the housing finance agency that “introducing competition into this complex space has the potential to create a ‘race to the bottom’ effect on our nation’s housing finance system.”The letter also said that because VantageScore is owned by the three firms that already control credit monitoring, using it to evaluate borrowers would present “a direct conflict of interest.” VantageScore spokesman Jeff Richardson said actually the status quo unfairly boosts the Fair Isaac Corporation. “The only company with a built-in competitive advantage is FICO because it currently has and has long enjoyed a government sanctioned monopoly,” he said in an email.What investors want is a single generally accepted way to evaluate the risk of mortgage-backed securities, so focusing on fostering competition among consumers of credit report information is absurd, according to Whalen, the investment banker.“There does not seem to be any groundswell of demand from lenders or investors for new credit scores,” Whalen wrote in a letter to the housing finance agency. The main group clamoring for change, he added, is the credit reporting companies.Before a procedural vote on Wednesday afternoon, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, called the pro-Equifax provisions “the most awful” part of the bank legislation.“For reasons I can’t even pretend to understand, this bill helps Equifax,” Brown said on the Senate floor. “The same Equifax whose former executive just today was charged with insider trading for dumping his stocks just before the company announced its data breach failure.”"

The data pertain only to pets that flew with the airline’s PetSafe cargo program, so it does not relate to the incident Monday in which a dog died after a passenger was reportedly forced to put her pet in its carrier in the overhead bin during a flight from Houston to New York. Pets that fly in-cabin are typically meant to be stowed underneath the seat in front of the owner.The airline issued a statement Tuesday saying it took full responsibility for the “tragic accident” and said it was conducting a full investigation. But United spokesperson Charlie Hobart said medical experts indicate that an overwhelming number of deaths amid pets who flew in the cargo area last year were due to things beyond the airline’s control, such as preexisting medical conditions.“Any time there’s a death or an incident, United does a thorough review,” Hobart said. “We reach out to the customer, offer our support and condolences, and we work to ensure that it doesn’t happen again.”About a year ago, United was criticized after a giant bunny, which was expected to be named the world’s largest rabbit, died in its cargo area. The Transportation Department numbers indicate how United shapes up with its competitors ― and the comparison doesn’t look good. The airline flew the most pets of any airline in 2017 through the PetSafe cargo program ― 138,178. Eighteen pets died and 13 suffered injuries. Clearly the vast majority of animals that flew reached their destinations without incident.One might think that more pets flown would inevitably translate into a higher number of animal deaths. However, the rate of pet deaths on United Airlines was also more than double that of the airline with the second highest frequency of pet fatalities, American Airlines. The same report from years past indicated that United also had the highest number of pet deaths in 2016 and 2015. Of airlines that experienced pet fatalities, Alaska Airlines had the best track record in 2017, with 114,947 pets flown, two deaths and one missing animal. A cat escaped from its kennel as it was being transported on the grounds of Honolulu International Airport. The feline was never found.“While the number of pet deaths is low, oftentimes when it does happen it’s due to pet stress, such as the animals chewing out of their kennel,” a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines told HuffPost. The airline urged customers to work with their veterinarians to prepare pets for flying weeks before the actual flight.Putting a pet in airline cargo is risky ― no matter the carrier. Over the years, top U.S. airlines have rotated having the highest number of pet deaths. From 2010 to 2012, Delta held the top spot. In an interview with HuffPost last year, Inga Fricke, director of pet retention programs at The Humane Society of the United States, cautioned customers against putting their pets in cargo. “Putting pets in cargo areas should be avoided whenever possible,” she said. “Once that animal is out of your control, there are so many risks it can be exposed to that it’s just not worth it.”"

52,BLACK VOICES,Remy Ma Explains The Importance Of 'Melanin Magic' And Helping Other Women,Princess-India Alexander,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/remy-ma-talks-empowerment-melanin-magic_us_5a95645ee4b0699553cc7930,“I would not be anything but a black woman. That’s life to me.”,2018-03-14,"Remy Ma's song ""Melanin Magic"" celebrates praises dark-skinned black women, who aren't always represented in mainstream media.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a958e161f00002c001689bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remy Ma has been championing women’s empowerment through her music since the days of “Conceited,” and she has no plans on changing.“However you are, that’s how you’re meant to be,” Remy said of the 2005 single while on the phone with HuffPost last month. “And that’s what I want people to hear when they listen to ‘Look at yourself in the mirror like what’s up.’ That’s what I’m giving them.”Born Reminisce Smith, the Bronx native has been active in rap since her debut in 2003. Many regard her as a true game-changer in female rap. Over the course of her career, Remy has made women’s issues an integral part of her platform. After finishing a 6-year prison sentence in 2014, she’s been outspoken about her values: empowering women through her music, denouncing colorism and advocating for female reproductive health.When HuffPost spoke with her, the rapper said this empowerment must start at home.“It starts when women are young,” she said. “Depending on how she’s treated as a child and how she’s taught to view herself will affect how she thinks about herself and other women growing up.”Remy credited her childhood for shaping her views today. She grew up as one girl in a legacy of women taking charge and working together. Her grandmother, mother and four aunts all had a hand in raising her and giving her a clear idea of what strong black women look like. “I had a family that was mostly women,” she said. “I learned in order for us to progress and be progressives, we help each other.”That lesson is something Remy consciously incorporates into her music. “Melanin Magic,” which came out this January and features Chris Brown, praises dark-skinned black women for all of the traits they possess that are commonly dismissed in Eurocentric standards of beauty. Along with the song, Remy launched the #MyMelaninMagic photo series to highlight black women across New York City and share their definitions of melanin magic. “You always hear songs that are about, ‘I got this exotic girl. She half this and she half that’ or she’s yellowbone or redbone,” she said. “You never hear anybody glorifying the people or the women that are brown skin or that are dark skin.”Colorism functions by devaluing darker-skinned people in favor of skin tones that more closely approximate whiteness and white aesthetics. As Remy pointed out, if black women are highlighted in videos or songs, they tend to be lighter-skinned with hair in loose curl patterns. These messages are woven into her platform because very often terms like colorism are seen as exclusive to academia. It’s the divide between “ivory tower feminism” and “grassroots feminism.”“I can’t preach to people the way I’m talking now. They’d be like ‘Aw, here goes Rem again on her rant,’” Remy said. “I have to trick them into it with a beat that they know that’s catchy to them with cutie pop or Chris Brown on the record.”So while Remy’s outward celebration of dark skin in music is still uncommon, she says she’ll always use her music to fight against these very stereotypes and push for more representation for girls like her.“[It’s] for those women who listen to my record like ‘Melanin Magic’ or a record like ‘Conceited’ that I made 10 years ago,” she said. “I want them to hear those songs and be like, ‘You know what? There is nothing wrong with me. I don’t need to change nothing.’”In February, Remy hosted a women’s empowerment brunch, where she discussed how she wants this pride to foster more female collaborations within rap. The industry is notorious for alienating female rappers and simply not giving them the same credit as male artists.Remy believes that women standing together is the answer to their collective success.While some point to her public feud with Nicki Minaj as contradictory to this message, Remy believes that it’s all a lesson in women speaking up for themselves.“And sometimes people are like, oh, she’s just saying that. I don’t feel any woman should tolerate disrespect,” she said. “And that comes from my mom, my grandmother and my aunts. If you have a problem, then say something ... I’m always gonna tell people, stand up for yourself. That’s what women’s empowerment includes as well. ”Remy has also been vocal about issues related to women’s health, publicly discussing in vitro fertilization (IVF) and her own challenges with infertility. After a tragic ectopic pregnancy in 2016, Remy found she could no longer give birth naturally. The process has made her very aware of the issues facing women trying to conceive.Not including the costs of medication and doctor’s appointments, a single IVF cycle can cost between $7,000 and $13,000 in the state of New York. The procedure isn’t covered by insurance in most states. At the 2017 Essence Fest, Remy announced she was going start her own foundation for women unable to afford fertility treatment costs.“Where are these politicians for pro-life when there are women out here who want to have children?” she told HuffPost. “A lot of things that have to do with women always gets swept under the rug. We’re always secondary and that’s why I’m so adamant about the IVF situation.” From women’s health to simply acknowledging how magical black girls are, Remy Ma views her platform as a chance to elevate women. She’s also basking in the proud moments when she acknowledges just how dope her identity is. One of her favorite moments is when the box braids are finally taken out, and her hair is washed and standing alone in all its afro-puff glory. In these moments, so singular to black girlhood, she’s fully herself.“Those are the days where I’m like I wouldn’t wanna be anything else,” she said. “I would not be anything but a black woman. That’s life to me.”"
53,POLITICS,How A Twitter Fight Over Bernie Sanders Revealed A Network Of Fake Accounts,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-bot-network-sally-albright_us_5aa2f548e4b07047bec68023,One Democratic Party consultant said an unnamed client controlled many of these accounts.,2018-03-14,"Someone automated dozens of accounts to amplify anti-Trump, anti-Sanders and pro-Democratic Party content.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa3096d2000002d00eb1431.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Russians at the Internet Research Agency interfered in U.S. politics, they created false online personas and fake political groups to amplify divisive messages that already had a homegrown American audience. It’s not too far from what some U.S. political consultants are doing themselves.Take Sally Albright, a Democratic Party communications consultant who backed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. Unsurprisingly, Albright is vocally opposed to President Donald Trump and a big supporter of the resistance to his administration. She is also one of the loudest, most divisive voices attacking Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clinton’s onetime Democratic primary opponent, and his left-wing supporters.Well after the primary, Albright continues to claim that Sanders is a fraud, a liar, racist and corrupt, among many other things. In one instance she declared that the policy idea of free college, as promoted by Sanders, was racist. This provoked Sanders supporters to argue back.Trevor, a Sanders supporter who declined to provide his last name for fear of being doxxed, but goes by @likingonline on Twitter, noticed a strange pattern of behavior when Albright responded to him. Her tweets addressing him were rapidly retweeted by the same series of accounts. This created a barrage of notifications making it look as though there was an avalanche of opposition to everything he said.But as Trevor discovered, after an extensive amount of research that he posted online, these were not normal accounts. They appeared to be bots ― automated accounts masked as real people being used to amplify a particular political message. Who is really pulling the strings, however, remains a mystery.Albright told HuffPost that the accounts were voluntarily handed over by their original users to an unnamed client of hers to be automated in “an analytics program.” She said she was bound by a non-disclosure agreement and could not disclose who was collecting and automating these accounts or for what purpose.But like her, these accounts were all pro-Clinton, anti-Trump and anti-Sanders.Twitter allows users to automate their accounts, including setting up automatic retweeting and liking of other accounts. This increases activity on the platform, something Twitter obviously wants to do, and allows busy users to promote messages or businesses that they support. Presumably Twitter did not anticipate that users would simply hand their accounts over to another person or campaign to artificially spread the latter’s tweets.The ability to swamp a debate with automated messages is a problem for political discourse around the world. Twitter is a vital platform for political debate. Automating Twitter accounts to retweet or otherwise promote specific messages thus becomes a tactic to silence political debate and squelch free speech.In Mexico, allies of President Enrique Peña Nieto have deployed swarms of Twitter bots to overwhelm and effectively shut down online debates. Journalists in the U.S. experienced a similar flood during the 2016 election from pro-Trump, neo-Nazi sock-puppet accounts posting anti-Semitic death threats. Often instead of suppressing speech it doesn’t like, the Chinese government these days drowns it on local social media platforms with a flood of pro-government content. University of North Carolina scholar Zeynep Tufecki has labeled this tactic a new form of censorship.What the automated accounts deployed by Albright’s unnamed client did was similar.Over the course of the last year or so, Albright was their favorite account to retweet ― almost always as a group. The fake accounts also retweeted people who responded to Albright’s tweets ― again, usually as a group, and often while in a debate with other users.The writers at Shareblue, a pro-Democratic Party news site that supported Clinton in the primary and general elections, were also frequently retweeted by the network of fake accounts, particularly when the Shareblue folks had something negative to say about Sanders. A spokeswoman for Shareblue told HuffPost that the company does not create sock-puppet accounts and has never worked with Albright.These accounts also liked #resistance celebrities like liberal conspiracy theorist Eric Garland (“Time for some game theory”) and Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe. And they were often deployed in intra-Democratic Party battles.When Albright led a Twitter campaign to attack a 2017 women’s conference for inviting Sanders to speak ― after Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) had turned them down ― the automated account network deployed to retweet her and any positive responses to her tweets.Albright probably didn’t need those retweets, as there were actual people opposing the conference’s decision. Still, someone questioned her campaign to block Sanders from speaking, describing it as similar to “Russian division strategy.” She wrote back, “Nyet. I am not Russian.”Then over a dozen fake accounts retweeted her.Within this pro-Albright Twitter force, many of the accounts have taken on false personas with stolen photographs ― just like the Russian trolls that tried to interfere in the 2016 election.The account named for Iris Winter, which is temporarily suspended, uses a picture of Spanish ice dancer Sara Hurtado. Minnie Casera’s supposed picture comes from the Facebook account of Martina Painter, an Alaskan who died on Jan. 11, 2017. The picture used by Georgia Miles is actually Deja Farrior-Quinones, a New Jersey woman who was killed in September 2016 by a car involved in a high-speed police chase. Maggie Campell’s picture is one of Deb Solsrud, a Florida woman who died in a plane crash in December 2016. Madeleine Ware’s photo is really Mary Knowlton, a retired librarian who was killed in August 2016 by a police officer in a practice drill.Allison Rowe’s account uses the picture of Dr. Roberta Guilizzoni, an Italian physicist who works at the National Physical Laboratory in London. Baylee Allmon’s picture is actually the Bosnian model Nejla Hadzic. The account of Callie Calloway uses a picture of Kelsey Lundy, a lobbyist in Arizona for Compass Strategies. Cameron Gibson offers an image of the freelance travel writer Sarah Gordon that appeared in the Daily Mail. Francie McCormack has taken her picture from the Twitter account of Callie Maries. The photo of Lena Robinson is actually Ashlynn Sparks, an Alabama teenager who was shot to death in 2016.The account of Gwen Barstow is temporarily restricted, probably because it used an image of Meaghan Delcourt, an Ottawa woman who was in the local news in 2015 after her apartment balcony collapsed underneath her.Cheryl Montgomery’s account @cherry_mgm was suspended in February after Catherine Simpson, a public relations professional in Vancouver, Canada, alerted Twitter that it was using her picture. The theft of Simpson’s photo to create this fake account was previously reported by the Canadian Global News. Albright admitted to HuffPost that she had handed over a number of accounts to that unnamed client that had been connected to previous projects of hers and that were no longer in use. She also said that she changed the pictures for some of them.One of the Albright-linked accounts, @OvrTheBayBridge, appears to have a picture of an actual person named Kirby Manning. But the Manning photo has been taken from someone else and appropriated for this account. The real person is Brinkley Hutchings, a leadership coach and environmental activist in Alabama.Other accounts that Albright said she provided to her client’s project included @PropagandaMnstr, @DruidCityMedia, @VotrProtection, @BucksPocket, @Sallying and @SocialCapitol. Each of these accounts was connected to a website domain that had been purchased by Albright.The accounts that link directly to websites owned by Albright and those pretending to be people they are not exhibit similar patterns of behavior. They retweet Albright and other accounts with similar messages at an extremely high rate. Each account has made tens of thousands of tweets, almost all of which are retweets. And they all almost exclusively post using an application called Buffer.Buffer, a social media management application with more than 2 million users, allows an individual to schedule tweets, retweets and likes; to schedule posts on other social media sites; and to control multiple accounts at once. It provides a limited free service for ordinary users and more extensive paid services for businesses and social media professionals.In March 2017, Albright tweeted a complaint at Buffer about a problem she was having with a recent update. In one tweet in that conversation, she posted a screenshot of her Buffer account. That screenshot showed a number of profile pictures from Twitter accounts under her control through Buffer.Among the pictures were those of @PropagandaMnstr, @CapWaterfront and @BucksPocket, all accounts known to be linked to her. There were also profile pictures for accounts that Trevor had listed in his original exposé of potentially fake accounts, including @FactoryofTruth, @_Stacey_Eff, @FordColvin, @GatsbyGirl, @PoliticalSavvy, @WTHisBill and @__SallyForth.Albright told HuffPost that this screenshot was “really old” and that she no longer had access to the Buffer account controlling those accounts.While it is still not known what organization was actually behind these automated accounts, most of them ceased operations after they were spotted by Trevor.Meanwhile, Albright, who said she is no longer connected to the unknown project, concedes that this kind of automation may be problematic.“I don’t really see it as the same thing as the Russian accounts, but I guess since you’re calling me about it, I guess that means that it’s something that I didn’t think that it was ― if that makes sense,” Albright said. “People seem upset by it in a way I did not anticipate.”"
54,POLITICS,How A Twitter Fight Over Bernie Sanders Revealed A Network Of Fake Accounts,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-bot-network-sally-albright_us_5aa2f548e4b07047bec68023,One Democratic Party consultant said an unnamed client controlled many of these accounts.,2018-03-14,The original image from skater Sara Hurtado's Instagram account (left) and the image used on the fake Twitter account named Iris Winter.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa2f8a52000003800eb1429.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Russians at the Internet Research Agency interfered in U.S. politics, they created false online personas and fake political groups to amplify divisive messages that already had a homegrown American audience. It’s not too far from what some U.S. political consultants are doing themselves.Take Sally Albright, a Democratic Party communications consultant who backed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. Unsurprisingly, Albright is vocally opposed to President Donald Trump and a big supporter of the resistance to his administration. She is also one of the loudest, most divisive voices attacking Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clinton’s onetime Democratic primary opponent, and his left-wing supporters.Well after the primary, Albright continues to claim that Sanders is a fraud, a liar, racist and corrupt, among many other things. In one instance she declared that the policy idea of free college, as promoted by Sanders, was racist. This provoked Sanders supporters to argue back.Trevor, a Sanders supporter who declined to provide his last name for fear of being doxxed, but goes by @likingonline on Twitter, noticed a strange pattern of behavior when Albright responded to him. Her tweets addressing him were rapidly retweeted by the same series of accounts. This created a barrage of notifications making it look as though there was an avalanche of opposition to everything he said.But as Trevor discovered, after an extensive amount of research that he posted online, these were not normal accounts. They appeared to be bots ― automated accounts masked as real people being used to amplify a particular political message. Who is really pulling the strings, however, remains a mystery.Albright told HuffPost that the accounts were voluntarily handed over by their original users to an unnamed client of hers to be automated in “an analytics program.” She said she was bound by a non-disclosure agreement and could not disclose who was collecting and automating these accounts or for what purpose.But like her, these accounts were all pro-Clinton, anti-Trump and anti-Sanders.Twitter allows users to automate their accounts, including setting up automatic retweeting and liking of other accounts. This increases activity on the platform, something Twitter obviously wants to do, and allows busy users to promote messages or businesses that they support. Presumably Twitter did not anticipate that users would simply hand their accounts over to another person or campaign to artificially spread the latter’s tweets.The ability to swamp a debate with automated messages is a problem for political discourse around the world. Twitter is a vital platform for political debate. Automating Twitter accounts to retweet or otherwise promote specific messages thus becomes a tactic to silence political debate and squelch free speech.In Mexico, allies of President Enrique Peña Nieto have deployed swarms of Twitter bots to overwhelm and effectively shut down online debates. Journalists in the U.S. experienced a similar flood during the 2016 election from pro-Trump, neo-Nazi sock-puppet accounts posting anti-Semitic death threats. Often instead of suppressing speech it doesn’t like, the Chinese government these days drowns it on local social media platforms with a flood of pro-government content. University of North Carolina scholar Zeynep Tufecki has labeled this tactic a new form of censorship.What the automated accounts deployed by Albright’s unnamed client did was similar.Over the course of the last year or so, Albright was their favorite account to retweet ― almost always as a group. The fake accounts also retweeted people who responded to Albright’s tweets ― again, usually as a group, and often while in a debate with other users.The writers at Shareblue, a pro-Democratic Party news site that supported Clinton in the primary and general elections, were also frequently retweeted by the network of fake accounts, particularly when the Shareblue folks had something negative to say about Sanders. A spokeswoman for Shareblue told HuffPost that the company does not create sock-puppet accounts and has never worked with Albright.These accounts also liked #resistance celebrities like liberal conspiracy theorist Eric Garland (“Time for some game theory”) and Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe. And they were often deployed in intra-Democratic Party battles.When Albright led a Twitter campaign to attack a 2017 women’s conference for inviting Sanders to speak ― after Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) had turned them down ― the automated account network deployed to retweet her and any positive responses to her tweets.Albright probably didn’t need those retweets, as there were actual people opposing the conference’s decision.

55,POLITICS,Banning High-Capacity Magazines Should Absolutely Be A Winnable Issue,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/high-capacity-magazine-ban_us_5aa843c9e4b0f7a689cd31ff,"It might not be politically feasible yet, but it's a smart way to start reducing casualties in mass shootings.",2018-03-14,"Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and Westglades Middle School gather to honor the 17 students and staff members killed at the high school in Parkland, Florida, last month.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa9aaf01f00002d0016a618.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A gunman entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School a month ago on Wednesday and opened fire with a semi-automatic AR-15-style rifle, killing 17 people and injuring 17 more. He shot nearly 150 rounds during the 10-minute attack, and reportedly would have continued if his weaponry had cooperated.Instead, dumb luck brought an end to the rampage when the shooter’s rifle jammed as he attempted to reload it with a fresh magazine, law enforcement sources told Florida media outlets. Other sources suggested the perpetrator “fumbled” while trying to reload. Whether user error or a technical malfunction, this mishap appeared to save lives. With police closing in, the gunman discarded his firearm and fled the school with a bag full of ammunition, blending in with evacuating students.In many ways, it’s a telling indictment of U.S. gun policy that 17 lives were cut short and we can feel lucky that it wasn’t worse. But if lawmakers are going to continue relying on luck alone to mitigate the carnage of mass shootings, the least they could do is work to stack the odds against murderers and in favor of their victims.One way to do that would be to pass a federal restriction on high-capacity magazines. This would limit the number of rounds a mass shooter could fire uninterrupted, meaning they’d have to reload more often, and not be able to shoot as many people in between. More reloading would result in a higher probability of a malfunction or mistake, giving law enforcement more time to respond and bystanders more opportunity to flee or fight back.“Even though it’s fairly easy to interchange magazines, any time you do is a point at which firing stops,” said Robert Spitzer, a professor at SUNY Cortland who’s written five books on gun policy. “People drop the magazines. They jam. In a real live fire situation, people are often nervous, even including those who are committing these crimes.”Most standard magazines for military-style rifles like AR-15s hold 30 rounds, though 10-round versions are also common. There are conflicting reports about whether the Parkland shooter used 10-round magazines or 30-round magazines, but regardless, the incident appears to demonstrate the value of forcing criminals to reload.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) hinted as much during a town hall with Stoneman Douglas students last month, when he said he’d consider a ban on high-capacity magazines after being told that several people were able to escape while the shooter was reloading. He later introduced legislation that ignored magazines entirely.Magazine capacity restrictions have been hotly debated at both the state and federal levels. The 1994 federal assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, included a 10-round cap on magazines. That limit would be reinstated under both House and Senate bills to renew the assault weapons ban.Eight states and Washington, D.C., have also passed measures restricting magazines of various sizes, with most implementing a 10-round limit as part of broader assault weapons ban legislation. Many of those laws have faced legal challenges, though federal courts have generally upheld them and the Supreme Court has so far declined to hear a challenge.“If the federal government enacted a high-capacity magazine ban, it would be constitutionally permissible,” said Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the UCLA School of Law who has written extensively on gun policy.Gun advocates often argue that the purpose of the Second Amendment is to ensure that an armed citizenry would be capable of rising up against a tyrannical government, but the Supreme Court has established that the core Second Amendment right pertains to self-defense. As long as the court maintains that position, it would be hard to justify a change on this issue, said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.“Having 10 rounds of ammunition to fire doesn’t materially infringe [on] the ability to use the gun for self-defense, especially when considered in light of the state’s interest to limit the ability of shooters to commit mass carnage,” he said.But to probe the issue of civilian versus government firepower a bit deeper, it’s worth noting that many high-capacity magazines available to the public are larger than the 30-round magazines law enforcement and domestic military personnel typically use. The Las Vegas gunman last October was equipped with a number of 100-round magazines, for example.While we’re weighing if civilians should have access to more than 10 rounds in a magazine, perhaps we should be asking the same of government agents. After all, if police or military officers can’t hit what they’re aiming for in 10 shots, maybe they shouldn’t be able to shoot another 20 rounds without reloading.Although the federal assault weapons ban legislation includes an exception for law enforcement, making it a universal restriction might help reverse the vicious cycle of militarization of both civilians and the state, said Skaggs.“The argument is that we make these products legal, giving criminals the ability to get these magazines, so we have to arm our law enforcement with more and more militaristic weapons because the civilian population has them,” Skaggs said. “It creates a one-way ratchet. Each side has to continually be more armed.”High-capacity magazine bans have traditionally been considered in conjunction with more sweeping assault weapons ban legislation, but there may be a few reasons to introduce such proposals on their own.Magazine capacity restrictions are slightly less politically polarizing than assault weapons bans, according to recent surveys, with some polls showing majority support even among Republicans. At the same time, many experts predict that restricting high-capacity magazines would be just as effective at reducing mass shooting deaths as banning assault weapons.There are also legitimate questions about the scope of assault weapons bans. Although it’s clear that just one bullet from a military-style rifle can inflict horrific damage to a human body, the same can be said of most rifles, including non-military style rifles that fire higher caliber rounds more slowly. In mass shooting scenarios, the elevated threat of a rifle like an AR-15 is primarily a function of its high volume and rate of fire, not the cosmetic features and other attachments often associated with so-called assault weapons.By focusing on how many rounds a weapon can shoot before it has to be reloaded, a high-capacity magazine ban more narrowly addresses the lethality of the firearm, said Winkler.“It makes a lot more sense, public policy-wise, to ban high-capacity magazines than it does to ban military-style rifles,” he said.But such an effort would also pose significant challenges. High-capacity magazines have been standard issue on some of the most popular rifles sold in the U.S. in recent decades, meaning there are tens of millions of them already out there. States that have banned high-capacity magazines have generally outlawed the sale and manufacture of new devices, while grandfathering in the possession of items that were legal when the ban was enacted. The federal proposals include a similar clause.When implemented on a state-by-state basis, these restrictions can be easily circumvented. Someone in a state where high-capacity magazines are banned can simply purchase them in a more gun-friendly state and bring them home. Although those magazines might technically be illegal under state law ― and transporting them across state lines certainly would be ― they don’t typically come stamped with a manufacture date, meaning law enforcement generally wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between a banned device and a legally possessed one.These are inherent weaknesses with the system of federalism, especially when it comes to gun laws, and further evidence that regulating high-capacity magazines might be best addressed at the federal level. But the current proposal would likely raise enforceability issues as well, simply because it would be difficult to keep track of the devices that get grandfathered in. Despite the complications, Spitzer maintains any move toward restricting high-capacity magazines is a step in the right direction. “At least you’re not producing and selling more of them,” he said. “If your basement is filling with water because of a broken pipe, the first thing you do is turn off the water. It doesn’t eliminate the water in the basement, but at least it keeps more water from coming in.”Still, it’s important to be realistic about the limitations of a high-capacity magazine ban. The current debate comes in response to increasingly frequent and deadly mass shootings, in which many of the perpetrators have used military-style rifles and high-capacity magazines. These incidents are deeply troubling and deserving of a policy response that can begin to reverse this bloody trend, even if it can’t prevent it altogether. But mass shootings are also a small problem of the overall gun violence picture, and they look markedly different than the overwhelming majority of incidents, which involve handguns outfitted with standard-capacity magazines.“I don’t think anyone would argue with a straight face that if we limit people to magazines of 10 or 15 rounds we’d solve the entire gun violence problem, but what we can do is expect to have a real effect on how many people are injured and killed in mass shooting incidents,” said Skaggs.And it might take patience to see results.“When you have 350 million guns out there, any law you adopt is going to take a long time to work, if it works at all,” said Winkler. “It’s a reform that would take generations to work, rather than days or months.”Of course, there are more cynical reasons to think a high-capacity magazine ban might not get much support at the federal level. With Republicans in control of all three branches of government and showing little interesting in opposing the National Rifle Association, even the soundest of reasoning might not make a difference.“It’s not about the logic of the argument, but the principle of no new gun control laws that’s really driving the NRA,” said Winkler."

57,POLITICS,Senate Passes Bill To Deregulate Banks With Democrats' Help,Arthur Delaney and Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-bank-deregulation-democrats_us_5aa96d81e4b0004c0406b33c,"Small banks, big banks and even credit monitoring companies like Equifax score with this legislation.",2018-03-14,The idea of helping Wall Street while increasing the likelihood of a bailout wasn't unsavory enough to stop the Senate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa96e6f1e00008e0b7aeb14.jpeg?cache=GyxPUpRaZg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Senate on Wednesday passed a bill so friendly to banks that even a Republican worried it goes too far.By a vote of 67-to-31, the Senate passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which is aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on struggling community banks ― even though most such banks are thriving. Supporters also argued that the bill would make it easier for Americans to buy a home by increasing their access to capital.The measure would also exempt 25 of America’s biggest banks from regulations created in response to the financial crisis that contributed to the Great Recession a decade ago. The Congressional Budget Office warned that the risk of another financial crisis “would be slightly greater under the legislation.”The prospect of helping Wall Street while increasing the likelihood of a bailout situation was unsavory enough to prompt one Republican on the Senate Banking Committee to try to make the bill less favorable to huge banks. The amendment from Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) never had much of a chance, however. While dozens of changes to the bill were proposed, party leaders were unable to reach an agreement to vote on any of them. Part of the legislation could allow JPMorgan Chase and Citibank, two of the very biggest banks in the U.S., to hold less capital relative to their assets, undercutting one of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law’s safety measures. Corker wanted to strike that provision.“Capital standards matter and leverage ratios matter a great deal to me,” Corker told HuffPost.The bill sailed through the Senate thanks in large part to backing from a mix of centrist and red-state Democrats, who argued that small and regional banks had nothing to do with the excesses of Wall Street prior to the 2008 recession.Those Democrats also touted several new “consumer protections” in the bill. While the legislation delivers favors to banks, it ostensibly cracks down on credit monitoring companies like Equifax, which exposed millions of consumers’ financial information to hackers last year. One provision would require such firms to give customers free credit freezes, although critics have complained that measure would also pre-empt more generous state laws and still allow employers and insurance companies to look at otherwise frozen credit reports. The bill also gives Equifax and other credit monitoring firms a leg up in the mortgage business.It’s unclear whether the House would vote to pass the Senate bill as is or amend it with other items. Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told reporters last week that the current Senate bill didn’t satisfy him and that he looked forward to attaching several other provisions.“I’m really pleased with what the Senate accomplished, but I actually think our legislation is better,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said Wednesday.Major changes to the bill, however, could threaten its support among Senate Democrats.Democrats themselves had proposed a range of amendments, some to improve the bill and some that were more about messaging. One proposal from Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) would have reined in corporate stock buybacks, which have surged since Congress passed a huge corporate tax cut in December.“The Senate functions best when people’s ideas can get a full debate,” Baldwin told HuffPost.The provision that caught Corker’s attention would allow “custodial” banks, which hold assets on behalf of other institutions, to not count certain assets for purposes of calculating additional leverage requirements on banks with more than $250 billion in assets. Though they’re not custodial banks, the Congressional Budget Office has said that JPMorgan and Citibank could benefit from the provision depending on its regulatory interpretation. Corker’s amendment would have taken away that uncertainty by deleting the entire section.Corker told HuffPost that he has talked about the issue with the Federal Reserve, which is one of the bank regulators that enforces the supplementary leverage ratio, as the Dodd-Frank provision is known. He suggested that simply having his proposed amendment in the Congressional Record would be a signal to bank regulators and also to the lawmakers whose job it will be to merge the different bills from the House and Senate. “We’re just trying to create some legislative history here,” Corker said. “I want to make sure that we give the Fed plenty of room to do what they feel is appropriate in that regard.”This article has been updated to reflect that the bill passed the Senate.

Tillerson urged Trump against pulling out of the Paris Agreement last June, and suggested last September that the U.S. could remain in the deal. Still, the State Department rewrote its web page on climate change last March, abolished its climate change envoy position in August and left teams working on global warming issues in limbo, seemingly encouraging staff to leave. Coincidentally, a major environmental nonprofit sued the State Department on Tuesday for refusing to release a U.N. report on U.S. climate action that was due on Jan. 1. If confirmed by the Senate, Pompeo seems poised to do more damage to efforts to combat climate change. “It’s good news for us,” said Myron Ebell, a leading proponent of climate change denial and a director at the right wing Competitive Enterprise Institute. “I expect very good things from him at the State Department.”Ebell, who led Trump’s transition at the Environmental Protection Agency, said he hopes Pompeo will convince the president to withdraw the U.S. from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, completely ending all U.S. participation in climate talks. He also wants Pompeo to “bury” an international deal to phase out refrigerants, coolants and aerosols called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, that contribute to climate change. The deal, signed by 197 countries in October 2016, is called the Kigali Amendment. Last November, the State Department quietly indicated its support for the agreement.  In his six years as a Republican congressman from Kansas, Pompeo voted so routinely against environmental policies that he received a 4 percent lifetime score on the League of Conservation Voters’ ranking. In 2011, he unsuccessfully pushed to end energy subsidies in a move Ebell said was meant to target tax credits for wind turbines. Throughout his tenure in Congress, Pompeo received over $1 million in donations from the billionaire Koch brothers’ network, making him their top recipient in the Trump administration. He collected $71,100 from Koch Industries, the Republican megadonors’ fossil fuel conglomerate, catapulting Pompeo to the top of the company’s recipients in Congress in 2016 alone, according to data collated by the Center for Responsive Politics.In January 2017, Pompeo skirted questions about his view on climate science during his Senate confirmation hearing to become CIA director.“Frankly, as the director of CIA, I would prefer today not to get into the details of the climate debate and science,” he said. “It seems — my role is going to be so different and unique from that.”In December 2015, Pompeo railed against the Obama administration for brokering the Paris climate agreement, the global deal to cut planet-warming emissions that virtually every nation on Earth has now signed. “For President Obama to suggest that climate change is a bigger threat to the world than terrorism is ignorant, dangerous, and absolutely unbelievable,” he said at the time.Pompeo called the accord part of a “radical climate change agenda.” He even used the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people to inveigh against Obama, claiming he “continues this pursuit of misguided policies, including his radical climate change agenda,” according to a since-deleted statement cited by Climate Central.  In December 2013, Pompeo rejected the consensus among 97 percent of peer-reviewed climate researchers that the planet is warming and burning fossil fuels, industrial farms and deforestation are the main causes. “Look, I think the science needs to continue to develop,” he said during a segment on C-SPAN. “I’m happy to continue to look at it. There are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change. There’s some who think we’re warming, there’s some who think we’re cooling, there’s some who think that the last 16 years have shown a pretty stable climate environment.”Environmental groups swiftly condemned Trump’s decision to name Pompeo as secretary of state.“Donald Trump has now somehow picked someone even worse than Rex Tillerson to run the State Department,” Naomi Ages, Greenpeace USA’s climate director, said in a statement. “In addition to being a climate denier, like his predecessor, Pompeo is Koch brothers’ shill who will denigrate the United States’ reputation abroad and make us vulnerable to threats at home.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa776cc1f00001503169f52.jpeg?cache=42AdiskngE&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Oskar Groening, a former Nazi SS guard known as the “Bookkeeper of Auschwitz,” has reportedly died at age 96 without serving a day of his four-year prison sentence for being an accessory to murder.Groening, one of the last Nazi war criminals to face trial for the genocide of Europe’s Jews during World War II, died in a hospital last week, German media reported.As an Auschwitz guard, Groening had been tasked with sorting through banknotes and other belongings taken from arriving prisoners. He was convicted in 2015 for being an accessory to the murders of 300,000 people. His jail term was delayed, however, by bouts of ill health and appeals.Groening’s defense lawyers pleaded for clemency, given his advanced age, but prosecutors in Hanover last year deemed him “fit for prison.”Born in 1921 in Lower Saxony in Germany, Groening was raised by his ultranationalist father after his mother died when he was 4 years old. Groening joined the Waffen-SS at the age of 20 and arrived in Auschwitz in 1942. In court, he admitted to sharing “moral guilt” for crimes at the death camp, but maintained he never personally murdered prisoners.“I ask for forgiveness,” Groening told the judge during his trial. “I share morally in the guilt but whether I am guilty under criminal law, you will have to decide.”After WWII, Groening worked in a glass-making factory in Lower Saxony, reported BBC. Decades later, he decided to speak publicly about his experiences during the war — becoming one of a very small number of Nazi personnel to do so.Groening said at the time that he had chosen to speak out to persuade Holocaust deniers of the truth. “I would like you to believe me. I saw the gas chambers. I saw the crematoria. I saw the open fires,” he told the BBC in 2005. “I would like you to believe that these atrocities happened because I was there.” Legally and symbolically, Groening’s trial had profound significance in Germany, where most Nazi officers were never prosecuted for crimes related to the Holocaust. Of the 6,500 former SS members who served at Auschwitz and survived the war, fewer than 50 were convicted. Groening’s trial, noted the Guardian in 2015, went “to the heart of the question of whether people who were small cogs in the Nazi machinery, but did not actively participate in the killing of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, were guilty of crimes.”Reacting to news of Groening’s death this week, Efraim Zuroff, chief Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said it was “unfortunate, at least on a symbolic level” that Groening never served prison time. “Without at least symbolic justice, these trials ― as important as they are ― lose an important part of their significance,” Zuroff told the BBC. “Their victims never had any appeals, nor did their tormentors have any mercy. Consequently these perpetrators don’t deserve either.”On Tuesday, Eva Mozes Kor, an Auschwitz survivor who made headlines in 2015 for publicly expressing forgiveness of Groening, shared a photograph on Twitter of her and the former SS guard taken during his trial. “He testified about his experiences and validated my testimony,” she wrote of Groening. “He said that he was sorry that he was part of Nazi regime ― that was important to denounce it!” "
61,POLITICS,Trump's Weak Gun Proposal Is A Big Political Test For The Parkland Movement,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gun-donald-trump-student-walkout_us_5aa7fb25e4b0a09afeae74ba,Wednesday's walkouts are a chance for advocates to show they won't give up.,2018-03-13,"Jonathan Cohn - Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c34278a210000e109cb7fcb.png?ops=100_100,"Students across the country are planning to walk out of their schools on Wednesday in a demonstration demanding action on gun violence. The timing could not be better, because the renewed campaign for tougher gun laws now faces its biggest test ― whether, in the face of a major political setback, it can sustain the energy that has kept it going since February’s mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.That setback happened on Monday, when President Donald Trump released his proposal for fighting gun violence.Less than two weeks ago, Trump presided over a televised, bipartisan meeting at the White House, where he boasted of standing up to the National Rifle Association and vowed to pass the kind of ambitious, meaningful gun legislation that his predecessor could not. But the agenda Trump released Monday is yet another example of big talk before tiny action.It doesn’t include expanding background checks so that they include all sales. It doesn’t include a ban on some or all assault-style weapons. He’s not even endorsing more anodyne proposals, like a higher minimum age for the purchase of assault weapons.Instead, Trump is calling to arm teachers, tweak the current background check system, and launch a blue-ribbon commission that will “investigate” options for further action.The commission’s leader will be Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education ― yes, the person who keeps getting confused about her own department’s policies during public appearances and, during her confirmation hearings, said she supported guns in schools in case of grizzly bear attacks in places like Wyoming.Trump did endorse one potentially important policy idea: passing laws that would give law enforcement power to take guns from people who threaten public safety. But that was an exhortation for states, not Congress, to act.The pattern, alas, is familiar. After the Sandy Hook massacre in December 2012, then-President Barack Obama made new gun legislation the first priority of his second term. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, worked with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania to craft a bipartisan bill to expand background checks.But every other Republican opposed it and a handful of Democrats did too. It was six votes short of the 60 it needed to clear the Senate. The bill didn’t lack popular support. On the contrary, polls at the time showed that a large majority of Americans supported expanding background checks. But more rural, more conservative states have disproportionate power in the Senate, and their lawmakers tend to be more skeptical of gun legislation. The ones who might have been wavering ― the ones who believe firmly in a right to bear arms but also consider background checks a reasonable way to manage ownership ― worried about political backlash. They figured the polls didn’t capture the intensity gap on guns, which has historically favored the NRA and its allies. Come the next election, these lawmakers figured, the only voters who would care or remember about a background check bill would be the ones who oppose gun legislation.The political landscape looks pretty similar right now. Universal background checks are extremely popular. So are bans on assault-style weapons. Support for these ideas has, if anything, grown since the Parkland shooting. But Republicans are in charge of Congress, and many oppose new gun legislation on principle. The ones willing to consider aggressive gun legislation figure they have more to fear from angry supporters of gun rights than they do from angry supporters of gun control laws.The student-led movement for new gun laws can change that.Wednesday’s demonstrations are the first step. If students really walk out, all across the country, it will be a sign that the movement represents more than a fleeting reaction to the Parkland shooting.Next comes the march on Washington, at the end of the month. If turnout looks anything like it did for the 2017 women’s march, it will capture national media attention and suggest that supporters can maintain their intensity, just as the NRA and its allies always have.But the push for new gun laws can’t stop there, because the election is still more than seven months away. Advocates need to keep applying pressure in a visible way ― by, for example, showing up at public events for lawmakers who would oppose new gun laws.That model worked pretty well for defenders of the Affordable Care Act in 2017. Although many Republican lawmakers responded by canceling their public, town hall-style events, that strategy won’t work this time, because the Republicans will have to be out campaigning.Advocates for new gun laws will also need to hone their arguments about what they want and why they think it will work. This should be easier than it was after Sandy Hook, because organizations like the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Everytown For Gun Safety and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence have spent the intervening years gathering and analyzing research, and translating it for advocates who are trying to make arguments.Choosing targets will also be a challenge. The primary focus of the campaign will inevitably be Republicans, because as long as the GOP is in charge of Congress, meaningful legislation has virtually no chance of passing. But there are Democrats who oppose gun legislation, and the new movement will have to single them out too. That means pointing out Democrats like Conor Lamb, the candidate hoping to win Tuesday’s special election for a Republican House district in Pennsylvania. Lamb has said he opposes new gun laws.Above all, though, the advocates for legislation have to keep calling b.s. when they see it. That very much includes Monday’s effort from the White House, which administration officials have tried desperately to portray as ambitious. The Trump administration’s gambit here is clear. Officials want to make the vast majority of Americans who support meaningful gun laws believe the administration is on their side, while endorsing measures that either won’t make much difference or won’t pass anyway.It’s easy to assume the gambit will succeed, because that’s how the gun debate has played out in the recent past. But there are reasons to think this time will be different. One of them is the students leading the movement right now. They have the country’s sympathy, but they are also smart and savvy. They grasp intuitively how to make arguments and organize through social media. What they don’t know, they are learning quickly.And they are not alone. They are part of a broader uprising against Trump, his allies and the policies they pursue. It started with the women’s march, carried on through the fight against Obamacare repeal, and has grown to include protests on behalf of Dreamers and West Virginia public school teachers.That is the kind of movement that can produce legislation and, ultimately, save lives. They just have to keep at it. Wednesday is their first opportunity."

The footage captured reporter Liang Xiangyi ― who works for Yicai, China’s largest financial media conglomerate ― rolling her eyes as another reporter, Zhang Huijun, asks a question during a convening of the National People’s Congress.While these press conferences are typically heavily scripted and choreographed, often peppered with questions meant to spotlight the government’s achievements, the eyeroll wasn’t. Just moments after the eyeroll aired, Chinese netizens flooded social media platforms like Weibo and Sina to discuss it. Viewers said they appreciated Liang’s honesty during the press conference, which many described as a dry event, while others laughed at the reporter’s unfiltered facial expressions. Social media users even came out with GIFs and parodies of the moment:Zhang, the reporter who asked the question, works for American Multimedia Television USA, a California-based outlet that appears to have a relationship with Chinese state-run media outlet China Central Television. Her question was directed at government official Xiao Yaqing, and partly involved what his plans were for 2018 and what he would do to protect Chinese state-owned enterprises.Netizens said the question was so long that it resembled a speech and likely prompted Liang’s eyeroll.The Communist Party quickly made moves to censor Liang’s name on social media, and rumors have been swirling that she has been suspended from her position. However, Liang’s employment status has not been confirmed, and Yicai hasn’t released a statement on the incident. "

In a report he co-wrote for the Stimson Center, Mirzayanov described how the chemicals were developed at the State Scientific Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology in Moscow during the final years of the Cold War. At the time, the U.S. and the Soviet Union were making public pledges to dismantle their existing stockpiles of chemical weapons. Novichok, Mirzayanov said, was developed in secret and designed to be undetectable to inspectors. According to NPR, Novichok is made with organophosphates, commercially available chemicals that are used in fertilizers and pesticides.They possess a different chemical structure to some other nerve agents, though their effect on the human body is said to be the same.Symptoms of Novichok poisoning can appear almost immediatelyNovichok, like other nerve agents, work by blocking messages from the nervous system to the muscles.“The reason you die from these [chemicals] is very simple,” Dr. Lewis Nelson, chairman of emergency medicine at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, told LiveScience. “If your muscles don’t work you can’t breathe, and if you can’t breathe you eventually die.”The effects of Novichok poisoning on the human body can be almost immediate with symptoms appearing as quickly as 30 seconds to 2 minutes following exposure. Symptoms of Novichok poisoning include constricted pupils, convulsions, drooling and, in serious cases, coma, respiratory failure and possibly death. What to do if you’re exposedIf a person is exposed to Novichok, their clothing should be removed, their eyes rinsed out and their skin washed with soap and water. Oxygen should also be administered.British health authorities said on Sunday offered guidance to anyone who was in the area where Sergei Skripal, the 66-year-old former Russian spy, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia Skripal, were found incapacitated. Recommendations include washing one’s clothes and cleaning one’s phone using baby wipes.“While there is no immediate health risk to anyone who may have been in either of these locations, it is possible, but unlikely, that any of the substance which has come into contact with clothing or belongings could still be present in minute amounts and therefore contaminate your skin,” officials said. “Over time, repeated skin contact with contaminated items may pose a small risk to health.”The agent can take on a variety of formsNovichok can exist as both a liquid and also a powder. According to the BBC, a powdered version of the agent can take longer to act, with symptoms not appearing until as long as 18 hours after exposure. Mirzayanov said some Novichok variants are “binary agents,” which means they can be stored as two less toxic chemicals that only become hazardous when mixed together. “One of the main reasons these agents are developed is because their component parts are not on the banned list,” Gary Stephens, a pharmacology expert at the University of Reading, told the BBC. “It means the chemicals that are mixed to create it are much easier to deliver with no risk to the health of the courier.”Novichok is more toxic ― and more difficult to identify ― than other nerve agents.Novichok is believed to be much more toxic than other known nerve agents.In his report, Mirzaryanov said that one variant, dubbed Novichok-5, was five to eight times as deadly as VX, the agent that North Korea allegedly used last year to murder Kim Jong Un’s half-brother.“This is a more dangerous and sophisticated agent than sarin or VX and is harder to identify,” said Stephens.It takes special expertise to make NovichokDan Kaszeta, a U.K.-based chemical weapons expert, told NPR this week that Novichok has long been a “deep-dark secret” that very few know how to create.“As far as I know, I don’t know anybody who knows how to make it except these guys in Russia,” Kaszeta said, referring to the scientists who developed the weapon. Though the ingredients found in the agent are relatively accessible, turning them into the chemical weapon requires the expertise and equipment typically only found in government-level laboratories, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.“With these kinds of substances, they are just so dangerous that no fly-by-night terrorist group is going to cook this up,” Andrea Sella, a professor of inorganic chemistry at University College London, told the news agency.The Kremlin has vehemently denied that it was involved in the poisoning attack.

The return on investment is not good. We know that.”The governor said she told Zinke that drilling off Oregon’s coastline also isn’t worth the risk because it falls along the Cascadia subduction zone fault line, and that activity there could increase the risk of an earthquake.“That’s what’s different about the western coast,” she said.It’s a sign of hope for Oregon, which, like many other coastal states, desperately wants an exemption from the Trump administration’s drilling plans, which include opening up federal waters to drilling off of California for the first time in decades and expanding oil and gas exploration all along the East Coast.North Carolina Gov.

And while everyone present was there to support Lamb, the main event was Cecil Roberts, the charismatic preacher and president of the UMWA labor union.After ascending the stage to chants of “U-M-W-A,” Roberts delivered a nearly 30-minute sermon in which he managed to portray a vote for Lamb in Tuesday’s special election as a sacred and patriotic act in keeping with the godly social justice tradition of Moses, Gandhi, UMWA founder John Lewis, Martin Luther King Jr. and the recently victorious West Virginia teachers’ strike.“We’re God-fearing folks down here in these coal fields,” Roberts roared in his West Virginia twang. “I believe in God and so do you and we don’t apologize to anybody for that.”“The bible tells us some day we’re all gonna be judged by how we treat the least of these, and the labor movement and the Democratic Party are about treating the least with respect and lifting them up,” he continued, to loud applause and affirmative shouts of “that’s right” from attendees.To hear Roberts tell it, the struggles of organized labor reflect a deep spiritual and patriotic fervor ― a fervor that Lamb shares.“It just excites me when people run up to me with a camera and say, well, ‘Tell me what kind of person Conor is.’ We don’t know each other personally, but let me tell ya, I know what he’s about,” he intoned in his breathy preacher’s cadence.“Let me try to explains [sic] to ya what kind of folks we are and what kind of Democrat Conor is. He’s a God-fearing, union-supporting, gun-owning, job-protecting, pension-defending, Social Security-believing, health care-greeting and sending-drug-dealers-to-jail Democrat!” he bellowed in conclusion as the audience rose to their feet and broke out in chants of “CON-OR, CON-OR.”Elements of the rally ― the religiosity, the pro-gun rhetoric and the romantic attachment to coal country ― would surely make more socially liberal Democrats squirm.But for better or worse, Roberts’ speech was the rhetorical capstone of a campaign that has sought to bring rank-and-file union members who voted for Donald Trump or past Republican congressional candidates back into the Democratic fold.And in union-heavy congressional districts like Pennsylvania’s 18th, if not in the country at large, organized labor remains a powerful tool in Democrats’ toolkit.Suburban women played a key role in Democrats’ electoral sweep in Virginia in November. And black women got credit for helping put Democrat Doug Jones over the top in his surprise win in the Alabama Senate race in December.Now it’s labor unions’ turn to bask in the spotlight: If Lamb wins Tuesday, he will owe much of his success to them.Lamb has acknowledged as much, telling the audience at the UMWA rally that organized labor has “been the heart and soul of this campaign.”A Lamb victory would not merely give organized labor an avowed policy champion, however. It would elevate the political capital of unions across the country by reminding both major political parties of their power to sway close contests ― particularly in the swing-voting industrial states along the Great Lakes.“What this race shows already, regardless of the outcome, is that labor is still very relevant and still has a lot of clout and the ability to organize and affect elections,” said Mike Mikus, a Democratic political consultant based in western Pennsylvania. Organized labor has experienced a steady decline in the country in the past few decades, devastated by the hollowing out of manufacturing and employers’ increasingly aggressive union avoidance tactics. Just 10.7 percent of American workers belong to unions, down from 20.1 percent in 1983.But in Pennsylvania’s 18th, with its high concentration of steelworkers, coal miners, carpenters and civil servants, about 23 percent of voters remain unionized.Thanks to more conservative views on hot-button issues like guns, abortion and immigration, rank-and-file union members have increasingly lent their support to Republicans, often against the advice of their leaders.President Trump, with his talk of reviving American manufacturing and coal mining, proved especially effective at picking off union members in this region. The UMWA, fretful about the effect of the Obama administration’s environmental regulations on the coal industry and Clinton’s promise to continue them, declined to endorse a presidential candidate in 2016.Nationwide, Hillary Clinton received 10 percent fewer votes from union members than Barack Obama in 2012, according to an internal survey by the AFL-CIO, a national umbrella federation of labor unions.Area Republicans have also proven adept at signaling that they are, at the very least, not enemies of unions. Former Rep. Tim Murphy, a Republican whose October resignation amid a sex scandal sparked Tuesday’s special election, actually secured the endorsement of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO in 2016 when he ran unopposed. He supported several union policy priorities as well, voting in 2007 for the Democratic-sponsored Employee Free Choice Act, which would have made it easier to unionize.“If Tim Murphy wouldn’t have gotten caught up in this scandal, I’d vote for him every time,” said Dwight Harris, a Republican union coal miner from the city of Washington, who plans to vote for Lamb.This time, however, the choice for labor unions is stark. Lamb, who hails from a prominent, pro-labor Democratic family (his uncle, Michael Lamb, is Pittsburgh city controller), has pledged his full support for a host of union priorities, from an infrastructure bill to bipartisan legislation that would shore up coal miners’ underfunded pensions.In the final week of his campaign, Lamb held at least three major rallies with labor unions, including a Tuesday assembly at the local chapter of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters where former Vice President Joe Biden spoke, and a Friday rally at the United Steel Workers’ headquarters where Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) and other elected officials addressed a crowd of at least 300.At every event, Lamb speaks poignantly about the vital role of unions, noting that Philip Murray, the founder of the modern United Steel Workers, enjoys a saintly monument in a Catholic cemetery in the Pittsburgh suburb of Castle Shannon.“In western Pennsylvania, it’s no surprise that we put a statue of one of our great labor leaders right there in the churchyard for everyone to see, forever,” he said in a January stump speech in Houston, Pennsylvania.In contrast, Lamb’s opponent, Republican Rick Saccone, is as clear-cut an adversary as organized labor has had in the region in some time. Among other offenses, he supports right-to-work laws and has not been clear about his stance on federal legislation to aid the coal miners’ pensions.As a state representative, Saccone has been a constant thorn in unions’ side. He infuriated building trades unions with his vote against a 2013 transportation infrastructure bill, and irked public-sector unions with his vote for a 2017 bill that would have made it harder to collect dues from their workers.The district’s frequently divided labor unions have united against him, activating their sophisticated voter education and turnout machine to inform their members that Saccone is not the kind of Republican they can get behind. The phone calls, emails and in-person admonitions that organized labor makes to its members often carry more weight than contact made by unknown campaign canvassers.Across the district, union members who happily voted for Murphy and either stayed home or backed Trump in 2016, said that they were choosing Lamb over Saccone thanks to appeals from their unions.Scott Zeszutek, a 48-year-old union electrician, voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 presidential primary, then left the top of the ballot blank in November because of his personal disdain for Hillary Clinton. He also regularly voted for Murphy.But in a Saturday conversation at the smoke-filled Cuddy Sports Club in Cuddy Hill, Zeszutek said he would vote for Lamb. A representative of his union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 5, called him to say that Saccone supported right-to-work laws. That is a dealbreaker for Zeszutek, who believes that preventing unions from compelling dues payment from workers they represent is tantamount to theft.“If they start taking money out of my pocket, what are they going to do for the rest of this country?” Zeszutek said.Of course, labor unions’ efforts on Lamb’s behalf have not been without their hiccups. Lamb rankled some union officials during a February debate in which he disavowed the $15 minimum wage, which has become a leading progressive cause thanks to the organizing work of the Service Employees International Union.Lamb’s remarks prompted rare public griping from some labor officials, which Republican groups have tried to capitalize on in campaign literature.(For his part, Saccone said he opposes an increase in the minimum wage, which is $7.25 in Pennsylvania, and argued that the floor on pay should be “market-driven.”)Darrin Kelly, a union firefighter who is now president of the Allegheny County Labor Council, said that organized labor was at least guaranteed an audience with Lamb when it disagrees with him.“The best thing about what we have with Conor Lamb is that we know he’ll listen,” Kelly said. “That’s all we really want when we help someone get elected ― is to make sure that our voices get heard.”"

The UMWA, fretful about the effect of the Obama administration’s environmental regulations on the coal industry and Clinton’s promise to continue them, declined to endorse a presidential candidate in 2016.Nationwide, Hillary Clinton received 10 percent fewer votes from union members than Barack Obama in 2012, according to an internal survey by the AFL-CIO, a national umbrella federation of labor unions.Area Republicans have also proven adept at signaling that they are, at the very least, not enemies of unions. Former Rep. Tim Murphy, a Republican whose October resignation amid a sex scandal sparked Tuesday’s special election, actually secured the endorsement of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO in 2016 when he ran unopposed. He supported several union policy priorities as well, voting in 2007 for the Democratic-sponsored Employee Free Choice Act, which would have made it easier to unionize.“If Tim Murphy wouldn’t have gotten caught up in this scandal, I’d vote for him every time,” said Dwight Harris, a Republican union coal miner from the city of Washington, who plans to vote for Lamb.This time, however, the choice for labor unions is stark. Lamb, who hails from a prominent, pro-labor Democratic family (his uncle, Michael Lamb, is Pittsburgh city controller), has pledged his full support for a host of union priorities, from an infrastructure bill to bipartisan legislation that would shore up coal miners’ underfunded pensions.In the final week of his campaign, Lamb held at least three major rallies with labor unions, including a Tuesday assembly at the local chapter of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters where former Vice President Joe Biden spoke, and a Friday rally at the United Steel Workers’ headquarters where Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) and other elected officials addressed a crowd of at least 300.At every event, Lamb speaks poignantly about the vital role of unions, noting that Philip Murray, the founder of the modern United Steel Workers, enjoys a saintly monument in a Catholic cemetery in the Pittsburgh suburb of Castle Shannon.“In western Pennsylvania, it’s no surprise that we put a statue of one of our great labor leaders right there in the churchyard for everyone to see, forever,” he said in a January stump speech in Houston, Pennsylvania.In contrast, Lamb’s opponent, Republican Rick Saccone, is as clear-cut an adversary as organized labor has had in the region in some time. Among other offenses, he supports right-to-work laws and has not been clear about his stance on federal legislation to aid the coal miners’ pensions.As a state representative, Saccone has been a constant thorn in unions’ side. He infuriated building trades unions with his vote against a 2013 transportation infrastructure bill, and irked public-sector unions with his vote for a 2017 bill that would have made it harder to collect dues from their workers.The district’s frequently divided labor unions have united against him, activating their sophisticated voter education and turnout machine to inform their members that Saccone is not the kind of Republican they can get behind. The phone calls, emails and in-person admonitions that organized labor makes to its members often carry more weight than contact made by unknown campaign canvassers.Across the district, union members who happily voted for Murphy and either stayed home or backed Trump in 2016, said that they were choosing Lamb over Saccone thanks to appeals from their unions.Scott Zeszutek, a 48-year-old union electrician, voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 presidential primary, then left the top of the ballot blank in November because of his personal disdain for Hillary Clinton. He also regularly voted for Murphy.But in a Saturday conversation at the smoke-filled Cuddy Sports Club in Cuddy Hill, Zeszutek said he would vote for Lamb. A representative of his union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 5, called him to say that Saccone supported right-to-work laws. That is a dealbreaker for Zeszutek, who believes that preventing unions from compelling dues payment from workers they represent is tantamount to theft.“If they start taking money out of my pocket, what are they going to do for the rest of this country?” Zeszutek said.Of course, labor unions’ efforts on Lamb’s behalf have not been without their hiccups. Lamb rankled some union officials during a February debate in which he disavowed the $15 minimum wage, which has become a leading progressive cause thanks to the organizing work of the Service Employees International Union.Lamb’s remarks prompted rare public griping from some labor officials, which Republican groups have tried to capitalize on in campaign literature.(For his part, Saccone said he opposes an increase in the minimum wage, which is $7.25 in Pennsylvania, and argued that the floor on pay should be “market-driven.”)Darrin Kelly, a union firefighter who is now president of the Allegheny County Labor Council, said that organized labor was at least guaranteed an audience with Lamb when it disagrees with him.“The best thing about what we have with Conor Lamb is that we know he’ll listen,” Kelly said. “That’s all we really want when we help someone get elected ― is to make sure that our voices get heard.”"

After Trump tweeted Tuesday about his plans to replace current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Pompeo, several advocates pointed out that Pompeo has long had a “toxic relationship” with American Muslims ― so much so that in 2016, he won a top award from Act for America, an organization the Southern Poverty Law Center considers an anti-Muslim hate group.Hoda Hawa, director of policy and advocacy for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, called Pompeo a “divisive” figure whose confirmation would further erode American Muslims’ trust in their government.“As the top diplomat for the United States, it is crucial that the Secretary of State carries out a foreign policy agenda that doesn’t marginalize American communities,” Hawa told HuffPost in an email. “Pompeo has shown, both as a Member of Congress and as the CIA Director, that his personal feelings inform his policies.”Scott Simpson, a spokesperson for Muslim Advocates, expressed similar concerns.“Mike Pompeo has made a career of bigotry and hate,” Simpson said. “This announcement should concern every congressmember and American who values religious freedom.”The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story.Pompeo’s tense relationship with American Muslims goes back to his days as a tea party representative for Kansas’ 4th District. In a 2013 speech on the House floor, Pompeo falsely accused Muslim leaders of being silent after the Boston Marathon bombing.“Instead of responding, silence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts, and more importantly still, in those that may well follow,” Pompeo said in that speech.In reality, American Muslim leaders swiftly and unequivocally condemned the attack, just as they’ve done for other acts of terrorism before and since the Boston Marathon bombing.Robert McCaw, director of government affairs for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told HuffPost that Pompeo has “made no attempt to make amends” for this false allegation.McCaw said he fears that Pompeo’s “toxic” relationship with American Muslims would impede his ability to build lasting relations with Muslim-majority countries as secretary of state.“All Americans, especially American Muslims, need a Secretary of State that is willing to push back” against the “rising tides of anti-American sentiment and Islamophobia that is spreading overseas in response to the Trump Administration’s American First and anti-Muslim policy agenda,” McCaw told HuffPost. Pompeo has also been criticized for his ties to Brigitte Gabriel and Frank Gaffney, two prominent anti-Muslim activists.Gaffney is the head of the Center for Security Policy, a D.C.-based think tank that promotes the conspiracy theory that Muslims are seeking to supersede the U.S. Constitution with Islamic religious law, or Sharia ― even though no national Muslim organization has ever called for such a move. According to The Atlantic, Pompeo spoke at the CSP’s “Defeat Jihad” summit in 2015 and has appeared on Gaffney’s radio show more than 20 times.Gabriel is the founder of Act for America, one of the nation’s largest grassroots anti-Muslim groups. In the past, Gabriel has claimed that practicing Muslims cannot be loyal citizens of the United States. Her group has successfully lobbied state legislatures to introduce bills banning “foreign” law in U.S. courts. Last year, Act for America organized nationwide “March Against Sharia” protests against the nonexistent threat of Sharia law.Pompeo has repeatedly spoken at Act for America’s national conferences, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also reportedly sponsored an Act for America legislative briefing at the Capitol in 2016.In a post on Act for America’s site, Gabriel said Pompeo has been a “steadfast ally” since the day he was elected to Congress. She said that in 2016, the group gave Pompeo its “highest honor,” a National Security Eagle Award.The SPLC says that Trump’s appointment of Pompeo betrays the president’s “anti-Muslim agenda.”“At a time when we’re seeing hate groups have unprecedented access to the White House, Pompeo’s ties to anti-Muslim hate groups are extremely alarming,” the SPLC said Tuesday in a statement. “This new position gives anti-Muslim extremists another ally in a high place.”In the past, Pompeo has indicated that he can distinguish between Islam and terrorism. According to The Wichita Eagle, Pompeo visited the Middle East for a “fact-finding” trip in 2015. Afterward, he told Wichita’s Republican Pachyderm Club that “there are many Muslims of good will” who “despise this extremism as much as anyone of any other faith.”Still, McCaw said American Muslims have a fundamental “lack of faith” in Pompeo’s commitment to ensuring their safety abroad. He also doesn’t think Pompeo, who has expressed support for refugee resettlement bans in the past, will challenge Trump’s travel ban. The ban is directed at people from eight countries, six of which are Muslim-majority. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments over the third iteration of the ban in April.“Pompeo must make amends for his past Islamophobic actions and stances. However, there is not enough time before his confirmation hearing to gain CAIR [or] the Muslim community’s support for his nomination,” McCaw said.Khaled Beydoun, author of American Islamophobia: Understanding the Roots and Rise of Fear, told HuffPost that Trump’s appointment of Pompeo reflects the administration’s “commitment to a ratcheted-up War on Terror.”“Trump has been critiqued for his rhetorical Islamophobia,” Beydoun said, “but appointments like this manifest that his state-sponsored Islamophobia is far more harmful.” Christopher Mathias contributed to this report."

To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here. By Aviva ChomskyThe immigration debate seems to have gone crazy.President Obama’s widely popular Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which offered some 750,000 young immigrants brought to the United States as children a temporary reprieve from deportation, is ending... except it isn’t... except it is... President Trump claims to support it but ordered its halt, while both Republicans and Democrats insist that they want to preserve it and blame each other for its impending demise. (Meanwhile, the Supreme Court recently stepped in to allow DACA recipients to renew their status at least for now.)On a single day in mid-February, the Senate rejected no less than four immigration bills. These ranged from a narrow proposal to punish sanctuary cities that placed limits on local police collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials to major overhauls of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act that established the current system of immigration quotas (with preferences for “family reunification”).And add in one more thing: virtually everyone in the political sphere is now tailoring his or her pronouncements and votes to political opportunism rather than the real issues at hand.Politicians and commentators who once denounced “illegal immigration,” insisting that people “do it the right way,” are now advocating stripping legal status from many who possess it and drastically cutting even legalized immigration. These days, the hearts of conservative Republicans, otherwise promoting programs for plutocrats, are bleeding for low-wage workers whose livelihoods, they claim (quite incorrectly), are being undermined by competition from immigrants. Meanwhile, Chicago Democrat Luis Gutiérrez ― a rare, reliably pro-immigrant voice in Congress ― recently swore that, when it came to Trump’s much-touted wall on the Mexican border, he was ready to “take a bucket, take bricks, and start building it myself... We will dirty our hands in order for the Dreamers to have a clean future in America.”While in Gutiérrez’s neck of the woods, favoring Dreamers may seem politically expedient, giving in to Trump’s wall would result in far more than just dirty hands, buckets, and bricks, and the congressman knows that quite well. The significant fortifications already in place on the U.S.-Mexican border have already contributed to the deaths of thousands of migrants, to the increasing militarization of the region, to a dramatic rise of paramilitary drug- and human-smuggling gangs, and to a rise in violent lawlessness on both sides of the border. Add to that a 2,000-mile concrete wall or some combination of walls, fences, bolstered border patrols, and the latest in technology and you’re not just talking about some benign waste of money in return for hanging on to the DACA kids.In the swirl of all this, the demands of immigrant rights organizations for a “clean Dream Act” that would genuinely protect DACA recipients without giving in to Trump’s many anti-immigration demands have come to seem increasingly unrealistic. No matter that they hold the only morally coherent position in town ― and a broadly popular one nationally as well ― DACA’s congressional backers seem to have already conceded defeat.Good Guys and Bad GuysIt won’t surprise you, I’m sure, to learn that Donald Trump portrays the world in a strikingly black-and-white way when it comes to immigration (and so much else). He emphasizes the violent criminal nature of immigrants and the undocumented, repeatedly highlighting and falsely generalizing from relatively rare cases in which one of them committed a violent crime like the San Francisco killing of Kate Steinle. His sweeping references to “foreign bad guys” and “shithole countries” suggest that he applies the same set of judgments to the international arena.Under Trump’s auspices, the agency in charge of applying the law to immigrants, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has taken the concept of criminality to new heights in order to justify expanded priorities for deportation. Now, an actual criminal conviction is no longer necessary. An individual with “pending criminal charges” or simply a “known gang member” has also become an ICE “priority.” In other words, a fear-inspiring accusation or even rumor is all that’s needed to deem an immigrant a “criminal.”And such attitudes are making their way ever deeper into this society. I’ve seen it at Salem State University, the college where I teach. In a recent memo explaining why he opposes giving the school sanctuary-campus status, the chief of campus police insisted that his force must remain authorized to report students to ICE when there are cases of “bad actors... street gang participation... drug trafficking... even absent a warrant or other judicial order.” In other words, due process be damned, the police, any police, can determine guilt as they wish.And this tendency toward such a Trumpian Manichaean worldview, now being used to justify the growth of what can only be called an incipient police state, is so strong that it’s even infiltrated the thinking of some of the president’s immigration opponents. Take “chain migration,” an obscure concept previously used mainly by sociologists and historians to describe nineteenth and twentieth century global migration patterns. The president has, of course, made it his epithet du jour.Because the president spoke of “chain migration” in such a derogatory way, anti-Trump liberals immediately assumed that the phrase was inherently insulting. MSNBC correspondent Joy Reid typically charged that “the president is saying that the only bill he will approve of must end what they call ‘chain migration’ which is actually a term we in the media should just not use! Because quite frankly it’s not a real thing, it’s a made up term... [and] so offensive! It’s shocking to me that we’re just adopting it wholesale because [White House adviser] Stephen Miller wants to call it that... [The term should be] family migration.”Similarly, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand claimed that “when someone uses the phrase chain migration... it is intentional in trying to demonize families, literally trying to demonize families, and make it a racist slur.” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi agreed: “Look what they’re doing with family unification, making up a fake name, chain. Chain, they like the word ‘chain.’ That sends tremors through people.”But chain migration is not the same as family reunification. Chain migration is a term used by academics to explain how people tended to migrate from their home communities using pre-existing networks. Examples would include the great migration of African Americans from the rural south to the urban north and west, the migrations of rural Appalachians to Midwestern industrial cities, waves of European migration to the United States at the turn of the last century, as well as contemporary migration from Latin America and Asia.A single individual or a small group, possibly recruited through a state-sponsored system or by an employer, or simply knowing of employment opportunities in a particular area, sometimes making use of a new rail line or steamship or air route, would venture forth, opening up new horizons. Once in a new region or land, such immigrants directly or indirectly recruited friends, acquaintances, and family members. Soon enough, there were growing links ― hence that “chain” ― between the original rural or urban communities where such people lived and distant cities. Financial remittances began to flow back; return migration (or simply visits to the old homeland) took place; letters about the new world arrived; and sometimes new technologies solidified ongoing ties, impelling yet more streams of migrants. That’s the chain in chain migration and, despite the president and his supporters, there’s nothing offensive about it.Family reunification, on the other hand, was a specific part of this country’s 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which imposed quotas globally. These were then distributed through a priority system that privileged the close relatives of immigrants who had already become permanent residents or U.S. citizens. Family reunification opened paths for those who had family members in the United States (though in countries where the urge to migrate was high, the waiting list could be decades long). In the process, however, it made legal migration virtually impossible for those without such ties. There was no “line” for them to wait in. Like DACA and Temporary Protected Status (TPS), the two programs that President Trump is now working so assiduously to dismantle, family reunification has been beneficial to those in a position to take advantage of it, even if it excluded far more people than it helped.Why does this matter? As a start, at a moment when political posturing and “fake news” are becoming the norm, it’s important that the immigrant rights movement remain accurate and on solid ground in its arguments. (Indeed, the anti-immigrant right has been quick to gloat over Democrats condemning a term they had been perfectly happy to use in the past.) In addition, it’s crucial not to be swept away by Trump’s Manichaean view of the world when it comes to immigration. Legally, family reunification was never an open-arms policy. It was always a key component in a system of quotas meant to limit, control, and police migration, often in stringent ways. It was part of a system built to exclude at least as much as include. There may be good reasons to defend the family reunification provisions of the 1965 Act, just as there are good reasons to defend DACA ― but that does not mean that a deeply problematic status quo should be glorified.Racism and the Immigrant “Threat”Those very quotas and family-reunification policies served to “illegalize” most Mexican migration to the United States. That, in turn, created the basis not just for militarizing the police and the border, but for what anthropologist Leo Chávez has called the “Latino threat narrative”: the notion that the United States somehow faces an existential threat from Mexican and other Latino immigrants.So President Trump has drawn on a long legacy here, even if in a particularly invidious fashion. The narrative evolved over time in ways that sought to downplay its explicitly racial nature. Popular commentators railed against “illegal” immigrants, while lauding those who “do it the right way.” The threat narrative, for instance, lurked at the very heart of the immigration policies of the Obama administration. President Obama regularly hailed exceptional Latino and other immigrants, even as the criminalization, mass incarceration, and deportation of so many were, if anything, being ramped up. Criminalization provided a “color-blind” cover as the president separated undocumented immigrants into two distinct groups: “felons” and “families.” In those years, so many commentators postured on the side of those they defined as the deserving exceptions, while adding further fuel to the threat narrative.President Trump has held onto a version of this ostensibly color-blind and exceptionalist narrative, while loudly proclaiming himself “the least racist person” anyone might ever run into and praising DACA recipients as “good, educated, and accomplished young people.” But the racist nature of his anti-immigrant extremism and his invocations of the “threat” have gone well beyond Obama’s programs. In his attack on legal immigration, chain migration, and legal statuses like DACA and TPS, race has again reared its head explicitly.Unless they were to come from “countries like Norway” or have some special “merit,” Trump seems to believe that immigrants should essentially all be illegalized, prohibited, or expelled. Some of his earliest policy moves like his attacks on refugees and his travel ban were aimed precisely at those who would otherwise fall into a legal category, those who had “followed the rules,” “waited in line,” “registered with the government,” or “paid taxes,” including refugees, DACA kids, and TPS recipients ― all of them people already in the system and approved for entry or residence.As ICE spokespeople remind us when asked to comment on particularly egregious examples of the arbitrary detention and deportation of long-term residents, President Trump has rescinded the Obama-era “priority enforcement” program that emphasized the apprehension and deportation of people with criminal records and recent border-crossers. Now, “no category of removable aliens [is] exempt from enforcement.” While President Trump has continued to verbally support the Dreamers, his main goal in doing so has clearly been to use them as a bargaining chip in obtaining his dramatically restrictionist priorities from a reluctant Congress.The U.S. Customs and Immigration Service (USCIS) made the new restrictionist turn official in late February when it revised its mission statement to delete this singular line: “USCIS secures America’s promise as a nation of immigrants.” No longer. Instead, we are now told, the agency “administers the nation’s lawful immigration system, safeguarding its integrity and promise... while protecting Americans, securing the homeland, and honoring our values.”Challenging the Restrictionist AgendaMany immigrant rights organizations have fought hard against the criminalization narrative that distinguishes the Dreamers from other categories of immigrants. Mainstream and Democrat-affiliated organizations have, however, generally pulled the other way, emphasizing the “innocence” of those young people who were brought here “through no fault of their own.”Dreamers, TPS recipients, refugees, and even those granted priority under the family reunification policy have all operated as exceptions to what has long been a far broader restrictionist immigration agenda. Trump has now taken that agenda in remarkably extreme directions. So fighting to protect such exceptional categories makes sense, given the millions who have benefited from them, but no one should imagine that America’s policies have ever been generous or open. Regarding refugees, for example, the State Department website still suggests that “the United States is proud of its history of welcoming immigrants and refugees... The U.S. refugee resettlement program reflects the United States’ highest values and aspirations to compassion, generosity, and leadership.” Even before Trump entered the Oval Office, this wasn’t actually true: the refugee resettlement program has always been both small and highly politicized. For example, out of approximately seven million Syrian refugees who fled the complex set of conflicts in their country since 2011 ― conflicts that would not have unfolded as they did without the American invasion of Iraq ― the United States has accepted only 21,000. Now, however, the fight to preserve even such numbers looks like a losing rearguard battle.Given that a truly just reform of the country’s immigration system is inconceivable at the moment, it makes sense that those concerned with immigrant rights concentrate on areas where egregious need or popular sympathy have made stopgap measures realistic. The problem is that, over the years, this approach has tended to separate out particular groups of immigrants from the larger narrative and so failed to challenge the underlying racial and criminalizing animus toward all those immigrants consigned to the depths of the economic system and systematically denied the right of belonging.In a sense, President Trump is correct: there really isn’t a way to draw a hard and fast line between legal and illegal immigration or between the felons and the families. Many immigrants live in mixed-status households, including those whose presence has been authorized in different ways or not authorized at all. And most of those felons, often convicted of recently criminalized, immigration-related or other minor violations, have families, too.Trump and his followers, of course, want just about all immigrants to be criminalized and excluded or deported because, in one way or another, they consider them dangers to the rest of us. While political realism demands that battles be fought for the rights of particular groups of immigrants, it’s no less important to challenge the looming narrative of immigrant criminalization and to refuse to assume that the larger war has already been lost. In the end, isn’t it time to challenge the notion that people in general, and immigrants in particular, can be easily divided into deserving good guys and undeserving bad guys?Aviva Chomsky is professor of history and coordinator of Latin American studies at Salem State University in Massachusetts and a TomDispatch regular.

The alleged crimes are said to not be related to Trump.The Wall Street Journal, which was the first to break the news of McEntee’s ouster, reported that he was removed because of an “unspecified security issue,” citing an unidentified White House official.McEntee wasn’t allowed to collect his belongings ― including his jacket ― before being escorted out, according to the Journal.The DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.McEntee previously served as an aide to Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, and the Trump campaign announced Tuesday that he will rejoin the organization as a senior adviser for campaign operations. He’ll work alongside Katrina Pierson, who served as the 2016 campaign’s national spokesperson and will now oversee the campaign’s national grassroots outreach.If there was any issue with McEntee inside the White House, Trump’s campaign hasn’t acknowledged it. “As we build out our operations for the 2018 mid-term elections and the 2020 reelection campaign, we are pleased to welcome back two outstanding members of our 2016 team,” Brad Parscale, the Trump for President campaign manager, said in a statement. “We need the help of proven leaders such as Katrina and John to promote the President’s growing portfolio of achievements across the country.”News of McEntee’s reported removal came Tuesday morning, when Trump also announced he had moved to replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. He said he had nominated Gina Haspel to be the new director of the CIA. The news also came nearly a week after it was reported that several White House staffers were either terminated or reassigned because of issues related to their security clearances. More than 30 White House staffers were stripped of their top-level security clearances, pending the completion of a background check. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who is a senior Trump adviser, also had his clearance downgraded.This story has been updated to include news of a reported criminal investigation."

Now, the woman who went public with her allegations against her former youth pastor is again speaking out about her experience, this time urging American churches to more fully reckon with their responsibility to sexual assault victims.“We as a church, of all places, should be getting this right,” Jules Woodson said in a New York Times op-ed video published on Friday. “It’s unfathomable to me that the secular world, Hollywood, are taking a stand. The church should have been the first group to stand up and say, ‘We will not allow this.’”Woodson came forward in January with allegations against her former youth pastor, Andy Savage. She claims that when she was 17 in 1998, Savage drove her to a private location after a church event in Texas and forced her to perform sexual acts. She said church leaders at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church (which later changed its name to StoneBridge Church) urged her to keep quiet and promised the church would take care of the matter internally.Savage later moved to Memphis, where he eventually became a pastor at Highpoint Church. After Woodson came forward with her story in January, Highpoint Church initially said that it had “total confidence in the redemptive process” Savage went through after he allegedly assaulted Woodson. Savage was placed on leave after the church received backlash in the national media ― one critic called the congregation’s response, which was streamed online, the standing ovation “heard round the world.” Savage said during his apology that he told Highpoint’s lead pastor about the incident before coming on board as staff.The New York Times filmed Woodson’s reactions to a video recording of Savage delivering his apology at Highpoint Church. Woodson criticized the apology, pointing out that Savage called what happened to her a “sexual incident” and repeatedly referred to the fact that it happened decades ago.“I was and remain very remorseful for the incident and deeply regret the pain I caused her and her family as well as the pain I caused the church and God’s kingdom,” Savage said during his apology. “My repentance over this sin 20 years ago was done believing that God’s forgiveness is greater than any sin. And I still believe that.”Woodson was in tears as she spoke in the op-ed video about the alleged crime and her church’s response.“I looked up to him. I trusted him,” Woodson said about Savage in the video. “What happened was a crime. This is not something that the church should handle internally.” “I want our churches to change how they handle sexual assault,” she added. “Sexual assault in the church. It’s a crime, not just a sexual sin.”Woodson’s words echo the reflections of other survivors of sexual abuse in Christian communities. Inspired by the Me Too movement, survivors have used the hashtag #ChurchToo to share stories of abuse that happens in church settings.Hannah Paasch, one of the founders of #ChurchToo, claims that a culture of purity in evangelical church settings has created the ideal of a “gentle and quiet” woman who accept the authority and leadership of men. “The stories that have poured in through the hashtag prove to me that the evangelical church, in its current iteration, actively supports the confessing abuser over the victim and, in the name of ‘having no appearance of evil,’ has managed to silence thousands of sexual and physical abuse allegations throughout the years,” Paasch wrote in an op-ed for HuffPost. Historian Neil J. Young, who studies the religious right, wrote that evangelical churches often tend to place the abuser at the center of the story, making the priority “forgiveness for his sins rather than justice for her injury.” “It is his words of confession and embarrassment, but also often rationalization, that a church body gathers together to hear on a Sunday morning, not her cries of rage and pain that they must confront,” Young wrote in an op-ed for HuffPost. “If #MeToo has been about breaking the silence, the evangelical response has been to allow the abuser’s voice to fill the void.”Highpoint has initiated two investigations into how the church handled the allegations against Savage, and whether its current policies are sufficient to safeguard the safety of children. On March 4, the church released a statement saying that the investigation was “wrapping up” and that its initial findings “give us assurance that we can begin the long process of moving forward as a church.”Highpoint did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.“Just as the culture around us is waking up to the suffering expressed by the courageous voices of the #metoo movement, we are taking very seriously our commitment to fully understand how our church should minister to the needs of the people we impact,” the church wrote on its website."
78,POLITICS,Mosque Terror Attack Suspect Put In Detailed Bid To Build Trump A ‘Great’ Border Wall,Christopher Mathias and Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-border-wall-mosque-attack-suspect_us_5aa84fcee4b0f7a689cd3f8b,The former sheriff's deputy submitted an extensive proposal that would make the border wall a recreational attraction.,2018-03-13,Michael Hari's company submitted a proposal to build Trump's border wall.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa8506a1f00002d0016a420.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An Illinois contractor bidding to build President Donald Trump’s wall on the Mexican border was among three men arrested Tuesday in connection with the bombing of a mosque in Minnesota and the attempted bombing of a women’s health clinic in Illinois.Michael B. Hari, 47, was arrested and charged Tuesday in federal court in lllinois with arson and possession of machine guns.According to the complaint, Hari and two accomplices — 29-year-old Michael McWhorter and 22-year-old Joe Morris — were responsible for the bombing of a mosque in Bloomington, Minnesota, on Aug. 5, 2017, and the attempted bombing of the Women’s Health Practice in Champaign, Illinois, on Nov. 7. All three are now facing federal arson charges.Confidential informants told the FBI that Hari said he would pay McWhorter and Morris $18,000 for their participation in the mosque bombing, according to the FBI affidavit. All three men allegedly drove up to Minnesota in a rented truck for the attack. Five parishioners were inside the mosque when it was bombed. No one was hurt. The attack, occurring at a time of rising anti-Muslim hate, garnered national headlines, especially after Trump’s apparent refusal to denounce it. (Trump’s then-adviser Sebastian Gorka defended the silence on the explosion, stating it might’ve been “faked by the left.”) The affidavit states that McWhorter later confessed to the FBI that he, Hari and Morris bombed the mosque to “scare [Muslims] out of the country” because they think they push their beliefs on non-Muslims. McWhorter said the bombing was mostly to say, “Hey, you’re not welcome here, get the fuck out.” The bomb thrown into the women’s health clinic in Illinois did not detonate. The criminal complaint notes that the clinic provided abortions. Hari is a former sheriff’s deputy who lives in Charence, Illinois, where he ran Crisis Resolution Security Services Inc., which had put in a bid for Trump’s border wall. In a YouTube video promoting the proposal, a narrator says the wall would be “culturally significant, a powerful architectural statement of the determination of the American people to defend their nation and its Anglo-Saxon heritage, western culture, and English language” and would defend “our way of life from other people who have different value systems.”“Build that wall. Make America great again,” the narrator states.His border wall proposal called for placing a pedestrian roadway on top of the wall in an effort to make it a tourist attraction, like the Great Wall of China. They called it the Great Western International Border Wall.“People can go up there, walk it or bicycle it,” Hari told the Chicago Tribune last year. “We’re probably the only ones who have submitted a proposal making it recreational.”The website of Hari’s company warned of the threat of Muslims in America. “Since the 9/11 attacks, 1.6 million Muslims have been admitted to the United States, 26% of Muslims in the US are homegrown converts, and 80% of Muslim prison inmates converted in prison,” the website claimed. “While many Muslims are peaceful people, only a small percentage of troublemakers will result in many incidents with a growing population of about 2.5 million Muslims total.” It linked to the conspiracy website formerly known as World Net Daily. The company, which claims to sell evacuation services at a cost of $3,995 for a 10-year period, also names riots and protests on its page about threats, including unrest in Berkeley, California, when right-wing activist Milo Yiannopoulos was due to speak and the anti-Trump protests leading up to his inauguration.Madihha Ahussain, special counsel for anti-Muslim bigotry at Muslim Advocates, said the group could not ignore the context surrounding the attack.“Anti-Muslim rhetoric from the administration and public officials has led to an unprecedented spike in hate violence against Muslims and mosque attacks, just like this one,” he said. “When the administration fails to swiftly condemn the bombing of a house of worship and instead makes excuses for the perpetrators, it sends a clear and unmistakable statement to the nation that these bombers ― whoever they are ― have a friend in the White House.”Hari has an extensive criminal record. He was found guilty of child abduction in 2006 after he took his daughters to Central America because he worried he’d lose custody. He was tracked down by an investigator for the “Dr. Phil” show and was later sentenced to 30 months of probation.On Tuesday, a federal judge assigned Hari a federal public defender and ordered him detained. This article has been updated with comment from Madihha Ahussain."
79,POLITICS,How Tax Cuts Paved The Way For America's Growing Teacher Revolt,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tax-cuts-teacher-strikes-west-virginia-oklahoma_us_5aa7de92e4b087e5aaee2357,"Like West Virginia, Oklahoma went on a tax-cut spree when things looked good. Now it can't fund schools, and workers are threatening to walk off the job.",2018-03-13,"Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R), pictured here in 2011, speaks during an interview in New York. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa7e54c1e00008e0b7ae70d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jessica Jernegan joined her fellow teachers to rally at the Oklahoma state Capitol in 2014 and demand more funding for schools. Despite the pleas of an estimated 25,000 protesters, the Republican-dominated legislature had other priorities in mind. Lawmakers went on to approve, and Gov. Mary Fallin (R) signed, a measure reducing the top personal income tax rate ― one of several tax cuts that left the state struggling to pay for basic services like public education.“That was really insulting,” recalled Jernegan, a fifth-grade reading teacher in Bixby, which is outside Tulsa. She noted that energy firms have been a prime beneficiary of the state’s tax cuts over the years. “We feel our state legislature has chosen the oil and gas industry over our kids,” she said.States like Oklahoma are now dealing with the reckoning, as educators and other public servants revolt against shrinking budgets that have stretched their workloads and left no money for pay raises. Teachers in Oklahoma have decided to follow in the footsteps of those in West Virginia, where a historic strike this year shut down schools for nine days. They say they’ll walk off the job on April 2 if lawmakers don’t pass legislation boosting money for schools and guaranteeing raises for workers. The success of the West Virginia work stoppage, which secured a 5 percent pay hike, has prompted discussions about walkouts and protests in Arizona and Kentucky as well.“Teachers and support [staff] are tired. Tired of not being listened to. Tired of not getting raises,” said Alicia Priest, president of the Oklahoma Education Association, the union organizing the walkout. “The state legislature has the power to make a school closure not happen by funding public education.”The parallels between the funding crises unfolding in West Virginia and Oklahoma are hard to miss.Both states embarked on a series of bipartisan tax cuts when their local economies appeared to be doing well, with Republican and Democratic leaders alike arguing that they needed to make their states more attractive to businesses. Beginning in 2006, West Virginia gradually reduced its corporate net income tax, phased out its business franchise tax, and eliminated its tax on groceries. Those and other tax cuts have diminished state revenue by an estimated $425 million a year.Oklahoma went on a similar tax-cutting binge starting in 2004. Legislators passed a series of bills gradually reducing the state’s top income tax rate, which applies to the majority of tax filers. They also increased the standard deduction and exempted capital gains from Oklahoma property sales. The cuts to the income tax rate alone have cost the state $1 billion annually, according to the Oklahoma Policy Institute.Many states were forced to cut education funding when tax revenue dried up during the Great Recession. Oklahoma now finds itself in an especially dire budget situation because it continued to cut taxes during the recovery that followed, according to Michael Leachman, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In addition to slashing income taxes, the state also cut the effective rate of its gross production tax on oil and gas firms.“They sort of maximized the damage that the recession did to their schools and other public services, and as the economy improved, they kept cutting taxes,” Leachman said. “You’re just digging your hole even deeper.”Just as falling demand for coal helped dry up West Virginia’s coffers, the drop in oil prices eventually hammered Oklahoma. The state has led the nation over the past decade in cuts to its education formula funding, which is the primary way individual districts get state money for schools. Oklahoma has slashed that funding by 28 percent since 2008 when adjusted for inflation, according to CBPP.HuffPost readers: Are you an Oklahoma educator willing to talk to a reporter? Email us.The squeezed budget has led to a grave teacher shortage, just like the one in West Virginia. Many Oklahoma schools have dropped to four-day weeks to save money. Each year the state has to certify an increasing number of emergency teachers to fill vacant roles ― it had 1,429 at the start of the current school year, up from 32 just five years ago. Teachers hired in these “emergency” roles do not have to meet the state’s normal minimum requirements to teach in public school.Bonny Reibert, who teaches fifth- and sixth-grade special education in Tulsa, said she knows of three roles in her school being filled on an emergency basis.“It’s not a knock on the emergency certified teachers, but the preparedness they lack is evident in the classroom,” Reibert said. “I’ve been teaching 11 years and I’m just now starting to feel comfortable with my ability and my skills. If you’re emergency, you’re an amateur and you need that time.”The low pay in Oklahoma has made it difficult to retain educators. The state ranked 49th out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia in teacher pay in 2016, according to the National Education Association teachers union. With an average salary of $45,276, it fell just behind West Virginia and was one of five states where average pay had dropped from the previous year. Although teachers can receive modest “step” increases based on length of tenure, the state has not instituted an across-the-board raise in years.All of Oklahoma’s border states offer higher average salaries. The school district in Dallas, Texas, has taken advantage of the low pay in the Tulsa area by actively recruiting teachers there, Governing magazine reported last year. It distributes flyers that say, “Oklahoma, Join Us!” and advertises starting salaries that are $16,000 higher than those in Oklahoma.Beth Wallis, a school band director who lives in Tulsa, told HuffPost that a fellow music educator raised his salary from around $32,000 to $50,000 by taking a job across the border in Arkansas.“Good teachers know what they’re worth, and if they can’t feed their families, they’re gonna go someplace they can,” she said.After years of tax cuts, it’s especially difficult for Oklahoma to reverse course in order to raise revenue. State law dictates that any legislative effort to raise taxes must be approved by 75 percent of lawmakers in both chambers. Even proposals with strong bipartisan backing haven’t been able to clear such a high bar.“We’re simply not bringing in the money to fund schools,” said Gene Perry, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Policy Institute think tank. “We even had our Republican governor and many Republicans [in the legislature] saying and admitting that we have a revenue problem, but they don’t have that 75 percent supermajority to do it.”The threat of a lasting school shutdown could change their calculus. As the success of the West Virginia teacher strike demonstrated, lawmakers can find money when they need to resolve a crisis and reopen schools ― even in a budget-strapped state. Several Oklahoma teachers who spoke to HuffPost said they were inspired by what they saw in Charleston, and that teachers from West Virginia have already reached out to offer advice on a shutdown.Jernegan said she hopes it won’t come to that, but she’ll be ready if it does.“I would love to be in my classroom teaching when that shutdown date comes,” Jernegan said. “We feel we’re giving [lawmakers] ample time to get it done. If not, they will be the ones responsible for shutting down our schools.”Correction: This story originally misspelled the name of the town Bixby."
80,POLITICS,Trump Just Trashed Some Very Popular Gun Proposals,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-gun-proposals-poll_us_5aa81743e4b04042d27edac1,Republicans aren't worried that the president will take their guns.,2018-03-13,Eighty-five percent of Republicans told that Trump favored “strengthening background checks for buying and selling guns” said that they also favored doing so.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa826001e000008087ae8f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just weeks after President Donald Trump championed gun restrictions in a rambling televised appearance, he backpedaled on Monday, offering a gun plan that largely hews to the NRA’s orthodoxy and seemingly scraps his proposal to raise the buying age for some guns.Trump shifted his position on age limits because they don’t have “much political support (to put it mildly),” he tweeted Monday.But as far as the American public is concerned, Trump is ― to put it mildly ― incorrect. A HuffPost/YouGov poll taken soon after Trump’s initial comments shows that most of the nation, including much of the GOP, was willing to go along with many of the gun control measures he briefly supported.Nearly 70 percent of the public, including most Republicans, favors raising the age for gun purchases from 18 to 21. About 80 percent of Americans polled favor strengthening background checks. Close to half even approve of Trump’s admonition to “take the guns first, go through due process second” when dealing with mentally ill people who could pose a threat.Just 8 percent of all Americans polled near the start of the month said Trump was doing too much to pass new gun laws, while 34 percent said he was doing about the right amount, and 37 percent said he wasn’t doing enough. Just 12 percent of Republicans felt the president was going too far.If Trump had stuck to his initial statements on guns, in other words, he could have done so without significant resistance from either his base or the country at large. The findings also hint at a stark difference between gun polling today and polling during the Obama administration: Republicans are no longer especially afraid that the president will take their guns.As former President Barack Obama began charting his course to the presidency, GOP support for gun control plummeted, thanks to rhetoric from the NRA that stoked fears about sweeping gun restrictions but often seemed disproportionate to the reforms Obama actually proposed.In practice, that meant the mere mention of Obama’s name was enough to torpedo GOP support for otherwise popular gun policies. Near the end of Obama’s presidency, a HuffPost/YouGov poll divided respondents into two groups before asking them about gun proposals. For one group, the poll attributed the proposal to Obama; for the other, it omitted his name. Republicans’ support for background checks was a full 20 points lower when the poll mentioned Obama’s name.The most recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, which set up a similar experiment, found that Republicans’ opinions of several of the policies Trump espoused stayed about the same, whether the poll mentioned his name or not.Eighty-five percent of Republicans told that Trump favored “strengthening background checks for buying and selling guns” said that they also favored doing so, as did a virtually identical 86 percent of those simply asked their opinion. In the control group, 61 percent of Republicans favored raising the age for gun purchases to 21; in the group with Trump’s name attached, a very similar 65 percent did. For other questions, Trump’s name seemed to modestly help quell GOP opposition to gun measures. One group of Republicans were told that Trump, speaking about seizing guns from mentally ill people who could pose a threat, had said, “A lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures. Take the guns first, go through due process second.” They agreed, 59 percent to 27 percent. Those who saw the statement without attribution to Trump agreed by a more modest 52 percent to 40 percent.Remarkably, when told that “President Trump has said former president Barack Obama did not do enough to pass new gun laws,” 48 percent of Republicans agreed. Absent the attribution to Trump, just under 40 percent did.Democrats asked questions that mentioned Trump’s name were less likely to favor proposals attached to him than those who didn’t see him mentioned. But in both groups, three-quarters or more backed stronger background checks, and 70 percent or more favored raising the age to buy guns. A 49 percent plurality of Democrats told that Trump had lambasted Obama’s record on guns insisted that Obama had done the right amount to pass new gun laws, with just 23 percent saying he hadn’t done enough. Democrats in the control group were apparently less on the defensive about their former president’s record ― 42 percent said Obama had done too little, and just 36 percent that he’d done the right amount.Other polling on gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida, found that while the rise in support for stricter gun laws wasn’t confined to Republicans, it included them. And in an earlier HuffPost/YouGov poll, 61 percent of Republicans said they viewed new gun restrictions as compatible with their Second Amendment rights, up from 42 percent as recently as last fall. That movement may only be temporary. It’s certainly not universal ― gun groups like the NRA still hold significant political sway, and their membership reportedly spiked after Parkland, as it has during past shootings. But the latest polling suggests that, had Trump held on to his support for gun restrictions, he may have brought some members of his party along.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 28-March 1 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

81,POLITICS,Trump Just Trashed Some Very Popular Gun Proposals,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-gun-proposals-poll_us_5aa81743e4b04042d27edac1,Republicans aren't worried that the president will take their guns.,2018-03-13,"President Barack Obama talks about the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and about his efforts to increase federal gun control on Jan. 5, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa83c261f0000150316a401.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just weeks after President Donald Trump championed gun restrictions in a rambling televised appearance, he backpedaled on Monday, offering a gun plan that largely hews to the NRA’s orthodoxy and seemingly scraps his proposal to raise the buying age for some guns.Trump shifted his position on age limits because they don’t have “much political support (to put it mildly),” he tweeted Monday.But as far as the American public is concerned, Trump is ― to put it mildly ― incorrect. A HuffPost/YouGov poll taken soon after Trump’s initial comments shows that most of the nation, including much of the GOP, was willing to go along with many of the gun control measures he briefly supported.Nearly 70 percent of the public, including most Republicans, favors raising the age for gun purchases from 18 to 21. About 80 percent of Americans polled favor strengthening background checks. Close to half even approve of Trump’s admonition to “take the guns first, go through due process second” when dealing with mentally ill people who could pose a threat.Just 8 percent of all Americans polled near the start of the month said Trump was doing too much to pass new gun laws, while 34 percent said he was doing about the right amount, and 37 percent said he wasn’t doing enough. Just 12 percent of Republicans felt the president was going too far.If Trump had stuck to his initial statements on guns, in other words, he could have done so without significant resistance from either his base or the country at large. The findings also hint at a stark difference between gun polling today and polling during the Obama administration: Republicans are no longer especially afraid that the president will take their guns.As former President Barack Obama began charting his course to the presidency, GOP support for gun control plummeted, thanks to rhetoric from the NRA that stoked fears about sweeping gun restrictions but often seemed disproportionate to the reforms Obama actually proposed.In practice, that meant the mere mention of Obama’s name was enough to torpedo GOP support for otherwise popular gun policies. Near the end of Obama’s presidency, a HuffPost/YouGov poll divided respondents into two groups before asking them about gun proposals. For one group, the poll attributed the proposal to Obama; for the other, it omitted his name. Republicans’ support for background checks was a full 20 points lower when the poll mentioned Obama’s name.The most recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, which set up a similar experiment, found that Republicans’ opinions of several of the policies Trump espoused stayed about the same, whether the poll mentioned his name or not.Eighty-five percent of Republicans told that Trump favored “strengthening background checks for buying and selling guns” said that they also favored doing so, as did a virtually identical 86 percent of those simply asked their opinion. In the control group, 61 percent of Republicans favored raising the age for gun purchases to 21; in the group with Trump’s name attached, a very similar 65 percent did. For other questions, Trump’s name seemed to modestly help quell GOP opposition to gun measures. One group of Republicans were told that Trump, speaking about seizing guns from mentally ill people who could pose a threat, had said, “A lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures. Take the guns first, go through due process second.” They agreed, 59 percent to 27 percent. Those who saw the statement without attribution to Trump agreed by a more modest 52 percent to 40 percent.Remarkably, when told that “President Trump has said former president Barack Obama did not do enough to pass new gun laws,” 48 percent of Republicans agreed. Absent the attribution to Trump, just under 40 percent did.Democrats asked questions that mentioned Trump’s name were less likely to favor proposals attached to him than those who didn’t see him mentioned. But in both groups, three-quarters or more backed stronger background checks, and 70 percent or more favored raising the age to buy guns. A 49 percent plurality of Democrats told that Trump had lambasted Obama’s record on guns insisted that Obama had done the right amount to pass new gun laws, with just 23 percent saying he hadn’t done enough. Democrats in the control group were apparently less on the defensive about their former president’s record ― 42 percent said Obama had done too little, and just 36 percent that he’d done the right amount.Other polling on gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida, found that while the rise in support for stricter gun laws wasn’t confined to Republicans, it included them. And in an earlier HuffPost/YouGov poll, 61 percent of Republicans said they viewed new gun restrictions as compatible with their Second Amendment rights, up from 42 percent as recently as last fall. That movement may only be temporary. It’s certainly not universal ― gun groups like the NRA still hold significant political sway, and their membership reportedly spiked after Parkland, as it has during past shootings. But the latest polling suggests that, had Trump held on to his support for gun restrictions, he may have brought some members of his party along.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 28-March 1 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

84,POLITICS,Trump Ousts Secretary Of State Rex Tillerson,Eline Gordts and Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rex-tillerson-out_us_59765701e4b0c95f375db326,Tillerson reportedly learned he'd been booted from Trump's tweet.,2018-03-13,President Donald Trump and Tillerson during a meeting on June 12.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5976705015000021008b3608.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rex Tillerson is out as secretary of state after just 14 months on the job.President Donald Trump on Tuesday tweeted that he is replacing Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, minutes after The Washington Post first reported that he had ousted Tillerson on Friday. Addressing reporters at the State Department Tuesday afternoon, a sullen Tillerson said that Trump had called him at noon, more than three hours after the president’s tweet.The White House said Trump asked Tillerson to step down on Friday so the president could have a “new team in place” for an upcoming meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.But a State Department spokesman told CNN that Tillerson found out about his firing when Trump announced it on Twitter on Tuesday.According to a statement that followed Trump’s announcement, Tillerson ”had every intention of staying,” the State Department said. “The Secretary did not speak to the President and is unaware of the reason.”The State Department official who contradicted the White House on Tillerson’s firing was also fired, The Associated Press reported.Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he “made that decision by myself” to remove Tillerson, and noted that “Rex, as you know, was not in this country” at the time. He alluded to their disagreements, saying, “we were not thinking the same,” and predicted, “Rex will be happier now.” Tillerson cut short a trip to Africa, returning to Washington Monday night. Reporters traveling with him said that they had no idea the secretary of state had been fired on Friday.Trump announced that he plans to nominate Gina Haspel, now deputy CIA director, to replace Pompeo as head of the spy agency.Most of Trump’s statement focused on Pompeo. He mentioned Tillerson at the end. “A great deal has been accomplished over the last fourteen months, and I wish him and his family well,” Trump said.Notably missing from initial Trump administration statements on the secretary of state was anything from Tillerson himself. The ousted secretary of state didn’t make his own statement until Tuesday afternoon, when he announced at the State Department that he would officially exit on March 31.Other than noting his phone call with the president, Tillerson did not mention or thank Trump in his remarks.Just a day ago, Tillerson made a statement holding Russia responsible for the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, putting him at odds with the White House, which did not single out Russia.Tillerson’s departure comes amid reports of his disappointment with the turbulent atmosphere in Trump’s White House, as well as mounting criticism of his performance as the country’s leading diplomat and his drastic reduction of civil servant positions at the State Department. His job security had always seemed precarious, but on Nov. 30, The New York Times reported that the White House was considering forcing out Tillerson and replacing him with Pompeo.The White House and State Department pushed back on the report, but that day, neither Trump nor White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders would definitively say whether the president had confidence in Tillerson.“He’s here. Rex is here,” Trump told reporters.“When the president loses confidence in somebody, they’ll no longer be here,” Sanders said at that day’s White House press briefing.Trump and Tillerson’s relationship has long been filled with tension. Tillerson reportedly considered resigning after Trump’s widely criticized speech to the Boy Scouts of America in July.On Oct. 4, NBC News reported that Tillerson called Trump “a moron” during a meeting with top officials over the summer.Following the report, Tillerson held an unusual press conference, in which he showered Trump with praise, affirming that the president is “smart.”Notably, he did not dispute whether he called Trump “a moron,” leaving that job to State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, who claimed that “the secretary does not use that type of language.”Attacking the reporting as “phony,” Trump later said he appreciated Tillerson’s comments and that he had “total confidence in Rex.”But less than a week later, he suggested in a Forbes magazine interview that if the story were true, he should “compare IQ tests” with Tillerson.“And I can tell you who is going to win,” he added.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed Trump’s comment was “a joke” and said that he “never implied that the secretary of state was not incredibly intelligent.”Trump has repeatedly undermined Tillerson’s diplomatic efforts in attempting to quell North Korea’s nuclear aggression, with the two men often contradicting each other and the president lambasting Tillerson on Twitter.Tillerson’s days as secretary of state seemed numbered from the start. A government outsider lacking diplomatic experience, he arrived at Foggy Bottom after decades at Exxon Mobil Corp., rising from engineer in 1975 to chairman and CEO in 2006, overseeing vast expansion of the company’s operations worldwide. Trump picked Tillerson for the State Department job after a lengthy public vetting of prominent candidates, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney.Tillerson faced opposition during his Senate confirmation process, with lawmakers expressing concerns over his lack of experience in government and diplomacy, and strong ties with Russian leader Vladimir Putin from years of business in the country. Even Tillerson himself had been reluctant to accept the position. “I didn’t want this job. I didn’t seek this job,” he admitted to the conservative news outlet Independent Journal Review in March.“My wife told me I’m supposed to do this,” he responded when an aide asked him why he accepted the position anyway. Once in office, Tillerson sought to reorganize the State Department and prioritize its activities toward business and security. He publicly illustrated the pivot after weeks on the job, opting to skip the presentation of the department’s annual human rights report.During his tenure, the department faced drastic budget cuts and a crucial leadership vacuum. Amid massive international challenges like North Korea’s nuclear arms race and the war in Syria, Trump proposed cutting the State Department budget by nearly one-third. Dozens of vacancies remained unfilled, including top deputies, because of White House refusal to accept Tillerson’s picks. Tillerson and the White House also clashed on policy and messaging. As a diplomatic crisis in Qatar unfolded, Trump directly undermined Tillerson’s calls for calm, expressing support for Saudi Arabia’s economic and diplomatic blockade of the Gulf state, and accusing Qatar of funding terrorism.In an August interview, Tillerson declined to defend Trump’s support for “America’s values,” telling Fox News that “the president speaks for himself.” The questioning arose during a conversation about Trump’s much criticized response to violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, earlier that month, when counterprotesters clashed with hate groups protesting the planned removal of a statue honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.From the White House, the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, often ran a parallel track of diplomacy ― traveling to Israel and the Palestinian territories to explore ways to revive peace talks, and interacting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. Sources told CNN in July that Tillerson was becoming increasingly frustrated with the White House. In late August, Axios reported that Trump was losing patience with his secretary of state, in part because key roles at the department still remained unfilled more than eight months into Trump’s presidency. A State Department spokesperson told Axios that Tillerson was working to fill the vacancies but that the White House was effectively sitting on his recommendations. Nauert had repeatedly insisted Tillerson was not considering resignation. Asked if a July vacation indicated Tillerson wanted to step away from the spotlight, Nauert said the secretary was “just taking a little time off” after that month’s G-20 summit.Tillerson, like Trump, wasn’t a fan of reporters’ questions, doing away with the State Department’s daily briefing and limiting media access during his foreign travels. He said he wasn’t “a big media press-access person,” when he allowed just one journalist ― a reporter from the Independent Journal Review ― to accompany him on a visit to South Korea. The move backfired. American journalists were unable to challenge an embarrassing report in the Korea Herald that the secretary had canceled a dinner with South Korean officials because he was fatigued. Tillerson is just the latest to step down in the Trump administration. In September, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced to resign, after he used taxpayer-funded private jets on numerous occasions.National security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to step down in February following revelations that he discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador before Trump’s inauguration. On May 9, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the presidential election.Mike Dubke, White House communications director, resigned later in May after months of chaos in the press shop. Press secretary Sean Spicer quit in July, after the president appointed Anthony Scaramucci as the new communications director. Scaramucci resigned after just 10 days, amid a spate of departures that included White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and, less than a month later, chief strategist Steve Bannon.This article has been updated to include additional comments on Tillerson’s firing."

His outspokenness was a key reason he gained favor with Trump. In November 2016, when the president picked him to lead the CIA, The New York Times noted that some members of Trump’s team chose him because another potential contender, former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), was seen as too “soft” on the Benghazi issue.On Tuesday, Trump nominated Pompeo to lead the State Department after ousting Rex Tillerson. A Tillerson spokesman said the secretary of state found out about his ouster after Trump tweeted about it Tuesday morning, although the White House insisted that Tillerson was made aware that his days were numbered on Friday.In June 2016, the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued a report finding no evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton or other members of the administration in the Benghazi attack. The inquiry came after eight other investigations had looked into the matter and reached a similar conclusion. It took more than two years and cost $7 million. Pompeo and a fellow conservative congressman, Jim Jordan of Ohio, issued an addendum to the report, however, that went beyond what their colleagues concluded. The 2012 incident, they wrote, was “the story of a State Department seemingly more concerned with politics and Secretary Clinton’s legacy than with protecting its people in Benghazi.” “And it is the story of an administration so focused on the next election that it lost sight of its duty to tell the American people the truth about what had happened that night,” they added in their report, which came out just a few months before the presidential election in which Clinton was running. Four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, died in the Benghazi terrorist attacks. Republicans like Pompeo argued that top members of the Obama administration ignored warnings about the danger of the situation, refused to call in military help during the attack and then tried to cover up what happened. But the independent investigations into the matter concluded that while there were systemic failures, Clinton herself was not personally responsible or deliberately reckless. Pompeo, however, said the Obama administration’s response to Benghazi was “worse in some ways” than Richard Nixon’s response to Watergate. He also pushed a conspiracy theory about how Clinton supposedly received her intelligence about the attack.Dana Shell Smith, who served as ambassador to Qatar and was principal deputy assistant secretary of public affairs at the State Department during Benghazi, said Pompeo will have a tough road to climb at the State Department after his role in the Benghazi investigation.“For all of the Republican fulminating about Benghazi, Rex Tillerson refused to meet one on one with his head of diplomatic security and did not nominate ambassadors, who are the officials ultimately responsible for the safety and security of our personnel overseas,” she said. “The bar for any secretary of State is understandably extremely high and, when it comes to Pompeo, will be even higher due to the role he played in politicizing a real national tragedy.”"

The decision came nearly a week after a grand jury indicted Cruz on 17 counts of first-degree premeditated murder and 17 counts of first-degree attempted murder for the Feb. 14 attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.Satz argued that the death penalty was warranted because Cruz “knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons” and committed a crime in a “cold, calculated and premeditated manner without any pretense of moral or legal justification,” and because the crime “was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel,” according to a copy of the filing.Prosecutors’ decision to seek the death penalty does not necessarily mean that a plea deal is off the table, though the only other penalty available for Cruz is life in prison without the possibility of parole, The Associated Press reported.Cruz has another formal arraignment scheduled for Wednesday, during which he is expected to be arraigned on an additional 17 counts of first-degree murder.Broward County Public Defender Howard Finkelstein, whose office is representing Cruz, had said that the teen would plead guilty if prosecutors did not pursue the death penalty.Finkelstein’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.CORRECTION: A photo caption in a previous version of this story indicated Cruz was 17.

Also pictured are Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) (right), Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) (left).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa81dc92000002d00eb1c5f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Tuesday swung back at critics of his use of private planes that the government has paid for, accusing one senator of slinging “insults” and “innuendos.” During a Senate committee hearing to discuss the administration’s proposed budget for his department, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) asked Zinke if he thought it was “a mistake” to have chartered a flight from Las Vegas to his home state of Montana, which cost taxpayers more than $12,000. “Insults, innuendos are misleading,” said Zinke, visibly agitated. “I never took a private jet anywhere.”“I resent the fact of your insults,” he told Cantwell. “I resent the fact they’re misleading.”For his trip to Montana he flew on a Beechcraft King Air 200, a twin turbo-prop aircraft.Zinke has billed taxpayers for his use of private planes two other times. In September, Zinke characterized the controversy surrounding these flights as “a little BS.” His use of chartered and government aircraft is under investigation by both Interior’s Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Special Counsel.As he defended himself at the hearing, Zinke also claimed that his immediate predecessor as Interior secretary ― Sally Jewell, who served under President Barack Obama ― spent nearly $1 million on roughly 80 chartered flights. But those figures, reported by CNN in October, were for both Jewell and the Obama administration’s first Interior secretary, Ken Salazar.“Sally Jewell, I think she was right,” Zinke said. “I think her travel patterns, even though she took a private chartered airplane, was met by helicopter and did a hike, I think she was right because as (interior secretary) she was out hiking and doing what she was supposed to be doing.”Cantwell in her opening remarks also made a reference to recent news that Interior is spending nearly $139,000 to replace doors in Zinke’s office. She said she could “talk a lot about private planes ... and doors, but there are also very important public policy issues here that I hope to focus on.”The doors reference also caused Zinke to bristle. He said he was prepared to go through his expenses “line by line.”Cantwell said public concern is growing over how money is being spent at Interior, as the Trump administration looks to slash the department’s budget by 15 percent while proposing to drastically hike entrance fees at 17 of America’s most popular national parks.Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) also blasted Zinke, accusing him of a “shell game with a wildfire account at Interior to pay for an unrelated helicopter ride.” He said voting to confirm Zinke to lead the agency was one of his “biggest regrets” during his time in the Senate. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) came to Zinke’s defense during the hearing, saying it was wrong that people are “giving him heck” for taking a chartered plane in a remote part of Alaska. “I’ve been shot at before.

Gene A. Hogg, the Salvation Army’s Central Maryland area commander, told HuffPost on Monday.The store, which has an on-site butcher and deli, as well as prepared meals and salads by Maryland’s Food Bank, is in a former Salvation Army warehouse that was renovated to offer what Hogg described as “that upper-end grocery store experience” at affordable prices.Inside, it’s bright and spacious, he said, and it features food samplings, recipe ideas, cooking demonstrations and visits by guest chefs and city health department nutritionists.Because it’s across the street from an elementary school, it also allows parents to pick up or drop off their children and shop for their family’s meals in the same trip, Hogg said.Previously, he said, people would have to travel more than a quarter of a mile to find a grocery store or market, which fits within the city’s definition of a food desert. The definition also includes more than 30% of the surrounding households having no vehicle access and the medium household income at or below 185% of the federal poverty level. “The idea is to strengthen the family table,” he said. “We want to do more than just sell groceries.”Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh attended the store’s opening ceremony to cut the ribbon. She encouraged the Salvation Army’s efforts.“This serves as a beacon for the rest of this community. If we can do this here, we can do this in other parts of the city,” she said, according to local station WJZ.In addition to providing fresh food, the store will also offer a workforce development program that will help train prospective employees. It will also have special offers and discounts for those who are part of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.Any money that is made from the operation will be donated to Catherine’s Cottage, a local facility run by the Salvation Army that offers support to human trafficking survivors, Hogg said.“What we’re trying to do is create an environment where the community feels welcome and where they’re engaging for the betterment of their community,” Hogg said.The Baltimore store is considered the Salvation Army’s test site. It hopes to open more stores around the country if this one succeeds and there is eagerness among outside communities to get involved.Thus far, Hogg said, he’s received calls from around the world inquiring about their efforts.“We think that we’re going to be successful, but you can’t make any judgment calls after four days of work.”"
90,POLITICS,Alex Jones Is Finally Getting The Defamation Lawsuit He Deserves,Andy Campbell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alex-jones-defamation-lawsuit_us_5aa7e4dae4b0e872b4bf22da,The Infowars host spun a conspiracy around a witness to the Charlottesville attack. But this victim won't back down.,2018-03-13,Infowars host Alex Jones has labeled the victims of tragedy as perpetrators one too many times.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa813b21e000057107ae8d3.png?cache=7JP5sPV9oc&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Alex Jones’ conspiracy playbook isn’t going to work anymore if a new lawsuit prevails.A defamation lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Tuesday against the Infowars mouthpiece and others, seeks to stop them from launching the kind of character assassinations against innocent people that have led to real-world harassment campaigns, death threats and other violent episodes.The plaintiff, Brennan Gilmore, recorded the vehicular attack that left a counter-protester dead during a far-right rally in Charlottesville last year. Jones branded him a “deep state shill” and “CIA asset” who supposedly helped organize the car attack in order to somehow defame President Donald Trump.Jones’ claim sounds ridiculous because it is. After Gilmore’s video went viral, Infowars and other far-right outlets latched onto his occupation ― he is a foreign service officer with the State Department ― as proof that there were “high-level CIA” and other operatives behind the violence in Charlottesville. As it turns out, white supremacists were behind the rallies, and white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. was allegedly behind the wheel of the car that ran over Heather Heyer. Gilmore just happened to record the killing.“What we now see is a pattern of attacks that politically motivated outlets like Infowars and the Gateway Pundit launch against witnesses and other victims of tragedies,” Gilmore said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. “They twisted [my] service into a story that I was a deep-state operative who had a role in organizing the violence that we saw in Charlottesville to undermine the Trump administration.”Ever since Jones came after him, Gilmore has been the subject of all sorts of harassment, both physically and online. He’s received death threats and hacking attempts; he’s been physically accosted on the street; numerous videos featuring his name have been made about the pseudo-conspiracy; and his parents’ address was posted online, after which they received an envelope with a “powdery residue” and a threatening note, according to the lawsuit.Gilmore is suing Jones, Gateway Pundit owner Jim Hoft, former Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.) and others for “intentionally inflicting emotional distress” on him and his family members. His goal, he said, is to deter them from “repeating this dangerous pattern of defamation and intimidation.”What’s perhaps most important about this particular lawsuit is that Gilmore and his legal counsel, Georgetown Law’s Civil Rights Clinic, don’t plan to back down if Infowars offers a settlement, as others have done in the past.“There is no amount of money we would settle for,” Gilmore told HuffPost on Tuesday, noting that he hopes a judgment against Infowars will set a “legal precedent” for future suits.Both Gilmore and his attorney emphasize that the lawsuit is not an attack on the First Amendment or journalism.“The First Amendment does not and cannot protect deliberate lies designed to incite incessant harassment and violence against private citizens,” said Andrew Mendrala, supervising attorney at the Georgetown clinic and Gilmore’s lawyer. “This case is a simple defense of democracy. A well-informed public is essential to a healthy democracy. But a deliberately misinformed public is fatal to it.”Jones is the megaphone through which numerous conspiratorial internet murmurings have been broadcast to the masses. Pick any American tragedy ― or, on a slow news day, pick anything ― and you’ll find videos featuring Jones, rabid and red-faced, pushing a paranoid fantasy dreamed up on anonymous forums. According to Jones, the teens who survived the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, are crisis actors; Hillary Clinton is tied to a secret society of pedophiles under a pizza restaurant; juice boxes make your kids gay; the Chobani yogurt company was “caught importing migrant rapists”; and so much more.When Jones is caught out, he claims victimhood, apologizes and then relents, often because he’s legally bound to do so. He apologized and retracted his Chobani stories as part of a settlement over his claims that the company was importing refugee workers who had raped a child. He apologized for promoting “Pizzagate,” which had inspired a gunman to enter a Washington, D.C., restaurant and fire a semi-automatic rifle. In a custody battle over his children, Jones’ lawyer told the court that “he’s playing a character” and “is a performance artist,” not a raving lunatic.This time, though, Gilmore insists there won’t be a settlement that caters to Jones’ preferred method of asking forgiveness later. Has that given the Infowars host pause? Hell no, commies! “As all of you know, everybody from the Communist Party U.S.A. to five different individuals that have worked directly for Hillary Clinton have filed completely baseless and frivolous lawsuits against Infowars,” he said in a new video about the current suit.He then went full Alex Jones: “It’s like ‘Pacific Rim’ ― you know, it’s a good entertainment movie ― they keep sending in the Kaijus to attack. First it’s every year, then every month. Then it’s like, OK, now we’re gonna have five attacks a day. That’s basically what it’s like. All these lawsuits are run by Hillary lawyers, or people that work for Hillary and the State Department and the CIA. And Julian Assange is in the news from WikiLeaks, who’s locked up for years up in his tower, saying Assange warns CIA officers flooding a Democratic Party for 2018 midterms to basically overthrow the country.”"

Speaking at the INTV Conference in Jerusalem on Tuesday, Newman added that “Buffy” is the “the most ripe show we have for bringing back.”“It’s something we talk about frequently, and Joss Whedon is really one of the greatest creators we ever worked with,” he said. “When Joss decides it’s time, we’ll do it. And until Joss decides it’s time, it won’t happen.”The series, which recently celebrated its 21st anniversary, aired for five seasons on the WB and two on UPN before signing off for good in 2003. The characters, however, have lived on in an official comic book series, but some fans still crave more. “Most times when we brought things back, it started with the creator coming in to us and saying I’ve got another story I want to tell,” Newman continued. “It seems to me that if there isn’t a real sense of nostalgia, a passionate fan base demonstrating they still want it, then i don’t really buy bringing these shows back.”Newman added that he “wouldn’t get out of the building alive” if he had announced the reboot on the spot. Whedon, who’s gone on to direct major blockbusters like “The Avengers,” has been reluctant about revisiting the show that catapulted him to superstardom.“I’ve been trying deliberately to move forward and do something a little bit different,” he told Entertainment Weekly when the cast reunited in 2017. “But yeah, the great thing is everybody looks great, and the other great thing is the show is about growing up.”Series star Sarah Michelle Gellar, meanwhile, has been more resolute in her opinion that the show should be left alone.“They want it until they see it and don’t like it, and then they’re like, ‘Why did you do that?! You ruined my favorite show!’ And then it all comes back down on you,” Gellar told HuffPost in April 2017. "
92,POLITICS,Companies Are Disclosing How Much Less They Pay Workers Than Executives,Arthur Delaney and Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ceo-pay-disclosure_us_5aa6da18e4b03c9edfae9aec,And some firms seem a little embarrassed.,2018-03-13,"An employee walks through the parking lot of a Marathon Petroleum Corp. Speedway gas station in Huntington, West Virginia, in 2016. Marathon Petroleum Corp. paid its CEO 935 times more than it paid its median employee in 2017, according to a new disclosure.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa7eaad1e000057107ae7c6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A moment that corporate executives may have dreaded for years has finally arrived. As Congress chips away at bank regulations established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, another part of the measure is exposing the extreme income inequality between bosses and their workers. The law requires publicly traded companies to calculate the ratio of their chief executive officer’s compensation to the median pay of the companies’ employees. After a series of delays, firms are finally disclosing their pay ratios in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some of the numbers are shocking. The staffing firm ManpowerGroup paid its chief executive $11.9 million last year ― 2,483 times the average employee’s earnings. The firm noted in its disclosure that most of its employees are temps who work only part of the year, making just $4,828 on average. ManpowerGroup’s ratio is the most lopsided of any disclosed as of Tuesday morning, according to Proxy Insight, a company that tracks SEC disclosures for investors. Excluding firms with no employees, the average ratio among the more than 263 disclosures to date is 77 to 1, with CEO pay averaging $7.2 million compared to $93,000 for the typical worker. Other notable ratios for big firms include the appliance maker Whirlpool Corporation, which paid its CEO 356 times what it paid its average worker, and the health insurance company Humana, whose top executive earned 344 times more than the median salary for employees. The disclosures come as Democrats and Republicans wage a rhetorical battle over who benefits most from the massive corporate tax cut President Donald Trump signed into law late last year. While Republicans have touted modest bonuses several million workers have received from various companies, Democrats have kept a running tally of share buybacks, which inflate the value of a company’s stock and enrich executives. Stock awards represent a substantial portion of executive compensation. Companies have long disclosed executive pay as part of their SEC filings, but what’s new is the requirement that they also own up to what they pay their rank and file. Paired together, the numbers can serve as a barometer for economic inequality within particular firms.Lisa Gilbert, a lobbyist and expert on executive pay with the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said that if company leaders dreaded this day, they were right to do so. “It’s embarrassing,” Gilbert said. “We’re learning how little they pay their workers. We’re learning how much they pay their CEOs, and the ratios are stark.”Although it has little regulatory impact, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio was one of the most contentious pieces of the Dodd-Frank legislation. It took the SEC three years to issue a proposal for firms to disclose the ratio, over the fierce objection of corporate lobbyists. The business community argued it would be too difficult and costly to calculate the ratios.Some regulators sympathized. Two Republican members of the SEC voted against the rule, and one of them, Michael Piwowar, said its real intent was to “shame” executives.The rule’s backers argued that both investors and employees have a right to know when executive pay is grossly out of step with typical workers’ salaries, saying it sheds light on a company and its priorities. Labor groups have used industry-level wage data to calculate worker-to-CEO pay ratio estimates to spotlight pay inequity. The AFL-CIO reported last year that among more than 400 companies traded on the S&P 500, the average CEO made 347 times more than his or her average worker. Executive compensation has grown far faster than overall wages, according to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. It found that in 1965, executives earned merely 20 times more than their average employee. For some firms, the ratio alone can obscure important details about employee compensation, such as whether workers reside in areas with a low cost of living and what their hours are, said Tim Bartl, CEO of the Center on Executive Compensation, a group that opposed the pay rule. “Unless you get into the details, it doesn’t tell you a whole lot,” Bartl said.Still, some companies in their disclosures appear eager to erase their lowest-paid employees from existence to make the pay ratios less conspicuous. ManpowerGroup, the temporary staffing firm, offered an alternative ratio that excluded the temp workers who are at the heart of its business model. The company noted in its SEC filing that its CEO earned only 276 times as much as the firm’s permanent employees. Marathon Petroleum Corporation is another firm with an eye-popping ratio. CEO Gary Heminger earned nearly $20 million last year ― 935 times more than the median Marathon employee.The company blamed the disparity on the thousands of workers at its Speedway gas station subsidiary. Gas station cashiers earned an average of just $9.83 per hour last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.If the company could wave a wand and make those low-wage workers disappear, then its CEO-to-worker pay ratio would be a much more reasonable 156-1, the company said.

In a Monday interview with CNN, David Hogg and Alfonso Calderon expressed disappointment over the White House’s new gun and school safety proposals, which include arming teachers to help prevent future on-campus shootings. But dropped from the plan was Trump’s call to raise the legal age for buying certain firearms ― including semi-automatic rifles ― from 18 to 21 years old.Trump endorsed changing the age requirement last month during a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers at the White House in the wake of the Florida shooting in which the suspected gunman used a semi-automatic rifle. The NRA, however, quickly came out against the age proposal.“What President Trump showed when he said he wanted to raise the age to 21 is bipartisanship and he wanted to work together on this and save some lives,” Hogg told CNN. “But the other thing that he showed after that is he is no better than the other politicians because he called out other GOP members and said essentially that you’re owned by the NRA and that’s why you don’t want to take action.”At the White House meeting, Trump had pointedly scolded lawmakers for not having previously acted on raising the minimum age for buying semi-automatic weapons, saying they were “afraid of the NRA” and he wasn’t.But in a series of Monday morning tweets, he touted his proposal to arm some teachers and sought to justify his backpedaling on the age issue.“Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent!” Trump tweeted, adding that there’s “not much political support (to put it mildly)” for raising the age requirement. “I ask him why?” Hogg said in his interview. “Show us you’re better than the other politicians, that you aren’t owned by the NRA and that you want to take action. Those proposals were great, but proposals without action remain proposals.”Calderon took on one of the main NRA arguments against raising the age requirement.“They always talk about the narrative of good guys with guns stopping bad guys with guns.
