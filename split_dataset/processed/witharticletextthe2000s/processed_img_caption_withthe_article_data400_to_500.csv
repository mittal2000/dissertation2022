It is the ‘dream team,’” he told the AP.Vaquitas live exclusively in Mexico’s Gulf of California and have been under serious threat since the 1990s.

Demand for the totoaba, also endemic to the Gulf of California, has been the main driver of this collapse. The fish’s swim bladder, also known as maw, is considered a delicacy in parts of Asia. Known as “aquatic cocaine,” it can sell for as much as $10,000 a kilogram, or almost $5,000 a pound.

Animals could die in the attempt, potentially precipitating the species’ extinction. And some experts have expressed concern that the health of the Gulf itself could also be threatened if teams remove the marine mammal. Without the protected vaquita to worry about, fishermen could wipe out the totoaba and other species, conservationists warn. Captivity is “not a desirable or practical option for the vaquita,” Omar Vidal, Mexico director of the World Wildlife Fund, who opposes the plan, told the AP. “We must strive to save this porpoise where it belongs: in a healthy Upper Gulf of California.”CIRVA has acknowledged the risks of the plan, but said the potential “salvation” of an entire species ultimately outweighs the dangers. “Capturing them is a very difficult decision. It implies risks, but it won’t be rushed. In any sign of stress, we will let them be free,” Rojas-Bracho said, according to the AFP this week. “We don’t know what will happen.

2,POLITICS,States Enacted More Than 60 Abortion Restrictions In 2016,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-anti-abortion-states_us_5863e1b5e4b0de3a08f6bf53,... despite the Supreme Court's ruling this summer.,2016-12-28,Protesters rally outside of the Supreme Court on March 2 as the court hears oral arguments in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5863f6951500002e00e9d59e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― 2016 was a watershed year for reproductive rights: The U.S. Supreme Court delivered a landmark victory to abortion rights supporters in June that warned states not to pass laws that impose a burden on women’s access to abortion without any medical justification.Still, Republican state legislatures enacted more than 60 abortion restrictions this year and introduced more than 500, according to an analysis by the Center for Reproductive Rights. Ten anti-abortion laws were ruled unconstitutional and blocked by the courts, but lawmakers are outpacing the lawsuits and finding new ways to chip away at reproductive rights. “Undoubtedly, this new barrage of attacks shows that the anti-abortion movement has abandoned its pretense of protecting women’s health and safety, instead making it crystal-clear that the end goal is attacking family planning providers and banning abortion care altogether,” the report states. Louisiana’s state legislature launched the strongest attack on abortion rights this year, passing seven new laws that restrict access to the procedure. Among other things, the restrictions triple the state’s mandatory waiting period before an abortion from 24 to 72 hours; they ban the dilation and evacuation procedure, the safest and most common abortion method used in the second trimester; they ban abortions after 20 weeks in cases of genetic abnormalities; and they require women to have their fetal tissue buried or cremated after an abortion. The Center for Reproductive Rights challenged all seven of Louisiana’s new restrictions before they went into effect, and the state agreed not to enforce them while litigation proceeds. Indiana, under the leadership of Vice President-elect Mike Pence (R), enacted an anti-abortion omnibus bill with a slew of new restrictions. The law requires women to receive state-mandated counseling and an ultrasound at least 18 hours before the procedure, forcing women to make two separate trips to the clinic. It also prohibits women from choosing abortion if the fetus is diagnosed with a genetic anomaly, and mandates that fetal tissue be cremated or buried. A federal district court blocked the law in June, ruling that the restrictions are unconstitutional and unrelated to any legitimate state interest. Other state laws have gone into effect. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) signed a bill into law that bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy ― two to four weeks earlier than the viability standard set by the Supreme Court. Oklahoma enacted an unprecedented law called the “Humanity of the Unborn Child Act,” which, among other things, would have required public restrooms in restaurants, hospitals, schools and hotels to post signs that urge pregnant women to carry to term. (Following protests, the Oklahoma senator leading the charge updated the law to only affect restrooms of abortion providers.) Eight states passed laws intended to defund Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest family planning provider, and eight states banned or restricted the donation of fetal tissue for medical research after an abortion. The slew of new laws continues a six-year trend toward eliminating access to abortion. States have enacted more than 300 restrictions since 2011. The Supreme Court’s decision this year in Whole Women’s Health vs. Hellerstedt only struck down two of these laws ― a pair of restrictions in Texas that required abortions to take place in ambulatory surgical centers, or mini-hospitals, and required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. But it set a legal standard on which courts can rely as they consider laws that restrict access to abortion without any benefit to women’s health. Republicans may be emboldened to pass even more anti-abortion laws in 2017, since President-Elect Donald Trump and his administration are friendly to the cause. Reproductive rights advocates are counting on the courts to block these efforts. “As we embark on 2017, we must hold our leaders accountable to the Constitutional protections guaranteed in Whole Woman’s Health,” said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. “A woman’s ability to access basic reproductive health care services like contraception or a safe, legal abortion are essential to her health and well-being.” This post has been updated to reflect that an Oklahoma senator introduced an amendment to the state’s law on bathroom signage.

4,WEIRD NEWS,"Thomas Edison Talked to the Dead, Almost","Marc Hartzman, ContributorAuthor, Creative Director, Weird Historian",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thomas-edison-talked-to-the-dead-almost_us_585a02dde4b014e7c72ed8d0,"In October of 1920, Thomas Alva Edison announced that he was working on a new machine that would allow people to talk to",2016-12-28,"<p>Edison’s burial place behind his home in West Orange, New Jersey. He has yet to communicate from there.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5863ff1919000022000e1dbb.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In October of 1920, Thomas Alva Edison announced that he was working on a new machine that would allow people to talk to the dead. Naturally, people were optimistic. After all, this was the man who, decades earlier, figured out a way to record and playback the human voice. At the time, such a thing seemed completely magical. If the Wizard of Menlo Park could create the phonograph, why not a telephone to the afterlife?Spiritualism had grown in popularity following the mass casualties of World War I, not unlike the mania that spread following the Civil War. The demand to speak with lost loved ones was high, and mediums eager to supply hope sprouted up wherever there was a buck to be made. Séance tables across the country were rapped and levitated, ectoplasm spewed from mediums, planchettes spelled out messages on ouija boards and many other effects led enthusiastic spiritualists to believe that communication with the afterlife was possible. Adding to the excitement were staunch believers Sir Conan Arthur Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, and English physicist Sir Oliver Lodge. Both wrote extensively on spiritualism, with Doyle having been firmly convinced he’d spoken with his deceased son. If Edison was going to talk to the dead, it was going to be done through science. As he told B.C. Forbes of American Magazine in 1920, “The methods and apparatus commonly used and discussed are just a lot of unscientific nonsense.” Why, he wondered, would any personality in the afterlife bother communicating in such prankish and primitive ways?Edison didn’t offer Forbes specific details of how his device would work, but he explained, “I am proceeding on the theory that, in the very nature of things, the degrees of material or physical power possessed by those in the next life must be extremely slight; and that, therefore, any instrument designed to communicate with us must be super-delicate—as finely responsive as human ingenuity can make it.“For my part, I am inclined to believe that our personality hereafter will be able to affect matter. If this reasoning be correct, then if we can evolve an instrument so delicate as to be affected, or moved or manipulated,—whichever term you want to use—by our personality, as it survives in the next life, such an instrument, when made available, ought to record something.”He added that, should he succeed, the first spirits to take advantage of the device would likely be telegraphers or scientists or anyone else with experience in the use of delicate instruments and electric currents. Was Edison making a joke? Was he merely looking to grab headlines during the Spiritualism craze? Many believed this was the case, but a 1933 article in Modern Mechanix magazine reported on a secret demonstration in his darkened laboratory with several scientists present. According to the article, “Edison set up a photo-electric cell. A tiny pencil of light, coming from a powerful lamp, bored through the darkness and struck the active surface of this cell, where it was transformed instantly into a feeble electric current. Any object, no matter how thin, transparent or small, would cause a registration on the cell if it cut through the beam.”The team of scientists spent hours closely watching Edison’s prototype for any sign of movement from beyond. But none came. Still, Edison maintained his belief that some form of afterlife may exist. Months after the 1920 article, the inventor added to his theories on what constitutes life in an interview with the New York Times. Edison explained that he believed the human body to be composed of 100,000,000,000,000 (that’s 100 trillion) infinitely small life units. Each being beyond microscopic, and beyond what the human mind can conceive. “I believe that life, like matter, is indestructible,” Edison said. “There has always been a certain amount of life in this world, and there will always be the same amount. You cannot create life; you cannot destroy life; you cannot multiply life.“I believe our bodies are composed of myriads and myriads of infinitesimal entities, each in itself a unit of life, which band together to build a man. “In our bodies these entities constantly rebuild our tissues to replace those which are constantly wearing out. They watch after functions of the various organs, just as the engineers in a power house see that the machinery is kept in perfect order. Once conditions in the body become unsatisfactory in the body, either through a fatal sickness, fatal accident or old age, the entities simply depart from the body and leave little more than an empty structure behind. Being indefatigable workers, they naturally seek something else to do. They either enter into the body of another man or even start work on some other form of life. At any rate, there is a fixed number of these, and it is the same entities that have served over and over again.”In the final chapter of the posthumously published The Diary and Sundry Observations of Thomas Alva Edison, the great scientist expanded on his thoughts, and even postulated that human life is alien in its origin. “I cannot believe for a moment that life in the first instance originated on this insignificant little ball which we call the Earth—little, that is, in contrast with other bodies which inhabit space,” Edison wrote. “The particles which combined to evolve living creatures on this planet of ours probably came from some other body elsewhere in the universe.”Edison died in October of 1931, having never completed his spirit phone. Sadly, this meant he couldn’t call in new inventions, which he surely would be working on if possible. He said it himself four years earlier after a reporter asked how he’d spend his afterlife, answering with a smile, “Experimenting.”Read more from Marc Hartzman at WeirdHistorian.com.

5,POLITICS,Anger In A Pre-Trump American Zionist: A Rabbinic Response To The Obama Administration's UN Abstention,"Menachem Creditor, ContributorRabbi of Congregation Netivot Shalom (Berkeley, CA), Founder o...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anger-in-a-pre-trump-american-zionist-a-rabbinic-response_us_58640788e4b04d7df167d292,"Careless diplomacy was never John Kerry’s trademark.

Yes, his sometimes aspirational language was deemed “messianic” by critics, but a more consistent hallmark of his curated American international relationship-ing has been careful phrasing. This career-long commitment to international sensitivity was abandoned Wednesday morning, and the effects will be deeply felt for years to come, to the detriment of all.A colleague, Rabbi Ben Goldstein, put it quite well:“What did Kerry offer other than oratory and wonderful rhetoric? ...As a vision for the future, there were some great pieces in the speech, but it will have the opposite of its desired effect. It will change no one’s mind in Israel, it will further the cause of those who think that the Obama administration has not been a friend to Israel, and it will give Israelis and the [political] right more reason to be excited for a Trump presidency. Does anyone think [Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin] Netanyahu will be more likely to give in when he is isolated and pressured by the international community, or is it going to merely give him and his followers more ammunition to believe that it’s them against the world? What good comes from that speech?”I subscribe to the worldview of Progressive Zionism, where Jewish humanism and Jewish self-determination are one and the same, where democracy and Jewishness are mutually strengthening, where pro-Israel and pro-Palestine are compatible, and where American self-interest and Israeli stability do not come at the expense of human rights and international legitimacy. This vision was hurt, not helped, by the United States’ abstention on the United Nations resolution condemning Israel for expanding settlements.(It should be noted, as J.J. Goldberg expertly does, that this condemnation of Israel is far from the worst the UN has passed through American strategic inaction. There are dozens of examples throughout Israel’s 68 years of existence, spanning Democratic and Republican administrations.)President Obama’s decision, executed by Ambassador Samantha Power at the United Nations Security Council this past week, accomplished three of the worst things possible:embolden the Israeli right (who have never trusted the Obama administration);Wednesday’s speech by Secretary of State Kerry did nothing real to advance the cause of peace. As U.S. Congressman Ted Deutch posted on Facebook:Even as a vibrant, often heated, debate over the best way to achieve peace takes place every day in Israel’s government and its media, with widely different approaches across the political spectrum, the threats Israel faces and the challenges with Israel’s negotiating partner remain.Wednesday’s speech was a terrible political move by a statesman who should have known better. By giving in to Netanyahu’s taunts, a Secretary of State with 23 days left in his term effectively positioned President-elect Donald Trump as “the good guy” in the eyes of American Zionists. This undermines the truths of Progressive Zionism and endangers Israelis and Palestinians.Furthermore, this venting of the Obama administration’s accumulated frustration with the Netanyahu administration places American Jewish leaders in the uncomfortable position of choosing between remaining silent (thereby becoming co-opted into the diplomatic war against Israel) and condemning President Obama’s and Secretary Kerry’s decision (thereby becoming co-opted into supporting President-elect Trump).Basically, if you love America, if you love Israel, and if you champion wise statecraft, Wednesday was a God-awful day. The good news is: tomorrow could be worse.What is a Progressive Zionist to do now? Resist the urge to wallow in despair, acknowledge this day’s dreadful mis-step, and do more than cry out on social media. Judaism’s recurring decision to hope against history’s likely outcome is the way forward. We dare not accept reality as it is, nor stand immobilized by fear in our uncertain times. Hopelessness, after all, is a betrayal of all who have come before us and an abandonment of all who are to come. We’ve gotten this far by resisting the presumed inevitable.As the father of Modern Zionism, Theodore Herzl, prophecized, “If you will it, it is not a dream.”"
6,HEALTHY LIVING,Carrie Fisher Was An Advocate For Women With Mental Illness And Addiction,"Michael Darer, ContributorStudent, Wesleyan University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carrie-fisher-was-not-just-an-advocate-for-people-with_us_58641dd3e4b04d7df167d2a7,"In the day since Carrie Fisher’s passing was announced on Tuesday morning, the actress, author, comedienne, script doctor",2016-12-28,<p>Carrie Fisher’s willingness to speak about her struggle with addiction and with bipolar disorder is all the more remarkable and powerful because of how little of the empathy now extended to the mentally ill is directed at female sufferers.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58641e531500002d00e9d625.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the day since Carrie Fisher’s passing was announced on Tuesday morning, the actress, author, comedienne, script doctor, and advocate has been receiving much of the media praise she was denied in life. While the press was always happy to reference Fisher’s talents as a performer, her unwillingness to self-censor was often seen as—at best—a quirk, and—at worst—a cause for irritation. It’s a well-worn platitude that culture doesn’t always know what to do with celebrities who don’t abide by the normal decorum of fame, and this goes doubly (both in and out of the limelight) for women. While a man in Fisher’s position might have been framed as an artistic live wire, a creative presence whose vitality and volatility were necessary and exciting comrades, Fisher herself was often viewed as a PR liability, if not a crackpot. Of course, now that she’s tragically passed, the same outlets that looked down on her unwillingness to hold her tongue for their benefit have decided to spin her acidic gifts as an essential quality that the world around her constantly upheld. “Mouthiness” is only worthy of commendation in a woman once that mouth stops moving.Among the things that Fisher was most famously outspoken about were her struggles with bipolar disorder and addiction, both of which were the focus of many of the interviews she gave, and running themes in her published work, most famously 2008’s Wishful Drinking, which Fisher adapted from her own one-woman show, and which is the source of one of the most frequently reference quotes in her recent obituaries and in-memoriams: “Now I think that this would make for a fantastic obit—so I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.”Fisher was a fearless reporter of her own struggles with mental illness, an unprecedented force for its normalization and humanization. She was an inspiration to so many as to how to speak about the struggles of mental illness and addiction, myself included: with humor and without shame. At no point did Fisher ever cast her biography as a tragedy. Honestly accounting for her battles and traumas and fumblings, she spoke as a passionate work in progress, someone who could earnestly see the heroism in her own living without ever lionizing herself unduly. As anyone who has tried to speak about the difficulties of living mentally ill knows, this can be a difficult thing. It’s all too easy to drift into tonal extremes into discussing the ways in which we have triumphed or failed. Fisher avoided this primarily through her wit. And, goddamn, was Carrie Fisher funny.It’s important in mourning Fisher to give as much weight to this aspect of her career as to any of her Star Wars work, both because of its singular importance in her life, and because of how it so powerfully informs how remarkable all of her other bountiful output was. I also wholeheartedly believe that in discussing Carrie Fisher’s impact on the way we feel touch about mental illness, and the courage with which she shared her own difficulties it would be disingenuous to simply say that Carrie Fisher made an impact on the discourse about mental illness and addiction. Carrie Fisher made an impact on the discourse about mental illness and addiction for women, who have often been denied the incremental social graces being afforded to more and more sufferers.You cannot fully talk about the bravery of Carrie Fisher’s openness without talking about the fact that Carrie Fisher was a woman, and, for women, emotional, psychological, and psychiatric transparency is more often punished than it is rewarded.It goes without saying that both mental illness and addiction carry with them an immense amount of stigma. For many, both are seen as emotional and moral failings rather than serious medical conditions. They are seen as inconveniences thrust upon the innocent friends of those who suffer their full brunt, whose sometimes troubling behavior are often motivated by a deep reservoir of confusion, chaos, sorrow, and fear.It also goes without saying that, as individuals and groups work to dispel that stigma, the progress is incremental. As I have often discussed in previous pieces, there are certain diagnoses (mainly depression and anxiety) that society has normalized to a far greater degree than others (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorders). Furthermore, if you’re going to be mentally ill in America, you’re likely to receive far more sympathy as a white man than as any other group. Among people of color, treatment for mental illness is far less common and stigma is far greater. With African Americans in particular, the nonviolent psychotic features of certain disorders are often read as confirmation of a host of baseless racial stereotypes portraying black Americans as deranged and animalistic. This leads to an increased number of police killings among mentally ill and neurodiverse people of color, who—in simply looking for help—are viewed as dangerous and out of control.Similar standards apply with addiction. While we rightly talk about the tragedy of the American opiate epidemic, it’s worth noting that the majority of the areas receiving coverage are predominantly white. While we talk about the rash of overdoses from opioid substances currently as a tragedy, similar drug outbreaks have received far less sympathetic coverage when they have not involved primarily white sufferers. The most obvious example of this is the “crack epidemic,” which was used as one of the major rationales for the militarization of American police forces that began in the 1970s and 1980s. Despite being a deadly and addictive substance, crack addicts were portrayed as carriers of a social pestilence rather than victims of a serve medical affliction. Looking at less severe substances, the argument still stands: while active alcoholics of all races are viewed with a certain amount of disdain, the problem drinking of a white man is far more likely to be viewed as a tragedy or even some sort of weird artistic asset (in the case of writers, musicians, filmmakers, etc) than in a black man, where it will most likely be written off as a confirmation of old stereotypes about laziness and irresponsibility.These double standards hold true across gender lines, as well. It’s a cliché, at this point, to envision Victorian women shipped off to old-timey mental-institutions in fits of hysteria—excess emotion seen as a sort of feminine insanity—and while we’ve moved away from the archaic staples of such an image, the attitudes that underpinned such incidents are still very much alive.Women who express strong will or strong emotion are seen as improper and broken. They are “crazy” and “bitchy.” They are an inconvenience to the rational men in their lives, who are just trying to move emotionlessly forward. As we have gotten better at fighting the toxic masculine ideal of cold reasonableness, though, we still fail to extend this newfound compassion to women.There are hosts of male artists who are beatifically praised for their discussions of emotional turmoil, or off-color public presentations. Playfully called “Sad Boy” artists, this fraternity includes musicians like Bon Iver, The National, and the Shins; or filmmakers like Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman. As white men, these (often very talented) creative are given space to speak about issues like heartache and depression, anxiety and substance abuse. These facets of their personalities are seen as just that: facets, parts of a whole. In the instances where we do choose to reduce a male artist to something like addiction or mental illness, we often do so through an uncomfortable sort of fetishization, portraying them as a tortured soul whose emotional difficulties or resultant misbehavior are the price and byproduct of being in touch with an unstable and molten creative element.Women are not so lucky. In discussing sadness or depression, women are expected to confine the topic to certain acceptable territories—the most popular being breakups. In this particular case, this containing of a woman’s emotional pain to romantic loss promises the listener that they won’t have to deal with this upset woman for long. All that she needs is a guy to come along and fill that hole in her heart. Then she’ll be happy once more. Still, as any woman who has ever been told to “smile” by a strange man knows, men have very little sympathy for a woman’s right to not be chipper all the time, or for her right to decide when she wants to feel what.Other emotions, such as anger, often don’t even get the luxury of an “acceptable” focus. Sure, everyone loves to joke about “a woman scorned,” but this isn’t an acknowledgment of a woman’s right to be angry when she’s crossed. It’s an assertion that a woman turns into a hellhound when something doesn’t go her way. If a woman takes issue with something, she’s a bitch or worse.Bipolar—which appears in two types and is categorized by swings of varying length and rapidity between depressive and manic moods—then, is a bullseye for the emotional stigmas that women are already saddled with. Sufferers of bipolar and other mood disorders are often portrayed as violent and temperamental, childish and petulant. Women with bipolar disorder are painted as veritable monsters, sometimes given the misogynist grace note that the impulsivity that often accompanies the disorder will make them great in bed, as long as you don’t stick around too long (as a man with a mood disorder I hold that I’m rather average in bed, though I can fluff a mean pillow). In fact, “don’t stick your dick in crazy” is a gross phrase that is almost always used in relation to women suffering from bipolar disorder: a pronouncement that women who have the disorder are unfit to fulfill their social role; incapable of love or commitment; undeserving of respect, attention, or dignity.In many ways, all mental illness in women is flattened into two-dimensional “craziness,” which is then plastered on the sufferer like a social biohazard sign. The result is pressure among women to hide mental illness, addiction, and trauma, to avoid asking for help, which might brand them as social undesirables to a greater degree than a man suffering the same pains.That Carrie Fisher spat in the face of this; that she chose to confront mental illness and addiction head-on; that she chose to speak about it, in all its complexities, and confusions, and minor pettinesses is absolutely breathtaking.It is refreshing to see Fisher’s advocacy given such attention now, but it is even more frustrating to see that attention come only in the wake of her death. If we wish to truly honor the breadth of Fisher’s courage, honesty, and accomplishment, however, we must continue to train ourselves and our culture to prize and celebrate this sort of honesty: every day, not just as the subheader in an obituary. That might be the literal definition of too little, too late.Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues? In the U.S., call 800-662-HELP (4357) for the SAMHSA National Helpline."

One book wants to break the cycle by using child-friendly comics to spread the facts and tackle the myths about menstruation.NEW DELHI – When Aditi Gupta was a teenager, getting her period was a monthly ordeal of isolation, stigma and shame. “I was told not to sit on the sofa or on anyone else’s bed. I was discouraged from entering the kitchen and I was made to stay away from festivities and social events,” she says. “In short, I was treated as impure or polluted and it greatly affected my confidence and self-esteem.”It was only when she started university at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad that she realized how little she actually knew about what was going on with her body. Whenever she had issues or questions about her period, her then-boyfriend, now husband, Tuhin Paul would turn to the internet for information. “His research proved to be an eye opener for both of us. I learned things about menstruation that nobody had ever mentioned to me,” says Gupta, 32.Speaking to other women about their own experiences, Gupta and Paul realized there was a general need for greater awareness among young Indian women about menstruation and menstrual hygiene. In 2012, they launched Menstrupedia, an illustrated website that teaches visitors about the physical and emotional changes girls go through when they reach puberty, as well as answering questions such as, “How important is it for a girl or woman to be aware of her body?” Then they launched a crowdfunding campaign to allow them to put their drawings to paper. The result is Menstrupedia Comic, a fun, colorful book that follows four girls as they learn about periods and everything that comes with them.In India, the majority of girls know little or nothing about menstruation before their first period, according to UNICEF. A taboo subject that’s rarely discussed in homes or schools, menstruation is often seen as shameful. The culture of silence around periods can leave girls confused and fearful when they hit puberty. This lack of awareness often costs girls their social lives and education: Almost one-quarter of girls in India drop out of school when they reach puberty. It also comes with health risks, with studies showing that around 90 percent of women in India don’t wear sanitary pads, using materials such as rags, newspapers and sand instead and increasing their risk of reproductive tract infections. When she was younger, even Gupta, who says she belongs to “a well-settled, educated family,” used a cotton rag instead of a pad. “In the small town where I was growing up, everyone knew each other. I thought going out and asking for pads in a store would impact my family’s reputation,” she says.The Menstrupedia comic books feature four relatable characters: Pinki, who is yet to reach puberty; Jiya, who gets her first period during the course of the story; Mira, who has already started her period; and Pinki’s older sister Priya, a doctor. The story opens with Pinki’s ninth birthday party, which gives Priya the chance to tell the girls all about growing up. As they’re eating a meal together, Jiya leaves to go to the toilet and panics when she sees blood in her underwear. Priya explains that it’s her first period and shows Jiya how to use a pad. In her advice to the girls, Priya touches on everything from pregnancy to nutrition to self-esteem: “Sometimes because of these hormones you may feel overtly conscious about your changing body. Always remember everyone is beautiful and unique in their own way.”The book, which is aimed at girls of nine years old and above, isn’t shy about the facts – drawings of the female anatomy are accurate and detailed; one panel shows the blood stain in Mira’s underwear. And girls are reading it in droves. Since its publication just over three years ago, the book has been translated into 10 languages, including Spanish and Nepali, and Gupta estimates it has reached 75 schools and 50,000 girls in rural India. She says the website gets an average of 150,000 visitors each month and orders for the books have been pouring in from around the world.Khushboo Singh, 22, and Nirali Thakkar, 21, use Menstrupedia in their menstrual-awareness campaign Bleed to Feed in five villages in Jhunjhunu district in Rajasthan, India’s largest state. They say the books are more effective than the traditional method used to teach reproductive health in schools. “Information is generally provided through audiovisual content and girls soon forget what was shown to them,” says Thakkar. “The comics can be stocked in school libraries, a girl can borrow the comic, share it with other women in the family. It is also teacher-friendly as it provides a more constructive and engaging way of dealing with the topic that no one is comfortable talking about.”Health workers, too, can use the comic, both to educate themselves and to supplement the information they share with rural communities. “Despite government guidelines on menstrual health hygiene, the health workers tend to reinforce traditional knowledge, which is based on myths and customs,” says Thakkar.Singh and Thakkar have seen firsthand the consequences of the stigma around menstruation. They meet girls who are kept in seclusion, prohibited not only from going to school or temple, but even forbidden to enter their own kitchen or eat meals with the rest of the family. “For young girls in villages, the menstrual phase becomes very traumatic as there is no one to guide them or provide emotional support,” says Thakkar. In the five villages where the Bleed to Feed campaign runs, across both the Muslim and the Hindu communities, “most parents marry off their daughters soon after they get their first period and they become mothers at a very young age.”For Gupta, catching girls early to teach them about puberty, growing up and the physical processes their bodies are going through is a way to lift the taboo and break the cycle of school dropouts and early marriages. Using frank talk and cartoon characters, “we can raise a generation of mothers who are not only aware about menstruation themselves, but also ensure that their daughters learn about periods at the right time,” she says.This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

In the meantime, the NYPD is still delaying its compliance with a federal court order from 2013 that requires the city to implement a body camera program.That delay ends next year. One thousand body cameras will be deployed in 2017, a spokesman for City Hall told The Huffington Post, and that number is expected to grow to 5,000 in 2018. (The NYPD employs some 35,800 officers.)City Hall wouldn’t comment on the union negotiations.The Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association acknowledged the pay offer while lashing out at the city in a statement on Wednesday.“Body-worn cameras present serious concerns for the rights and safety of both police officers and the public, and those concerns need to be addressed before the cameras are widely deployed,” said union President Patrick J. Lynch. “While paying police officers for wearing the cameras will not resolve these issues, it would at least signal a recognition of the increasing duties and burdens that NYC police officers have been asked to assume without any additional compensation.”Police unions generally have cited higher stress levels, greater job complexity and concerns over the privacy of both officers and civilians as arguments against wearing body cameras. But advocates for the reform contend that police unions are simply delaying to block technology that can hold their members to higher standards of transparency and accountability.Even paying officers more won’t necessarily equate to greater transparency. There’s a nationwide debate raging over how much body camera footage should be released, who should spend resources to edit those videos, and whether the footage should be subject to public records requests. Several jurisdictions have simultaneously passed police body camera laws and blocked all footage from public access.In any case, body cameras in the NYPD are inevitable. They’ll eventually be required for all of the force’s 20,000 patrol officers, The New York Post reports."

The musician, who was briefly married to Fisher in the 1980s, expressed his condolences in a tweet early Wednesday morning. The beloved actress and author died Tuesday following her hospitalization last week. She was 60.Fisher and Simon met while Fisher was filming the first “Star Wars” movie, which debuted in 1977. “Once they saw each other, no one else mattered to either of them,” Peter Ames Carlin wrote in this year’s Homeward Bound: The Life of Paul Simon. The pair moved into an apartment near Central Park almost instantly, but their relationship was complicated by Fisher’s heavy drug use and fears that she wouldn’t live up to Simon’s reputation as a musical virtuoso. Hoping marriage would solve their problems, they wed in 1983, but divorced the following year.The relationship didn’t end there, though. According to Carlin’s biography, as reported by People magazine, they moved in together again after the divorce and dated on and off for about a decade, with Fisher helping to raise Simon’s son from his first marriage. The couple reportedly ended the relationship after a psychedelic trip in the Amazon.Simon’s 1983 song “Hearts and Bones” was about his romance with Fisher. The lyrics imply the coupledom was tumultuous, but end on a loving note: “The arc of a love affair / Waiting to be restored / You take two bodies and you twirl them into one / Their hearts and their bones / And they won’t come undone.” In her 2008 autobiography, Wishful Drinking, Fisher said Simon’s 1990 song “She Moves On” is about their breakup. Simon wrote, “I know the reason I feel so blessed / My heart still splashes inside my chest / But she, she is like a top / She cannot stop / She moves on.” Fisher praised “She Moves On,” writing, “If you can get Paul Simon to write a song about you, do it. Because he is so brilliant at it.”Fisher never remarried, though she did begin dating talent agent Bryan Lourd shortly after breaking up with Simon. They had one child together, “Scream Queens” actress Billie Lourd, in 1992. During a 2010 interview with The New York Times, Fisher reflected on the stereotypically feminine role she felt she was expected to play in her marriage to Simon. “I’m not as cooperative as you might want a woman to be,” she said. “Every man, I think, or at least the ones I end up finding, there’s no such thing as a consort. All men are kings. That was my little discovery in the process ... I really thought men’s fantasy is to have an intellectual geisha. So what I did was I learned to cook and I took a massage course. But that’s not all of it. You have to also agree.”"
13,ARTS & CULTURE,"The Invaluable Lessons Of 'Watership Down,' A Dark Classic Every Kid Should Read",Katherine Brooks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/watership-down-lessons_us_5863f638e4b0d9a59459ccfa,Richard Adams knew his book would frighten kids. And that's why he wrote it.,2016-12-28,"A scene from the animated version of ""Watership Down"" (1978).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586419221900002a000e1e33.jpeg?ops=crop_27_14_5958_3841%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"“I do not believe in talking down to children,” Richard Adams explained in an interview with The Guardian last year.This, coming from an author widely known for writing the most violent “talking rabbit book” in history, is an understatement. Watership Down, his 1972 adventure novel, is not only what happens when a writer refuses to talk down to children. It’s what happens when a writer refuses on all counts to shelter kids from the brutal, melancholy realities of our nonfictional world. It’s what happens when a writer decides to give his young readers an obvious, but invaluable lesson: loss, obstacles and chaos, whether we choose them or not, are part of life.Adams, who died on Tuesday at the age of 96, has recounted the birth of Watership Down many times. In the late 1960s, he ― then a civil servant in the U.K. who’d never written fiction in his life ― would entertain his two daughters on the way to school by telling them stories that revolved around a particularly troubled warren of rabbits. “Once there were two rabbits called Hazel and Fiver,” he’d begin, telling tales captivating in their darkness, involving poison, snares and attack dogs.Eventually, encouraged by his daughters, Adams put pen to paper and submitted a surprisingly vicious and rabbit-filled manuscript to publishers. Rejected seven times (”They felt the language was too grown up,” Adams explained in a Reddit AMA, “yet the older children wouldn’t like it because it was about rabbits!”), it was finally accepted by Rex Collings, the tiny and summarily lucky publishing house that would go on to see the book sell in the millions.Hazel and Fiver are names that pique the ears of those who’ve navigated through Adams’ award-winning, 400-plus-page book. Brothers, they lived in a bucolic landscape meant to mimic the Berkshire Downs of Adams’ childhood. Spurred on by an apocalyptic vision Fiver has, they, along with a small group of other rabbits, decide to leave their vulnerable home in search of a new one. The Odyssean journey is neither smooth nor assuring. The distinct characters, so carefully anthropomorphized, are never blindly valiant as a result.A particularly jarring passage of Watership Down describes the pure fear and anxiety Fiver experiences after involuntarily parting ways with his brother Hazel halfway through the book.In the burrow, Fiver slept and woke uneasily through the heat of the day, fidgeting and scratching as the last traces of moisture dried out of the earth above him. Once, when a trickle of powdery soil fell from the roof, he leaped out of sleep and was in the mouth of the run before he came to himself and returned to where he had been lying. Each time he woke, he remembered the loss of Hazel and suffered once more the knowledge that had pierced him as the shadowy, limping rabbit disappeared in the first light of morning on the down.Because of its subject matter (talking rabbits), and perhaps the fact that many first encounter Adams on a high school reading list, some fans might classify Watership Down as a children’s book. Adams shrugs off the label entirely. “I don’t believe there should be such a thing as a children’s book,” he explained during a Reddit AMA. “A book is a book is a book,” he supposes in other interviews. In 1974, New York Times critic Richard Gilman directly questioned the intended audience of Adams’ book, claiming, “I can’t imagine many readers under 13 or 14, an age when the lines between juvenile and adult fiction begin to blur, having the patience and grasp of extended allegorical strategies to persevere to the end of a 426‐page epic about a community of rabbits.”Gilman’s lack of faith in the reading comprehension of teenagers aside, his criticism missed the point. Kids on the precipice of adulthood should be encouraged to read books like Watership Down whether they have the patience for it or not. Humanity wrought through the eyes of bunnies is exactly the kind of fantasy readers under 13 or 14 should be exposed to. The kind of twisted, alien plot that sits in our heads for decades, becoming brighter and more poignant as you age and better empathize with moments like Fiver’s. The kind of book that unravels slowly, painfully, to reveal a story so realistic it’s easy to forget you’re dealing with talking rabbits and make-believe.“Readers like to be upset, excited and bowled over,” Adams continued in his 2015 interview with The Guardian, remembering his early literary preferences. “I can remember weeping when I was little at upsetting things that were read to me, but fortunately my mother and father were wise enough to keep going.”Of course, not all mothers and fathers are. Many want to shade their kids from the harsh realities of life, a natural instinct hardly worth criticizing here. Some children come face to face with loss regardless ― be it physical, financial, psychological. They are forced to understand grief and resentment firsthand. They are forced to understand that hard work and persistence and focused belief don’t always yield epic outcomes. But others, nestled safely, are not.Fiction, thankfully, can give us the gift of empathy. The kind of empathy your protective parents might not be able to impart. Adams, though a parent himself, aware of the fear his stories instilled in his own daughters, remains cooly detached from Watership Down readers. Through his writing, he’s not attempting to provide solace or security. He’s attempting to forge stories that, like the kind he read in his youth (by Edgar Allan Poe, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Algernon Blackwood), made him feel sad and frightened. That familiarized him with the cold, cloying feeling of worry.Why? Well, Adams, so unaware that he was crafting a classic when he first started sharing stories of Hazel and Fiver, answers the question early on in his book.To come to the end of a time of anxiety and fear! To feel the cloud that hung over us lift and disperse ― that cloud that dulled the heart and made happiness no more than a memory! This at least is one joy that must have been known by almost every living creature. "

That’s because the values and norms of your culture shape the person you’ll become from a young age, scientists believe.And the earliest, and likely the most lasting, of these cultural influences comes from ― you guessed it ― your parents.During the five years she spent studying babies around the world, Washington State University psychologist Dr. Maria Gartstein made some striking observations of how parents’ different cultural values influenced the temperaments and behavior of their babies. These temperamental patterns could set the stage for mental health or illness down the road. Gartstein and her colleagues conducted a cross-cultural examination of the behavior of Chilean, Polish, South Korean and American babies, the results of which were recently published in the European Journal of Developmental Psychology. The mothers of 125 to 420 babies in each country were asked to fill out observations of more than 200 behaviors and temperamental qualities in their infants at 6 months and 1 year old, including activity level, shyness, sadness, cuddliness and attention focusing.The results showed significant parenting differences across these four cultures. American babies, for instance, were more social and impulsive than babies from the other countries, and they were also the most likely to enjoy highly stimulating activities.“[American babies] have some unique opportunities and challenges, compared to infants growing up in other regions of the world,” Gartstein said. “I really appreciate their readiness to engage and share enjoyment ― the baby version of extraversion, if you will.” American mothers also reported that their babies were less likely to display negative emotions, and are easy to soothe when upset. This behavior may result from parents discouraging their children from expressing negative emotions. The other babies, however, acted very differently. In fact, Garstein says that she was taken aback by the extent of the behavioral differences seen across cultures. “One of my more profound moments occurred when I realized that parent-infant interaction dynamics varied dramatically, even in cultures we think of as being similar,” Gartstein told The Huffington Post. Here are some of the most striking differences: South Korean babies had the longest attention spans. The researchers largely chalk these differences up to variations in parents’ cultural values. In South American cultures, for instance, parents are typically very animated with their children, which may contribute to babies being more active and having more trouble focusing. In Poland, on the other hand, the common cultural value of being open about emotions may lead infants to feel comfortable showing sadness. In South Korea, an emphasis on behavioral and attentional control likely causes babies there to reflect these traits. Parenting plays a huge role in the development of these behaviors, and not just what we typically think of as parenting, like playing and feeding, according to Gartstein. “We have to think broader ... [to include] things like daily routine, what parents view as important for their kids to develop to be happy and healthy adults, what they think is essential with respect to parental responsibilities,” she explained. “There are surprisingly considerable cross-cultural differences in these areas.” The researchers hope that better understanding the influence of cultural values can help psychologists devise new strategies for preventing behavioral issues in babies and toddlers, and potentially predicting mental illnesses like ADHD. “If we are aiming to prevent behavioral problems which are a known precursor for more serious psychological problems,” Gartstein said in a press release, “we need to know more about the values and expectations parents bring to the child-rearing table.”"

The star topped Forbes annual list of highest grossing actors, with her films bringing in $1.2 billion worldwide.The magazine cited Johansson’s role as Black Widow in “Captain America: Civil War,” which grossed more than $1.15 billion worldwide. The star’s role in “Hail, Caesar!” also helped to earn her the top spot. “Captain America: Civil War” costars Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. tied for second place on the highest grossing actors list, as the blockbuster was the highest grossing movie of the year.Johansson cemented her place in history as the highest grossing actress ever in June, when Box Office Mojo reported that movies featuring the star grossed $3.3 billion in domestic box office revenue. Earlier this year, Johansson spoke about the gender wage gap that plagues the film industry, saying that she felt “a little obnoxious” discussing how the issue applied to her personally.“I am very fortunate, I make a really good living, and I’m proud to be an actress who’s making as much as many of my male peers at this stage,” Johansson said in Cosmopolitan’s April issue. “I think every woman has [been underpaid], but unless I’m addressing it as a larger problem, for me to talk about my own personal experience with it feels a little obnoxious. It’s part of a larger conversation about feminism in general.”"

Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) is introduced with other Congressional Black Caucus members at a Sept. 17 dinner. If President-elect Donald Trump wants support for an infrastructure package, the caucus may be his best bet for votes across the aisle.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58632a761500002c00916165.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump opponents have been urging Democrats since the day after the election to offer the incoming president nothing but across-the-board resistance to his agenda. Anything else, the argument goes, is tantamount to an endorsement of racism, misogyny and Islamophobia. Liberal magazine writers have been particularly outspoken in support of the strategy of all-out opposition, arguing that only complete obstruction will drive Trump’s approval numbers low enough for Democrats to capitalize, whereas bipartisan cooperation will only make him more popular. “Charles Schumer is leading Democrats to their doom,” warned New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait, slamming the incoming Senate minority leader for pledging to work with Trump on an infrastructure bill. Slate’s Jamelle Bouie warned that Democrats who collaborate “run the real risk of being co-opted, of bolstering the political prospects of ethno-nationalism in the name of a broad ‘populism’ that isn’t actually at play. An infrastructure bill doesn’t outweigh the impact of Trump’s attacks on communities of color, even if it’s influenced by the left. Communities of color need physical and economic security.”The people who represent those communities of color, however, are much more ready to make a deal. The Huffington Post spoke with 11 of the 45 members of the Congressional Black Caucus in the House of Representatives and found the vast majority skeptical but willing to work on an infrastructure bill with Trump, even if Trump cuts House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and her lieutenant, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), out of the process. “The biggest mistake Obama made was trying to work directly with Boehner and Cantor. He should’ve gone straight to the Tuesday Group,” said Sam Geduldig, a lobbyist who is one of K Street’s top donors to the GOP, referring to a group of moderate House Republicans that has since dwindled. “My firm and our clients are looking at this as an opportunity to team with black lobbyists and black caucus members to put together a coalition and work with the rank and file to bypass Pelosi and Schumer. We know Trump won’t make the same mistake as Obama.”Moses Boyd, a Democratic lobbyist and former senior Senate Democratic aide, said that he wasn’t advocating bypassing Democratic leaders but does believe the CBC could play a pivotal role if Trump approached them. “If he’s serious, then we’re serious,” said Boyd, who has worked on lobbying campaigns with Geduldig. “I believe there’s an opportunity to push critically needed infrastructure investments, particularly in the inner city.”William Lacy Clay Jr., who represents St. Louis, perked up at the thought of Trump bypassing Democratic leadership and working directly with the CBC. “He’s got my attention, if that’s their approach. I don’t have a problem with it,” he said, adding that St. Louis, being a transportation hub at the center of the country, has a number of infrastructure needs.“One in particular is the merchant’s bridge, which carries a lot of train traffic over the Mississippi. So if that’s their approach for 2017, I’m all in,” Rep. Clay said. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), who represents parts of Kansas City, advised Trump not to try to cut side deals but added that the CBC’s founding motto, formulated by Lacy Clay’s father, may become relevant. “It is worth Mr. Trump knowing the motto of the Congressional Black Caucus, written several decades ago by William Clay: ‘We have no permanent enemies, no permanent friends, only permanent interests.’ But it’s not going to be easy to trust someone who has almost blatantly sent out a message of ‘I don’t care about you guys,’” Cleaver said. “To be sure, there isn’t a single person in our caucus who thinks that the president was extending an olive branch when he nominated Sen. [Jeff] Sessions, nor when he selected Mr. [Steve] Bannon.”Bannon, who claims to have worked to establish Breitbart.com as a home for the “alt-right,” which was coined as a more palatable term for white nationalism, sees the infrastructure package as a way to cleave black and brown voters from Democrats. “I’m not a white nationalist; I’m a nationalist. I’m an economic nationalist,” Bannon, who is Trump’s chief strategist, told The Hollywood Reporter. “I’m the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. With negative interest rates throughout the world, it’s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Shipyards, ironworks, get them all jacked up.”“If we deliver, we’ll get 60 percent of the white vote and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote, and we’ll govern for 50 years,” Bannon boasted.Cleaver said the CBC would be willing to talk. “Now, if there are things the next president wants to do that matches our agenda, then you’ll find the CBC working with the next president. For example, if he genuinely wants to do transportation, if he genuinely wants to do criminal justice reform, he’s going to find a receptive ear from the Congressional Black Caucus and Hispanic Congressional Caucus.”Danny K. Davis, who represents Chicago, said he was skeptical Trump would go that route but that if he did, he’d be ready to talk. “Any conversation would have to include the allness of America,” he said, noting that his district includes many areas that would not typically be thought of “as part of black need.” “Now what I would be open to is a conversation about our 10-20-30 plan that we’ve been pushing. Which means that you take 10 percent of your appropriations and put them in areas where 20 percent of the population has been living at or below the poverty level for 30 years. I’d be delighted to have that conversation,” Rep. Davis said.Outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada wasn’t bothered by the suggestion Trump break protocol and cut out leadership. “If Trump thinks he can get the infrastructure bill by going to the CBC, good. Those are all my friends. I want infrastructure. However he gets it done, he should get it done,” Reid said.Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), formerly the chairman of the CBC, said it “would be a mistake for any president to bypass the minority party in the Congress.” “I’m not suggesting that he should exclude the Congressional Black Caucus,” he added. “You start your negotiations with the leaders of the Democratic Party and Democratic caucus, but certainly we want to be a part of the conversation.” He has a list of upgrades his district needs, including “water and sewer systems that are over 100 years old. I don’t know how you define infrastructure. Some people would put schools into infrastructure, and if that is the case we have schools that need to be brought into the 21st century. We have a lot of dilapidated and boarded-up housing that is contributing to the blight in the community. These boarded-up houses need to be demolished.”“I don’t think there’s going to be any daylight between the CBC and the Democratic caucus. “That kind of divide-and-conquer strategy is not smart for us,” said Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.). Others were skeptical that Trump would come forward with anything useful to negotiate over ― and, indeed, Paul Krugman and others point to signs that it may just be one more grift anyway. “It would be interesting to see if he even proposes something,” said Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), saying she doubted “he would propose something that is helpful to Democrats or our core values, since I’ve not seen that with his appointments, I’ve not seen any apologies for the things that he has said that affect me personally as a female and an African-American. I get that he is the president-elect, and maybe if he acts like that and sends us something, we’ll take it from there.”Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat, is the incoming chairman of the CBC. He said it was too early to say whether he’d say yes to direct talks with Trump. “I have not talked to him, so I have no idea, to tell you the truth. And the caucus has not seen anything or been presented with anything, or [been] contacted in any way, so it’s really just hypothetical right now. It’s not a yes. It’s not a no. You know, we’ll see what he does.”Sign up here to get Ryan Grim’s newsletter, Bad News, in your inbox."

Estimates say the scales came from 5,000 to 7,500 different animals and could have had a street value of more than $2 million.Pangolins have quickly become a striking face in the fight against wildlife crime, with almost a million trafficked over the past decade. All eight species are now listed as “vulnerable,” “endangered” or “critically endangered” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.The creatures, also known as scaly anteaters, are hunted primarily for their scales, which are used in traditional medicine in China and Vietnam in attempts to cure everything from cancer to asthma. However, there is no scientific basis to those claims. The scales are made from the same material as human fingernails.Authorities have busted several massive pangolin smuggling rings over the past few years, many of which traffic thousands of animals at a time. A raid in Indonesia netted some 4,000 animals last year and more than 4 tons were discovered in Hong Kong, labeled as plastic, in June.Delegates from nearly every nation voted to ban the international sale of pangolins and their parts in September during this year’s meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also known as CITES. All species of pangolins were given the strictest protection afforded to threatened animals, but the bust in China shows a rampant market still exists for contraband wildlife.Shanghai customs officials arrested three people who have been accused of smuggling the parts this month. They’re suspected of importing illicit pangolin scales from Africa into China since at least 2015, Agence France Presse reports.Despite recent protections, it’s estimated more than 10,000 pangolins are poached every year."

Andrew Cyrille; photo: Petra Cvelbar; Thelonious Monk (1966); photo: Everett CollectionBy Dan Ouellette, ZEALnyc Senior Editor, December 28, 2016Think the brutal cold and sometimes snow or freezing rain of New York in January can keep musicians and crowds off the streets and huddled under blankets at home? Think again. In fact, it seems that the city's annual festivals have found a vital life in one of the darkest and bleakest months of the year. Think of it as the heat factor in the short days of daylight. There is no hibernation season, but rather a sizzling of high-caliber music that has been sprouting to life despite the chill.You'd think summer, with all its green glory, would be the season of choice for music--especially jazz--to swing right into our lives. But the gray, leafless, snowy or icy season of the winter wonderland has in recent years made for a different kind of celebration that eclipses other times of the year. Of course, the cultural impact of New York City, in all its boroughs, is the grand central of local and international musicians gathering in artistic anticipation. It could well be the act of keeping warm by gathering.Herein are the top 5 fests of the wintertide.••• Five Snowballs: NYC Winter Jazzfest, January 5-10What started twelve years ago as an inspired goal of giving voice to the plethora of relatively unknown but immensely talented jazz musicians toiling in the multitude of the New York's tiny and obscure clubs, the Jazzfest has become hands down the best festival for jazz in the entire year in a city where improvised music never sleeps. Some call it the SXSW of jazz.It's immense. This year's fest stretches over six days, highlighted by the two-night Jazzfest Marathon on Friday, Jan. 6 and continues on Saturday, Jan. 7 at thirteen venues in and around Greenwich Village and across Lower Manhattan. More than 140 different groups comprising four hundred musicians take the various stages.The range of music is dizzying. There's a not-to-be-missed opening night show (Thursday, Jan. 5 at Le Poisson Rouge) featuring jazz elder saxophonist Pharoah Sanders (who played in one of John Coltrane's later bands) and the young upstart from Britain, saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings, who is one of the most dynamic young saxophonists in jazz today--though not well known because he hails from across the pond and has rarely played in the U.S. The bookend of the fest takes place on Tuesday, Jan. 10, when Le Poisson Rouge presents Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra and its Concert for Social Justice with special guest pianist Geri Allen and arrangements by LMO co-founder Carla Bley.In between, there's a plethora of jazz wonder, including salutes two of jazz's top labels, Blue Note and ECM, with bands from their stables. Plus there's a #BlackLivesMatter showcase of poetry and song by several groups as well as the Jazz Legends Play for Disability Pride NYC benefit concert at the Quaker's Friends Meeting House.Salutes go to two of jazz's greats: artist in residence drummer/composer Andrew Cyrille and a special honoring of the 100th birthday anniversary of one of jazz's top masters: piano genius Thelonious Monk--one of the most influential artists to the new class of jazz musicians.If it all seems a bit overwhelming, well, it is--like going to the North Sea Jazz Festival in July in Rotterdam and being faced with acts playing on 13 different stages all at the same time. So, a word to the potentially weary: choose carefully and become immersed in only tidbits of the offerings.••• Four Snowballs: globalFEST, January 8, Webster HallGranted it's only a one-night shot (scaled down from what it used to be), but globalFEST (globalfest.org) is a multifarious extravaganza of world music from around the planet that takes place in the multiple performance spaces in Webster Hall). ""This year's edition brings us full circle to why we started globalFEST in 2003 following 9/11 and the country's closing of borders,"" noted globalFEST co-founder Isabel Soffer. ""We wanted to encourage our colleagues in the performing arts field to take artistic risks, and put international perspectives centerstage.""With ""building bridges"" culturally by music as its theme, this year's edition features tradion and experimentalists including old-school Congo rumba by L'Orchestre Afrisa International), Africa-rooted Latin by Betsayda Machado, socio-political Cuban club music by Batida, shaman-rooted glam rock of Korea's SsingSsing, African nu-soul singer Jojo Abot, and digital-looping Estonian folk violinist/singer Maarja Nuut. Also on the program are the global facets of very regional American styles: D.C.'s Rare Essence's funk-fired go-go and Ranky Tanky's take on the Gullah Sea Island traditions in South Carolina.Added tastemaker and festival co-founder Bill Bragin: ""globalFEST strongly believes that these unique cultural and personal expressions are what bring us closer together as a society. Diversity is a force that unites, not divides."" Indeed this is the world in all its diverse beauty.There is no place to better dive into the wealth of the world's music on the same evening as globalFEST. It's a unique event--only in New York--put together by the wise and wily expertise of the show's founders and programmers. Support it!Lineup of artists for this year's globalFEST:* AlSarah and the Nubatones (Sudan/Brooklyn): East African Retro-Pop * Batida (Portugal/Angola): Afro electronic dance party * Betsayda Machado y La Parranda El Clavo (Venezuela): Powerhouse Afro-Venezuelan vocalist (U.S. debut) * Jojo Abot (Ghana/Denmark/USA): Experimental Afropolitan pop-soul * Hoba Hoba Spirit (Morocco): Casablanca's irreverent rock stars. * L'Orchestre Afrisa International et M'bilia Bel (DRC/USA): Tabu Ley Rochereau's Congolese rumba legends return * Maarja Nuut featuring Hendrik Kaljujärv (Estonia): Digital Estonian folk soundscapes * Ranky Tanky (USA): Funky Gullah songs of the South Carolina Sea Islands * Rare Essence (USA): D.C.'s pioneering polyrhythmic Go-Go superstars * Rudresh Mahanthappa's Indo-Pak Coalition (USA): Indo-jazz * Septeto Santiaguero (Cuba): Grammy-winning son cubano stars * SsingSsing (Korea): Shamanistic Korean folk songs meet rock••• Three Snowballs: Jazz at Lincoln Center, January/February LineupWhile Jazz at Lincoln Center is not advertising it as such, but iut sure looks like a January/February festival if there ever has been. Whether it's staged at Rose Theater (the centerpiece of the jazz performance spaces) or at the amphitheater-like stage, the Appel Room with its backdrop of a picture window onto the colorful Columbus Circle, the shows this winter are top-tier events.A brief overview:* Branford Marsalis Quartet With Special Guest Vocalist Kurt Elling: January 20-21, Rose Theater This collaboration, once viewed as a one-shot event/recording, has been a perfect fit. Adventurous jazz from the saxophonist teamed with the quirky, equally daring vocals by one of the best in jazz makes for a special evening of song.* Celebrating Dizzy Gillespie: January 26-28, Rose Theater The Diz would have been 100 years old this year. While he passed away in 1993, nearly a quarter century ago, the trumpeter/musical adventurer--who co-founded the bebop movement and brought Afro-Cuban music into the jazz vernacular--still influences the vital music of today. Wynton Marsalis leads his Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with musical director Vincent Gardner in well-recognized Dizzy standards (i.e., ""Salt Peanuts,"" ""Night in Tunisia"") as well new pieces inspired by the icon.* The Latin Side of Dizzy With Carlos Henriquez: January 27-28, Appel Room Musical director and bassist Carlos Henriquez brings together an all-star Latin jazz cast to celebrate Gillespie's contribution to Latin jazz.* Dianne Reeves: February 10-11, Rose Theater One of the top-tier jazz singers of this generation, the Grammy Award-winning Dianne Reeves sings lush swing for this special pre-Valentine engagement. Love and romance in the mix!* Jazz of the '50s: Overflowing With Style: February 17-18, Rose Theater While today's jazz continues to evolve and grow in experimentation and in popularity, the golden age of the idiom historically inarguably took place in the 1950s. Wynton Marsalis and his Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with musical director Chris Crenshaw prove that assessment by performing the classic music of the eras by Miles Davis, Art Blakey, Gerry Mulligan and others.••• Two Snowballs: The Ferus Festival, January 5-10In its fourth annual year, the Ferus Festival sets up shop in January at National Sawdust, curated by its in-house producing and touring company VisionIntoArt. This festival features ""untamed voices"" showcasing multimedia collaborations and works-in-progress. As might be expected with National Sawdust, the mix is very eclectic, including collaborations in new music, theater and multimedia by innovative international and local artistsA snapshot roundup of shows:* M IS BLACK ENOUGH: Poetry by Roger Bonair-Agard; music by Andy Akiho, Thursday, January 5* The Afield and Nelson Patton with Lonnie Holley (split bill): Friday, January 6 Visual and textual storytelling within musical performance. Violinist Rebecca Fischer performs with a band and a film by Anthony Hawley is shown; Nelson Patton is an experimental duo of looped trombone (Dave Nelson) and drums & Moog bass pedals (Marlon Patton) with Lonnie Holley contributing vocals.* Revert to Sea created and composed by Yuka C.

21,QUEER VOICES,Here Are 13 Of The Worst Anti-LGBTQ Villains Of 2016,Curtis M.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585cd3eb1c00000a070ed2b6.jpeg?cache=5t60jC2hyk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After years of progressive strides, 2016 turned out to be an unfortunate stumbling block in the LGBTQ community’s quest for equality. Unquestionably the year’s most devastating blow took place on June 12, when 49 people, most of whom identified as queer, were killed in the devastating Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida. As sickening as that grisly act of homophobia was, hopes that such an unparalleled tragedy would encourage national solidarity with the LGBTQ community were soon dashed when Donald Trump, who ran on an explicitly anti-queer platform, won the U.S. presidency in November.Orlando shooter Omar Mateen’s actions were, of course, an unprecedented level of extremism that lie beyond critical scope. But there were a number of public figures whose actions and words during 2016 fed into the culture that allowed an act of hate like the massacre to occur. From former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, who aggressively backed his state’s anti-transgender “bathroom bill,” to Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, who suggested he’d rather be crucified than ditch his opposition to LGBTQ rights, 2016 made in very clear that there are still people in positions of authority who want to dismantle the progress the LGBTQ community has made over the past decade.As keen as we are to be forward-thinking after the challenges of the last year, we also must reckon with the forces ― and individuals ― who still oppose our basic rights. In the spirit of resistance in 2017, here’s an honest look back at 13 people who actively worked against the rights and humanity of LGBTQ people in 2016. We can (hopefully) only go up from here, folks. "

I had run again and articulated it, I think I could’ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,” Obama said.Trump thinks not and claims the president had too much negative baggage for another win. “I say NO WAY,” Trump tweeted, adding: “jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.”Besides, Trump tweeted: “The world was gloomy before I won — there was no hope.”There was no immediate response from the White House.Trump also took the opportunity while writing his tweets to praise his Donald J. Trump charity, which he announced Saturday he is shutting down to “avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as president,” and vowing to “continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.”Trump boasted on Twitter that he has given “millions” to the foundation (and “raised or recieved” — in yet another Twitter typo — “millions more”) yet the “media won’t report!”In fact the Washington Post has reported that according to charity records Trump hasn’t contributed anything to his charity since 2008. The biggest donors in recent years were pro-wrestling moguls Vince and Linda McMahon, who Trump recently nominated to head the Small Business Administration.The president-elect has also spent $258,000 from the charity to settle lawsuits against his businesses, contrary to regulations governing such foundations, according to the Post. He’s also used charity funds for other “self dealing” prohibited by charity regulations, such as using some $30,000 to purchase two large paintings of himself, one of which hangs on a wall at a Trump golf resort. The charity is currently being investigated by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has warned the foundation that it cannot be dissolved while it is the target of a probe. Schneiderman’s office ordered the organization in a letter to stop fundraising as of September since it had not obtained the proper certification to solicit money from the public.The probe was launched after the foundation gave a $25,000 donation to a campaign fundraising group for Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was considering joining a fraud lawsuit against Trump University at the time. Trump paid a $2,500 fine to the IRS because of regulations that prohibit charities from giving political donations, and Trump reimbursed the $25,000 to his foundation.Schneiderman’s spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick, told ABC that the ongoing probe examining procedures at the charity will prevent Trump from shuttering the organization immediately.“The Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,” Spitalnick said in a statement. The foundation’s fundraising activities also “remain suspended following the AG’s notice of violation earlier this year.” "

It takes both a man and a woman to get pregnant, so both partners should be aware of what they are doing to prevent pregnancy,” Dr. Rachel Weinerman told Reuters Health in an email.“It is reassuring to see that the overwhelming majority of men knew about their partner’s contraceptive use,” said Weinerman, a reproductive endocrinologist at the University Hospitals Ahuja Medical Center in Beachwood, Ohio, and UH Cleveland Medical Center who wasn’t involved in the study.The findings also emphasize how important it is to have a conversation about safe sex prior to that initial sexual encounter, Weinerman said.“Every relationship is going to be different, but it doesn’t have to be a long or awkward discussion. ‘What kind of birth control do you use?’ is a straightforward question that female partners should appreciate,” she said.SOURCE: bit.ly/2ifaRYn American Journal of Men’s Health, online December 5, 2016."

In fact, considering that no good ever comes of using a celebrity’s death to promote a product, the reaction from Twitter users was unsurprisingly quick and harsh.Cinnabon has not responded to The Huffington Post about the now-deleted tweet, but posted an apology a few hours later.The brewing storm is similar to the one that blew up in General Mills’ corporate face after Prince died in April. The cereal company put out a tweet featuring the words “Rest in Peace” against a purple backdrop. In place of the dot over the “i” was a single Cheerio. New York-based crisis management expert Jessa Moore told HuffPost at the time that there is really no good way for a corporate brand to honor a celebrity’s death.“It’s insensitive,” Moore said. “It’s like they’re saying, ‘We’re going to capitalize on [a celebrity] death so we show up in a search algorithm.’”UPDATE: This version of the story has been updated to include Cinnabon’s apology tweet."

So many chose unemployment in order to be poor enough to qualify for Medicaid coverage, researchers report in the American Journal of Public Health.“Policy makers in states that have not expanded Medicaid often suggest that making Medicaid available to more people will increase their dependence on public insurance and discourage them from working to obtain insurance through an employer,” said lead author Jean Hall, a health and disability policy researcher at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City and the University of Kansas, Lawrence.“Our results show just the opposite for people with disabilities, who are much more likely to work in states that expanded Medicaid,” Hall told Reuters Health by email.In 2014, states were given the option to expand Medicaid’s coverage under the ACA, allowing people earning up 138 percent of the poverty rate to receive Medicaid coverage.In the 19 states that have not expanded Medicaid, the earnings limit for people with disabilities is 85 percent of the poverty rate, or $834 dollars per month, Hall’s team writes.To examine how Medicaid expansion affects employment rates among people with disabilities, researchers used data from a nationally representative quarterly phone survey conducted 10 times between early 2013 and late 2015.The analysis included 2,740 participants who answered yes when asked if they had a mental or physical condition or impairment that affects daily activities or requires the use of special equipment such as a wheelchair or communication devices.Participants were also asked about their work status in each survey round, and researchers compared the employment rates of people with disabilities in states that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA and those that didn’t, before and after the law went into effect.After the ACA was implemented, people with disabilities living in states with expanded Medicaid were significantly more likely to be employed than those in non-expansion states. In the expansion states, 38 percent of the disabled survey respondents were working compared to 32 percent in the states that didn’t expand coverage.The proportion of people who said they were not working because of their disability was 40 percent in expansion states and 48 percent in non-expansion states.In states that didn’t expand Medicaid, employment rates among the disabled fell slightly after the ACA went into effect, but researchers said they didn’t have enough data from the years before the law’s implementation to explain why that happened. “People with disabilities desperately need health insurance because of chronic health conditions,” Jae Kennedy, chair of the health policy and administration department at Washington State University in Spokane, said by email.Medicaid expansion requires more funding from states and the federal government, but the result is that newly insured people are able to pay for their care with insurance, said Kennedy, who wasn’t involved in the study.“Medicaid matters. Expanding it without extra requirements helps people with disabilities remain in or return to work,” Kennedy said.“Expanding Medicaid empowers people with disabilities to work instead of applying for cash assistance, being dependent on the government, and living in poverty,” Hall said. “Moreover, research has shown that working, even part-time, improves health.”SOURCE: bit.ly/2h6OMGI The American Journal of Public Health, online December 20, 2016.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the location of Washington State University Health Policy and Administration program.

Google tweaked its algorithm following weeks of backlash after several outlets reported the top result for the search “did the Holocaust happen” directed users to an article from American neo-Nazi group Stormfront that claimed it never took place.“We recently made improvements to our algorithm that will help surface more high quality, credible content on the web,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “We’ll continue to change our algorithms over time in order to tackle these challenges.”The update marks a reversal of the company’s original decision earlier this month to refrain from tampering with the anti-Semitic article’s top position.“[The company does] not remove content from [its] search results, except in very limited cases such as illegal content, malware and violations of our webmaster guidelines,” a Google spokesperson previously told Gizmodo.The Stormfront article does still appear in search results but not at the top, and tweaking the phrase to “the Holocaust didn’t happen” continues to place the article near the top of results.The company did not further explain whether it has any continuing efforts to alter search algorithms.This isn’t the first time Google has come under fire for inadvertently bringing up offensive content. The search engine also altered its auto-completion suggestions earlier this month after racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic prompts like “are Muslims bad” and “are women evil” were reported.These updates highlight Google’s tricky task of embracing free speech and remaining politically neutral, while maintaining its commitment to producing fact-based search results.“Google was built on providing people with high-quality and authoritative results for their search queries,” the spokesperson told HuffPost. “Judging which pages on the web best answer a query is a challenging problem and we don’t always get it right.”"

The overall perception of the law has been mixed at best, thanks to a botched website rollout and recent premium increases. But the legislation has also come with some serious benefits. It allows young adults to stay covered under their parents’ insurance plans until age 26, forces insurance companies to cover those with pre-existing conditions, covers preventative health care and ends lifetime limits on essential coverage. Thus far, the law has helped roughly 20 million people gain health coverage.In order to understand just how transformative the law has been for some Americans, HuffPost Rise spoke with two families that have felt the positive impact of the Affordable Care Act firsthand. Stacey Lihn’s daughter Zoe was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a congenital heart defect that required her to have her first open-heart surgery at just 15 hours old. Before the age of 5, Zoe underwent two more open-heart surgeries, and Lihn started coming to terms with a scary realization.“When we received Zoe’s diagnosis, I had coverage under my employer’s’ plan, but we had a lifetime cap on our policy,” Lihn said. “It’s very expensive. Obviously having three open heart surgeries before the age of 5, she was going to hit that lifetime cap and likely at a very young age.”Fighting back tears, Lihn described how she considered giving her parents guardianship of Zoe so the little girl could continue to get health coverage.  “And when the Affordable Care Act was passed it was such a relief. It would be affordable and there wasn’t a cap on how much medical care she could receive,” she said, referring to a provision of the law that prohibits the use of lifetime dollar limits on essential health care.Today, Zoe is a healthy 6-year-old, but her mother, who captivated America with her daughter’s story at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, still fears for her well-being every day.“I’m extremely concerned about a complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act” she said. “I fear that [Zoe] … at 6 years old, is going to have to be confronted with [the question of] ‘Why am I not being cared for anymore? Why can’t I go to the doctor if I don’t feel good?’ And not being able to protect her in that way and having her realize her own mortality because of an election is terrifying.”Jeff Jeans was another victim of the United States’ complicated health insurance system. In 2011, Jeans’ small real estate business went under, so he lost health insurance coverage. Shortly afterward, he found out he had throat cancer. But without insurance, the cost of treatment was going to be a hurdle.“I think we lost our insurance in January or February and I lost my voice in September [or] October,” he said. “You know, you don’t think you have cancer. That’s the last thing you probably think of, especially when I was only 49 years old.” After going more than a year without health insurance, Jeans purchased a pre-existing condition insurance plan through the individual marketplace that was created with Obamacare. “The very day my policy kicked in, they gave me radiation. They gave me chemotherapy,” he said.Jeans, who had previously been a staunch conservative and even canvassed for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, wasn’t fond of the Affordable Care Act before he received his diagnosis. He’s since had a change of heart.“When we owned our business and they first passed the Affordable Care Act, I told my wife that we would shut the doors of our business and shutter it before I would comply with this law. And that was the law that ended up saving my life,” he said. Now a devoted Obamacare supporter, Jeans runs a Facebook group called Obamacare Saved My Life, where he shares health care-related articles and information about the ACA. Despite stories like these, an Obamacare repeal remains a very real possibility. While repealing and replacing the law will be tough, President-elect Donald Trump has stated that he is dedicated to the cause.

She denies wrongdoing and accuses Argentina’s current leader, Mauricio Macri, of using the courts to persecute her.The country was riveted in June when Fernandez’s former public works secretary, Jose Lopez, was arrested while tossing bags stuffed with millions of dollars over the walls of a Catholic convent on the outskirts of Buenos Aires.A gun-toting Lopez started hurling the money into the Our Lady of Fatima convent when the elderly nuns inside were slow to answer the door in the early morning hours of June 14, according to a neighbor who witnessed what happened and called 911.A surveillance video shows the nuns finally welcoming Lopez and accepting the cash while paying little attention to the automatic rifle he had placed by the convent door.Lopez and his direct boss, former Planning Minister Julio De Vido, were indicted along with Fernandez on Tuesday.The alleged skimming of road projects took place in the Patagonian province of Santa Cruz, where Fernandez lives.The ruling said the offenses took place until Dec. 9, 2015, Fernandez’s last day as president after eight years in office. No arrest warrant has been issued for Fernandez, and Lopez is already in jail on money laundering charges.In May Fernandez was indicted for “unfaithful administration to the detriment of public administration.” During her administration, according to the charges, the central bank took money-losing positions in the futures market just before a widely expected devaluation of the peso currency.Fernandez, head of the leftist faction of the Peronism party umbrella, is revered by millions of Argentines for her generous welfare programs. She is reviled by others, who accuse her of wrecking Argentina’s economy, Latin America’s third biggest, with profligate state spending and heavy-handed trade and currency controls."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5862d87f1500002e00e9d42f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New York subway art is about to get a bit more inclusive. When the city’s long-awaited Second Avenue subway line opens New Year’s Day, commuters will get a first look at a series of life-size, mural portraits adorning the new 72nd Street station ― including a depiction of two married gay men holding hands.Artist Vik Muniz told the Associated Press that he opted to include New York married couple Thor Stockman and Patrick Kellogg in his “Perfect Strangers” mural project because “they are just people you would expect to see” riding the city’s subway.”You would expect to see men holding hands,” the artist, who divides his time between the U.S. and Brazil, said. Kellogg said he and Stockman posed for the photograph on which their “Perfect Strangers” mural is based while meeting up with a friend who was working with Muniz three years ago in Brooklyn. Earlier this year, they learned that their image would be among those that the artist had selected for replication in the subway station project. Although the news felt like “winning the lottery,” Stockman said the men were asked to keep it under wraps until specifics of the installations were made public by the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) earlier this month. The couple is particularly proud of their participation in the project, which is believed to be New York’s first permanent, non-political LGBTQ piece of public art, because they see themselves as the type of same-sex couple not normally represented in popular culture. “Our friends were even happier that this is gay representation that is not incredibly beautiful and skinny,” Kellogg told the AP. Among those to praise the Second Avenue subway works was New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who called it the “largest public art installation” in the state’s history, according to Gothamist. “Public works projects are not just about function—they’re an expression of who we are and what we believe,” Cuomo, who will take the Second Avenue subway’s inaugural ride on New Year’s Eve, said. “Any child who has never walked into a museum or an art gallery can walk the streets of New York and be exposed to art and education simply by being a New Yorker. That is where we came from and that is what makes New York special.”What a beautiful way to honor the city’s diversity and embrace of all people! "

But moms-to-be with kicky babies can rest easy ― the MRI image showcases an extremely rare condition that was not caused by a baby’s kick.The 33-year-old woman had developed a 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) tear in the wall of her uterus, and through the tear, part of the amniotic sac measuring 7.5 by 4.7 by 3.5 inches (19 by 12 by 9 cm) popped out, according to a brief report of her case. The amniotic sac is the fluid-filled membrane found in the uterus that contains the growing and developing fetus. But the woman had no symptoms that any of this was going on. She didn’t learn of her condition until she came in for a routine ultrasound when she was 22-weeks pregnant, according to the report, published Dec. 21 in The New England Journal of Medicine.Dr. Pierre-Emmanuel Bouet, an OB/GYN at the Angers University Hospital in France and the lead author of the report, said he had never seen a case like this before.

In all of her five previous pregnancies, the woman delivered the babies via Caesarean section (C-section), they wrote.In fact, it was the woman’s five previous C-sections that increased her risk for a uterine tear, Bouet said. It seems that her C-sections had weakened the wall of the uterus, he said. The tear didn’t occur at the exact location of the earlier C-sections, but close by, he added.The area of the uterus that had scarred after the C-sections was strong, but the regions around this scar were fragile, Bouet said. The forces and pressures on the uterus that occur during pregnancy ultimately led to the tear, he said.Upon discovering the woman’s uterine tear and protruding amniotic sac, the doctors informed the woman and her husband of the potential risks, which included additional uterine tearing, preterm birth and a serious pregnancy complication called placenta accreta, in which the placenta doesn’t detach from the uterine wall after birth.It was also possible for the amniotic sac to rupture, Bouet said. If this occurred, the doctors would make sure that the fetus still had a heartbeat, and if so, would perform an emergency C-section, Bouet said. The doctors would also have to consider the age of the fetus: if it was too early in the pregnancy, the odds of survival would be lower, he said.The woman and her husband decided to continue the pregnancy with close monitoring, according to the report. Bouet said that the woman was not put on bed rest during this time, and that she could do some moderate walking. By 30 weeks, the tear in the woman’s uterus grown by 2 inches (5 cm) and the portion of the amniotic sac outside the uterus had grown in size, the doctors wrote in the report. At that point, not only did this part of the amniotic sac contain the fetus’s legs, but also the abdomen, they wrote.The doctors and the woman decided to deliver the baby via C-section. The baby boy was healthy, and weighed in at 3 lbs. (1.385 kilograms), according to the report. After delivery, the doctors repaired the woman’s uterus, and she returned home from the hospital after five days.The doctors last checked in with mother and baby six months after he was born, and noted that they were doing well.Originally published on Live Science."

The “Happy Birthday” song. Beyoncé’s entire catalog. And, of course, composer John Williams’ score to the “Star Wars” films, which are just as iconic and recognizable as that opening prelude scroll into outer space. At least one person, however, doesn’t agree with that conclusion: Williams himself, who told The Mirror that he doesn’t find the “Star Wars” theme orchestrations to be particularly noteworthy. “A lot of them ​are ​not very memorable,” he said.“I’m a composer of music,” he explained, “and I look at Mozart and I look at Beethoven and Bach, the greatest organizers of sound that we’ve ever had, and you need to be humble when the shoulders that we stand on are so great.​“Not to mention that Williams himself has also composed ― aside from non-film symphonies and concertos ― a number of other memorable scores, including those for “Jaws,” “E.T.,” “Schindler’s List,” and the first three “Harry Potter” movies. That’s some stiff competition within his own oeuvre.Perhaps more surprising is that, after spending months or more meticulously crafting and conducting orchestral compositions for these films, he admitted that he’s never actually seen the finished products. “I’m not particularly proud of that,” he told The Mirror. “”When I’m finished with a film, I’ve been living with it, we’ve been dubbing it, recording to it, and so on. You walk out of the studio and, ‘Ah, it’s finished.’” Then it’s time to move on to the next project. The always-prolific Williams hasn’t slowed down at 83; after scoring “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” last year, he has begun work on a new Steven Spielberg project.H/T AV Club"
39,POLITICS,Did James Comey Cost Hillary Clinton The Election? We Asked The Late-Deciding Voters.,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-comey-hillary-clinton_us_58617933e4b0eb586486f317,"The FBI director didn't help, they say. But it's too simple to put all the blame on him.",2016-12-27,The Clinton campaign has blamed James Comey for their candidate's loss. We asked voters if they agree.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58617bd81500002f00e9d25c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For months, as the election wound down to its bitter conclusion, Leonard Rainey of Louisiana struggled over which presidential candidate he’d support. In the past, the choice would have been simple. Rainey, 33, leans Republican. He voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. But like others this cycle, he found the idea of backing GOP nominee Donald Trump repugnant, matched only by the nausea that accompanied the thought of pulling the lever for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He entertained sitting out the election. But, as he said, “you don’t have a right to bitch if you don’t vote.” So he pored over the news in search of guidance. It became overwhelming. Each WikiLeaks revelation was a new micro-drama; every Trump debate performance an eye-opener.“His mouth doesn’t fucking stop,” he said after the second one. By the final week, the continuous revelations and conspiracy theories surrounding Clinton were taking a toll. Rainey had heard something about Clinton’s ties to a pedophilia ring ― a hoax that led an armed man to fire shots in a D.C.-based pizzeria. He found Clinton Foundation ties to the Saudis and Qatari government disturbing.The night before Election Day, Rainey kept worrying about how a President Trump might navigate a complex international standoff. He woke up wondering if Clinton was the right choice. But in the end, he voted for Trump anyway ― an uninspired, rote contribution to American democracy. “You could have put up anybody else against him,” Rainey said. “But they just picked a bad candidate.” There is little disagreement that voters like Rainey ― the “late deciders” ― were ultimately responsible for Trump’s election. But a month and a half after his victory, an argument persists over why they voted the way they did. Clinton’s defenders blame FBI Director James Comey, who opened up a new investigation into Clinton-related emails 10 days before the election, only to close it a week later. Clinton’s critics say a campaign that was outworked and outsmarted in the Rust Belt states is merely in denial.In interviews with a number of late deciding voters ― found through various social media networks ― a less elegant explanation emerges. Comey was a factor for some but not others, and even then, it’s not clear how decisive his letters were. For many voters, random, often arbitrary moments from the campaign proved motivating in often unexpected ways. That Clinton left herself vulnerable to their whims is the story of the election as much as the eleventh-hour pronouncement from the FBI director.“That was not the nail in the coffin,” Rainey said of Comey. “It was the throwing of gas on a fire. ... Ultimately, there was too much baggage with her.” The Clinton campaign’s argument that Comey decided the election is based on simple math. Data shows that the majority of voters who made up their minds during the last week of the election broke for Trump ― and in significant numbers. Comey’s dual announcements were the major revelation of the week; ergo, he must have changed the course of the election. This isn’t just a public posture, either. In a private conference call two days after the vote, Clinton’s campaign staff told surrogates that internal data showed voters unfavorable to either candidate broke heavily towards Trump “by a 20 to 30 percent margin.”  One of those voters was Steven Hernandez. A teacher in Pennsylvania, Hernandez described himself as a libertarian-leaning Republican who “despised Trump for most of my life.” During the GOP primaries, he supported Carly Fiorina and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). And when those two dropped out, he joined the ranks of #NeverTrump Republicans.And yet, on Nov. 8, he went with Trump ― the final act of months of political self-reflection.Initially, Hernandez saw Clinton as a pragmatist. He wasn’t particularly disturbed by the emails, hacked and publicized on WikiLeaks, from her campaign chief John Podesta. Even Clinton’s use of a private email account didn’t bother him much. What turned him, gradually, was the relentless criticism of Trump. Hernandez felt sympathy for the man as Clinton and the media aggressively harped on allegations of sexual assault, including ones Hernandez viewed as unfounded. The agitation he initially experienced when Trump casually skated through controversies turned into begrudging respect for his perseverance. By the time Comey’s letter announcing a new investigation of Clinton came out, he was already leaning toward the GOP nominee. “The letter itself didn’t phase me or move me either way on Clinton. But her reaction to it kind of solidified it,” Hernandez said. “If I wanted to say when I knew for sure, it was when they started attacking Comey for doing his job in the weekend prior to the election.” Adam Shutt, a 35-year-old civil engineer from Muscatine, Iowa, was another Republican whose mind was unsettled through the campaign’s final week. But unlike Hernandez, Schutt flirted with supporting former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson (R) before ultimately backing Trump.  Trump had not been his first choice during the primary, he said, “or even my fifth.” And much of the general election confirmed his ambivalence. As late as his lunch break on Election Day, Schutt planned to vote for Johnson. Ultimately, however, he went with party allegiance. “I figured if I’m going to vote for a guy a little bit off the wall, I might as well vote Trump,” he explained.Comey’s letter, Shutt conceded, may have played a small, subliminal role in helping make up his mind; not because he was shocked by the content but because it motivated him toward a certain outcome. “Most of the undecideds I know weren’t deciding between Trump and Hillary. They were weighing the imperfection of the two versus the reality of dealing with the other in office,” Schutt said. “So, many of us ‘principled’ people decided to vote Trump just to stop Hillary.”The late-deciding voters breaking for Trump weren’t just Republicans. Andrew Bagley, 40, a diehard supporter of both President Barack Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he found Trump’s every utterance “abhorrent.” But he voted for him anyway, even as gay family members expressed fear to him that Trump would treat them “as second-class citizens.”  It wasn’t Comey’s letter that convinced him. It was foreign policy.“I think Trump is far less likely to get us involved in endless war in the Middle East,” Bagley, a native of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, said. “And the thing to me that is most important is not getting into unnecessary wars. Trump might be more likely to press the nuclear button than Hillary. But I put the chances of a nuclear war at 0.00001 percent. I put chances of a war in the Middle East with Hillary at nearly 100 percent.” Among the theories the Clinton campaign held during the election was that college-educated Republicans would be so repulsed by the prospect of a Trump presidency that many would cast a vote to prevent it from happening. Polling reinforced this idea. These were the voters most likely to swing from one candidate to another in response to a major controversy (the Billy Bush tapes, for example). Yet what caught the Clinton campaign off guard was both how many of these voters would ultimately hold their nose and vote for Trump anyway (compelled by Comey or not) and how many of them would drift away from Trump but not necessarily toward Clinton. Dustin Mooney, 27, of Orlando, Florida, fell into the latter category. He had voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and was prepared to cross the aisle to back Clinton four years later. He was bothered by her arrogance ― as if, he put it, “the American people were a speed bump to get to her ultimate objective.” But he liked her foreign policy views and pegged her as a moderate on domestic issues. Trump, meanwhile, was a non-starter. “I knew I wasn’t going to vote for him as soon as he won the nomination,” Mooney, an account manager, said. But as the election neared, the accumulation of negative Clinton stories became ineluctable. Comey’s letter was a part of it. But by that point, Mooney’s opinion of Clinton’s email use was firm. Anyone not of her stature, he’d concluded, would have been punished to some degree.On election day, Mooney was so torn about what to do that filled out his ballot backwards ― checking off the local races and saving the presidential contest for last. When it came time to cast that ballot, he wrote in Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan’s name. “Quite frankly, going into the election, I thought [Clinton] was going to win pretty handedly,” he explained. “My calculus would certainly have changed if I thought there was a bigger chance that Trump was going to win. But it was hard for me to wrap my head around that outcome based on the polling.” Michelle Hart, of Orange County, California, also had the resume of a fence-sitting Republican whom the Clinton campaign thought it could pry from Trump. Hart had worked in politics for years ― with California Republicans ranging from Gov. Pete Wilson to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ― and cast her first vote in 1992 for George H.W. Bush. But she exhibited political independence, too, backing California Democrat Dianne Feinstein for the Senate and supporting Obama’s 2008 campaign.More importantly, Hart didn’t want to vote for Trump. She was shocked he had even decided to run. But she couldn’t bring herself to back Clinton, either. The allure of seeing a woman president was outweighed by her philosophical disagreements with Clinton. At weekly “girl dinners,” she said she’d find herself trying to rationalize voting in discomforting ways.“I thought, ‘Do I dance with the devil I know or don’t?’” Hart recalled. “And I realized I’m calling them both ‘devil.’”The Comey letter didn’t bother Hart. And, indeed, the night before the election, she found herself considering a vote for Clinton after being inspired by first lady Michelle Obama’s introductory remarks at a rally in Philadelphia. But then Clinton came onstage and delivered a milquetoast speech that seemed, to Hart, to lack any passion. The next day, she wrote in Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) as her choice for president. “It was absolutely the toughest vote I had to cast,” she said. Hart says she has no regrets about her vote. And why should she? California went overwhelmingly to Clinton. One ballot for Kasich there did not make a difference. But for some of the other late deciders who went to Trump or avoided Clinton, there seems to be a creeping sense of guilt. Shutt, of Iowa, said he wished Trump would abandon the campaign-like rhetoric he’s carried over to the transition. “He hasn’t blown anything up yet,” he said of the president-elect. “But that’s a pretty low bar, I know.”Mooney, of Florida, said that if he had his vote back now, he’d probably support Clinton rather than Ryan. He didn’t expect Trump to win when he wrote the speaker’s name on his ballot. “In my eyes, he had to pull a royal straight flush to win,” he said. “And he did! He drew the river card.”And while Bagley said he didn’t want his vote back ― at least not yet ― he was open to the possibility that Trump’s presidency would prove damaging in ways similar to, if not greater than, what he worried about with Clinton. “Do I regret that he won? At the moment, no,” he said. “He hasn’t taken office yet. But in a year or two, I might. It’s kind of like Brexit. No one is going to know if it is the right choice or not till five years down the road.”Want more updates from Sam Stein? Sign up for his newsletter, Spam Stein, here."

41,QUEER VOICES,Trying To Keep The Faith: Why Losing George Michael Hurts Especially Badly In 2016,"Michael Darer, ContributorStudent, Wesleyan University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trying-to-keep-the-faith-why-losing-george-michael_us_5861c605e4b04d7df167d11d,He laid the groundwork for a number of queer cultural figures.,2016-12-27,The passing of George Michael marks yet another death of a musician whose cultural persona spat in the face of the toxic masculinity that has defined 2016.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5861c6b61500001300915f7b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"2016 was a banner year for toxic masculinity ― a victory lap for an ugly social devil who has already spent centuries perched atop the medalists’ podium. In 2016, millions of American voters ― both men and women ― were willing to accept that bragging about sexual assault was simply boorish “locker room talk” or at least stomach the rationale long enough to cast a ballot for an accused rapist.In 2016, political and social discourse was dominated by a legion of bitter and insecure men, hiding behind computer screens, looking to punish women for their failure to live up to the poisonous and archaic standards they set for themselves.In 2016, politicians dragged gender-nonconforming Americans through the mud to fight over whether they could feel safe using public restrooms, only to abandon ship on their promise to undo the legislative hate crime of HB2 at the 11th hour, stymied by their own undemocratic attempts to consolidate power in North Carolina voting districts.Perhaps this is why it hurt so much to hear on Christmas Day that pop icon George Michael had passed away. Perhaps this is why, in retrospect, the loss of Prince and David Bowie from earlier this year now seem to carry a special sting.In many ways, angst over this past year have been divided into two separate categories, the two major taxonomies of “fuck 2016”: the social and political strife that have dominated nearly every aspect of life in America and abroad, and the seemingly unending string of celebrity deaths, which have come on ― what appears to be ― a monthly rate.At first glance, these two things might seem largely unrelated, one certainly more severe than the other. It’s easy to (in the hectic sphere of social media wherein everyone seems convinced that only one topic can exist at any given time) say that, while the loss of a living legend like Leonard Cohen or Alan Rickman or Zsa Zsa Gabor sucks, there are bigger fish to fry, that the living have a couple more courses of tragedy yet to be served.Still, acting as though the “lowbrow” world of popular culture and the “highbrow” firmament of political state building are somehow separate spheres ― that they have ever been ― is fundamentally foolish, if not totally dishonest. Perhaps nothing demonstrates this more clearly than the first strains of the misogynist white nationalist collective that now calls itself the “alt-right” manifesting in the 2014 (and ongoing) debacle that was GamerGate; or the violent backlash against Paul Feig’s gender-swapped Ghostbusters remake, the ugliest episode of which involved the harassment of the actress and comedienne Leslie Jones by Twitter trolls incited by “alt-right” mainstay Milo Yiannopoulos.As such, viewing the more dismal moments in pop culture this past year through the lens of the political shitstorm that has served as their perpetual soundtrack (the Chainsmokers will have to settle for not being the most frequently broadcast example of white man bullshit in 2016 ― sorry, guys) is wholly natural, and the two often inform one another. They empower and deepen each other, and they give us a fuller view of where we stand.If it was so hard to watch toxic masculinity reaffirm its position at the head of the table in American politics and culture, it was even harder because ― in losing artists like Bowie and Prince and George Michael ― we lost three major voices who, for the 40-plus years, opposed these values, spat in the face of the idea that there were certain ways to be a man that were correct and acceptable, flaunted identities that contradicted traditional manhood and male sexuality unrepentantly.This is not to say that these three musicians are to be seen as flawless crusaders against the toxic ideas we are currently staring down, or to be lionized without question about their personal behavior. It is only to say that ― for someone like myself ― knowing that a singer like David Bowie, with his extraterrestrial androgyny, or a superstar like Prince, with his overt gender-creative expressions of passion, or an icon like George Michael, with his unabashed engagement with queerness, could command such confidence and power was deeply moving. It affirmed in a culture that was all but programmed to dismiss ideas and identities that failed to conform. There was a gleeful, luxuriant, and enlightening punkness to it.For some, it might have been one of these artists who helped them realize that there were ways to exist beyond the options laid out by society in the morning. For others it was all three. Either way, I know that I am not alone in feeling that somehow there was absolutely something transcendent, ecstatic, and almost gospel to a denim-and-leather-clad George Michael shaking his ass in the wake of the church organs that open his perfect “Faith.” Watching Michael’s video for that 1987 single, it’s easy to miss how subversive the pop star is being.Though he was not outed until 1998, the singer often played with the trappings of traditional heterosexuality. In the “Faith” video, over a rockabilly guitar line, Michael struts across the frame, dressed as one might expect an early ‘80s Springsteen. The whole production is an exercise in queering everything in frame: from jacket to sunglasses to jukebox. Over the course of nearly four minutes, as the video vacillates between black and white and color, George Michael leads an unwitting viewer into a sort of Oz, where markers of gender and sexuality become skewed until they’re all but meaningless.Michael’s twisting of the fashion symbols of manliness are as much an affront to toxic masculinity among gay men as among straight men, who are often wrongly deemed the only perpetrators of these dangerous ideas. In the wake of the Orlando Pulse Shooting, gay men across America flooded social media with promises that they were equally equipped to be violent (all in the name of rational self-defense, of course; proportional force, thy name is AR-15). Yiannopoulos—who (while dressed like a white eighth grader just recently in possession of his first Eminem record) went out of his way to present pictures of a trans student during a speaking tour, and crow to his audience at UW Milwaukee “the way that you know he’s failing [at passing] is I’d almost still bang him [is there a ‘sic’ equivalent for when someone is both linguistically incorrect and a irredeemable piece of shit?]”—identifies as gay. In November of 2015, he published a piece on Breitbart—which I will not link and discourage you from seeking out ― calling for the “T” to be removed from “LGBT.”George Michael was, for me, the most captivating of these three artists because of the way he managed to incorporate the ideas of manhood that many young gay men are told to aspire to into his persona, but then subvert them so that they served his queerness, rather than acted as an exception or an allowance to heteronormativity. While it’s easy to consider his engagement and meddling with masculinity and its meanings unremarkable by today’s standards, he laid the groundwork for a number of queer cultural figures, and the ways in which his “passing” was never more than a wink away from outright rejection of all heterosexual masculinity altogether makes all of his work sparkle with a sort of mockery of the people who just needed a slight change in the singer’s wardrobe to convince themselves that he wasn’t what the rumor mill was trying to say he was.Looking back on the last 12 months, it’s frustrating and agonizing (though not surprising) to see how the fragile and insecure vestiges of traditional manhood have redressed themselves, and embarked upon a campaign of what is nothing if not social and political terrorism as a way to try to regain their long undeserved cultural footing. Equally disheartening is to look back and to see the multitudes of ways by which that culture has enabled and endorsed them, carving new avenues and highways, creating new footing and ledges. As with any evil, 2016 is the sum of the perpetrators and those who have found reason to excuse them. At this point, their difference in sin is only a matter of degrees. As such, mourning the loss of a figure like George Michael, or of Prince, or of David Bowie, also feels like a mourning of the place to which we have allowed ourselves to regress, the ever-present demons we have committed ourselves to providing room and board.I was comforted to hear that George Michael died peacefully. I hope he rests that way as well.I am not at a place where I can say America or many of her people will be given that same grace."

Now, the president makes decisions that effect the lives of millions, and intelligence briefings are crucial for staying up-to-date with the ever-changing world, to ensure the making of informed decisions. But Trump has decided he doesn’t need briefings because he’s “a smart person.”So I’ve been wondering. If the president-elect of the United States can skip his equivalent of school, why can’t I skip mine? I mean, I’d consider myself to be a pretty “smart person.” For example, unlike our president-elect, I know what a blind trust is, and that just because someone is black doesn’t mean they were born in Kenya.But most importantly, I’m not the one who is about to run the country. The United States isn’t depending on me to solve its problems or make major decisions. And yet, I’m put in big trouble and called a “delinquent” if I cut classes, while Trump can miss out on crucial information he needs to run the country and not pay any price for it.I’ll admit, being the goody two shoes and slight coward I am, I would never ditch or skip school (the only time in my entire life I’ve done that was for a student walkout protesting Trump).But that’s not the point. This is: Why is a 15-year-old being held to higher standards than the president-elect of the United States?And it’s not just the intelligence briefings. The entire campaign season, I’ve been noticing that I— a high school freshman— have been held to way higher standards than our president-elect. Take this, for example:If I wrote an essay compiled of nothing but actual things Trump has said (you know, real intelligent stuff like “I know words, I have the best words,” and “Grab ‘em by the pu**y”) and then turned it into a teacher at school, you’d better believe I’d get an F. I’d also probably be called to the principal’s office to discuss my alarming rhetoric and profanity.And if on top of that, I walked around school acting like Trump for even a single day— calling people rapists, fat pigs, dogs and slobs— forget it. I’d be expelled within a week.And yet that same stuff done by a presidential candidate for 18 months is not just okay, but wins the presidency of the United States of America!And that makes me wonder: If morals and rules don’t apply to the people running the country, then why are kids expected to follow them? Why should they apply to me? Why am I not aloud to call people names, cut classes, cheat people, and insult others — but the president-elect is?"

The city has seen more than 750 homicides this year and approximately five times as many shootings. “My dad founded the funeral home in 1933, and I’ve been at my father’s business since I was 12,” the 79-year-old president of Leak & Sons Funeral Home said Tuesday. “I’ve never seen violence like it is now. And I’ve seen a lot.” In January, Chicago’s homicide figures were already forecasting a violent year ahead. That has proved tragically accurate. Over the Christmas holiday weekend alone, at least 57 people were shot, a dozen of them fatally. “I looked at our city over the holiday, and how beautiful it was with people enjoying the season,” Leak said. “And blocks away, people were destroying each other. This can’t keep going on.” As crime dips to historic lows nationwide, Chicago has struggled with a homicide problem that now outpaces New York and Los Angeles combined. The year 2016 has been Chicago’s deadliest since 1997.And just as a few big cities like Chicago can skew the national average, only a handful of neighborhoods are responsible for Chicago’s rising numbers overall.Of Chicago’s 77 neighborhoods, eight have more than 90 homicides per 100,000 people, while at least 11 have less than one, according to data compiled by the Chicago Tribune and The Trace, a news nonprofit. (The official homicide figures from the Chicago Police Department tend to be somewhat lower than the numbers compiled by media organizations and the medical examiner’s office, because of the way the police department adjusts its crime stats as investigations progress.)City officials have categorized most of the shootings as gang-related, with criminals and bystanders alike among the dead.“What I’m seeing now is random violence as opposed to targeted violence,” Leak said. “I’m seeing situations where people do mass shootings. That’s something we did not see 20 to 30 years ago.” There’s little agreement as to what the biggest contributing factors are.Community members in the hardest-hit neighborhoods cite the lack of mental health care, economic investment or educational opportunities. The city’s mass shuttering of 50 public schools in 2012 largely affected low-income black and Latino communities. Politicians and police have their own list of grievances, including comparatively weak gun laws in the neighboring states of Indiana and Wisconsin that facilitate a flow of illegal guns into the city. They also blame thinning police ranks and relatively short local jail sentences for gun-related charges.Chicago’s homicide clearance rate ― the share of cases that get solved ― is about 30 percent. That’s less than half the national average, according to the FBI’s 2012 data.The city last grabbed headlines for its homicide total in 2012, when it passed the grim milestone of 500 for the year. That high-water mark prompted outrage from the community and promises of action from City Hall ― largely in the form of more police.In 2016, the outrage is familiar, as are the promises.A new wrinkle, though, involves the idea that anti-police sentiment linked to viral videos of officers killing black people ― the so-called “viral video effect” or “Ferguson effect” ― is somehow contributing to rising murder rates in Chicago and elsewhere.CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson has repeated this claim throughout the year, despite nationwide polling that suggests the public largely respects police, and despite criminal justice experts debunking the theory. “The anti-police rhetoric has emboldened and empowered these gang members to do what they do,” Johnson said at a press conference Monday. “You know when they feel [the] public will speak out for them, and not the police officers, that’s giving them the power to go out and do what they do.”Johnson, a CPD veteran, assumed the role as Chicago’s top cop earlier this year as the violence was surging. His predecessor, former Superintendent Garry McCarthy, was unceremoniously booted amid national outrage following the November 2015 release of a police dashcam video that showed a CPD officer fatally shooting Laquan McDonald 16 times as the teen walked away.Johnson was tasked with repairing the broken trust between the police and the communities they patrol. As Chicago heads into a new year with more questions than answers over how to stem the tide of shootings, Leak and his South Side funeral home expect to remain busy. Leak said he and his team start each day with a prayer, knowing that the hours ahead will likely involve an onslaught of ringing phones and heart-wrenching conversations with families of slain Chicagoans. Leak said he is praying for everyone in Chicago and hopes for bold moves in the new year to counter the city’s violence. “Let’s do something extraordinary,” he said. “We’ve got to match extraordinary for extraordinary.” Moments later, he apologized for having to cut the conversation short. “I’ve got to go,” Leak said, before hanging up the phone. “I have another family I need to attend to.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated that Chicago surpassed 500 murders in 2012 for the first time in nearly a decade. The city had more than 500 murders four years earlier, in 2008."
46,POLITICS,Dozens Of Cities And States Will Raise Their Minimum Wages For 2017,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cities-states-raise-minimum-wage_us_5859aff0e4b0de3a08f36246,The Fight for $15 campaign has led to pay hikes coast to coast.,2016-12-27,"Fight for $15, here leading a demonstration in San Diego on Nov. 29, has helped propel many of the minimum wage measures.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5859b07e1c000011070ecb8c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you’re a minimum wage worker, you might be getting a raise on New Year’s Day. As 2016 comes to a close, at least 40 cities and states around the country will be raising the local wage floor. The hikes come after dozens of bills and ballot measures were passed by voters and local lawmakers in recent years, moving local minimum wages well above the federal floor of $7.25 per hour.Among the 19 states, the biggest hike will happen in Arizona, where the minimum wage will jump from $8.05 to $10. Maine will move its minimum wage from $7.50 to $9, and Washington state will bump it from $9.47 to $11. On the city and county level, most of the raises will occur in California. San Mateo, Los Altos and Cupertino, which is home to Apple headquarters, will all raise their minimum wages from $10 to $12, a 20 percent increase. Mountain View (home of Google) and Sunnyvale (Yahoo’s base) will move theirs from $11 to $13. A chart from the National Employment Law Project breaks down the wage hikes.The federal minimum wage hasn’t budged since 2009 and prevails in any locality that doesn’t mandate a higher one. But even though Congress has left the federal rate untouched, low-wage workers and labor groups have succeeded in pushing up local rates from coast to coast, particularly through ballot referendums. These days, a majority of states have a higher minimum wage than the federal one.Americans tend to like the idea of raising the minimum wage, and even aggressive proposals typically poll very well among the general public. Although Democrats are most likely to support such measures, many independents and Republicans also vote in favor of a raise when it’s on the ballot. Even a handful of solidly red states have opted to raise their minimum wages.In many cases, the increases have been vast, thanks largely to Fight for $15, a labor-backed campaign aimed at boosting paychecks and winning union contracts for low-wage workers. The campaign, which is organized by the Service Employees International Union, started in the fast-food industry but has spread to home care, day care and airports, too. The movement’s stated goal is “$15 and a union” for all workers. The Seattle suburb of SeaTac, Washington, was the first city to approve a $15 minimum wage measure back in 2013. Other cities soon followed suit with their own $15 measures, including Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City. In most cases, the legislation was written so that hikes occur periodically, gradually raising the wage floor to $15 over the course of several years. On New Year’s Day, Seattle will be the first large city to hit $15, though that rate will apply only to large businesses (the mandated minimums in Seattle depend on the size of the employer and whether it offers benefits).According to advocacy groups for low-wage workers, in raising minimum wages, cities and states are taking the initiative that lawmakers on Capitol Hill have lacked. In a statement on the New Year’s raises, the National Employment Law Project estimated that 12 million workers will see their wages rise as a result of the hikes, most of them in California and New York. The group said 19 cities and states will raise their minimum wages later in 2017.The Employment Policies Institute, a nonprofit linked to the restaurant industry, advocates against minimum wage raises and calls the patchwork of different rates “mind-boggling.” Michael Saltsman, the group’s research director, said that “labor unions and their activist allies may be popping the champagne on New Year’s to celebrate minimum wage increases, but businesses and their employees are the ones that will feel the hangover effects.” "

The Madison Square Garden Company pushed back on that on Friday, announcing in a statement that every Rockette must “voluntarily sign up” for every event she performs in. But some Rockettes say they still fear for their jobs if they sit this performance out. Now one Rockette is publicly speaking out about the controversy.In an interview with Marie Claire published Tuesday, a Rockette ― using the pseudonym “Mary” to protect her identity ― discussed the turmoil going on behind the scenes in the wake of the famous dance troupe’s commitment to perform at Trump’s inauguration.“This is making our show, our job, our name, branded as right-wing. An extreme right-wing,” Mary told Marie Claire. “There’s a reason why everyone else is turning this down. Why are we not?”Mary told Marie Claire that many of the dancers first found out about the performance through text messages sent from friends. One dancer felt as though she was being “forced to perform for this monster,” Mary said, while another woman reportedly wrote in an email to the dancers: “I wouldn’t feel comfortable standing near a man like that in our costumes.” (The Rockettes often perform in revealing costumes, and Trump has both bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy” without their consent and been accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen women.) According to Mary, some of the dancers initially were obligated to perform at the inauguration. But after the backlash on social media from dancers and fans, the company quickly made participation optional. Unfortunately, many of the dancers are still afraid they’ll be penalized for not performing at inauguration. “It will be interesting to see who doesn’t get their job back,” Mary said. “If I had to lose my job over this, I would. It’s too important. And I think the rest of the performing arts community would happily stand behind me.” Mary admitted that the lack of women of color in the kick line is “embarrassing” already, adding that, “it’s almost worse to have 18 pretty white girls behind this man who supports so many hate groups.” The Rockette said that this performance is not about politics, it’s about human rights. “This is not a Republican or Democrat issue ― this is a women’s rights issue,” she said. “This is an issue of racism and sexism, something that’s much bigger than politics.”Head over to Marie Claire to read the full interview.

That's A Lie.,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-foundation-money-claims_us_58627534e4b0d9a59459096a,"Over $250,000 from The Donald J. Trump Foundation has reportedly been used to settle lawsuits.",2016-12-27,"President-elect Donald Trump and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi attend the Palm Beach Lincoln Day Dinner at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida on March 20, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5862b3141500002f00e9d3bf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President-elect Donald Trump made the dubious claim on Twitter late Monday night that his foundation pays zero expenses and donates all of its money to charity. However, a number of reports appear to prove otherwise.The Donald J. Trump Foundation, established in 1987, admitted to the Internal Revenue Service just last year that it engaged in “self-dealing,” a prohibited practice in which a nonprofit leader uses an organization’s money to benefit his or her own interests.According to a Washington Post report earlier this month, the foundation’s 2015 tax filings confirmed it had transferred income or assets to a “disqualified person” that year (in this case, a “disqualified person” could be Trump himself or a member of his family or business) and had engaged in similar practices in previous years.Trump also came under fire this year when The Associated Press reported his foundation had donated $25,000 to a political fundraising group associated with Florida’s Republican attorney general, Pam Bondi, in 2013.The contribution violated laws banning tax-exempt charitable institutions from making political contributions. What’s more, the payment came just days after Bondi announced her office was considering investigating Trump University. (The attorney general ended up abandoning the investigation.)A spokesman for Trump’s foundation said in a statement in June that the donation was “made in error.” Trump was fined $2,500 by the IRS and has since reimbursed the foundation.In 2014, Trump’s charity made its largest donation of the year to a foundation associated with Citizens United, the conservative group best known for its fight against campaign finance restrictions. Trump’s foundation handed over $100,000 to the foundation, which was pursuing legal action against New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ― a Democrat who also happened to be investigating Trump University at the time.Another Washington Post report from September found Trump used $258,000 from his foundation to settle lawsuits ranging from self-dealing fines to quarrels with the town of Palm Beach, Florida, over the height of a flagpole at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club.The Mar-a-Lago lawsuit was settled in 2007 after Trump agreed to donate $100,000 to the Fisher House Foundation, a charity for veterans. Instead of reaching into his personal piggybank, Trump settled the lawsuit using his foundation’s money. The Huffington Post reached out to several Republican members of Congress following rumors of self-dealing, but few seemed bothered by the illegal practice.“I don’t know. I don’t know the facts of it,” Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) told HuffPost in September. He said he supports Trump because “Trump is a wild card, and I’ll take a wild card over unworthy anytime.”On Monday, Trump also tweeted that he’d donated “millions of dollars to the DJT foundation” and complained that the media “won’t report” on it.Yes, Trump has donated roughly $2.7 million to his foundation, but according to the foundation’s 990 forms, he hasn’t made any further contributions since 2009.The president-elect announced this week his plans to close the foundation to avoid future conflicts of interest during his presidency. But Schneiderman’s ongoing investigation into the foundation’s practices legally bars Trump for proceeding with the closure. “The Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,” Amy Spitalnick, the press secretary for the New York attorney general’s office, said Monday in a statement to ABC News.Jason Miller, Trump’s former campaign spokesman, called the investigation “nothing more than another left-wing hit job” in a statement in September."

He was kind.” Fisher added, “It was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend.”Though some people didn’t understand why the actress would reveal the secret now, she reminded fans that she’d waited four decades to come clean. “I didn’t say anything to anybody for years but it’s not like anyone’s deeply affected by it anymore,” Fisher told People. “Harrison’s very private, but I think I waited an appropriate amount of time.

The campaign is no longer active.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5862d70f1500002f00e9d429.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The ex-husband of Anne-Christine Johnson, a Texas woman who has been missing for nearly three weeks, is now being eyed in her disappearance.The League City Police Department told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that 32-year-old Shaun Philip Hardy is a “person of interest” in the case.A person of interest isn’t an official suspect, and Hardy hasn’t been charged. But the couple had a “volatile” relationship, and he was the last person to see the 30-year-old cocktail waitress and mother of two, police said.“You have a contentious couple in a volatile relationship, sharing custody of a child, and he was the last person to report seeing her,” said League City Police Department spokesman Kelly Williamson. “The totality of those circumstances is what makes him a person of interest.”Johnson has been missing since Dec. 8, when she went to Hardy’s home in League City, Texas. Her father reported her missing when she failed to show up for work and family members were unable to locate her.Johnson’s mother, Stephanie Johnson, did not respond to a request for comment from HuffPost. In a recent interview with Houston’s KPRC 2 News, she said she’s “slowly dying inside.”“I’m crying and not sleeping or eating and I’m relying on the strength of friends to keep me going,” she said.Hardy reportedly told investigators he saw his ex-wife outside his home on the day of her disappearance and said she left in a white sedan driven by an unknown man.Authorities said Hardy is no longer speaking with them.“We interviewed him once by phone and once in person, but after that he employed an attorney,” Williamson told HuffPost. “We requested a second face-to-face meeting with him, which went through his attorney, but that was denied.”HuffPost was unable to reach Hardy or his legal representation.Johnson and Hardy have been divorced since April 2015. Johnson was ultimately awarded primary custody of their 5-year-old autistic son, and Hardy received limited visitation rights. Johnson also reportedly has an 8-year-old son from a different relationship who lives with his father.“She would never leave a 5-year-old autistic kid,” Johnson’s mother told KPRC 2 News. “All he wanted to do is be with his mommy.”The Houston Chronicle reports Johnson filed court documents in June 2015, seeking a protective order against her ex-husband.“Shaun Philip Hardy’s violent behavior against me has gotten so bad that he has assaulted me with a shotgun, threatened me with a knife, and choked me,” Johnson stated in the documents. “I am afraid that without this protective order, Shaun Philip Hardy will continue to hurt me or even kill me in the future.”Hardy reportedly filed for his own protective order the same month, claiming Johnson had “engaged in conduct that constitutes family violence” and was “reasonably likely to harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment, or embarrass” him.Both requests were granted, but they were canceled less than a month later. HuffPost was unable to confirm who had canceled them and why.Johnson’s mother later started a GoFundMe campaign to raise legal funds for her daughter after Johnson filed for the protective order last year. The campaign, which featured a photo of a battered Johnson, raised $790 before it ended.Investigators say they are concerned for Johnson’s safety.“Right now, there is no body, no bloody car and no weapon,” Williamson told HuffPost. “That could be nothing or it could be something, but it’s been almost three weeks, so that, in our opinion, is pointing toward foul play.”Williamson declined to say whether any search warrants have been issued in connection with the case.“I cannot release that information,” he said. The missing person search and recovery group Texas Equusearch has conducted multiple searches for Johnson. They focused on an area that lies within a 3-mile radius of where she was last seen, but found no sign of her. Those searches are now temporarily suspended.“I really don’t have a whole lot of hope,” Johnson’s mother told the San Antonio Express-News. “I just have small shreds of hope that I hang onto.”Anne-Christine Johnson is described as a white female, 5 feet 2 inches tall, 110 pounds, with brown hair and green eyes. Anyone with information about her whereabouts is asked to contact League City police at 281-332-2566.Need help? In the U.S., call 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) for the National Domestic Violence Hotline."

It also punctuated the joyful moments as well, like the birth of her daughter, Billie Lourd.When Billie was born in 1992, Fisher shared the news with a hilarious birth announcement, which she recalled in her first memoir, Wishful Drinking. The announcement was a short poem, which read:Someone summered in my stomach. The actress and writer also got real about her birth experience in Wishful Drinking, writing that her baby “was dragged from [her] body as though it was a burning building.”Fisher also wrote about her love for her daughter, referring to Billie as her “most extraordinary creation.” After the news of her death reached her former fiancé Dan Aykroyd, he tweeted about the irony of the timing, noting that Christmas was her “favorite thing, next to babies.”Rest in peace, Carrie Fisher, a goddess among women."

As rescue teams dashed to the scene, warplanes circled back for a “double tap,” pummeling the isolated hospital in northwestern Syria a second time, minutes later. And a third. And a fourth.Twenty-five people died, including nine health care workers and five children. Staff and volunteers who survived the onslaught at the Doctors Without Borders-supported facility rushed victims to the next closest emergency center in a nearby town. The bombs followed.It’s an utterly grim and tragic irony: Hospitals are now among the most dangerous places in Syria. There have been 252 attacks on Syrian health care centers in 2016 so far, according to the Syrian American Medical Society, a nonprofit organization. Countless men, women and children suffering from injury or illness in the war-torn country have endangered their lives simply by seeking treatment. Many of the brave doctors who voluntarily walk into hospitals to help those in need ― dismally aware of the grave personal risk ― never come back out.“Perhaps one of the defining facets of the conflict since its outset has been making attacks on medical care a part of the war strategy,” Jason Cone, executive director of Doctors Without Borders’ U.S. branch, told The WorldPost. “In this day and age, [going to a hospital in Syria] is a very risky endeavor,” Cone added. “Some of our colleagues in Syria have reported that people don’t want to stay in the hospital for any longer than they have to. Many seek to be discharged before their treatment is completed because they don’t feel safe in hospitals.”The rate of assaults doubled after Russia’s military intervention in the conflict in September 2015, the medical society’s figures show. And nearly 200 occurred after May 3, when the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution strongly condemning violence against those providing and receiving medical treatment in the country.In July alone, the U.N. recorded 44 attacks on Syrian hospitals ― a rate of one every 17 hours ― including 15 in eastern Aleppo. Not a single medical facility in the formerly besieged region of the city has gone unscathed.Two of Aleppo’s largest hospitals were bombed out of operation on the same day in September. When a reporter asked Syria’s ambassador to the U.N. Bashar Jaadari at a press event if his government had launched those deadly attacks, he simply laughed and walked away. In fact, Damascus and Moscow have repeatedly denied that hospitals are being targeted.That’s hard to believe.From the beginning of the conflict in March 2011 through July 2016, Physicians For Human Rights tracked 400 onslaughts against at least 269 separate medical centers in Syria, killing 768 health care workers. The humanitarian group acknowledges that its method of corroboration often leads to significant undercounting, requiring rigorous review of each reported incident and at least three independent sources to add an assault to its list.“There are far more attacks than we’re able to document,” PHR research coordinator Elise Baker told The WorldPost. Even so, more than 90 percent of the documented attacks and deaths came at the hands of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government and its allied forces ― including the two assaults that Jaadari scoffed at.The U.N. holds an even higher count. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon strongly denounced more than 600 “horrific attacks” on Syrian hospitals and clinics In 2014 and 2015 alone, resulting in 959 deaths and more than 1,500 injuries.Health care structures in Aleppo have fallen victim to a particularly devastating number of attacks. In October, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Stephen O’Brien called the city’s health care system “all but obliterated,” with medical facilities “being hit one by one.” By mid-November, there were no more functioning hospitals left to demolish there. Days of intense airstrikes forced every last one out of service, leaving some 275,000 people without access to health care.“When you have that population also subject to hundreds of airstrikes, that leads to a rate of death we can’t even begin to imagine,” Baker said.One of Aleppo’s main trauma centers was completely destroyed after it was hit four times in less than three weeks earlier this year. The SAMS-supported hospital had already endured at least seven earlier attacks between 2014 and 2015, according to PHR. Syrian and Russian warplanes were responsible for all of them.“We’ve noticed a pattern of attacks targeting the same hospital multiple times,” Dr. Ahmad Tarakji, president of SAMS, told The WorldPost. “We’ve also noticed that attacks on facilities are not just individual attacks ― airstrikes will hit many facilities at the same time in the same region to paralyze the medical response in that area, which will increase the casualties and death because of inability to treat even mid-level injuries.”SAMS operates more than 100 medical centers offering specialized and general health care treatment in Syria. In early December, the organization announced its staff had been driven out of Aleppo after all its facilities in the city were seized by the Syrian government.“With the targeting and destruction of ambulances, it’s made it incredibly difficult for first responders to even get to people and bring them to medical facilities,” Cone said. Some Syrian hospitals, he said, are operating underground and in caves as a means of shelter and protection from aerial bombardment. “There’s really no line that hasn’t been crossed in this war.”Experts anticipate health care problems resulting from the war will far outlast the conflict itself. “There are growing longterm issues that we will see for decades to come,” said Baker, who stressed the urgency of civilians’ various medical needs that have long been neglected. “Kids aren’t getting vaccinations, people have gotten amputations without appropriate rehabilitative care ... Syria’s entire health care system will need to be rebuilt.”Children growing up in a war zone are also at a greater risk of developing psychological disorders, added Tarakji. “In besieged areas of Syria in particular, we have seen increased incidences of violence and depression ― signs of illnesses that won’t be easily treated, and will last for many generations to come,” he said. “Some of these children witnessed their parents and siblings dying, being raped or burned right in front of them.”Some of the hospitals that have been damaged by regime airstrikes are government-operated facilities, Baker points out. “Of course the government knows where they are, because it established them,” she said. The activist asserts many attacks on hospitals have “absolutely” been deliberate, initially as a means to “demoralize members of the opposition” and “bomb them into submission.”But Assad continues to deny Syrian and Russian accountability. After the U.S. government accused the regimes of deadly airstrikes against a Red Crescent aid convoy delivering medical assistance in rural Aleppo, Assad called the White House’s claims “just lies.”“I would say whatever the American officials said about the conflicts in Syria in general has no credibility,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press days after the assault, calling it a ground attack by rebels.Eyewitnesses, including relatives, described helicopters, barrel bombs and at least 20 missiles, AP’s Ian Phillips pushed back, noting only the Syrians and the Russians have helicopters.“You cannot talk about eyewitnesses for such judgment or accusation. What are the credibility of those eyewitnesses, who are they? We don’t know,” Assad responded.“In Syria, the government and its allies relentlessly — deliberately — attack hospitals, doctors, first responders and patients,” said MSF president Dr. Joanne Liu during an impassioned speech before the U.N. Security Council in September. “People are being taken off life support so that the multitude of wounded can be treated. With the bombs continuing to fall, the doctors tell us they await their own deaths.”Beyond the constant exposure to death, pain and relentless misery, doctors in Syria face yet another unimaginably excruciating hardship. With extremely limited resources available, they often have to make the heart-wrenching decision to only treat patients with the best chances of survival, while the others are left to die, explained Tarakji.“People think this is a political war, and that’s it. But this isn’t true,” he said. “What’s going on inside Syria is a constant violation of humanity.”To support crisis-afflicted Syrians, see The WorldPost’s list of ways you can help.

55,THE WORLDPOST,Refugees Take Us Inside Their Fight For Survival In This Harrowing Film,Willa Frej,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/watch-refugee-become-own-storytellers_us_585c0578e4b0de3a08f461bb,"Displaced people use  camera phone footage to highlight life on the run in ""Exodus.""",2016-12-27,Young migrants and refugees walk along train tracks between Serbia and Hungary.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586002d21d00002d001983ef.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One summer morning, yet another flimsy boat overflowing with people glides precariously across the Aegean Sea between Greece and Turkey. Men, women and children are clinging to one another when water suddenly seeps into the raft. People sitting on the edges tumble into the sea, while those still in the dinghy use water bottles to try and pour out the seawater. A man named Hassan Akkad, once an English teacher from the Syrian capital Damascus, filmed the entire event.It’s one of many harrowing scenes that refugees and migrants themselves have filmed and it features in “Exodus,” a two-hour documentary film produced by Keo Films that airs on PBS’ “Frontline” Tuesday.“Anyone can be a refugee,” said Akkad in the film. “It’s not something which you choose, it’s something that happens to you.”Akkad’s ordeal was far from over once he finally reached the shoreline. He told The WorldPost after arriving on the Greek island of Lesbos from Turkey on July 12, 2015, how masked men aggressively tried to push the refugees back to Turkish waters. He survived the terrifying event, and after many months of traipsing across Europe made it safely to the United Kingdom. Many others have not survived the oddessy across hundreds of miles of land and sea, a voyage that hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants have attempted in the past few years.It’s become the largest mass displacement catastrophe since World War Two ― 65 million people around the world have been forced to flee from their homes. About 21 million of them are refugees, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency. The horrific scenes in “Exodus” may have been shot in 2015, but the crisis has showed no signs of abating.Some of the routes we see in the film have become mass graveyards in 2016, in particular the area between Libya and Italy. More migrants and refugees died this year in transit than ever before, particularly in the central Mediterranean, even though the total number of people making crossings decreased compared to 2015.And while people once could travel relatively freely across the Europe Union’s open-border territory, known as the Schengen Area, several countries took extreme measures to build border walls this year. This has made it nearly impossible for migrants and refugees to travel further west toward their end intended destination.“Exodus” director James Bluemel and his team visited refugee and migrant “hotspots” in 26 countries around the world. They needed to find people who were not only willing to open themselves up to a camera crew but also agree to shoot their own footage on a camera or smartphone “when our presence would impede this footage,” Bluemel told The WorldPost.The show focuses on five main characters, including Akkad, as it launches into the stories at various points along the journey. The others are Syrians Isra’a and Ahmad, Alaigie from Gambia and Sadiq from Afghanistan. (PBS did not disclose their surnames.)The viewer meets Isra’a while she’s selling cigarettes on the street with her father, Tarek, in the Turkish coastal city of Izmir, which has a high concentration of smuggling activity. She and her family spent four months there before they earned enough money to pay smugglers for spots on a rubber dinghy that would take them to Greece.Alaigie’s story begins in his home country of Gambia, as he prepares to leave for Italy. It’s an eight-month trip that will take him through several Sub-Saharan African countries before he’s imprisoned in Tripoli, Libya.“The idea came from seeing images in the news daily of mainly Africans dying in huge numbers in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Libya,” Bluemel said.He chose to anchor the film around footage coming from the people actually making the trip. It’s “incredible, unique access that was shot only if you’re a migrant shooting that thing yourself,” the filmmaker said.Bluemel conducted a “sort of casting process” to find subjects who would work best with an audience and accept that what is being asked of them is potentially dangerous, he said. Each one took a different approach to filming.Akkad, for example, “found filming incredibly useful, almost like a crutch or a way to distance himself from reality,” Bluemel said. “He filmed absolutely everything and still carries on filming, he found it very useful.”The film ends at the beginning of a new journey for all of the characters ― we don’t learn what happens to them once they’ve reached their final destination.So the BBC commissioned another three-hour update to “Exodus” because “the situation in Europe is radically different now than when we made that film,” Bluemel said.Greece, for example, became a holding pen for around 50,000 refugees and migrants this year after neighboring countries like Macedonia closed off their borders.Many have become disenchanted by their lives in their European destination of choice, either because of rising anti-immigrant sentiment or difficult asylum processes. Sadiq, for example, gets his asylum application rejected in Finland as the film ends.“The sympathy we’ve had for refugees is quickly disappearing,” Bluemel said.The next episode is more focused on the various places ― like the French border town of Calais or the shores of Libya ― that have been completely transformed as a result of this crisis, one of the film’s producers Daisy Squires said. “It’s really more about places and characters within a place,” she said.Going into 2017, the causes that compel people to flee continue to worsen in many countries like Syria or Yemen, making the work of informing and raising awareness all the more important, she added."

I said HELL YESSSS!!” Apparently, Kelly proposed in Musgraves’ childhood home in Texas the night before.The 28-year-old singer shared a video explaining how it all went down. “We had just been at my parent’s house randomly having a night of watching bittersweet old home tapes of all these beautiful family memories that were made in this little, old country house I grew up in that I now have,” she wrote in the caption. Then, Musgraves wrote, Kelly had Musgraves’ sister and brother-in-law sneak off to decorate her childhood bedroom “in the most nostalgic and perfect Christmas decorations.” Henry Mancini’s “Two for the Road” was playing in the background, she explained, making it the perfect time for Kelly to get down on one knee.In her original post, Musgraves called Kelly “the best man I’ve ever met.” The songstress was previously linked to her guitarist Misa Arriaga, but it seems things heated up between Kelly and Musgraves this fall. She shared a photo of herself with the Nashville-based artist several months ago, and the two walked the red carpet at the CMA Awards this November.For his part, Kelly also seems pretty psyched.Check out more photos of Musgraves’ very special Christmas below."

Spotify told TMZ and Billboard that plays of Michael’s solo music jumped 3,158 percent between Sunday and Monday. The song “Last Christmas,” which Michael wrote when he was in the duo Wham!, also registered as the No. 3 song on the digital music service’s Global Top 50, which tracks the most-played songs on Spotify at any given moment. On Sunday, police were called to Michael’s house in Goring in Oxfordshire, England, where they pronounced Michael dead. Authorities have not announced the official cause of death, but the singer’s manager, Michael Lippman, said he died of heart failure.

Are you insane?” “Dear RNC,” wrote an aide to Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R): “We don’t have a king. What the hell is wrong with you people?” RNC spokesman and incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the statement had nothing to do with Trump and criticized the “politicizing” of Christmas. “Christ is the King in the Christian faith,” he said on CNN.Christ “was born today so we could be saved,” he wrote later on Twitter, calling the uproar “sad & disappointing.”One Twitter user quipped in response that Jesus was an “illegal immigrant, born out of wedlock, no less” so the “GOP wouldn’t know his face.”Another joked that the statement was about Russian President Vladimir Putin, not Trump.Last year’s message from Priebus didn’t mention a king. This year’s message urged Americans to remember the less fortunate and to support U.S. troops abroad.Trump tweeted two Merry Christmas greetings — one featuring a photo of him with a raised fist, apparently at a past rally — and a Happy Hanukkah greeting with a picture of a menorah.

While other respondents gave innocuous answers, Paladino used the opportunity to call the first lady a man who should live with gorillas and said he hopes the president dies from mad cow disease and that Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett is decapitated.Here are Paladino’s answers, with the original misspellings: 1. What would you most like to happen in 2017? Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford. He dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to Valerie Jarret, who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a Jihady cell mate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her.Paladino received swift criticism for his answers. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) called the comments “racist, ugly and reprehensible.”On Saturday, Paladino’s son William also weighed in. He wrote on Facebook that he wanted nothing to do with the remarks and tried to distance his father from the family real estate business. The Buffalo News reported that many locals were skeptical of the statement that Paladino’s son is the driving force behind the company.“Carl Paladino was the company’s founder and led the 43-year-old development firm as CEO for decades, until his son took over a few years ago as the father became more active politically, first with the Buffalo Public Schools and then in statewide Republican circles,” the paper wrote. “Carl Paladino remains chairman of the company, which he started in 1973, and is still considered by many to be influential in the firm’s overall direction.”Nevertheless, the statement represented a strong condemnation of Paladino’s remarks from his own son. Paladino responded to the national criticism Friday in a statement, saying his comments had “nothing to do with race” and criticizing America for not getting his “deprecating humor.”“It’s about two progressive elitist ingrates who have hated their country so badly and destroyed its fabric in so many respects in 8 years,” the statement read, referring to the Obamas. Paladino added that he thought the president was a “yellow-bellied coward who left thousands to die in Syria and especially Aleppo.”When Paladino ran for New York governor in 2010, he came under fire for sending emails to associates that included references to bestiality and offensive characterizations of Obama. In one email labeled “Obama Inauguration Rehearsal,” there was a video clip of African tribesmen dancing around.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

He also says he is innocent.Criminal charges have also been brought against LaMia co-owner Marco Antonio Rocha Benegas, whose whereabouts are unknown, and air traffic controller Celia Castedo, who fled Bolivia after the crash and is seeking asylum in Brazil.Bolivian authorities have said the crash was an isolated incident, but that the government will accelerate the process of implementing a new safety system.

67,POLITICS,Rex Tillerson Supposedly Shifted Exxon Mobil’s Climate Position. Except He Really Didn’t.,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rex-tillerson-exxon-mobil-climate_us_585d6ca1e4b0eb5864863a13,The oil giant's transformation on global warming was more rhetorical than anything else.,2016-12-26,Rex Tillerson became chief executive of Exxon Mobil in 2006. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585d6d381d00002d001981ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In December 2006, Exxon Mobil Corp. convened a two-day summit of environmental and ethics experts at a rural retreat near the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. It was nearly a year after Rex Tillerson took over as chief executive, and a month after Democrats had claimed a new majority in Congress. The world’s largest publicly traded oil company found itself in a bind.For decades, Exxon had funded far-right think tanks that seeded doubt over the scientific consensus on climate change. Under Tillerson’s predecessor, Lee Raymond, the company had aligned itself heavily with Republicans, funneling 95 percent of its political donations to the party from 2000 to 2004, according to Steve Coll’s 2012 book, Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power. Raymond took an aggressive stance against climate science: “It is highly unlikely that the temperature in the middle of the next century will be affected whether policies are enacted now or 20 years from now,” he said in a 1997 speech.Tillerson and Ken Cohen, Exxon’s PR chief and chair of its political action committee, wanted to broaden the company’s political reach. One step was changing their messaging about climate change, moving away from the denial the company had been attacked for supporting. The Blue Ridge retreat was part of that effort, and brought together more than a dozen guests, which according to Coll’s account, included “two senior energy-policy analysts from the Brookings Institution, a human rights activist at Freedom House, climate specialists, business ethics professors, socially responsible investors, and religious activists.” As Coll wrote, “Tillerson’s own views about climate science were not greatly different from Lee Raymond’s,” though Tillerson “did not claim or wish to project the same sort of independent scientific expertise that Raymond had offered about climate science.” But Tillerson did see that the company needed to reposition itself. “All they were saying they were going to do is simply acknowledge that it might exist, as opposed to saying it does not exist,” Jennifer Bremer, an economic development consultant who attended the meeting as a guest, told The Huffington Post. Bremer said Exxon executives had called the retreat so the attendees could give them some advice, not so they could dictate the company’s new policy. “You don’t just bring in a couple of hippies and start discussing internal deliberations,” Bremer added. “Not if you’re Exxon.”Not long after the summit, Exxon began to modify its public stance on climate change. Its 2007 Corporate Citizenship report announced that the company would “discontinue contributions to several public policy groups whose position on climate change could divert attention from the important discussion on how the world will secure energy required for economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner.”The company announced its first big investment in biofuels two years later, vowing to spend $600 million on research into algae-based transportation fuels. In 2015, the firm backed the historic climate agreement reached in Paris, a stance it reiterated four days before this year’s election. Tillerson, who President-elect Donald Trump has now nominated as his secretary of state, has gotten a lot of credit for Exxon’s shift away from climate denial. But even as Exxon learned to talk the talk, the $378 billion company has failed to walk the walk.Tillerson “brought a more clever approach, a more PR-savvy approach, to climate at Exxon, but the company really didn’t change its stripes much,” said Kert Davies, who leads the Climate Investigations Center and was the creator of ExxonSecrets, a Greenpeace program tracking the company’s climate denial. “They managed to drop this campaign of using surrogates, scale that back enough that it took the pressure off.”In June 2009, the House passed a bill to set up a cap-and-trade system limiting carbon emissions. But that legislation failed to gain traction in the Senate. Exxon undertook an aggressive lobbying campaign that year, spending $27.4 million ― more than the entire environmental lobby combined, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The American Petroleum Institute ― of which Exxon Mobil is a member ― launched its own PR campaign against the legislation. Meanwhile, Tillerson put Exxon’s new public positioning into action, making headlines when he said publicly he preferred a tax on carbon ― a policy that was not under debate in Congress at the time, but was also politically implausible at best, considering it was in the middle of the Great Recession. Some environmental leaders said the discussion about a carbon tax at that point was “ “a distraction” from the urgent need to put a cap on carbon emissions. “[W]e can’t wait for lawmakers, industry, and the American people to spend years hashing out the details of an entirely new system,” wrote Frances Beinecke, then-president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.Tillerson continued the company’s repositioning on the science as well, testifying before Congress in 2010 that “there is no question the climate is changing, that one of the contributors to climate change are greenhouse gases that are a result of industrial activities.” Six months after his testimony, the Senate climate bill died. Supporting a carbon tax wasn’t necessarily a cynical ploy to undermine the cap-and-trade bill; there are practical reasons a company like Exxon would support of a carbon tax. A handful of fossil-fuel companies already assign a price to carbon emissions for their internal accounting, including Exxon. As more countries take steps to cut carbon emissions as part of the Paris agreement, Exxon has said it prefers a predictable tax on carbon to a cap-and-trade system that is open to market fluctuations. But even as recently as last year, Exxon continued to fund organizations that deny or downplay climate science, and proposed solutions to global warming. In 2015, the company spent nearly $2 million on more than a dozen such think tanks and advocacy groups, according to data compiled by Greenpeace and vetted by the Union of Concerned Scientists. That list ranges from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest industry association, to more radical groups, such as The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, which has called global warming “nothing more than an educated guess,” and the Mountain States Legal Fund, which once described itself as the “litigation arm” of an “anti-environmental” movement. And unlike many of its industry rivals, Exxon has failed to invest seriously in renewable energy. The company ranked below all of its U.S. and European competitors on reducing emissions and issuing corporate guidance on the risk posed by climate change, according to a November report from the British shareholder advocacy group CDP. Tillerson has openly mocked the clean-energy industry for years, joking once that he wasn’t “really against renewables” because wind turbine operators bought Exxon’s oil as a lubricant. “The more windmills are built, the more oil we sell,” he said. At a May 2015 shareholders meeting, Tillerson said he hadn’t invested in renewables because “we choose not to lose money.” Even the company’s touted biofuel efforts have been slow to yield anything concrete. By 2013, Exxon tweaked its approach, refocusing its efforts to produce gasoline from genetically modified algae after spending one-sixth of the $600 million it had pledged to spend on biofuels. In September 2015, the firm kicked off a new partnership with Michigan State University to research algae-based fuels, but devoted just $1 million to the project. In January, Exxon signed a deal with a clean-energy developer to start researching new ways of distilling ethanol. Yet, even for a company whose yearly earnings were roughly halved to $16.2 billion last year by low oil prices, the investments seem like an afterthought.

68,POLITICS,Rex Tillerson Supposedly Shifted Exxon Mobil’s Climate Position. Except He Really Didn’t.,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rex-tillerson-exxon-mobil-climate_us_585d6ca1e4b0eb5864863a13,The oil giant's transformation on global warming was more rhetorical than anything else.,2016-12-26,President-elect Donald Trump nominated Rex Tillerson to serve as secretary of state. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585d6dd81c00000a070ed428.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In December 2006, Exxon Mobil Corp. convened a two-day summit of environmental and ethics experts at a rural retreat near the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. It was nearly a year after Rex Tillerson took over as chief executive, and a month after Democrats had claimed a new majority in Congress. The world’s largest publicly traded oil company found itself in a bind.For decades, Exxon had funded far-right think tanks that seeded doubt over the scientific consensus on climate change. Under Tillerson’s predecessor, Lee Raymond, the company had aligned itself heavily with Republicans, funneling 95 percent of its political donations to the party from 2000 to 2004, according to Steve Coll’s 2012 book, Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power. Raymond took an aggressive stance against climate science: “It is highly unlikely that the temperature in the middle of the next century will be affected whether policies are enacted now or 20 years from now,” he said in a 1997 speech.Tillerson and Ken Cohen, Exxon’s PR chief and chair of its political action committee, wanted to broaden the company’s political reach. One step was changing their messaging about climate change, moving away from the denial the company had been attacked for supporting. The Blue Ridge retreat was part of that effort, and brought together more than a dozen guests, which according to Coll’s account, included “two senior energy-policy analysts from the Brookings Institution, a human rights activist at Freedom House, climate specialists, business ethics professors, socially responsible investors, and religious activists.” As Coll wrote, “Tillerson’s own views about climate science were not greatly different from Lee Raymond’s,” though Tillerson “did not claim or wish to project the same sort of independent scientific expertise that Raymond had offered about climate science.” But Tillerson did see that the company needed to reposition itself. “All they were saying they were going to do is simply acknowledge that it might exist, as opposed to saying it does not exist,” Jennifer Bremer, an economic development consultant who attended the meeting as a guest, told The Huffington Post. Bremer said Exxon executives had called the retreat so the attendees could give them some advice, not so they could dictate the company’s new policy. “You don’t just bring in a couple of hippies and start discussing internal deliberations,” Bremer added. “Not if you’re Exxon.”Not long after the summit, Exxon began to modify its public stance on climate change. Its 2007 Corporate Citizenship report announced that the company would “discontinue contributions to several public policy groups whose position on climate change could divert attention from the important discussion on how the world will secure energy required for economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner.”The company announced its first big investment in biofuels two years later, vowing to spend $600 million on research into algae-based transportation fuels. In 2015, the firm backed the historic climate agreement reached in Paris, a stance it reiterated four days before this year’s election. Tillerson, who President-elect Donald Trump has now nominated as his secretary of state, has gotten a lot of credit for Exxon’s shift away from climate denial. But even as Exxon learned to talk the talk, the $378 billion company has failed to walk the walk.Tillerson “brought a more clever approach, a more PR-savvy approach, to climate at Exxon, but the company really didn’t change its stripes much,” said Kert Davies, who leads the Climate Investigations Center and was the creator of ExxonSecrets, a Greenpeace program tracking the company’s climate denial. “They managed to drop this campaign of using surrogates, scale that back enough that it took the pressure off.”In June 2009, the House passed a bill to set up a cap-and-trade system limiting carbon emissions. But that legislation failed to gain traction in the Senate. Exxon undertook an aggressive lobbying campaign that year, spending $27.4 million ― more than the entire environmental lobby combined, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The American Petroleum Institute ― of which Exxon Mobil is a member ― launched its own PR campaign against the legislation. Meanwhile, Tillerson put Exxon’s new public positioning into action, making headlines when he said publicly he preferred a tax on carbon ― a policy that was not under debate in Congress at the time, but was also politically implausible at best, considering it was in the middle of the Great Recession. Some environmental leaders said the discussion about a carbon tax at that point was “ “a distraction” from the urgent need to put a cap on carbon emissions. “[W]e can’t wait for lawmakers, industry, and the American people to spend years hashing out the details of an entirely new system,” wrote Frances Beinecke, then-president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.Tillerson continued the company’s repositioning on the science as well, testifying before Congress in 2010 that “there is no question the climate is changing, that one of the contributors to climate change are greenhouse gases that are a result of industrial activities.” Six months after his testimony, the Senate climate bill died. Supporting a carbon tax wasn’t necessarily a cynical ploy to undermine the cap-and-trade bill; there are practical reasons a company like Exxon would support of a carbon tax. A handful of fossil-fuel companies already assign a price to carbon emissions for their internal accounting, including Exxon. As more countries take steps to cut carbon emissions as part of the Paris agreement, Exxon has said it prefers a predictable tax on carbon to a cap-and-trade system that is open to market fluctuations. But even as recently as last year, Exxon continued to fund organizations that deny or downplay climate science, and proposed solutions to global warming. In 2015, the company spent nearly $2 million on more than a dozen such think tanks and advocacy groups, according to data compiled by Greenpeace and vetted by the Union of Concerned Scientists. That list ranges from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest industry association, to more radical groups, such as The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, which has called global warming “nothing more than an educated guess,” and the Mountain States Legal Fund, which once described itself as the “litigation arm” of an “anti-environmental” movement. And unlike many of its industry rivals, Exxon has failed to invest seriously in renewable energy. The company ranked below all of its U.S. and European competitors on reducing emissions and issuing corporate guidance on the risk posed by climate change, according to a November report from the British shareholder advocacy group CDP. Tillerson has openly mocked the clean-energy industry for years, joking once that he wasn’t “really against renewables” because wind turbine operators bought Exxon’s oil as a lubricant. “The more windmills are built, the more oil we sell,” he said. At a May 2015 shareholders meeting, Tillerson said he hadn’t invested in renewables because “we choose not to lose money.” Even the company’s touted biofuel efforts have been slow to yield anything concrete. By 2013, Exxon tweaked its approach, refocusing its efforts to produce gasoline from genetically modified algae after spending one-sixth of the $600 million it had pledged to spend on biofuels. In September 2015, the firm kicked off a new partnership with Michigan State University to research algae-based fuels, but devoted just $1 million to the project. In January, Exxon signed a deal with a clean-energy developer to start researching new ways of distilling ethanol. Yet, even for a company whose yearly earnings were roughly halved to $16.2 billion last year by low oil prices, the investments seem like an afterthought. Exxon spent $8.8 million on political lobbying this year.Nor has Exxon ever fully owned up to the years it spent undermining climate science. That came into full view in October, when InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times published reports revealing that the company understood global warming decades ago and covered it up anyway ― long before Tillerson’s supposed shift.

One bullet struck his the shoulder and another grazed his head, they said.The rapper, whose real name is Roland Collins, managed to drive for a few more blocks until he crashed his car and a passerby took him to the nearest hospital. He was listed in stable condition.Police had yet to arrest anyone over the shooting by early Monday.Collins wears an ankle bracelet and is out on $500,000 bail following a May shooting backstage at a T.I. concert that left his bodyguard, Ronald McPhatter, dead. He has been charged with second-degree attempted murder and an illegal weapons count.Surveillance footage at the concert shows Collins firing a gun, but he said he had wrestled the weapon away from the man who killed McPhatter and that he shot back in self-defense. Collins was shot in the leg during the altercation. “Tonight, Troy Ave was targeted again — at Christmas,” said his lawyer, Scott Leemon, in a statement to Billboard Sunday. “...Thankfully, he will survive the second attempt on his life. As we have said from the beginning, he is a victim.”The rapper escaped more serious injury because he spotted his attacker just in time, according to another attorney.Collins “looked to his left. He saw that the guy had a gun and was about to fire, and he started driving away,” John Stella, told the New York Daily News. “He’s in pain, but he’s grateful. He said to me that he feels blessed that this wasn’t fatal,” Stella added.Collins is due to appear in court again on the concert shooting charges on Jan. 26."

The soulful Wham singer hit the top of the charts in the mid-1980s by singing about the jitterbug and filming a video at the Great Wall of China. Yet, in the latter part of his career he became a nuanced and complex, if sometimes misunderstood, writer and interpreter of songs. “Wake Me Up Before You Go Go,” “Careless Whisper,” and “Last Christmas” gave way to the more direct “I Want Your Sex” and later “Jesus to a Child.” As he advanced to more mature subjects, so did his audience. George Michael dominated the pop charts when Baby Boomers controlled the record labels and the rest of us were coming of age. His “Freedom 90” video captured the zeitgeist of the supermodel phenomenon with the lyric, “sometimes the clothes do not make the man.” The line was tongue-in-cheek but also begged for us to take him seriously. What an incredible voice he possessed; his 2012 performance of Rufus Wainwright’s “Going to a Town” at the Palais Garnier Paris was one of the best (and simultaneously most bittersweet and sad) performances he ever gave. However, his 1985 Live Aid duet with Elton John on “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” will likely stand as his vocal pièce de résistance. Nearly 32 years later, I cannot hear it without crying.The songs we love when we’re teens stay with us forever. That’s why 2016 has been one of the toughest years ever for music fans. The past twelve months have claimed the lives of dozens of beloved musicians – including David Bowie, Prince, Maurice White, Leonard Cohen, Glen Frey, Phife Dawg, Merle Haggard, Sharon Jones and others. When they go, they take a part of us with them. Sadly, George Michael’s Christmas Day death in 2016 won’t be the end of this trend of musicians dying. In fact, it may be the beginning of a long stretch of time in which our favorite rockers disappear one by one, month after month. Why? Because many of the songwriters and performers who have brought hit songs to our car radios, living room stereos and bedroom record players over the past five decades are getting older. Our golden age of music is fading.The music of our youth never goes out of style in our minds. Even with the passing of so many great voices in 2016, the music of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s continued to be a relevant part of my daily life and helped me cope with personal loss and physical health challenges throughout 2016. When David Bowie died on January 10th, it felt a bit like the passing of a relative. I sat on my porch with headphones on and listened to “This is Not America” over and over for hours. A few days later, I walked in a Bowie tribute parade in Atlanta. When Prince played his final shows in Atlanta two days before his April death, I was recovering from a surgery. His solo piano set, including all the hits he’d written for other performers, was worth every ounce of energy it took to climb to the very top row of the Fox Theatre. That same week, my high school friends came from all over the country to join me at a Duran Duran show, where I experienced the joy of dancing for the first time in a long time. At the end of the month, my spirits were lifted even higher when Chic and Nile Rodgers honored Bono and Jimmy Carter at a NYC charity event. Who would’ve imagined that U2 songs could be performed so coolly in 2016 with Chic, the band whose sound I first fell in love with at the roller skating rink in 1978?Much of 2016 was filled with the throwback songs of our teens and twenties. Pretty in Pink and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off – and their fantastic soundtracks – played in revival screenings at movie theaters across the US; our 1990s heroes toured frequently (a friend FaceTimed me from a Ben Watt show 800 miles away); and singalongs became louder at concerts: This past spring and summer, Cyndi Lauper led a crowd through a weepy, yet majestic “Time After Time” in Atlanta Symphony Hall; Howard Jones got the entire crowd on its feet for “Things Can Only Get Better” at Verizon Amphitheater; and we all sang every word to “Don’t Look Back in Anger” with Noel Gallagher at the Tabernacle. For me, all of the above moments were therapeutic and cathartic after the recent death of a family member.Those 1980s lyrics still matter. At a performance by The Fixx, The Church and the Psychedelic Furs at the Orange County Fair (CA) in July, I was amazed at how well the words to the 1980s songs “Deeper and Deeper,” “Reptile,” and “President Gas” fit with today’s political landscape. At the Hollywood Bowl that same week, Sting and Peter Gabriel turned The Police’s 1981 hit “Invisible Sun” into a statement about the global refugee crisis. Ted Yoder got 85 million views for his dulcimer cover of the 1985 Tears for Fears song, “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” in August and Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder (with Coldplay’s Chris Martin) sang the 1986 Crowded House song, “Don’t Dream It’s Over” in front of a worldwide audience at the Global Citizen Festival in September. Crowded House’s own November concerts in front of the Sydney Opera House in Australia also evidenced the staying power of their music.Never underestimate the ability of a song from your youth to resurface in your life to lift and surprise you. Will future generations of music lovers rely on music as a source of comfort and strength, too? Or will music be replaced by a pastime which requires less emotional investment? Only time will tell.For now, we gotta have faith.R.I.P. George Michael."

Representatives for the Pentagon declined to comment.Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said the incoming team had no comment on China’s move. Trump takes office on Jan. 20 but has already drawn headlines over a series of statements on China and Taiwan.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said people should not read too much into what the carrier was up to, as its movements were within the law.“Our Liaoning should enjoy in accordance with the law freedom of navigation and overflight as set by international law, and we hope all sides can respect this right of China’s,” she told a daily news briefing.Influential state-run Chinese tabloid the Global Times said the exercise showed how the carrier was improving its combat capabilities and that it should now sail even further afield.“The Chinese fleet will cruise to the Eastern Pacific sooner or later. When China’s aircraft carrier fleet appears in offshore areas of the U.S. one day, it will trigger intense thinking about maritime rules,” the newspaper said in an editorial.China has been angered recently by U.S. naval patrols near islands that China claims in the South China Sea. This month, a Chinese navy ship seized a U.S. underwater drone in the South China Sea. China later returned it.Japan said late on Sunday it had spotted six Chinese naval vessels including the Liaoning traveling through the passage between Miyako and Okinawa and into the Pacific.Japan’s top government spokesman said on Monday the voyage showed China’s expanding military capability and Japan was closely monitoring it.China’s air force conducted long-range drills this month above the East and South China Seas that rattled Japan and Taiwan. China said those exercises were also routine.Last December, the defense ministry confirmed China was building a second aircraft carrier but its launch date is unclear. The aircraft carrier program is a state secret.Beijing could build multiple aircraft carriers over the next 15 years, the Pentagon said in a report last year.China claims most of the South China Sea through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims."

It promises to be a real treat for fans! To coincide with the film’s broadcast, George and Sony Music have decided to move the reissue of the ‘Listen Without Prejudice’ album to the same time.”“Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1” was the singer’s second studio album, which came out in 1990.According to an earlier website post, Michael was expected to narrate the film, which would feature appearances by Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Mark Ronson, Mary J. Blige, Tony Bennett, Liam Gallagher, James Corden, Ricky Gervais, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford and others.Nile Rodgers apparently had been working with Michael’s team on a project as well. The acclaimed producer tweeted Sunday that he had been at Michael’s home just two days before his death.  Michael died Sunday at his home in England after suffering from heart failure. He was 53. He left behind decades of music ― both as a solo artist and with the ‘80s group Wham! By the sound of it, we may see more where that came from. There’s no word yet on the status of the documentary, but here’s hoping Michael left fans at least one last musical parting gift. "

In fact, in 1986 ― after multiple No. 1 hits and 25 million records sold ― Michael called their decision “the most amicable split in pop history.”On his website, Michael referred to Ridgeley as his “best friend,” saying that at the end of their run together, their friendship was “as strong as it was in the beginning.”Ridgeley, who largely escaped from public view after Michael took his career solo in the mid-1980s, evidently shares that feeling. Upon hearing of Michael’s death, Ridgeley tweeted that he was “heartbroken” and that Michael had “left the best of himself,” a clear reference to his friend’s music. “[George Michael] had a voice that would transport u, he was the finest singer/songwriter of his generation & has left the best of himself 4 us,” Ridgeley wrote."

Summer, discovered in a second-floor bedroom, had also died by then. Autopsy results confirmed the baby had died of starvation and dehydration.“It was hard going in there and being the one to see them like that,” the friend, James Grant, told local station WAJC-TV. “They cared for their daughter. For two flawed people, they did their best to hold it together.”Chambers had overdosed before in November, but medical personnel revived him, according to Callihan. Authorities allowed the baby to stay in the home. A representative from Children and Youth Services met with the parents “with the child present at the residence,” said Callihan. “They checked out the house, and it was appropriate to a child living there. There was plenty of food and the child seemed well taken care of,” she added.Since both parents died at approximately the same time, no one was left to alert authorities or care for the baby, according to Johnstown Police Captain Chad Miller. “Being from out of town, not having anybody in town, it was too long for anybody to notice that they were missing,” he said. Callihan said the tragedy “illustrates the ongoing issues that we’re having with overdoses” in the area. “If you are addicted, if you’re using heroin and you have children, you’re endangering their lives,” Callihan said. “You need to get help for your children.”Heroin deaths in the U.S. are skyrocketing. Last year, for the first time in more than 15 years, heroin caused more deaths than gun homicides, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "
77,QUEER VOICES,George Michael Was A 'Filthy' Gay 'F***er' And We Should Honor Him For That,Noah Michelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-michael-cruising-gay-sex_us_586073afe4b0de3a08f5b7cd,We could all learn a lot from his unapologetic approach to his sexuality.,2016-12-26,"George Michael died on Dec. 25, 2016 at the age of 53.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58612fee1c00008c100ed6e7.jpeg?cache=OVQmZMcrfE&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last night, after word spread that pop star George Michael died at the age of 53, I sent out several tweets honoring the man who meant a lot to me as a queer young man who came out in the late ‘90s. My first tweet instructed those unfamiliar with Michael (and the brilliance of what he created) to seek out his music. This was my second tweet:I was referencing Michael’s well-publicized history with cruising for sex in public places (he was arrested by an undercover policeman in a Beverly Hills men’s room in 1998 and again 10 years later in London). While I was being cheeky in a way that I thought he would appreciate in the big Wembley Stadium in the sky, I also meant it. It was my way of paying tribute to how open, outspoken and unapologetic he was about who he was (once he came out in 1998), his sexuality and looking for gay sex in what could be referred to as non-traditional locales.But shit soon hit the fan. People who thought I was being “disrespectful” and “tacky” and “tasteless” flooded my Twitter mentions. A few people commented “too soon.” Others couldn’t believe that this was the only aspect of his life that I had chosen to concentrate on (which means they obviously didn’t read my aforementioned tweet). How dare I! One person called me “the 2016 of people” (which is actually kind of amazing) and another promised to “piss on my grave” when I died (I mean... don’t threaten my corpse with a good time, right?).I tried to explain that as a queer, sex-positive man, this part of Michael’s life ― these moments of queer sexuality and his sex life that were made very public ― helped to reorganize and shape how I saw and embraced my own sexuality, which was nothing short of a miracle considering the homophobic and sex-negative culture we live in.My tweet wasn’t a joke and it wasn’t rude or disrespectful. If you read it that way you’re implying that gay sex ― public or otherwise ― is shameful. I don’t and neither did Michael.In fact, after the pop star was caught in 1998, he turned the incident into a celebratory song (accompanied by a splendidly self-conscious video featuring a public restroom that turns into a disco and Michael dressed as a cop) about the joys of having sex outside:After his arrest in a public toilet on a drug-related charge in 2008, he opened up to The Guardian about his love of cruising saying, “the handful of times a year it’s bloody warm enough, I’ll do it.” He added, “It’s a much nicer place to get some quick and honest sex than standing in a bar, E’d off your tits shouting at somebody and hoping they want the same thing as you do in bed.”No shame. No embarrassment. No mincing of words. Just the truth about what he liked and how he liked it.In 2011, he playfully quoted his 1987 hit “I Want Your Sex” to tweet a similar message:So why all of the frantic pearl clutching? Why the attempts to bleach this part of his life from his legacy? Because we like our heroes wearing halos and because gay sex ― public or otherwise ― is still an absolutely terrifying concept for too many people (including some who may support queer rights). It’s seen as disgusting. It’s seen as unnatural. It’s seen as contributing to the downfall of modern civilization. In fact, William Pryor, a man that Donald Trump is considering as a nominee for the United States Supreme Court, believes that consensual gay sex should be illegal ― even in the privacy of one’s own home. But let’s not forget that the sex acts that gay men engage in aren’t secret satanic practices. It’s the exact same kind of sex that most non-queer people have, just with a different distribution of equipment (and if anyone wants to claim that non-queer people don’t also enjoy blow jobs or butt sex, I’m going to laugh you right off of this planet).Even scarier and sadder to me than the non-queer people who have a problem with gay sex are the queer people who are up in arms about my tweet. I’ve encountered folks like them before and in some ways, I understand their trepidation and their fear. The general idea is that if we don’t “behave” ourselves ― especially if people like Michael (who represent us in a world where queers are all too often invisible, ignored and/or vilified) don’t ― and quietly assimilate into mainstream society, we won’t be able to keep the rights that we have (and gain more). And so, instead of speaking frankly and honestly about sex ― that tireless boogeyman that has mesmerized and terrorized our society for centuries ― we should just shut up, get married, have kids and stop causing trouble.But we can’t do that. Our queer fore-parents worked too hard, and too many died, for us to walk away from the dream of sexual liberation for all of us. That means we must not buy into a broken system that is simultaneously obsessed with and panic-stricken by all things sex. It means we must not accept the sexual status quo that all-too-often results in fake piety in the streets and discreet sleaze in the sheets. It means we must not pretend that Michael never had or loved gay sex. Let’s not sanitize him just because it would make it easier for some of us to eulogize him or love him or play his music for our children or our grandparents.Michael himself wouldn’t want that. He’d hate it. Consider what he told The Guardian in 2005:“You only have to turn on the television to see the whole of British society being comforted by gay men who are so clearly gay and so obviously sexually unthreatening. Gay people in the media are doing what makes straight people comfortable, and automatically my response to that is to say I’m a dirty filthy fucker and if you can’t deal with it, you can’t deal with it.”And before anyone says that I’m claiming public restrooms should become bathhouses or that we should all be pumping our neighbors in the park, I’m not. While I constantly try to question, unpack and challenge why our society feels the way it does about sex and what it deems is OK and what isn’t, I understand that there are currently laws against these activities and I understand why they exist. I’m talking about pushing back against the shame and hysteria that accompanies any kind of discussion of a gay person’s sex life and striving to not view sex or sexuality ― queer or otherwise ― as bad things. I also want to briefly acknowledge Michael’s long struggle with substance abuse and how it may or may not have played into his sexual appetites and activities. Gay men, drugs and sex have an intimate and complicated history and I don’t want to ignore any of that. But I also refuse to write off his sex positivity or his candor about it as merely a result or symptom of his experiences with drugs.So, yes, George Michael was an incredible singer and a beautiful songwriter but he was also a gay man who wasn’t ashamed of his sexuality and who loved sex. I want to honor all parts of his life ― the musical and the sexual, the triumphs and the setbacks ― and I refuse to shy away from any of it out of a misguided and incomplete attempt to pay “respect” to his life or his death. Ultimately, the best way I know how to honor him is to talk about who he really was, what he really did and how it changed my life ― and that means all of it, including his hunting for dick in the men’s room.You’ll be sorely missed, George. Thanks for everything you did ― all of it ― and I hope the men in heaven are as hot as you were and that you’ve found yourself a nice fluffy cloud where you’re already getting into all of the best kinds of trouble.

The long anticipated film adaptation of Japanese author, Endō Shūsaku’s novel Silence by director, Martin Scorsese, has just been released in the U.S. on December 23. A work of fiction, Silence tells the true story of Christian persecution in 17th-century Japan under the iron rule of the Tokugawa shoguns. Scorsese calls it his “obsession” and has been working for nearly three decades to bring the film to the big screen.A True Story in the Japan of the ShogunsJesuits, the worldwide Catholic religious order of priests and brothers, figure prominently in the story. By the 1620s, the golden age of the Japanese missionary enterprise, founded by the Jesuit missionary St. Francis Xavier, had passed, and missionaries had been officially expelled from Japan. A number of priests, however, went underground to minister to the vibrant Christian community that was struggling to survive against all odds. Among them was Fr. Cristóvão Ferreira, the Portugese provincial superior of the Jesuit mission, who in 1633 renounced his faith while undergoing one of the most barbaric forms of torture ever devised—the torture “of the pit”. To atone for the sin of his public apostasy, the Jesuits sent several groups of missionaries to Japan to persuade Ferreira to reconcile with his own conscience and with the Church. These men knew that they would be apprehended, tortured, and killed. This is all part of the drama of Jesuit history. Endō’s Novel and Scorsese’s FilmIn the novel, the missionaries sent to Japan are given the fictional names, Rodrigues and Garrpe. After Rodrigues is arrested and brought before Ferreira, who now works for his captors, he is faced with an impossible choice: either trample on a sacred image (fumi-e) of Christ to signify his own apostasy or watch a group of Japanese Christians die a slow, hideous death in his stead.Wracked with doubt and anguish and faced with an impossible dilemma, while God remains mysteriously “silent”, Rodrigues finally succumbs to the inquisitor’s demand. He defaces an image of Christ by stepping on it to alleviate the terrible suffering of the Japanese Christians. Immediately thereafter he hears the cock crow—as Peter did after he had denied three times that he knew Jesus. But paradoxically, at the very moment when he falls into apostasy and loses his own dignity and self-respect, Rodrigues hears an echo of the merciful voice of God.At no point does Endō condone or equate apostasy with the “new normal”. Rather, he concentrates on an understanding of Christian faith marked by suffering and divine mercy. The novel reminds us of a Zen kōan, a short, pithy saying that presents the Buddhist novice in training with a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement, whose purpose is to free the mind from the illusion that rationality alone can penetrate the depths of truth. Not everything is black and white. Enlightenment lie elsewhere. A Drama for our own timeFour hundred years after the real events took place and fifty years after Silence was first published in 1966, Endō’s novel remains a most uncomfortable and disconcerting story of heroism and betrayal. As ethnic, racial, and religious intolerance and violence continue to mark our own time, Endō’s novel invites us to reflect on what exactly it means to have faith in a world full of anguish and suffering. In the year that saw “post-truth” enter the Oxford English Dictionary as a new word, how do we—both as individuals and as a commonwealth of societies and nations—find what is true and good? It is this stark and timeless drama of the human condition that served as the backdrop and inspiration for both Endō’s story and Scorsese’s cinematic re-telling of Silence for our own time. The questions are haunting.Having set off for Japan thirty-one years ago as a young and enthusiastic Jesuit missionary, I cannot help but be haunted by a simple yet painful question: Had I been born in 1564 rather than 1964 and found myself in Rodrigues’s shoes, What would I have done?"

If you want to see that truth in action, just Google ""characteristics of successful people."" Some of the results will undoubtedly point to the famous Marshmallow Study at Stanford, which demonstrated that the ability to delay gratification is a key component of success.But that's far from the only theory:-- According to Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, it all comes down to mindset. She conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated that, while the average person sees their abilities as fixed assets, successful people have, what she calls, a ""growth mindset."" In other words, successful people focus on self-improvement and overcoming challenges rather than seeing their mistakes as the products of insurmountable personal flaws.-- In another study conducted by Penn State and Duke, researchers assessed the social skills of 700 kindergartners. Twenty years later, they followed up and discovered a strong correlation between social skills and success. The children with the best social skills were more likely to have earned a college degree and to hold a full-time job, while the kids who struggled with social skills in kindergarten were more likely to get arrested, binge drink, and apply for public housing.And the list goes on and on. So what is happening here? Why are there so many different theories, complete with the science to back them up, about the traits that contribute to success? I think it's because most wildly successful people are complex -- so complex that many of their defining qualities are paradoxical.Rather than an ""either/or"" set of static characteristics, they're more likely to demonstrate both. This is a key to their success. Here are some examples of what I'm referring to.  1. They're polite, yet completely unafraid to rock the boat. Successful people are, what I like to call, ""graciously disruptive."" They're never satisfied with the status quo. They're the ones who constantly ask, ""What if?"" and ""Why not?"" They're not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom, yet they don't disrupt things for the sake of being disruptive; they do it to make things better. Still, they're polite and considerate, and they don't draw attention to other people's mistakes just to humiliate them. However, that doesn't mean they sit back and let people wander off in the wrong direction. They won't hesitate to speak up when it's time to change course.  2. They're deeply passionate, yet rational and objective about their work. Successful people are passionate about their work, but they don't let it skew their thinking. They have the ability to step back and look at their work with a critical eye and to accept their mistakes. If it's a disaster, they'll admit it, because they realize that it's better to try something different than to put out something subpar with their name on it. That sense of detachment also allows them to accept feedback from others without taking it personally. Successful people are passionate about their work, but they don't let it skew their thinking.  3. They're convergent and divergent thinkers. Convergent thinking is what's measured by IQ tests: rational thinking that typically results in a single right answer. Divergent thinking, on the other hand, is less precise. It's about generating ideas and asking questions that have no solid right or wrong answers. Both are important. No matter how high your IQ is, you're not going to be successful if you can't think outside of the proverbial box. On the other hand, you need rational thinking skills to correctly judge whether your ideas have merit. That's why this particular paradox is so important.  4. They're both energetic and calm. Successful people seem to have limitless energy when it comes to doing the things they're passionate about, but they aren't frantic. They can keep that energy under control. They work hard and focus on the task at hand with devoted concentration, but they're so smooth that they make it look both easy and fun. Some people are so energetic that they're hyperactive and unfocused and constantly bouncing from one thing to another. Successful people know how to harness their energy so that it works in the service of progress and doesn't undermine it.  5. They like to work and play. Successful people personify the often-repeated quote, ""Do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life."" Because they love what they do, they find brainstorming, problem-solving, and grinding out tough projects thought-provoking, engaging, and deeply satisfying. And though they take their work very seriously, the enjoyment and gratification they derive from it blurs the common demarcation between work and play. Successful people are not limited by what other people tell them is possible. 6. They're ambiverts. Successful people are comfortable acting in ways that amplify their introversion and extraversion, depending on what the situation calls for. They can sit in the back of a conference room and silently listen to what's going on, or they can go up on stage, grab a microphone, and engage a huge crowd -- and they look just as comfortable doing one as they do the other.  7. They're naïve and smart. No one would argue that intelligence isn't an important part of success, but many successful people also have a childlike lack of awareness (or maybe it's a lack of respect) for the type of constraints that other people blindly accept. They're not limited by what other people tell them is possible.  8. They're both humble and proud. Taking pride in your work is absolutely essential for success, but successful people know they wouldn't be where they are without the people who came before them and those they've worked with along the way. They know that they didn't achieve their success all on their own, and because they're OK with that, they don't have anything to prove. That's why so many incredibly successful people end up coming across as grounded and humble when you meet them in person.Bringing It All TogetherThe reason that there are so many different opinions on what traits are necessary for success -- and the reason that so many of them contradict each other -- is that successful people are complex. They have a wide variety of paradoxical skills that they call upon as needed, like a mechanic with a well-stocked toolbox.  What other paradoxical habits characterize successful people?

Yes, they're dead. But now, thanks to a mechanical fortune teller (add Big to the mix), they discover that one of them can return to life, via a unanimous vote of the group.Each defends his life in turn, the Tracy Flick-ish Ocean O'Connell Rosenberg (her parents were uber-hippes), chubby and schlubby Constance Blackwood (her catchphrase is ""I'm sorry""), Ukranian-born would-be rapper Mischa Bachinski, Marlene Dietrich wannabe Noel Gruber, fantasy lover Ricky Potts, and a spooky sixth contestant identified only as Jane Doe, because she, literally, lost her head in the fatal accident and remains unidentified.All of the performances are terrific, revealing both the teenage cliché of their characters, as well as the genuine human being underneath. And it's charmingly pulled together by director and choreographer Rachel Rockwell, doing a fine service to the hilarious, inventive, and often surprising work of writers Brooke Maxwell and Jacob Richmond.It's creepy, it's campy, it's touching, and, for a musical about a bunch of dead teenagers, it's very funny.

85,BUSINESS,2016 In Review: Top Tips from the Best Entrepreneurs in the Business,"John Bowen, ContributorSerial entrepreneur and host of the Accelerating Entrepreneuri...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-in-review-the-top-ti_b_13798022.html,,2016-12-26,2016-12-22-1482441323-1751034-aes_huff_post_year_end.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-22-1482441323-1751034-aes_huff_post_year_end-thumb.jpg,"Over the past year, I've compiled more than 150 business-building insights and actionable strategies from some of the top entrepreneurs in their respective fields--including social media market mavens, consultants to some of the world's most affluent families, and even a Hindu priest turned entrepreneur.Here are five of the top tips that have come my way--ones that I, and other top entrepreneurs like me, are now using every day to leapfrog the competition and build winning, world-class companies. 1. Focus on where you generate the most value. We've got to decide what our highest and best ability is, and devote ourselves to it. For many of us, that means being the rainmaker who brings in new business and makes important new connections--not the person who deals with the daily operations and minutia. Each year, take a step back and ask yourself: Am I focused where I should be given what I want to accomplish most? Such moments can lead to inflection points in your businesses.2. Build a great ""front row"" of raving fans--and become one yourself. You want great people surrounding you in all aspects of your life. These will be the people who make up your ""front row""-- your biggest, most raving fans who will support you in all you do. To build that roster, start by listing the most important people and relationships in each major category of your life -- including health, business, social, religious and so on. Are you devoting enough time and energy to these key people as you should, or do you let these relationships slide?Another exercise for building a great front row of people around you is to ask yourself: Whose front row am I in? Look at your network and your friends and see who you are important to. Then ask yourself how you are doing at serving them, helping them and rooting them on. 3. Manage your energy like you manage your money. No matter how wealthy you are, you still have a finite amount of money -- and typically you stop and think before you spend or invest a bunch of cash, right? The key is to do the same thing with another finite, limited resource: your energy. Ask yourself: If I'm going to invest my energy in someone or something, are they going to do something with my energy that generate a return on my investment? In short, treat a request for your time and energy like a business proposition. One way to do that is to only give advice with strings attached. When you give someone advice, always give them something to do--a simple action they should take based on your advice. If they ask for your help again, see if they did what you asked them to do the first time. If not, let them know you can't help them until they've taken that first step. If so, go out of your way to keep helping, as they've shown a commitment to executing on your advice. 4. Remain a lifelong learner. The desire to engage in continuous education is a hallmark of great entrepreneurs. It helps you stay on top of trends in and out of your industry that could impact your business, and allows you to meet and network with other knowledge-driven business owners who can help you ""up your game"" even more.One of the most valuable learning options is a mastermind group -- where successful business owners across multiple industries meet to discuss vision, strategies and challenges and brainstorm together to make improvements. The diversity of these groups can help you discover best practices and identify solutions that might not occur to you if you simply met with other entrepreneurs who are just like you. Often in these groups, members share their financials with each other in order to drill deep and develop detailed action plans around specific goals.Important: Join only those groups or organizations with the members and resources that can have a real impact on your success -- and that you can contribute your knowledge to as well. 5. Engage with the influencers in your niche. If you can enlist the help of influencers -- the movers and shakers among the types of clients you most want your business to serve -- you can leapfrog over the competition. Influencers can help you better understand the needs and concerns of your chosen niche and how to solve them, as well as help connect you to ideal prospective clients. That might mean, for example, going after the smartest people in the industry and forming partnerships or joint ventures with them. If you identify the people in control of key relationships and media channels and make them your partners, you'll get the first introductions to new leads and get big-time exposure in new markets. (Indeed, I recently co-authored a study of 3,500 highly successful entrepreneurs and found a high correlation between networking with influencers and superior financial results.)Give yourself the tools you need to accelerate your success like never before.
