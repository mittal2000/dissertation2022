We’re not talk about cinnamon or nutmeg or any of those other spices, but the kola nut. At first taste, the kola nut is quite bitter, but it does contain a natural sweetness as well as caffeine. It comes from the kola tree, which grows predominately in West Africa and areas of Latin America. The tree grows in tropical areas and produces large pods, similar to the cocoa pods that house the cocoa bean. In Nigeria, the kola nut is a revered part of culture. According to Words are Sweet: Igbo Stories and Storytelling, it is the highest form of hospitality. It is often offered to house guests as a way to let them know they are welcomed.

The general manager at Betony’s in New York City used the kola nut to make a reinvented version of the classic rum and coke. And smaller beverage companies, such as Q Drinks, are still using it to make their cola drinks. We talked to Jordan Silbert, the CEO of Q Drinks, for information on the kola nut’s role in cola. He told us that the main reason people used kola nut to make cola was really for its caffeine.“What really makes cola special is the other ingredients that are in it,” Silbert explained. Q Kola adds lemons, oranges, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and agave for additional sweetness to their kola nut beverage to give it that distinctive cola flavor. Silbert also told us that you can find kola nuts at some African markets. So if you want a taste of the real thing (and caffeine that you can chew on), be on the lookout."

I did. I was also on some medication that you’re not supposed to drink on, which I didn’t know.” The combination, she said, impaired her judgment. She told Harrison that she’s now in the process of tapering off the medication, which she began taking after her Champagne-filled stint on Nick Viall’s season of “The Bachelor.” She said she’d learned through the incident to be more cognizant of what she puts into her body. Production of “Paradise” was halted after production staff filed complaints of misconduct over an incident involving Olympios and DeMario Jackson on the first day of filming. After an independent investigation found no wrongdoing by the cast, taping resumed ― though both Olympios and Jackson declined to return.Since the controversy erupted, Olympios has commented on the incident primarily through statements from her legal team, while Jackson spoke more frequently to the press. He also sat down with Harrison for a taped interview that aired during “Bachelor in Paradise” on Aug. 22, sharing his and his family’s hurt and confusion at the dramatic media reports of the situation. He stated, not for the first time, that he had nothing but warm feelings for Olympios. “I’m here for her,” he told Harrison. “She’s experiencing the same thing that I am.” Still, she told Harrison that she was thrown by Jackson’s openness with the press, a move which, she said, left her on the defensive. If her close-lipped reaction to the controversy left any confusion about her feelings toward Jackson, Olympios wanted to clear that up during the Tuesday night interview. “I really just want people to know that I don’t blame DeMario,” she told Harrison. “I never pointed fingers at DeMario.” If she could speak to him, she added, she’d tell him, ”I respect you as a human. I have nothing against you.... I wish you all the best, and I’m just, I’m sorry.” For more on “Bachelor in Paradise,” check out HuffPost’s Here To Make Friends podcast below:Subscribe to Here To Make Friends: Apple Podcasts / Acast / RadioPublic / Google Play / Stitcher / RSSDo people love “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” or do they love to hate these shows?

But we need to confide in others and get help. Process what’s happening. Find the root and try to heal.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a623e71e00003c00a74d04.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Florida mom and reporter’s raw Facebook post is offering a glimpse into the pain of anxiety disorders. Kristen Hewitt, who works part-time as a television reporter, has two daughters, ages 5 and 8. On Saturday, she posted a selfie in the midst of a challenging day. “Today has been a rough day. I’ve been feeling well lately, taking care of myself, and been relatively calm. But today anxiety won,” she wrote in the caption.Hewitt explained that her anxiety made her feel like she couldn’t leave her kids to go on vacation with her husband because the plane might crash, caused her to cry for hours, and led her to hide in her room so that her children wouldn’t see her so upset. “Since suffering from a traumatic birth, PTSD, perimenopause, and postpartum anxiety disorder I’ve never talked about this emotion,” she wrote. “I was afraid others would think I was weak. I was afraid people would know I’m broken. But I’m not, just a little banged up.”Hewitt described her bout of anxiety as a “monstrous wave” and “emotional fueled by [her] thoughts. Addressing her fellow mothers, she wrote, “We change after having kids. Sometimes it’s depression, sometimes anxiety, sometimes both. But we need to confide in others and get help. Process what’s happening. Find the root and try to heal.”Hewitt told HuffPost she’s been dealing with mental health struggles since the birth of her first daughter eight years ago. “She had a traumatic birth, and I was diagnosed with postpartum anxiety disorder. It’s been an up-and-down battle, and something that’s been hard to cope with,” the mom said.She posted the selfie “on a whim” and decided to speak out about her experience. “I had never really opened up about it, but that day was awful. It was a new low and after I dug myself out that post just poured out of me,” she explained. “I was tired. Tired of ignoring how I felt. Tired of pretending to have it all together when everything felt like it was falling apart.”To cope with her anxiety, Hewitt saw a therapist for awhile and tried medication, but now she opts for natural treatments, including acupuncture, meditation, essential oils and keeping a gratitude journal. “It all works pretty well, but sometimes I need more help, so then I reach out and see someone,” the mom said. Hewitt’s Facebook post received more than 860 likes. She said the reaction to her post has been really helpful, and she’s enjoyed reading encouraging words from women who offered their support and shared their own stories. “We aren’t alone, it’s so incredible to learn how many women deal with this after childbirth and sometimes for the rest of their lives,” she said. Hewitt hopes people who are struggling can read her post and realize they aren’t alone and that this is a common experience. “Anxiety doesn’t define you,” she said. She added, “I’m really glad I opened up because already it’s helping people. I think we all need to break the stigma and talk about mental health more. There’s no shame in asking for help.”"
4,POLITICS,A Third Of Americans Say They Know Someone Affected By Harvey,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-third-of-americans-say-they-know-someone-affected-by-harvey_us_59a72765e4b0a8d14572e2b4,Early reviews of the government's response to the disaster are generally positive.,2017-08-30,Residents use boats to evacuate floodwaters from Tropical Storm Harvey along Tidwell Road in east Houston on Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a7296c24000036004ba888.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than a third of Americans say they or someone they know has been affected by the flooding in Texas caused by Hurricane Harvey, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, which finds a generally positive initial reaction to the response by President Donald Trump and the federal government.Four percent of those polled say they’ve been directly affected, 12 percent that someone in their family has been affected, and 22 percent that someone else they know has been. With some people falling in multiple categories, that adds up to a total 34 percent who know someone who’s felt the impact of the storm. In the South, that total number is 40 percent.For some, the effect has been tangential or relatively minor. Some say they or a relative have been forced to postpone a trip, have temporarily lost power or have been unable to get to work in the past several days.Others say the effects on them or their loved ones have been far more serious.“Mom’s house in Rockport was destroyed. She’s 84 years old so we will have to figure out her insurance, and apply for assistance,” wrote one Texas man. “My father-in-law lived in Port Aransas, Tx. He is still unsure of the condition of his home. They are all staying with us 100 miles north.”“Our daughter may have water damage to her house,” another Texas resident wrote. “A friend does have water damage. My husband and I were up all night watching the water level at our house, our daughter’s house and our friend’s house.”Asked how his family had been affected, one man wrote simply: “Have not been able to get hold of them.”A 51 percent majority of Americans say they approve of the federal government’s efforts to handle the flooding in Texas, the survey finds, with just 16 percent disapproving, and the remaining third unsure. Opinions of Trump’s performance are also positive, with 42 percent approving, 24 percent disapproving and the rest uncertain. (The survey was conducted almost entirely prior to Trump’s visit to Texas on Tuesday, during which he praised the turnout for his event and, according to pool reports, made little mention of the victims of the storm.)Perhaps unsurprisingly, Americans’ ratings of Trump’s performance were far more polarized than their opinions about the federal government overall. Among those polled who were asked about the federal government’s response, voters who supported the president in last year’s election were 35 points likelier than those who supported Hillary Clinton to approve. Among those asked specifically about Trump, the gap in approval between Trump and Clinton voters was twice as big.Brock Long, Trump’s pick to run the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has decades of experience in emergency management and has been hailed by a former FEMA official as “probably one of the best prepared (people) that the country could ask for.”“FEMA is going to be [in Texas] for years,” Long said Sunday in an interview with CNN. “This disaster is going to be a landmark event. ... While we’re focused on response right now and helping Texas respond, we’re already pushing forward recovery housing teams. We’re already pushing forward forces to be on the ground to implement the National Flood Insurance Program policies and doing the inspections that we need. We’re setting up and gearing up for the next couple years.”Americans are split on how much the nation currently spends on disaster relief ― 32 percent say it spends too little, while 33 percent say it spends the right amount. Just 6 percent say the country spends too much.They’re generally confident, if not deeply so, about their own areas’ abilities to withstand a disaster. A near-majority, 49 percent, say they think their state government would be at least somewhat well-prepared to handle a disaster, although just 13 percent say they’d be very prepared. About three in 10 say their state would be not very or not at all well-prepared.The survey also finds that 47 percent of the public believes climate change played at least a somewhat important role in causing the flooding in Texas, with just under a third believing it played little or no role.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Aug. 28-29 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Alexandra Brodsky, a civil rights attorney and co-founder of anti-sexual violence organization KnowYourIX, noticed Wednesday morning that the “Rape And Sexual Assault: Renewed Call To Action” report had been taken down. The report can still be accessed on the Obama administration’s archived website.“I went looking for it because I’m working on briefing for a client who’s a survivor and was looking for some literature about the impact of sexual violence and that’s been a really helpful resource for that kind of research,” Brodsky told HuffPost. “But it was no longer on the White House website. It’s not anywhere on the White House website.”While it is commonplace for the White House website to be cleared of its digital content during transitions between presidential administrations, it is unclear whether this report was taken down during the administration turnover on Inauguration Day, which was Jan. 20, or in the months since then. The report, which can also be found on KnowYourIX’s website, was created under the Obama administration by the 2014 White House Council on Women and Girls in partnership with then-Vice President Joe Biden. The findings of the report consist mainly of nonpartisan facts about sexual violence including sexual assault statistics and different ways the criminal justice system and college campuses can improve in combatting sexual and gender violence. Brodsky tweeted her discovery early Wednesday morning. While the White House declined to clarify exactly when the report was taken down since President Donald Trump took office, a White House spokesperson provided the following statement to HuffPost:At the conclusion of a Presidential Administration, web content from that Administration is archived by NARA and typically made available on an archived website. The policy, process, and extent of archiving of Obama Administration content was determined by the Obama Administration, in consultation with NARA and other stakeholders.Brodsky likened the removal of the report to when the climate change page disappeared from the White House website a few days after Trump was elected.In the days following Trump’s inauguration, many people noticed that certain pages had been removed from the White House website including the LGBT and climate change pages. According to Snopes, it is “inaccurate to say that these terms were specifically scrubbed from the site by Donald Trump.” While the climate change page has since been replaced with a page titled “An America First Energy Plan,” there has been no replacement for the LGBT page.“I think one of the reasons that that example comes to mind is because this is a report of facts and research,” Brodsky said. “This is a summary of really important and, in some cases, government-funded work that was done to understand the causes and effects of sexual and gender violence. What does it mean that the Trump administration doesn’t want the public to have that information?”This article has been updated to reflect the standard processes of digital archiving that take place when a new administration comes into the White House. CORRECTION: This article previously suggested that the removal of the report from the White House site was in some way unusual. As the White House notes, such removals are not uncommon in the routine transition between administrations."

Play. Or ride your bikes outside. You find something.” “Yeah, right.” “What about helping me with the chores?” “Ok, we’ll play.” (And after ten minutes). “Can we go to the beach?”I don’t know whether you sigh with relief when schools close for summer or with frustration, but for us every summer goes like this: At first, we’re eager for the schools to close and stop all the after-school activities. You know, just to stay at home a little to relax and do nothing. But after a few days of blissful happiness the problems begin. Too many people together in an apartment for too many hours. Day after day.With my husband we’re lucky enough to usually be able to arrange our shifts, so that one of us is at home with the children at all times. Which means though, that either I or he are at home with the little monsters… sorry children, alone. With all four of them, their ages ranging from eleven years old to one and a half.And in Greece the summer creates more problems than it solves. The days are too long and the summer too endless, and in the habit of chasing the other seasons out. The high temperatures also dictate the school program. In other words, the schools close for three whole months. THREE MONTHS! But children become restless way before that. Teachers know that Easter signifies the real end of the school year.And how can you concentrate on school subjects when it smells of summer already in March? The first excited tourists arrive in large groups, occupying the city and showing off their white skin when the locals are still wearing long-sleeved blouses, because “it’s rather windy”. And the children’s mind is on their first visit of the year to the beach.Ever since I was a child, the summer was valued by how many baths we had, how many ice-creams we ate, and yes, how many mosquito bites we could display (which meant we stayed a lot outside the house after dark). If you counted over one hundred in all of the above, your summer was a success.Things haven’t changed much, except for even going to the beach after some time sounds boring. If you’re a late beginner, you start going in June, in the afternoon, after work. You stay till the sun goes down and then back home again, a bath and everyone in bed. But that way, by August, the children—and you—need a change. You’re tired of little sand footprints in your living room (“ups, I forgot, mum”). The children are tired of having another bath (“we’ll be going back again tomorrow, what’s the big deal?”). Your husband is tired of trying to stop your youngest from swallowing little salty stones that look so yummy. And we’re all tired of seeing the same faces, even on the beach.Inevitably, the question arises on whether to pack and go for a few days on vacation somewhere else, but your mind starts doing the math. With so many children you need two rooms and not one. Your children, let alone your husband, need to eat. The prices go wild in the summer because of the demand, and the new beach will probably be more crowded than the one in front of your house. So, why bother? Just to keep your children from nagging “we never go on vacation!”The only way out is what the Greeks call the undying soul of the Greek family—the mother. My mum lives in a village in the north, on the other side of the country where it rains half of the time, and we see each other twice a year which makes her eager to have the children over. Our phone calls throughout the year end with the familiar: “send me the older children in summer, so you can rest a little”.My mother’s cottage is my children’s paradise. Clearly she spoils her grandchildren every way she can. The TV is always on in the mornings, and the children behave like royalty expecting to be served. Their days include a lot of ice-cream and chocolate. Their bedtime shifts from a ten-o’clock-the-latest approach to a ten-more-minutes-grandma-please-please approach. And we don’t join them at my hometown because my children and my mother in the same house—and at her own turf—is too much even for me. What else does a child want?Well, it seems even good life bores them. Too much TV results in too many fights, and soon they miss their familiar family rules. “I miss my bed,” my younger one says, and they all ask how their little sister is doing, and if their classmates are back from camping so we can arrange a meet-up. “When are you picking us up?” they end their calls.So, I make the long trip to my mother’s to bring them back. At home, after the hugs are over and they’re done with telling what they ate and where they went, they pick up where they left off: “What should we do?”Previously published as ‘Beach Days and Bored Children’ in Irena’s GAZE column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays:The Darkness of Trump’s America by Maria BehanWhy Jesus Would Want Us To Speak Out Against Prejudice by Reverend Rachel KesslerThe Lessons My Family Have Learned From the Past by Annie Mark-Westfall"

Not anymore.,2017-08-30,"President Donald Trump speaks about tax reform during a visit to Loren Cook Company in Springfield, Missouri, on Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a72cdd1e00002700c6016f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – A year after saying he would raise taxes on the rich, President Donald Trump is now pushing a proposal that instead would give those Americans an enormous tax break.Trump gave few details at a Wednesday speech in Springfield, Missouri, instead offering very broad priorities: a tax break for the middle class; fewer “loopholes”; bringing home companies’ overseas profits; a much lower corporate tax rate.Only on that final component did Trump attach a specific number – 15 percent as a goal, down from the current 35 percent maximum. And it is that piece that would provide a huge benefit to the wealthiest Americans, who own a disproportionate share of the nation’s businesses, either directly or through shares of stock.Trump said providing that tax cut would help middle- and working-class Americans because businesses would hire more employees. “We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, create jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America,” Trump said at Loren Cook Company, a manufacturer of fans and blowers. “Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work. They will love getting up in the morning. They will love going to their job. They will love earning a big, fat, beautiful paycheck.”Democrats, whose help Trump would almost certainly need if he wants permanent tax law changes, were quick to criticize that approach.“Giving huge tax cuts to businesses in the hopes that wealth will magically trickle down to hardworking Americans is pure folly, and not supported by the facts,” said Massachusetts Democrat Richard Neal, the ranking member on the House’s tax-writing panel.And while Republicans and some Democrats argue that taxes are too high, taxes for all but the richest Americans are lower now than at any time since President Ronald Reagan took office, according to a HuffPost analysis of data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.In years past, including as a candidate for president starting in 2015, Trump often spoke of the need for wealthier Americans to pay more in taxes. In August of that year in Iowa, Trump said he would increase the burden on those “making hundreds of millions of dollars” in income, “because right now they are paying very little tax.”In May 2016, Trump told ABC News that “taxes for the rich will go up somewhat.”If he still intends for that to happen, he offered no hint of it in a 34-minute speech that attacked the current code and Democrats who oppose him and his policies but gave no specific guidance on what he wants to see in a legislative proposal.“I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. And I don’t want to be disappointed by Congress, do you understand me?” he said. “I think Congress is going to make a comeback. I hope so.”Trump’s earlier remarks notwithstanding, his plans even as a candidate heavily favored the wealthy. A plan analyzed by the conservative-leaning “Tax Foundation” would have dropped the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent down to 25 percent, and would have cost the Treasury $10 trillion over a decade, even assuming increased growth of the economy.In October Trump promised the “Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act,” which he claimed would reduce taxes for a middle-class family by 35 percent ― although he offered no specifics on how that would be achieved or even what constituted “middle class.” But like his previous plan, it would have cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.Since his election, Trump has been characteristically vague on the tax package he would like to see, sometimes emphasizing how it would be designed to help the middle class while sometimes focusing on cutting the corporate rate.In the last week of April, as he tried to stack up accomplishments toward the end of his first 100 days in office, the White House released a single page of bullet points on what Trump wanted in tax reform. Those included the 15 percent corporate tax rate, but also included some specifics such as reducing the top individual rate down from 39.6 percent down to 35 percent and doubling the standard deduction.At that time, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration would have a detailed plan out by August ― a prediction he admitted last week would not happen. Instead, he said he hoped to see a bill pass Congress by the end of the year.Even that goal appears optimistic, though, given the legislation Congress must pass in the coming few months, including a spending bill for the budget year that starts Oct. 1; an increase to the Treasury’s borrowing authority to pay for debt already incurred; and, given the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey along the Gulf Coast, likely an emergency storm relief bill as well.At this point, no actual legislation exists, and the process of coming up with a plan has been assigned to the so-called “Big Six”: Mnuchin, Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and the GOP chairs of the two tax-writing committees.That group has not indicated a timeline, either, although Ryan in a prepared statement Wednesday called tax reform “our top priority this fall.”Anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, though, predicted that congressional Republicans would have a much easier time with taxes than they did trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, because that law had powerful opponents in hospitals, doctors and insurance companies.“Bottom line is tax reduction, tax reform is infinitely easier for Republicans to pass than healthcare,” said Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. “Fewer moving parts, no organized opposition.”Ryan and McConnell could pass a tax bill with only Republican votes under a special budget rule, but it would expire after 10 years unless it did not increase deficits ― an unlikely scenario, given the steep tax cuts Republicans want. To make deficit-increasing tax cuts permanent, Republicans would need eight Democrats in the Senate to vote with them to overcome a filibuster."

The old adage that “sex sells” seems to have been taken to a whole new level. We see advertisers using scantily clad women riding mechanical bulls in order to sell, wait – what were they selling? Oh, that’s right, hamburgers. And, sitting in a room with your children when a Liquid Plumber commercial airs has become downright uncomfortable.Over the years the line between appropriate vs. inappropriate topics in the media seems to have blurred. Especially when it comes to the time frames reserved for general family viewing and/or listening. That is, if there is such a thing anymore. Between the music, TV shows, commercials, and even the news, there does not appear to be a topic or image that is off limits.As a consequence, we are becoming immune to behavior and topics and that were once considered inappropriate for common consumption. So what affect is this having on our children and us overall?What’s Happening to Our ChildrenA consequence of all this openness and freedom of topic is the exposure of our children to things that they should have years before having to think about as a young adult. When your child asks why an erection lasting more than four hours is bad after watching a poorly timed Cialis commercial, you have to wonder if we have become too open. There are several other negative outcomes as well.Overly sexualized children. The lyrics to even the radio-edited versions of many of the most popular songs today are wildly suggestive. And a great deal of TV available during what used to be considered family viewing hours makes sex seem like no big deal. Not to mention what children can be exposed to on the internet. As a result, we have children who are too familiar with topics that are completely beyond their years and are far too complex for them to understand.Is There Anything Positive Here?Positives in this case are debatable. However, there may be a few outcomes that have helped us turn a good corner.Discussion. The normalization of formerly off-limits topics like sexuality and sexual health has pushed many parents into having frank conversations with their children. It has been said that knowledge is power. If this is to be believed, then arming our children with information that is influenced by our own family values is likely to be positive.What Does This All Mean?The bottom line is that we are living in a world where boundaries are becoming more and more fluid. The definition of what is appropriate and inappropriate is more subjective than ever. That tide is not likely to turn.It is possible that we have made some gains in certain areas, although some may think we have simply lost sight of the line between decency and decadence. For our children, however, we have likely opened the gate to inappropriate material far too wide.As individuals, partners and parents, we have to be more aware than ever of what is coming into our home and what is accessible to our kids. What is okay for adults has always been different than what is okay for children, but now we can no longer assume that anyone in the media actually cares about that difference. No one else is watching out for our kids’ best interests but us.You can read more advice from Dr. Kurt at Guy Stuff Counseling, Facebook, Google+, or Twitter."

In a new interview with “Sparkle & Circulate with Justin Sayre,” the singer-songwriter took a candid look back at his career thus far. As it turns out, Shears, 38, found solace in music in the days following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. “I was loving dancing, but then, I got kind of bored with it,” he tells host Justin Sayre in the clip below. Post-9/11 Manhattan, however, was “such a strange time” to be pursuing a new career objective, but nonetheless, Shears connected with musician Scott “Babydaddy” Hoffman. “We just started hanging out at his place and recording really dumb things that we thought were hilarious,” Shears recalls. Eventually, the two men wrote a new tune, “Bicycling with the Devil,” which they performed at New York’s Slipper Room. “I felt like it would be fun to go out and do something that would make people smile,” he says. It was there they met singer Ana Matronic, and the Scissor Sisters behind hits like “I Don’t Feel Like Dancin’” and “Let’s Have A Kiki” were born. Shears’s full “Sparkle & Circulate” interview with Sayre can be heard here. Previous interviews have included “RuPaul’s Drag Race” champion Jinkx Monsoon, “Queer as Folk” icon Randy Harrison and singer Gabrielle Stravelli. Sayre, a writer-performer based in New York and Los Angeles, is best known as the host of “International Order of Sodomites” (I.O.S.) which, for eight years, gathered monthly for “The Meeting,” a variety show honoring gay icons and cultural works.He’ll return to the stage with a brand new show, “I’m Gorgeous Inside,” which plays Los Angeles’s Au Lac, Joe’s Pub at the Public Theater in New York and Oasis in San Francisco throughout the month of September. You can also view some previous performances from “The Meeting” on Sayre’s official YouTube page. For more Sayre, head to Facebook and Twitter.

To the 28-year-old Kim, who lives and works in South Korea’s capital, Seoul, the comments sounded eerily familiar to those she’d heard from North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un, whose family for decades has threatened to engulf its enemies in flames.As U.S. media worked itself into a 24/7 fever pitch, debating the prospect of nuclear war and how quickly Trump could press the button, Trump’s brazen, unplanned remarks left Kim Jeong-seon deeply worried during her travels. “Trump against Kim Jong Un was all over the news,” she recounted from back home in Seoul. “I was incredibly distressed.”But her anxiety almost immediately dissipated upon returning home, as her friends and family showed little of the frenzied fears she had felt in America. “South Korean media just wasn’t treating the story in that dire of a manner,” she said, as she strolled in a Seoul park filled with people enjoying afternoon beers and soju on the grass. Under its enigmatic leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has dramatically ramped up its nuclear and missile development program. In recent months, Pyongyang reportedly managed to miniaturize a nuclear warhead and successfully tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles that experts say could reach California, or beyond. In a sharp escalation of its belligerent stance, the Kim regime on Monday fired a missile that flew over Japan.But while the North’s rapid scientific advancements and Trump’s confrontational response have sparked alarm in the U.S., the rising tensions appear to have left many of Seoul’s residents unfazed. “I guess I got used to it,” explained one Seoul resident, who declined to give her name but spoke with HuffPost on camera about North Korea’s missile tests (Pyongyang has conducted more than a dozen this year alone). “Because Kim Jong Un keeps launching missiles, I just think: ‘Oh, there goes another one ... .’”The apparent indifference is remarkable, given the South’s proximity to the eccentric regime. Seoul, a bustling metropolis of 25 million, lies just 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone, commonly referred to as “the DMZ” ― a heavily fortified border separating a North and South that could not be more different. Technology and connectedness is king in South Korea’s capital, where nearly 90 percent of the population owns a smartphone and Wi-Fi access reaches into subway stations deep underground. Meanwhile, many regular citizens in Pyongyang aren’t even allowed to use the internet.The North has a vast array of traditional weaponry ― thousands of cannons and rocket launchers ― buried in the mountains just beyond the DMZ, ready to fire at its glittering neighbor in case of an American attack. According to some estimates, those weapons could rain down destruction on the South’s capital city and kill tens of thousands of its residents within minutes. But despite the existential threat, more than a dozen people interviewed in Seoul one week after Trump’s “fire and fury” comments expressed doubt that war was imminent, and pointed to overt sensationalism in foreign media. Seoul was electric with life while Pyongyang and Washington, D.C., were exchanging barbs: Korean fried chicken joints were packed, the popular shopping area of Myeongdong was bustling, and karaoke bars were lit up with disco balls and K-pop renditions nightly.“Though foreign countries view the situation alarmingly, here, everyone is out and about,” Yoon Seok-hwan, 35, said while walking with his wife and young daughter in Seoul’s Yeonnam-dong neighborhood. “South Koreans are too busy all the time.”The sentiment wasn’t limited to South Koreans in Seoul. Americans living in the city said they, too, took the war-mongering with a grain of salt. Frank Scott, a 67-year-old American who retired to Seoul, said he could tell when U.S. media ran a story about the North on the nightly news, solely based on the number of calls he got from relatives back home.“Every time something happens, I get calls from my family in the U.S. saying, ‘Get out,’ and I go, ‘Calm down, it’s OK,’” Scott told HuffPost. “People are still going to theme parks, they’re going to movies, they’re going to festivals. We’re going to concerts, everything’s fine.”Suk-Young Kim, a professor at UCLA who studies Korean culture, said she’s noticed a societal level of indifference toward the North Korean threat during her own visits to Seoul, particularly among younger generations. “You go to South Korea and it’s just like every day is normal,” Kim said. She noted, however, that older Koreans ― some of whom may have originated from the North ― would likely remember when the peninsula first became divided, and be more interested in following news coverage of the Kim regime.Signs of Seoul’s geographic vulnerability are hidden in plain sight.In case an attack should ever come, more than 3,200 emergency bomb shelters are scattered throughout Seoul, and most subway platforms hold large blue cases stocked with gas masks, water bottles and first-aid supplies (although they can’t be used in nuclear or chemical attacks). The city conducted a nationwide civil defense drill this week, and officials have been handing out leaflets to inform residents about their nearest shelters. But after walking past them every day, sometimes for decades on end, many Seoul residents no longer pay attention to the evacuation signs. Most of the evacuation centers go unnoticed as well, and few residents appear to know know what the simple, bright red emblems identifying them mean. City officials said this month that 74 percent of residents in Seoul don’t know where their nearest shelter is. An administrative manager at a government community center told HuffPost no one had come in to ask about the facilities in recent weeks, despite the uptick in tensions.Part of the reason South Koreans say they aren’t easily startled by Kim Jong Un’s threats is that they’ve been levied almost nonstop for decades. The two Koreas are technically still at war but have abided by an armistice agreement signed in 1953. Nevertheless, North Korea has been promising to attack its southern neighbor in near perpetuity since the end of the Korean War. The North has promised to turn Seoul into a “sea of fire,” a “sea of flame” and to bomb the city “to ashes” with an almost regimented frequency.“The country’s been living under threats and bellicose statements for 70 years,” American Seoul resident Scott said. North Korea will “huff and puff, but nothing’s going to happen,” he said, “and the U.S. will huff and puff ― one person in particular will huff and puff — but nothing’s going to happen.”Although the current standoff between D.C. and Pyongyang doesn’t appear to have rattled people in Seoul’s streets, Trump’s confrontational approach has shaken officials in the Blue House, the executive office and official residence of the South Korean head of state.Former American presidents have used a mix of punishing sanctions and attempts at negotiation in efforts to convince or coerce the North into abandoning its nuclear program, to varying success. But Trump’s rhetoric represented a near-unprecedented escalation that prompted some historians to compare his language to that of former President Harry S. Truman after he ordered a nuclear attack against Japan in 1945, The New York Times and Reuters noted.South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in issued a sharp rebuke to his counterpart in the White House after Trump’s comments raised alarm in diplomatic circles, saying there would be no military action on the Korean Peninsula without Seoul’s consent and that his government would “block war by all means.” “The people worked together to rebuild the country from the Korean War, and we cannot lose everything again because of a war,” Moon said during a news conference this month.Evans Revere, a former principal deputy assistant secretary of state who specializes in North Korea, agreed that Trump’s comments unsettled many behind the scenes in Seoul and Japan, another U.S. ally that has long been in range of North Korean weaponry.“That the United States is behaving in a very different way ... our Japanese and Korean friends are troubled by that,” he said. “I do hope the Americans understand what the consequences might be to a pre-emptive strike against North Korea.”But just like many South Koreans, Revere did not think a military conflict was near. “My sense is that despite the rising tensions, despite the concerns, despite the reality of growing North Korean military capabilities, I don’t see us on the brink of war.”Since his election in May, Moon has said the South is open to talking with Pyongyang. North Korea rejected offers to do just that this month, but Moon has proposed sending a special envoy to its neighbor in an effort to reopen diplomatic relations.“A dialogue between South and North Korea must resume. But we don’t need to be impatient,” Moon said. “I think lots of effort and time could be necessary to overcome a decade of severed ties and to reopen a dialogue.”Some of Seoul’s publicly calm demeanor may be starting to slip as Trump adds a new level of unpredictability to an arena already dominated by a master of the dubious claim. Alex Oh, 21, a cadet in the South Korean military, explained that contrary to some of his countrymen, his experience as an officer led him to “always worry.”“The problem Koreans have is they don’t fear,” Oh said near Seoul’s Hongdae neighborhood. He described Kim Jong Un as a “crazy person,” but added that he worried about Trump too. He said he admired the U.S. president for “being a straight shooter” who says what’s on his mind, but he feared Trump in the end would focus on profit rather than diplomacy.At the busy Seoul Station, a major railway hub in the center of the city, 84-year-old Oh-Jae Kwon was less worried. As travelers rushed to catch afternoon trains departing to destinations on the Korean peninsula, he explained he found Kim Jong Un to be a dangerous man, but not one to make reckless decisions. “Because the world is so global now, our allies won’t let North Korea to attack South Korea. We should be aware of our circumstances, but there’s no need to worry. A war won’t break here,” he said. In the background, televisions broadcasting local news featured stories on the weather, a fickle stock market and celebration activities planned for National Liberation Day. The update on North Korea’s latest threat came more than more than half an hour in. No one appeared to be watching anyway."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a483261e00002700c5fb08.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer individuals. But with his directive Friday banning transgender people from serving openly in the military, the president rolled back progress that was already underway during President Barack Obama’s administration. A group of civil rights organizations announced Monday that it was suing Trump’s administration over the new policy.Eric Fanning served as Army secretary at the end of Obama’s term, and was part of the effort to transition the military to full equality for transgender individuals. Fanning was also the first openly gay person to serve in the position. He is now on the board at the Center for a New American Security.On Monday, Fanning spoke to HuffPost about his views on Trump’s ban, arguing that there is no basis to the president’s claim that transgender service members hurt readiness and cohesion. (The interview has been lightly edited for clarity.)So, first, can I just get your general reaction to what Trump is doing?It’s hard to distill that. My general reaction is that this is unprecedented. Not just the way he has gone about announcing this via tweet, but the idea that we would just say to a group of people who’ve been told they can serve openly, “never mind,” after they’ve identified themselves. We’ve never done that before. Over time, we have found ways to increase opportunities for service. You know, President Harry Truman integrating the military in the 1940s, women in combat roles, Don’t Ask Don’t Tell repeal. Never have we gone back and changed the policy to tell people who are serving, meeting your standards, in your jobs for which they’re trained, that there’s not a future for them.Can you imagine if you had been secretary of the Army and you had seen a tweet from the commander-in-chief announcing this policy?No. I suppose everything that was unimaginable before is happening now. Start with the tweet. He said that it’s burdensome and disruptive. I am offended that a commander-in-chief would refer to thousands of people serving in uniform under his command as a burden. And the disruption is him changing this policy, especially over a tweet. It’s sowed so much confusion across the force. Then, a week later, he makes the statement that this is complicated and confusing, so he’s doing the military a favor. The military does complicated and confusing things all the time, and does it really well. And we spent a year analyzing, debating, discussing, deciding what to do with this policy because we wanted to do it in the most professional way possible. He said the military cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs of gender reassignment surgery. Can you comment on that and whether that would be burdensome?I look to the RAND Corp. RAND did two studies on that. They’re an incredibly credible organization. Their estimate was that it would cost $2.5 million to $8.5 million, something in that range, which is essentially one one-thousandth of a point of a percent of military medical spending ― 0.0001 percent of military spending. We spend $40 million a year on Viagra. Eighty million dollars total on erectile dysfunction issues. And RAND’s estimate is as low as $2.4 million a year. And I believe they came up with that estimate before the accession policy was set that says for a transgender American to join the military, they have to be stable in the target gender for 18 months. So, people aren’t able to join just to get transition-related medical care.You were helping to oversee the transition under Obama. Was there resistance in the Army to allowing transgender service members to serve openly?The Army is an enormous institution. So you’re going to find all different viewpoints on any given issue. Certainly there was resistance. Some people just don’t approve. But most of it in the debate was really ― it was just questions, wanting to know, how does this impact readiness? How many soldiers are not going to be deployable because of medical care that they’re receiving?And RAND’s analysis ― again, before the accession policy was set with the 18-month stability clause ― was that it would be as low as 29 to as high as 129 service members a year that would require medical, surgical treatment for transitioning. I suspect that number’s going to be lower, again, because of the 18-month requirement for stability in the target gender. And there aren’t ongoing medical needs that impact deployability. The Trump administration has said it’s willing to let current transgender individuals serving in the military continue to serve. What are your thoughts on that? Does that undercut the argument that allowing more transgender people to serve will undercut readiness? I suspect that the lawyers just couldn’t figure out how to make work the idea of discharging people who are already serving and have been told they could serve openly. That’s my guess what happened behind the scenes. I think there are a number of things that undercut the argument that this negatively impacts readiness. And that’s just one of them, if you’re allowing people to continue serving. They want to find ways to drum them out. That’s clear. Are you worried that the Trump directive ― even if they do allow transgender people to continue serving who are already there ― do you worry that the directive will have an impact on them? Such as an uptick in harassment or anything like that?I do worry about that. The military is a very professional organization. It’s also a very young organization. And here the commander-in-chief is essentially saying it’s okay to discriminate against this group of people. So I worry about how that message is being received, particularly by young people in uniform. And I worry about the environment that creates for open trans service members. Anything else?It’s essentially the last discriminatory practice in the military. Gays and lesbians are allowed to serve openly and are fully integrated. All combat positions are open to women. All that should matter is meeting the requirements. And there are thousands of transgender service members who did meet the requirements. They are trained, and they are doing their jobs. The RAND estimate ― to suggest that those numbers would have an impact on readiness is really hard to substantiate.What were your thoughts when Tennessee state Sen. Mark Green was nominated as Army secretary and it came out that he had made all these, mostly anti-transgender comments? (Green withdrew from consideration in May, after considerable criticism over his past comments.)I think that diversity is one of the strengths of our force, and an important part of that force is inclusion. I think it’s hard to have a leader of such a diverse a force who has any open prejudices against people who are serving, whether it be LGBT, whether it be Muslim, whatever it is. The force is large, and it represents and reflects society and all its diversity, which is a positive thing. A leader of an organization like that should respect that diversity.America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.

Hundreds of the ear tickling promises made by Trump-the-candidate are off the table or have been brushed aside entirely by Trump-the-president, and some people are having doubts about their man. This is most readily expressed in the interactive social media discussions among friends. These are truly amazing to observe, and some of those defending the president’s every behavior have reached a level of absurdity not even required before the election. With a 35 percent approval rating, and members of his Make American Great Again team either quitting or getting fired, some people are now suggesting his days as president are numbered. How long his core supporters will cling to the guy can’t be known, but one important thing is being overlooked by the professional observers: the anger for a revolution against the status quo that Donald Trump originally tapped remains unsatisfied. This is only going to get worse. Victims of a film-flam man aren’t likely to buy in again, but that anger is still festering.My father was a factory worker in the furniture industry in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He operated a router, cutting the same piece for the same furniture over and over again for twenty years as part of an assembly line. He was a working man and a Democrat of the Adlai Stevenson ilk. My father simply could not vote for Republicans, because they represented the wealthy, including the boss, the owners, the managers, all those who got rich on the backs of others, especially labor. “Silk stockings” I recall hearing.At the annual company picnic, the children of employees were each given a silver dollar, and it was a big, big deal for all of us. They were heavy and big, and they made our eyes pop. We always ended up spending them later, but for the moment, we felt rich. However, those shiny coins were also emblematic of the reality that the people carrying the bags full of them and handing them out were the overseers, and we, as recipients of their largess, were not. When you hold a big silver dollar in your little hand, the mind wanders to what it might be like to hold two. Or three. Or more.Ecclesiastes 4:4 “Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man’s envy of his neighbor.” ESVMy father even disliked Gerald Ford, the local boy who became president in the wake of Watergate. Ford came from East Grand Rapids, considered the other side of the tracks from our modest means. Ford’s policies were not Nixon’s, because his favor came from a different sort of Republican ― the business elite and their desire need to advocate for wealth and more wealth.This disgust with the rich is now gone from our culture. It’s been replaced by a sinister form of dangled carrot envy that shouts, “The liberals have robbed you of your chance at the good life through the tyranny of the minority, so all you have to do is vote against them to get back what really belongs to you.” This forms a fascinating paradox for the people who elected Donald Trump, because there simply aren’t enough bodies in the one percent to elect a candidate anywhere. You must have working class people included, and that remains the biggest mystery of the Trump phenomenon. How do you get people like my father to vote WITH those above you in every status measurement? It’s actually easier than you think. You tell them that it’s not the fault of the rich that you sit in the have-not cabin; it’s those damned liberals. And so discontent increases with opportunities for acting on it, and that’s the trade-off for those who swallow the dangled carrot. The more you have, the more you need, and the one percent knows this paradox well, and they exploit it to keep the scales balanced in such a way as to favor their trickle down imaginings.Television reality shows pay their stars well, so even “realities” like the Jersey Shore, a Louisiana swamp, or a small town in rural Georgia are skewed by those with money in their pockets. Then there are the Kardashians. Endorsement deals featuring reality show “celebrities” create a wannabe sub-culture that mimics the wealthy in ways that contribute to the envy of one’s neighbor. Think not? Spend a little time wandering around Instagram asking who’s getting paid for promoting what? How much of the debt in our culture comes from young people trying to emulate those they see on TV or online? Johnny has that car, so why not me? It doesn’t matter that Johnny was given the car to promote sales to you.This is the self-centered cultural core that we explored at The 700 Club to raise money and channel this discontent to the Republican Party. It’s all in my book, The Gospel of Self: How Jesus Joined the GOP. Any person who will dance and kick with arms raised in church, speak in tongues, fall to the floor “in the spirit,” lay hands on the sick for healing, and generally give themselves over to a public display of emotional worship in unison with others can easily be convinced to step outside reason on matters of conscience, economics, and politics. We taught that wealth creation was a holy calling, because wealthy Christians could then use that wealth to help the poor and the afflicted. Since they were busy people, however, we offered to “help” them do their duty by using their money for them, which encouraged their participation in funding everything that was CBN. We also regularly encouraged viewers to test God with their offerings, which tapped that core of envy while filling our coffers with tax-deductible contributions. It was a heady time for us indeed. We were changing the world and doing it for good, we thought.But envy unsatisfied is frustration, which is a three-syllable word for anger, and absent an outlet, anger is shoved inside to reappear when frustration’s targets can be identified as liberal thieves out to steal everything that’s ours. It didn’t matter if this was true or not; it only needed to appear to be true, for such is the power of television’s version of mass marketing.The problem with anger is that it can redirect energy away from truth. Resentments always color one’s existence, because the narrative can only present a skewed reality. Resentment also directly connects us to the past, where we are simply unable to fully enjoy all that exists for us in the present. So, to paraphrase Pascal, we never live, but we hope to live, and in so doing it’s inevitable that we will never be happy. This is neither God’s best for us, nor His plan. We are simply unable to live life on Life’s terms so long as we are bolted to the past (or the future). We paint ourselves as victims who deserve better. However, the best a victim can do is survive, while those willing to embrace life fully are free to win. This is my choice daily.The idea that the haves should govern the have-nots is straight out of the colonialist playbook, the outcome of which is only good for the conquerers and the rich people who write the rules. This is the gift of civilization for those in charge. Ron Sider, writing for Christianity Today (The Holy Calling of Wealth Creation Isn’t So Simple), says this about a new document from the Lausanne Movement and Business as Mission Global called “The Wealth Creation Manifesto,”While this manifesto is reflective of important biblical themes, it ignores others and ultimately fails to provide the balanced wisdom and guidance so urgently needed on this important topic.Here’s the deal. There is an Evangelical Christian belief that the Bible calls for men (and women?) of God to be the keepers of wealth in the community, because, apparently, we’ll follow certain righteous mandates and make sure everybody is treated from a fair economic perspective. Mr. Sider does a brilliant job of deconstructing this, and I wish I could simply copy and paste the whole thing. Here’s just one paragraph:Any manifesto that celebrates wealth creation without also acknowledging the ways wealth creation can be unjust is an inadequate representation of central biblical themes and current realities. The Bible continually stresses God’s special concern for the poor and the importance of just distribution. The manifesto does insist that “wealth hoarding is wrong, and wealth sharing should be encouraged,” but this does not come close to dealing realistically with the astonishing, unjust concentration of wealth that exists today.So here we sit ― with right-wing Christians having elected a man who promised to assuage their anger by “Making America Great Again.” However, that’s not happening and is not likely to happen given the policies and promises provided to make it so. This is the open window through which President Trump’s opponents ― whether Republican, Independent, or Democrat ― should enter in order to make a difference in coming elections. The anger is still there. The envy is still there. And certainly the selfishness isn’t going anywhere either.He who has ears to hear, let him hear."

The couple also waited to give their kids cellphones until they turned 14. “You’re always looking at how it can be used in a great way ― homework and staying in touch with friends ― and also where it has gotten to excess,” he wrote.Melinda echoed those same ideals in her essay and wrote that she admires social media and smartphones for their access to information and for giving marginalized groups access to community, but that she does advocate for a balance between having access to smartphones and having no screen time. She also admits she probably would have delayed “putting a computer in [her] children’s pockets” if she could do it again.“The internet is a wonderful thing,” she wrote. “It gives kids the freedom to move around in a big world, to experiment, to connect with others. As a parent, though, I know that I am responsible for making sure that my kids are ready for all that freedom ― and that they know how to keep themselves safe.”Read Melinda’s essay in full on The Washington Post."

Hispanic infants and those in other minority groups did have worse care than whites according to Baby-MONITOR scores, however.Differences between races were larger for individual parts of the score.Black infants were more likely to have chronic lung disease and a collapsed lung, compared to white infants, for example.Black infants grew faster than white infants, however.White infants scored as well or better on all measures than Hispanic infants.Differences in care were also tied to the NICUs’ overall scores, the researchers found.NICUs that provided the worst care tended to have the smallest gap in care between infants of different races, for example. In some cases, black infants received better care than white infants.“There is a lot of variation,” said Profit.“One of the main points of the analyses is that it’s really dangerous to use a broad brush,” he said. “The results are really at the level of the NICU.”He said the next step is to look at other data that provide more information about societal issues that could influence care.SOURCE: bit.ly/2wiMiOB and bit.ly/2wjcYyw Pediatrics, online August 28, 2017."

He has now teamed up with a fellow father, Stephen Medawar, for another GoFundMe campaign, and has set his sights on helping elementary, middle and high school students across the state so they don’t have to worry about their debt in the cafeteria or being shamed for not being able to afford lunch. Lew and Medawar, both Washington state residents, were classmates at the University of Washington. When Medawar saw Lew’s previous GoFundMe school lunch projects, he reached out asking to get involved with the campaign. Medawar helped launch the project’s site called LunchDebt.orgBefore extending his project to cover the entire state, Lew raised more than $98,000 for five school districts, wiping out overdue school lunch balances for thousands of students. Learn more about Lew’s initial efforts in the video below. Currently, Lew and Medawar are asking for $650,000 on GoFundMe, which is an estimate of the total lunch debt in the state. The districts included are based off of a list from the state’s Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the schools are public and private schools that chose to participate in the National School Lunch Program. Lew told HuffPost that he has not heard back from all the schools about their lunch debt information and that the duo will update the GoFundMe page to reflect a new total if needed. As of Tuesday afternoon, they have raised more than $14,000. Lew told HuffPost he is confident that this campaign will help end both lunch debt and lunch shaming and advocated for what he calls “universal lunches” for all students. “It would be the solution to end both lunch debt and lunch shaming,” he said. “Public schools are already provided for children, so why not lunches?”For more information, head to Lew and Medawar’s GoFundMe page."

Katie believes Quinn adorably embodies the classic Harry Potter-isms “I solemnly swear I am up to no good” and “mischief managed.”Said the photographer, “Quinn is a chubby, ice cream-loving 1-year-old whose smile melts your heart, but don’t let that fool you because she is a busy little lady who loves getting into trouble!”To bring the photos to life, Katie had Danielle physically support Quinn for safety and then used Photoshop to remove the mom’s hands.

But over the years, the tennis player’s long shorts have become much shorter shorts. It’s no accident and at a recent event, Nadal says it has everything to do with his age. “They were very comfortable, but not for my age. When I was 18, 19, 20, they were OK,” the 31-year-old told InStyle at the 2017 Palace Invitational with Venus Williams last week.He added, “I decided to change up the style in 2009. You never know what can happen in the future, but playing again with those long pants is not going to happen. I’m too old for that.” He’s still wearing his shorter shorts at the U.S. Open this week, where Nadal faces the possibility of playing Roger Federer for the first time in New York City. They’re set to face each other if they reach the semifinals, though Nadal doesn’t sound too excited about it. “If I am in semifinals, I prefer to play against another [player]’’ Nadal told the NY Post. “It’s obvious, no? I am not that way. Sounds very good, but the real thing I prefer to play against another player, an easier one if it’s possible.” He added, “Of course I understand that’s gonna be great for our history. [It’s] true we played in all [other] Grand Slam finals. We never played here and we are not going to play in the finals. Finals are more special than semifinals.’’We can’t wait to watch this showdown and, of course, we’ll be keeping an eye on the length of Nadal’s shorts."

NASA declared Hopkinsville to be city closest to the epicenter of the August 21 astronomical event, bringing international attention to the city of 32,000 residents.</em> </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a572481e00003d00a74ae0.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jennifer P. BrownThe Corner Coffeehouse in downtown Hopkinsville, Kentucky, has seen a mix of brisk business and slower periods since Amanda and April Huff-McClure opened their shop at the end of March in a restored, two-story brick building next door to city hall.When people talk about downtown revitalization in communities where the old core of a town has struggled to recover from decades of neglect and retail retreat, this is exactly the kind of place they imagine.The regulars get coffee and muffins to go in the morning and head to nearby offices. Others come for lunch and linger with friends. They like the view and the pace. There’s seating for 10 or so customers inside and a few small sidewalk tables next to a large picture window.One block over from the Corner Coffeehouse, I have a small office on the second floor of a law office, and soon after the coffeehouse opened I began talking to Amanda and April about what they expected when thousands of visitors poured into Hopkinsville (pop. 32,000) for the total solar eclipse on August 21. No one was certain what to expect.The city had been marketing itself as Eclipseville, and the welcome sign was out for anyone who wanted to spend a day or longer in the community that NASA had designated as the point of greatest eclipse, or the point where the axis of the moon’s shadow would be closest to Earth during the eclipse. The exact spot was actually several miles from Hopkinsville in a farm field near Cerulean, a tiny community straddling the Christian-Trigg county line in flat, fertile Western Kentucky.But Hopkinsville had been tagged as the city closest to the eclipse epicenter 10 years earlier, and the city was not about to miss the opportunity for a multi-million-dollar tourism boom and the potential for worldwide exposure. And with a new mayor who’d previously served as president of the Christian County Chamber of Commerce, the community got serious about sprucing up and preparing for company on a grand scale.In the months leading up to the eclipse, crowd estimates kept creeping up. The city took reservations for camping spots and one-day viewing sites at several parks. Two whiskey distilleries in the county rented out space for overnighters and promoted big plans to celebrate with spirits, musical entertainment and food trucks.Almost everyone I knew had people coming to stay overnight. It was going to be a homecoming like Hopkinsville had never seen. While the town got a good scrubbing, locals like me planted more flowers, pulled out air mattresses and filled up chest freezers with barbecued pork. My husband and I kept buying more craft beer, hoping to satisfy every taste for a few dozen guests we expected. Then we packed in ice cream, brownies, hot dogs and pizza for our five grandchildren. We bought ice early and stocked up on paper towels and toilet paper. One day I found an excuse to procrastinate on a writing project and devoted hours to creating the ultimate eclipse musical playlist on Spotify.The local museum paid a crew to re-paint the historic town clock, and the county historian, William T. Turner, devoted himself to winding the clock’s gears every few days so it would keep correct time. The city got busy installing window tint and eclipse logos in vacant downtown storefronts. Someone put an eclipse sign over an old “Sexy and Sassy” sign for a shoe store than had been out of business for years.Even the Crime Stoppers most wanted posters of two little-known fugitives ― which hung for years in one of downtown’s most haggard-looking buildings ― came down. Then the week before the eclipse, a couple hundred people turned out at dusk to see the ceremonial lighting of a new marquee on the 89-year-old Alhambra Theatre.As we got closer to the big day, Brooke Jung, the eclipse coordinator and marketing expert the city had hired a year earlier, said it looked like 100,000 was a conservative estimate for visitors in the city and county combined. Local officials urged residents to buy groceries, top off their gas tanks and get cash before the crowds arrived.As it turned out, nothing could prepare the coffeehouse owners for the crowds they would serve. Amanda and April worked from 5:30 a.m. until 10 p.m. four days straight – only taking an hour break on Eclipse Day, which fell on a Monday. They closed long enough to walk across the street to Grace Episcopal Church, where they’d been married last year, to meet up with friends and experience totality, when the moon blocked the sun for 2 minutes and 40 seconds. Visitors began arriving on the Friday before the eclipse, the same day the city shut down a few streets for a three-day festival downtown.“Friday was a good day, but the intensity came in waves,” Amanda told me. “Saturday was amazing. Sunday, honestly, was what we were expecting and planning for – breakneck speed most of the day and great numbers. April and I said at the end of the day that Sunday was the most we could do in a day. And then on Monday, we doubled that. Monday was insane for us. We got the last available parking space in the free public parking at 5:45 a.m. We had people banging on the glass wanting to know when we were going to open by about 6:15.“At 6:30, when April unlocked the doors, there was a line of people that started clapping and cheering. Most of the morning there was a line of people out the door. It was crazy intense and I honestly don’t know how we physically maintained the pace.”The eclipse brought an estimated $30 million in spending and a crowd of roughly 150,000, Mayor Carter Hendricks told me two days after the eclipse. (That is an early estimate. City officials were still studying aerial photographs to gauge the crowd.)The weekend before the eclipse many locals were surprised that traffic wasn’t more congested. Tents had popped up everywhere but getting around town was relatively easy. Outside of downtown, stores and restaurants were not as busy as many expected.The actual number of eclipse-chasers who’d come to Hopkinsville and Christian County wasn’t clear until Monday afternoon when most of the visitors tried to leave around the same time. Roads leading out of town, including U.S. 41 and the Pennyrile Parkway, snarled to a crawl for hours that evening. State workers on ATVs drove up and down medians to hand out bottled water to people stuck in traffic. Part of my family sat for two hours on the parkway, the main route north, and eventually gave up and came back to spend another night. Other drivers stuck it out and said it took 10 hours or longer to get to Lexington, Kentucky, a drive that normally takes just over three hours.Two days after the eclipse, the Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper devoted most of its front page to a story praising Hopkinsville for the preparation and hospitality extended to such a large gathering.Photographer Michael Clevenger had been especially charmed by my friend Margaret Prim, the executive director of the Pennyroyal Arts Council, after she let the Courier-Journal staffers use the Alhambra Theatre on Main Street for their base during the long, hot weekend.“We had planned for the eclipse for a month. Hopkinsville planned for it for a decade,” Clevenger wrote. “In the end you can plan for portable toilets and traffic flow and campgrounds for 200,000 of your closest friends. But you can’t buy helpfulness. You can rent hospitable. You can’t fake friendly. Hopkinsville figured out how to host the world but remembered the intangible things that make us uniquely Kentucky. And it showed.“The sun and the moon may have stolen the show in Hopkinsville on August 21, but Hopkinsville stole my heart.”Some of the news reports I read and heard in the months leading up to the Great American Eclipse described Hopkinsville as a “sleepy town” or a “tiny town.” In some reports, my hometown came off as almost idyllic.Hopkinsville is the seventh largest city in Kentucky and the most racially diverse community outside of the two largest cities, Louisville and Lexington. About 32 percent of the city’s residents are African-American. Many of our residents have lived around the world while serving in the 101st Airborne Division based at Fort Campbell, which is a 15-minute drive from downtown Hopkinsville.The city’s median household income is $34,600, and 22 percent of our residents live in poverty, according to the Census Bureau.I’ve known Hopkinsville, warts and all, as a nearly lifelong resident. My family moved to the city in 1966, when I was 4 years old. From 1986 to 2016, I was a reporter and eventually an editor and columnist for the local daily, the Kentucky New Era.In 30 years with my hometown newspaper, I’d picked up some skills in grousing. I was wary of most announcements that came from the Chamber of Commerce, I’d sparred with many public officials who wanted to side-step unflattering situations, and I knew on cue when economic development folks with shiny ground-breaking shovels would proclaim, “It’s a great day in Hopkinsville.” The slogan became such a cliché, some of us in the newsroom threatened to have it printed on T-shirts. This was part of my healthy skepticism.These days, if I have a blind spot for civic pride, it rests in downtown Hopkinsville. Several new businesses have taken hold in the past decade, including my favorite lunch spot, The Place ― A Local Eatery, where I eat at a counter tucked back in the kitchen of an old storefront building on Sixth Street. Next door is Griffin’s Studio, a shop where three of my grandchildren spent a week at art camp this summer. Up on Main Street, Quincy’s restaurant serves Southern fare, the Black Patch has steaks and seafood, and the Main Street Tavern has pizza.The Hopkinsville Brewing Co. on Fifth Street is another new spot. The afternoon of the eclipse, my husband and I sat outside the brewery and talked about local history with two men from Cincinnati who’d spent the weekend camping and waiting for the moon to turn the landscape dark.Hendricks, the mayor, told me he hopes regional visitors like those come back.But even while local leaders look to market Hopkinsville to out-of-towners, I think the eclipse gave locals something I haven’t seen in a long time – if ever – in my hometown.I think people wanted a reason to feel good about Hopkinsville. Getting ready for company and then reveling in the party did something significant for the town’s self-esteem.Now if we can just keep those wanted fugitive posters out of the heart of downtown, if more entrepreneurs like Amanda and April see value in downtown, if more people want to spruce up and dig in, then I’ll believe this turn in Hopkinsville’s fortunes is real. I’ll believe it’s about much more than a solar eclipse."

It consists of 14 statements of affirmation and denial relating to human sexuality.For instance, Article 7 of the statement reads:WE AFFIRM that self-conception as male or female should be defined by God’s holy purposes in creation and redemption as revealed in Scripture.Nashville mayor Megan Barry tweeted Tuesday criticizing the coalition for using her city’s name in a statement of exclusion.Among the signers were many prominent and influential evangelical leaders, including Steve Gaines, president of The Southern Baptist Convention, Russell Moore, president of the SBC’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, Albert Mohler, president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. Perkins was also reportedly one of the architect’s behind President Donald Trump’s ban on transgender service members.CBMW president Denny Burk said the statement aimed to mitigate Christians’ “confusion” over issues of sexuality.“The spirit of our age does not delight in God’s good design of male and female. Consequently, confusion reigns over some of the most basic questions of our humanity,” he told HuffPost. “The aim of The Nashville Statement is to shine a light into the darkness – to declare the goodness of God’s design in our sexuality and in creating us as male and female.”Though several Christian denominations, including the Episcopal Church and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), have affirmed same-sex marriage in recent years, the Southern Baptist Convention has been squarely and unwaveringly opposed to anything other than heterosexual marriage.In a preamble, the leaders explained that the document is a response to what they feel to be an “increasingly post-Christian” culture.“This secular spirit of our age presents a great challenge to the Christian church,” they wrote.But critics in the Christian community noted the bizarre and even “callous” timing of the document’s release and warned that it would do more harm than good.Brandan Robertson, a Christian pastor and LGBTQ activist who helped organize a protest at the Ethics and Religious Liberty Conference last week, said the statement will further marginalize sexual and gender minorities in the church.“This is indeed yet another sad day in the history of the modern evangelical movement,” Robertson told HuffPost.“The most heart breaking part of this statement is that this document will promote and perpetuate teachings that will cause verifiable psychological harm to LGBT+ Christian youth in churches around the world.”He added: “I am confident that future generations will look back at this resolution and see it as despicable as we do former Southern Baptist statements promoting slavery and segregation.”But the pastor added that he was heartened by the fact that Americans, overall, including all U.S. Christian groups, are becoming increasingly accepting of the LGBTQ community.Robertson said: “More and more Christian leaders are stepping forward to proclaim the very opposite of the Nashville Statement, that LGBT+ people are beautifully and wonderfully created in the diverse image of our expansive God and are welcomed just as we are into our place in the Church and in society.”"
34,ENTERTAINMENT,Female Musicians Are Taking The Veil,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/female-musician-veil_us_598b7b98e4b0a66b8bb0df0f,"Why the garment with a rich symbolic history is popping up in pop culture thanks to artists like SZA, Bat for Lashes and Beyonce.",2017-08-29,"Banks performs during Lollapalooza 2017 at Grant Park on Aug. 5, 2017, in Chicago, Illinois.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598b7f032200002d001a53f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During a performance at Glastonbury Festival last year, dream pop singer Natasha Khan, better known as Bat for Lashes, emerged onstage wearing a white, floor-length wedding gown and a veil to match. Her movements appeared muffled, ritualistic, almost ghostlike, as if she was Miss Havisham singing karaoke to a packed house. “But what does it mean?” Khan sang. “The bad things that I’ve seen.” Slowly and purposefully she pulled the veil back from her face. The crowd cheered at the great reveal. In his essay “Ways of Seeing,” art critic John Berger argues that “men act and women appear,” that being seen is a fundamental and perpetual element of the feminine experience. “Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at,” he wrote.There are many ways to disrupt this stereotypical relationship between the man who watches and the woman who’s watched, and one time-tested method is donning a veil, a cascading mask that separates the wearer from the world. Veils hold centuries of symbolic references in their folds, stemming from a variety of cultures and religions. In the past couple of years, they’ve made a peculiar resurgence on the pop culture scene, as female musicians in pop, R&B and hip-hop have cloaked their faces in dripping fabric, both in videos and on stage. Musicians like Bat for Lashes, Banks, Princess Nokia, Beyonce and SZA have each resuscitated and warped the garment’s storied associations with femininity, the sacred and the profane. On her 2016 album “The Bride,” Bat for Lashes assumes the identity of a fictitious, lovesick bride whose groom-to-be dies in a car crash en route to their wedding. In the record’s first song, “I Do,” Khan revels in the fantasy of marital bliss that so many young women indulge. Yet by the third song, “In God’s House,” the groom hasn’t shown up and Khan knows something has gone horribly awry. “Through this veil they can’t see / The fog of death envelop me,” she sings.In the video for the song, Khan wears an infrared cocktail dress with a retro veil and a caramel fur coat. She treks through a desolate desert landscape to visit a shrine to her late fiancé. As the sky turns violet, Khan removes her veil and waves it above her head, the tulle trembling in the wind. At times the fabric blocks the camera’s lens, clouding the viewer’s perspective in a red haze. The scene couples the veil’s nuptial duties with another of its more macabre functions ― as a symbol of mourning. In a single album, Khan explores the veil’s knotted relationship with betrothal and independence, morality and mortality, love and death. These symbolic associations are prevalent in Western culture today; brides often don a white veil as a symbol of chastity and virginity, which the groom peels back as part of the marriage ceremony. Alternately, black veils serve as a marker of grief, providing the mourner a semblance of privacy. One of the earliest written references to veils is found in Middle Assyrian law code, written between 1400 and 1100 BCE, which describes the accessory’s purpose: to distinguish women who were “respectable” ― and thus should be hidden from view ― from those who weren’t. In Ancient Greece and Rome, married women similarly wore veils to visualize their subservience to their husbands. Thousands of years have passed and veils have retained their relevance. Some Muslim women ― and, to a lesser degree, men ― wear veils as symbols of modesty and privacy, a layer to separate the self from the divine, a practice similar to those of devout Jewish and Christian communities.Regardless of cultural and religious specifics, though, veils are most often reserved for women, whether their beauty is considered too sacred for everyday life, or too profane. For Khan, the veil makes the bride; removing it becomes an act of liberation. Yet other artists opt to contort the veil’s symbolic reference points, taking comfort in its coverage as a sort of disguise. Singer-songwriter Banks, for example, incorporates sheer black veils into her performances and music videos ― specifically, veils that resemble those worn by Isis, an ancient Egyptian goddess of fertility. Banks rarely performs in anything other than all black, yielding a witchy aesthetic that appeals to young women seeking power beyond patriarchal structures. “And to think you would get me to the altar,” Banks sings on her second album, appropriately titled “The Altar,” patronizing an ex-lover who, she sings, kept a limiting grip on her.In this verse, Banks uses altar as a stand-in for wedding. Yet as an album title, the follow-up to her debut “Goddess,” “altar” takes on a more ambiguous, occult tenor. The altar transforms from a site of marriage to a grander space for worship ― likely, worship of Banks, the goddess herself. And so does the veil. When Banks emerges onstage draped in black gauze, powerful and stormy, she recalls the image of a pristine bride only to contradict it completely. Rather than removing her wedding sheath, she dyes it black and writhes beneath it, scorning those who hindered her growth. She adopts the veil as a sort of mask, containing a wearer with a spiritual force so powerful it must be buffered. She becomes the goddess of Isis, a creature defined by mystery and power. Another artist to weave references to altars, veils and spirituality into her music and performances is rapper Princess Nokia. In her recently released video for “Brujas,” a woman stands in the ocean draped in a turquoise veil, an homage to Yemayá, a figure in Santería and Yoruba religions, who, as the mystical queen of the sea, represents motherhood. Her arms undulate like the water as singer Djali Cepeda Brown sings an indigenous song as introduction. Then the beat kicks in with the syrupy incantation: “I’m your supreme, I’m your supreme.” Nokia’s verses pay homage to womanhood, witchcraft and her Afro-Latina heritage. “We is them ghetto witches,” she begins. “Speaking in tongue bitches / Fall on the floor / Got sage on the door.” Like Banks, Nokia aligns the veil with an occult tradition, though hers is tethered to the Yoruba. Her chorus declares, “Orisha, my altar / Got coins on the counter,” referencing the religion’s Supreme Divinity.Of course, in the world of pop culture, most music fans worship at the altar of Beyonce. It’s not surprising, then, that one of the most iconic veils in recent pop cultural memory was worn when the queen announced her pregnancy back in February. Beyonce wore a transparent sea foam green veil with a bra and boy shorts in a now legendary photograph by Awol Erizku. It didn’t take long after the picture spread for art critics to draw comparisons between the singer’s blueish veil and that worn by the Virgin Mary in countless art historical representations. Fabric and cloth, and the very act of sewing, are symbols central to Mary’s role in the Bible, summarized by the belief that, in giving birth to Jesus, she “gave the divine a bodily form in which to cloth itself on earth.” To this day, the Veil of the Virgin is deemed a Christian relic with great significance. The shroud represents meekness and humility, but also, motherhood and the immense power possessed within it. When, after giving birth to twins, Beyonce shared a photo of them for the first time, she again sported an aquamarine veil, though this time the tissue was pulled back to reveal her face. At the 2017 Grammy’s, Beyonce wore another veil ― this one opaque, beaded and gold. The look combines Catholic iconography with references to Yoruba tradition, blurring the line between belief systems to conjure a stirring image of matriarchal power. Today, weddings aside, Muslim women are the most prominent group to incorporate veils into their everyday lives. The hijab ― one manifestation of the veil, along with niqab, burqa, abaya, khimar, chador ― is described in the Quran “not as an article of clothing but something akin to a curtain or ‘separation’ that allows for privacy,” according to The New York Times. R&B singer SZA rocked a veil (though, none of the veils or headscarves listed above) in the music video for her song “Drew Barrymore,” an ode to the ’90s romcom heroine. Singing the song’s chorus in a laundromat, SZA wears a baby pink fishnet shroud tucked beneath a broad-brimmed purple hat. Aside from these accessories, she dons only high-heeled shoes as she kneels, curling her body into a ball, apparently recreating a Mark-Meir Paluksht photograph. SZA grew up, as she described, “orthodox Muslim. Very sheltered, very conservative.” She wore a hijab until 9/11, when Islamophobia spread amongst her classmates and led to taunting and bullying at school. “At school, I wanted to fit in so I would take my hijab off,” she told Complex in 2013. “I asked my mom if I could go school shopping, rather than let my dad because I would just wear long skirts or overalls everyday.”In her video, SZA is nude, a stark shift from the modest dress code expected of many observant Muslim women. And yet the veil remains, a symbol of her faith, executed without apology or compromise. Whether or not SZA’s outfit choice self-consciously pays tribute to her Muslim upbringing, there is something undeniably powerful about its presence, and little else. It’s a curious time for veils to reemerge so strongly in pop culture, given the increase in hostility and violence toward Muslim women who wear headscarves for religious purposes. It feels off when certain women don veils and set trends, while others risk their safety doing the same. But on a certain level, pop culture has always served as a safe space for a select few to enact the daily fears and fantasies of the rest of us. Let’s return, then, to Berger’s words ― “men act and women appear” ― not as an insurmountable truth but a widespread belief. By Berger’s logic, men paint and women are painted; men are artists, women muses. Yet while Renaissance painters may have been able to work hidden from view, for contemporary musicians, being seen is an integral part of making art. By donning veils, female artists both erase and illuminate their own visibility, emphasizing the power of their image that can enchant, seduce and inspire. “Women constantly meet glances which act like mirrors reminding them of how they look or how they should look,” Berger writes. “Behind every glance there is judgment.” The veil disrupts this expectation, denying the male viewer the opportunity to judge the female artist, freeing her up to act as well as to appear. And to embrace the power in both. "

The actor recently wrote a scathing op-ed on Billboard, published Monday, in response to MTV’s major snub of “Despacito” at the VMAs. But Leguizamo wasn’t just concerned about the uber-popular single’s recognition, but about how its dismissal is something all too familiar for Latinos in mainstream media. “The song, not the video, was a late, perfunctory inclusion as the song of the summer at the MTV Video Music Awards,” he wrote. “We must ask ourselves, is this a blatant omission? A proactive and decisive stand against the Spanish language? With 3 billion views, this historic song and video triumphs over the likes of, with all due respect, Beyoncé or Taylor Swift, but this is only one example of exclusion.”The actor said that in the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s, Latinos perhaps felt it was ignorance that prevented them from reaching their potential in mainstream television, film and music ― but he now feels that justification is not enough.″‘They don’t know better’ doesn’t work in the age of the internet, where analytics and response rates are easier to source than a McDonald’s cheeseburger,” Leguizamo writes in the op-ed. “So why are we still subjected to the ‘Latin only’ corner of the room?”“While this is a slap in the face to Latin artists who work so hard to hold a mirror up to humanity as a whole (and not just Latin people), it’s far more detrimental to our youth,” he added. “From where does the Latin youth draw role models and experiences, when even the Latin artists, celebrities and athletes still stay silent?”Leguizamo emphasized the importance of Latino artists refusing to settle for being invited to participate, instead of speaking up and demanding a seat at the table. The actor ultimately urged Latinos to take action, both by supporting other Latinos with their consumer power and by speaking out. The Colombian-American star has been a vocal advocate of real diversity in Hollywood for years, and has written and created one-man shows based on his own experiences growing up Latino. In 2016 alone, Leguizamo wrote two op-eds, in USA Today and The New York Times, about the invisibility of Latinos both in Hollywood and in U.S. history. ″‘Latinos don’t want to see movies about other Latinos,’ a studio executive once said to me,” Leguizamo wrote in USA Today in February 2016. “But my people love movies so much, we’ll even see stories about white people. My long track record — sorry but not sorry for the immodesty — of selling out theaters across the country demonstrates how badly people of color want to see themselves represented on stage.”To his point, last week, Leguizamo’s latest one-man show, “Latin History for Morons,” announced a limited engagement on Broadway after sold-out, critically-acclaimed off-Broadway performances.

36,THE WORLDPOST,What World War I Can Teach Us About How To Manage The North Korea Crisis,"Andreas Herberg-Rothe, ContributorSenior lecturer, Fulda University of Applied Sciences",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/world-war-north-korea_us_59a4344fe4b06d67e33929d2,We should not delude ourselves with the assumption that peace is the natural state of mankind in our age.,2017-08-29,"King George V in the ruins of Ypres, Belgium, in an undated photo.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a4378824000036004ba132.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FULDA, Germany — Are there lessons to be learned from the devastating conduct and outcome of World War I for our times? Is there only one lesson to be learned — that you can learn nothing from history? Or are we doomed to repeat history if we don’t learn anything from it?These questions are especially important as North Korea continues to escalate a tense standoff in East Asia with provocative nuclear tests and missile launches, the most recent of which flew over northern Japan yesterday.There are many structural similarities between the pre-1914 period in Europe and the current conflicts in Asia. The main aim of many countries in the non-Western world is to be recognized as equals by the leading Western powers, in order to regain their former status as global powers and civilizations that was lost in the process of European and American colonization or hegemony. The desire for recognition is the driving force behind the economic and political rise of Asia. The same was true in the conflict between established, rising and declining powers before World War I.We are again living in an age in which a war between the great powers is viewed as unlikely because it seems to be in no one’s interest, as the outcome of such a war would be so devastating that every party would do the utmost to avoid it. That rationality seems to dominate the assumptions and ways of thinking in our times: the eruption of a global conflict like World War I in Asia, which could lead to the destruction of great parts of Asia, Europe and North America, would be in no one’s interest.But what if conflicts in Asia would not be fought to pursue national interests so much as recognition? What would it mean to be accepted as equal again after the humiliation in the course of European colonization and subsequent American hegemony? Indeed, acknowledgment of past suffering seems to be a trauma in the conscience of many Asian nations. Are those desires irrational or a different kind of rationality that we have to take into account?World War I resulted in the self-destruction of the European powers. It is an important lesson that when military aims and strategies gain priority above meaningful political purposes, a limited conflict can escalate into a nightmare with millions of deaths and unspeakable suffering for which no rational explanation can be found.Perhaps the deepest and most hidden reason for that escalation during World War I was that no party could admit defeat or failure. Over the course of the war, the German Empire’s goals got more and more unrealistic and irrational. The pride, honor and identity of the German Reich prohibited the acknowledgment of defeat and failure. The same was true of Russia, France, England and the Habsburg and Turkish Empires. These empires knew that their rule wouldn’t survive if they had to acknowledge military defeat or failure. Military defeat would have been humiliating. So the empires fought a war for life and death.I do not mean to equate a rising China with the then rising German Empire. But although the actors then and today seem to be quite different, the dynamics generated by the conflict between emerging, rising and declining powers are strikingly comparable.There are good precautionary warnings from World War I for today. The task today is to take precautionary steps in order to ensure that there will be no world war in Asia. Here, Cold War efforts to avoid military conflict between the superpowers (such as the Moscow-Washington direct communication link) could be applied to the current conflicts in Asia. As it stands, Asia’s lack of multilateral institutions to settle disputes, like those created in Europe after 1945, is dangerous.The eminent Chinese scholar Zhang Wei Wei has argued that the world is transforming from a hierarchical international system to a more symmetrical one. And the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel made a similar argument: If there is any progress in history in the long run, it is the transformation of hierarchical societal relations to more symmetrical ones, between and within societies. What we need is a floating balance and harmony between the West and the East.But as Thomas Hobbes once famously noted, the natural state of mankind is not peace, but the war of all against all. We should not delude ourselves with the assumption that peace is the natural state of mankind in our age. As the late Yitzhak Rabin once said: “You don’t make peace with friends. You make it with very unsavory enemies.” The initial proposition of politics is to differentiate friends and foes; its final aim is to mediate between friends and foes, to find a common ground between antagonistic contrasts without eliminating the competition. This might be the most important lesson we should learn from history.And we must not forget the role of luck in geopolitics. As Robert McNamara, the U.S. secretary of defense during the Cuban Missile Crisis, famously noted, it was sheer luck that prevented the escalation of that crisis into a world war: “At the end we lucked out. It was luck that prevented nuclear war. We came that close to nuclear war at the end. ... Rational individuals came that close to total destruction of their societies. And that danger exists today.”In current times, all great powers are using military means to pursue their political and economic interests. We should not allow ourselves to wager that military conflicts and strategies will not lead to the escalation of limited conflicts into global wars."

Some of the worst effects have hit Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city.As of Tuesday morning, the storm had broken the record for the most rainfall in the continental U.S., according to the National Weather Service.The president and first lady Melania Trump made stops in Corpus Christi, near where the storm made landfall, and in Austin, the site of the storm’s emergency response center.Lawmakers and officials updated Trump on the storm during his first stop. The president praised recovery and rescue efforts, but added that “we don’t want to say congratulations. We’ll congratulate each other when it’s all finished.” Trump expressed awe at Harvey’s “epic proportions,” and said officials’ response to the storm could serve as a model for the future.“We want to be looked at in five years, in 10 years from now as, this is the way to do it,” he said. “We want to do it better than ever before.”Trump avoided visiting areas hit hardest by the storm, saying he did not want to disrupt rescue and recovery efforts with the complicated logistics of a presidential visit.“The president wants to be very cautious about making sure that any activity doesn’t disrupt any of the recovery efforts that are still ongoing, which is the reason for the locations we are going here today,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters aboard Air Force One.The trip presents the Trump administration with a major test, as the storm and its aftermath make up perhaps the first crisis that was not of the president’s own making.Trump received criticism for callously responding to the storm, releasing a barrage of other news as the hurricane made landfall on Friday evening, and posting a stream of unrelated tweets throughout the weekend.The tweets that did mention Harvey’s progression often read as self-congratulatory. As the deadly storm dumped torrential rain and stranded residents, Trump appeared to be awestruck by Harvey’s “historic” and “record breaking” nature, praised authorities’ “all out effort” for “going well!” and celebrated the “spirit of the people.”But in scripted comments made during a joint press conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö on Monday, Trump struck a more measured tone — although he again noted the “epic” and “historic” storm, saying “there’s probably never been anything like this.”“I want to begin today by extending my thoughts and prayers for those affected by Hurricane Harvey and the catastrophe of flooding and all of the other difficulties that they’re currently going through in Houston, in southeast Texas,” he said in his introductory remarks.“Recovery will be a long and difficult road, and the federal government stands ready, willing and able to support that effort,” he added, pledging to pass federal funding for recovery efforts.But Trump, a former reality television personality, also mentioned the “ratings” that came from the storm when defending the timing of pardoning controversial former Sheriff Joe Arpaio on Friday night.“I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally,” he said. “You know, the hurricane was just starting.”Trump again referred to the television coverage on Tuesday, praising Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long as “a man who really has become very famous on television in the last couple of days.”Outside the briefing, he addressed supporters, climbing up a ladder and marveling: “What a crowd, what a turnout,” he said, according to White House pool reporters.Trump also promised Texans that “we’re going to get you back and operating immediately.” His statement contradicted other authorities, like Long, who said Sunday that FEMA’s recovery efforts could take years.“We want him to see and understand the enormous challenges that Texans have faced and the need for the aid that he’s providing,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) told CNN from the tarmac as Air Force One landed in Corpus Christi. “He’s a champion of Texas and a champion of helping us rebuild, and I think we will hear that commitment.”In an email to supporters on Tuesday, Trump’s re-election campaign encouraged donations to the Red Cross, Salvation Army, United Way and animal rescue groups, according to The Associated Press.Trump received another briefing on Tuesday from state officials at the Texas Department of Public Safety’s Emergency Operations Center in Austin. He again remarked on the scale of the damage.“The sad thing is that this is long-term. Nobody’s ever seen anything this long. Nobody’s seen this much water,” he said. “Probably, there’s never been something so expensive in our country’s history. There’s never been something so historic in terms of damage.”The president has said he may return to the region this weekend to visit Louisiana. The state’s residents are bracing for torrential rainfall from Harvey’s remnants. On Monday, Trump issued a disaster declaration for the Louisiana and authorized it to receive emergency federal aid. He had issued such a declaration for Texas ahead of the storm last week. The storm’s progression changed dramatically over the weekend.The relentless rain and rising floodwaters have complicated already perilous recovery and rescue efforts across the region. Since Monday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been conducting controlled releases of dams, as the water has reached record levels.“We are deeply concerned about those dams,” Abbott said Tuesday on “Fox & Friends.” “This is going to be a minute-by-minute process.”A levee in Brazoria County, which is south of Houston, breached on Tuesday, forcing further evacuations. Authorities warned that other levees and reservoirs in the area could breach, as the rainfall is expected to continue throughout the week.First responders have focused on rescuing people in life-threatening conditions, and hospitals have taken major precautions, evacuating patients out of flooded facilities and sealing off low-lying areas inundated in water.FEMA has estimated that more than 30,000 people will be displaced due to the storm and seek temporary shelters.The George R. Brown Convention Center in downtown Houston, which is being used as a temporary shelter, received 9,000 evacuees, according to local news reports. Its official capacity is 5,000 people. Long, the FEMA administrator, stressed that the situation was under control.“We’re very aware of the issues at the convention center. But let me be clear: This is not the Superdome,” he said Tuesday, referring to the disastrous evacuation efforts during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. “They have food, security, I have an incident management team inside the city of Houston as we speak.”Jet George, 44, of Houston, didn’t lose his home. Hee wanted to help those who did, so he went downtown to donate bags of jackets and other supplies at the convention center.“We’re all kind of swamped in together,” he told HuffPost. “This is crazy. I’ve lived here all my life and never seen anything like this ... we were lucky so we thought we’d bring things they said they needed.”Andy Campbell contributed reporting from Houston.This is a developing story.

Greg Abbott (R) told CNN from the tarmac as Air Force One landed in Corpus Christi. “He’s a champion of Texas and a champion of helping us rebuild, and I think we will hear that commitment.”In an email to supporters on Tuesday, Trump’s re-election campaign encouraged donations to the Red Cross, Salvation Army, United Way and animal rescue groups, according to The Associated Press.Trump received another briefing on Tuesday from state officials at the Texas Department of Public Safety’s Emergency Operations Center in Austin. He again remarked on the scale of the damage.“The sad thing is that this is long-term. Nobody’s ever seen anything this long. Nobody’s seen this much water,” he said. “Probably, there’s never been something so expensive in our country’s history. There’s never been something so historic in terms of damage.”The president has said he may return to the region this weekend to visit Louisiana. The state’s residents are bracing for torrential rainfall from Harvey’s remnants. On Monday, Trump issued a disaster declaration for the Louisiana and authorized it to receive emergency federal aid. He had issued such a declaration for Texas ahead of the storm last week. The storm’s progression changed dramatically over the weekend.The relentless rain and rising floodwaters have complicated already perilous recovery and rescue efforts across the region. Since Monday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been conducting controlled releases of dams, as the water has reached record levels.“We are deeply concerned about those dams,” Abbott said Tuesday on “Fox & Friends.” “This is going to be a minute-by-minute process.”A levee in Brazoria County, which is south of Houston, breached on Tuesday, forcing further evacuations. Authorities warned that other levees and reservoirs in the area could breach, as the rainfall is expected to continue throughout the week.First responders have focused on rescuing people in life-threatening conditions, and hospitals have taken major precautions, evacuating patients out of flooded facilities and sealing off low-lying areas inundated in water.FEMA has estimated that more than 30,000 people will be displaced due to the storm and seek temporary shelters.The George R. Brown Convention Center in downtown Houston, which is being used as a temporary shelter, received 9,000 evacuees, according to local news reports. Its official capacity is 5,000 people. Long, the FEMA administrator, stressed that the situation was under control.“We’re very aware of the issues at the convention center. But let me be clear: This is not the Superdome,” he said Tuesday, referring to the disastrous evacuation efforts during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. “They have food, security, I have an incident management team inside the city of Houston as we speak.”Jet George, 44, of Houston, didn’t lose his home. Hee wanted to help those who did, so he went downtown to donate bags of jackets and other supplies at the convention center.“We’re all kind of swamped in together,” he told HuffPost. “This is crazy. I’ve lived here all my life and never seen anything like this ... we were lucky so we thought we’d bring things they said they needed.”Andy Campbell contributed reporting from Houston.This is a developing story.

I thought it would be there and be a place where I could make my art, my life’s work, a record of what I’ve done with my life. It’s not. It’s gone. The streamers killed it.That’s a hard one for me. Much harder for young artists trying to make their mark.I have been trying to just keep going. Been making records with the help of my friends and the kindness of patronage, but it’s just because it’s what I do, what I have always done, what I love to do. As it stands right now there’s not much future in it. Lots of people are trying to find new ways: subscription, clubs, or some magical way to watermark a digital file so it can’t be copied. Something. I’ve not seen a real answer come up yet. But I’ve had a new bad thought: What if we lose live performance? Impossible you say? I admit it’s a weird thing for a guitar player to come up with. But the bomb at the Ariana Grande concert in England. The bomb at the Boston Marathon, the shootings into crowds in theaters and clubs, the cars driven into crowds. The fact that large groups of people are a target makes me wonder: What happens when artists and venues no longer can get insurance?The venue has to have it, so does the promoter and so do I. Possibly you did not know that but yes, I believe all touring artists have to have insurance at anything above a club level. And the big shows have a LOT of insurance and it costs a great deal. I think many places have laws requiring insurance as well. So what if you simply can’t get it or it’s so drastically expensive that the profit motive is gone. What happens then? What happens when local law enforcement just says no concerts, too dangerous.Is Bruce going to play clubs? Is Alicia? What about the Stones? Will they come up with a trick to insure themselves? Live Nation is not about to start doing free shows in the park. What about this? If I’m wrong I’d really like to stop worrying. But what if I’m not wrong?And terrorism is obviously a problem beyond concerts, but I believe that music is a lifting force in society. I believe that people attending a concert together – or any public experience with art – brings us closer and helps us to find common ground with people we may otherwise think we had nothing common with. To lose that would be a detriment to our shared humanity. Here’s to hoping we won’t have to face that day."

In an Aug. 28 interview, the “Big Little Lies” actress spoke with WWD about being a single mother to her two children and, of course, “Wonder Woman.”“I loved seeing it — and I really loved seeing it with my 12-year-old daughter,” Dern said of the box-office smash “Wonder Woman.” “People are like, ‘Well, you can’t turn this kind of film into a statement.’ It’s like, no. You infiltrate every story that you tell. It can be a traditional movie, but you respond to something different.”Dern added that she got to do just that for her role in the 1993 “Jurassic Park” opposite of Jeff Goldblum. “We did it on ‘Jurassic Park’ ― there was a rather feminist line in response to something Jeff Goldblum says about ‘man creates dinosaurs, and dinosaurs eat man.’ Something like that. And then I look back and say the line, ‘Yeah ― and woman inherits the earth’ and that was such a big deal,” Dern said. “It was like here it is, we’re in this formulaic, big movie and it’s this fabulous, fun, feminist moment.”Watch the “Jurassic Park” clip Dern is referring to below. Dern explained to WWD that 12-year-old girls, like her daughter, were watching “Jurassic Park” and heard that subtle feminist line ― and that’s important. “Then there are 12-year-old girls watching the movie and they hear that, and it’s one line,” Dern said. “For years it was ‘Oh, well that’s more for boys, because it’s a dinosaur movie,’ and that’s what they used to say about ‘Star Wars,’ and now because there are female icons in it, all the girls want to see it as much as boys.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a4249e1e00003c00c5f966.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Myanmar security forces intensified operations against Rohingya insurgents on Monday, police and other sources said, following three days of clashes with militants in the worst violence involving Myanmar’s Muslim minority in five years.The fighting - triggered by coordinated attacks on Friday by insurgents wielding sticks, knives and crude bombs on 30 police posts and an army base - has killed 104 people and led to the flight of large numbers of Muslim Rohingya and Buddhist civilians from the northern part of Rakhine state.The violence marks a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since October, when a similar but much smaller series of Rohingya attacks on security posts prompted a brutal military response dogged by allegations of rights abuses.The treatment of about 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya in mainly Buddhist Myanmar has emerged as the biggest challenge for national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has condemned the attacks and commended the security forces.The Nobel peace laureate has been accused by some Western critics of not speaking out on behalf of the long-persecuted minority, and of defending the army’s sweep after the October attacks.The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar and classified as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots there that go back centuries, with communities marginalized and occasionally subjected to communal violence.“Now the situation is not good. Everything depends on them - if they’re active, the situation will be tense,” said police officer Tun Hlaing from Buthidaung township, referring to the Rohingya insurgents.Rohingya villagers make up the majority in the area.“We split into two groups, one will provide security at police outposts and the other group is going out for clearance operation with the military,” he said.A Buthidaung-based reporter, citing police sources directly involved in events, said three police posts in northern Buthidaung had been surrounded by Rohingya insurgents.Many houses had been burning since Sunday in parts of neighboring Maungdaw town, another journalist and a military source in Maungdaw told Reuters.A Rohingya villager in the area said the army attacked three hamlets in the Kyee Kan Pyin village group with shotguns and other weapons, before torching houses.“Everything is on fire,” he said by phone. “Now I’m in the fields with the people, we’re running away.”A military source in Rakhine state confirmed that houses were burned in the area but blamed the insurgents, who he said opened fire when soldiers came to find them and clear landmines.The insurgents fled, he said, adding there were no casualties.The Myanmar military reported clashes over the weekend involving hundreds of insurgents, taking the death toll to at least 104, the majority militants, plus 12 members of the security forces and several civilians.There were no official updates from the army or the government on Monday.REFUGEES STRANDEDThe unrest has exposed the dark side of Myanmar’s historic opening: an unleashing of ethnic hatred that was suppressed during 49 years of strict military rule that ended when the generals stepped back from direct rule in 2011.The following year, hundreds of people, most of them Rohingya, were killed in communal clashes in Rakhine state and about 140,000 people were displaced.In neighboring Bangladesh on Monday, border guards tried to push back refugees stranded in no man’s land near the village of Gumdhum. Reuters reporters have heard gun fire from the Myanmar side in the last three days.A Bangladesh foreign ministry official told reporters Bangladesh was willing to work with Myanmar to crack down on the insurgents.“The main purpose is to ensure Myanmar can’t accuse us of harboring them to use against them,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly to media.An Islamist group called the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which Myanmar has declared a terrorist organization, claimed responsibility for the Friday attacks. It was also behind the violence in October.In a video posted online on Monday, ARSA leader Ata Ullah, flanked by two gun-toting men in masks, warned Myanmar against “oppressing” Rohingya and vowed to keep fighting to protect the rights of the community. Rohingya have been fleeing Myanmar since the early 1990s and there are now about 400,000 in Bangladesh, which has said no new refugees will be allowed in.Bangladeshi police threatened refugees already in the country with arrest if they help new arrivals, refugee sources said.“How can we go back there? Just to get killed?” asked Mujibur Rahman, standing on the border.Nevertheless, an estimated 5,000 people have crossed into Bangladesh in the past few days, with more than 1,000 coming early on Monday, according to Rohingya refugees in camps in the border district of Cox’s Bazar.Myanmar has urged Rohingya civilians to cooperate with security forces, assuring those with without ties to the insurgents they would not be affected.The government has evacuated thousands of non-Muslim villagers from the north of Rakhine state to towns, monasteries and police stations. About 500 people arrived in the state capital, Sittwe, on Monday, the government said.“A lot of Kalar were coming and we had to run away,” said Nyo Nyo Win, 52, using a racial slur for Rohingya. “They followed us and we ran and ran.”(Additional reporting by Krishna N.

Tures, ContributorProfessor of Political Science, LaGrange College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/actually-academics-and-athletics-do-mix-pretty-well_us_59a442d9e4b0a62d0987b10a,Starting UCLA QB Josh Rosen gave an interview to Bleacher Report where he claimed that football and school don’t go together.,2017-08-28,<p>Picture is from a Division III Football Game.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a4437c24000038004ba160.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since Rutgers played Princeton in the first college football game back in 1869, college athletes have been splitting time between the classroom and contests on the field or at an indoor facility. And since the 1860s, such players in college, and even high school, have had to labor under the label “dumb jock.” This generally false insult is now being advanced by a starting football player and sportswriter for reasons that are unclear.Starting UCLA QB Josh Rosen gave an interview to Bleacher Report where he claimed that “football and school” don’t go together. “They just don’t. Trying to do both is like trying to do two full-time jobs ... Human beings don’t belong in school with our schedules. No one in their right mind should have a football player’s schedule and go to school.”When Matt Hayes, Bleacher Report’s reporter, pointed out players who graduated in three years, Rosen replied, “I’m not knocking what those guys accomplished … but certain schools are easier than others.” The economics major went on to say, “If I wanted to graduate in three years, I’d just get a sociology major,” showing that overconfidence that marred his sophomore year.Yes, being an athlete, any athlete (football or any other collegiate sport) is hard. Here’s a good lesson: Life is hard. College is a challenge. It should be. It’s preparing you for something bigger than high school, and is designed to help you in the NFL well beyond your NFL career, if you get there, and for however long it lasts (which is why “Wonderlic” tests are part of the process). It is designed to be earned, not handed to you because you are a talented quarterback.At our college, we did a study of grades of athletes and non-athletes. The athletes slightly outperformed non-athletes. Whenever I have an athlete come to me, interested in majoring, I think it’s a good thing, just as much as a student government senator or member of the chess club. In fact, those who are part of any campus organization tend to be focused, and recognize the value of discipline and hard work. Well, at least most of them do. I wish I had a column just devoted to their successes in business, law, government, education, and even coaching.Yet Mr. Rosen has a major enabler in columnist Pat Forde, who calls Rosen’s words “the truth” several times in column, as if saying it enough will make it so. In fact, Forde says that Rosen’s “stated truth” will anger administrators, fans and boosters. “It will lead to a series of individual rebuttals from athletes who maxed out their college experience – exceptions to the rule – who competed at a high level while attaining a degree.” Yes, even when you are an athlete who succeeds in academia, you’re just one of the rare exceptions to the “dumb jock” rule.Mr. Rosen complains about how playing football and going to classes is like taking on two full-time jobs. Mr. Forde piles on. “The non-athletic universe is full of college students who change majors – their interests change, or they realize they weren’t good at what they originally intended to do, or whatever. The same rationale obviously can apply to athletes, as well. But there also are time demands, often tied to scholarship money, that force the hands of many student-athletes.”Perhaps the UCLA QB and the sports columnist don’t know this, but many of my students also work a full-time job, in addition to taking their classes. I have students with kids, students who must care for ailing parents, and those who serve in the military, having to miss time with deployments overseas and get shot at. Some have the job, obligations to family and country, and classes to contend with! But they are different from these college athletic critics in one respect: few complain. They know how hard life is, and bite the bullet, and often get the job done.I noticed in the Bleacher Report article that scouts feel Rosen is talented, but often unfocused. I have some advice for him. Instead of lamenting how hard his life is with classes and sports, I would love to see him show some drive and intensity in the academia as well. If he does, I think he’ll convince scouts he can handle the NFL playbook, the harsh glare of the media in professional sports, and the leadership responsibilities that go with being a franchise QB.John A.

I like the Jesus I read about in the New Testament who preaches a message of God’s unequivocating love for all people and calls us to radical justice for the poor and the marginalized. I am a big fan of the Jesus who says “Blessed are the peacemakers” and who assures us that the meek will inherit the earth.Despite my admitted inclination to emphasize the themes of abundant grace and love found in the accounts of Jesus’s teachings, I sometimes have to remind myself not to mistake hippy progressive Jesus with “nice” Jesus. I am not so sure Jesus was necessarily “nice.” In fact, I might go so far as to say that “nice Jesus” is an insidious heresy that has worked its way into many mainstream churches and, more broadly, into our collective consciousness.I often find myself reminding my congregation that Jesus has some pretty harsh words about judgment in the Bible. Jesus does in fact talk about the causes of sin being rooted out and cast into the fires of Hell. Not exactly an image that we associate with hippy progressive Jesus.Perhaps one of the most challenging statements attributed to Jesus is his assertion that he “does not come to bring peace, but a sword.” His mission is about severing families from one another and bringing division as much as unity. “Nice guy Jesus” does not fit this mold.I have been reflecting quite a bit on the heresy of “nice guy Jesus” quite a bit in the days since the tragic and horrifying “unite the right” rally in Charlottesville. I have also been thinking about the importance of Jesus’s words of judgment when I hear the morally repugnant response to the Charlottesville demonstration from Donald Trump. And I realize how seductive, how insidious, the lure of “nice guy Jesus” can be when I read otherwise rational, sensible people defending the notion that “both sides” are to blame for the chaos and violence that erupted on the University of Virginia campus.We live in a society where we put so much value on respectable “niceness” that we have lost the ability to speak those harsh, if uncomfortable, words of judgment and condemnation that are so desperately needed. We have been trained to be fair and strive for even-handedness. We have been trained to seek to pacify differences and disagreements. Even if we do not share in the sentiment that both the demonstrators and counter-protestors share the burden of guilt for what happened in Charlottesville, we may hold ourselves back from directly naming the hatred, the racism, and—quite frankly—the evil that incited the events in the first place. We might see it as not worth getting into an argument with those who disagree with us. After all, should we not seek to maintain peace in our communities and our relationships?That way of thinking, however, is the heresy of the “nice guy Jesus” at work. Peace is worth nothing if it is built on a veneer of civility that hides evils which must be brought to light and named for what they are. There can be no true peace in our country as long as our president makes excuses for those who deny the fundamental humanity of anyone not white, straight, and Christian. There can be no peace in our country while monuments and memorials continue to celebrate historical figures who fought for the right to own their fellow human beings. To name more subtle, and perhaps more uncomfortable truths, there can be no peace in our country while public figures who have the respectability to condemn blatant neo-Nazi demonstrations nevertheless work to suppress voting rights for minorities. There can be no true peace in our country until everyone who looks like me—white, privileged, and comfortable—is willing to admit how much we continue to benefit from societal structures that disenfranchised our black neighbors.So, yes, I am a fan of hippy progressive Jesus. But I do not for a minute pretend that hippy progressive Jesus makes my spiritual life comfortable or easy. That is the job of nice Jesus. Let us avoid being nice and do the hard, inevitably messy work of justice. Let us name the evils that need to be named—those that are obvious in angry crowds bearing swastikas and those which may reside more deeply within ourselves. Hippy progressive Jesus would approve.Previously published as ‘The Messy Work of Justice’ in Reverend Rachel’s SOUL MATTERS column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays:The Darkness of Trump’s America by Maria BehanThe Mental Workload of a Mother by Jami IngledueThe Lessons My Family Have Learned From the Past by Annie Mark-WestfallHow Women Can Help Each Other By Sharing by Irena Ioannou"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a4a7d21e00002800a749e5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan’s northern Hokkaido island into the sea early on Tuesday, prompting warnings for residents to take cover while provoking a sharp reaction from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other leaders.The test, one of the most provocative ever from the reclusive state, appeared to have been of a recently developed intermediate-range Hwasong-12 missile, experts said. It came as U.S. and South Korean forces conduct annual military drills on the peninsula, to which North Korea strenuously objects.Earlier this month, North Korea threatened to fire four Hwasong-12 missiles into the sea near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam after U.S. President Donald Trump warned Pyongyang would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States.North Korea has conducted dozens of ballistic missile tests under young leader Kim Jong Un, the most recent on Saturday, but firing projectiles over mainland Japan is rare.“North Korea’s reckless action is an unprecedented, serious and a grave threat to our nation,” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters.Abe said he spoke to Trump on Tuesday and they agreed to increase pressure on North Korea. Trump also said the United States was “100 percent with Japan”, Abe told reporters.The United Nations Security Council would meet later on Tuesday to discuss the test, diplomats said.Earlier this month, the 15-member Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea in response to two long-range missile launches in July.South Korea’s military said the missile was launched from near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, just before 6 a.m. (2100 GMT Monday) and flew 2,700 km (1,680 miles), reaching an altitude of about 550 km (340 miles).“We will respond strongly based on our steadfast alliance with the United States if North Korea continues nuclear and missile provocations,” the South’s foreign ministry said in a statement.Four South Korean fighter jets bombed a military firing range on Tuesday after President Moon Jae-in asked the military to demonstrate capabilities to counter North Korea.South Korea and the United States had discussed deploying additional “strategic assets” on the Korean peninsula, the presidential Blue House said in a statement, without giving any more details.North Korea remained defiant.“The U.S. should know that it can neither browbeat the DPRK with any economic sanctions and military threats and blackmails nor make the DPRK flinch from the road chosen by itself,” North Korea’s official Rodong Sinmun said later on Tuesday, using the initials of the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.LOUDSPEAKER WARNINGSNorth Korea fired what it said was a rocket carrying a communications satellite into orbit over Japan in 2009 after warning of its plans.

47,POLITICS,"While Democrats Fight For Consumers, Republicans Fight For Those Trying To Screw Consumers","Ian Reifowitz, ContributorProfessor of History at SUNY-Empire State College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/while-democrats-fight-for-consumers-republicans-fight_us_59a400fce4b0a62d0987b0a5,"Who’s out there fighting for you? When you go to vote, and you have to choose between a Democrat and a Republican, ask yourself",2017-08-28,<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is on your side.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a401322400001b004ba07c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Who’s out there fighting for you? When you go to vote, and you have to choose between a Democrat and a Republican, ask yourself which one is going to fight harder for you. For essentially every American — other than those at the tippity-top of the economic pile, perhaps — that simple question has a simple answer: the Democrat. The most effective way to make that argument is through a story. Thankfully, we’ve got a really good one, and it’s one that is making news again.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau protects everyone in this country who deals in some way with financial services companies. If you have a bank account, a mortgage, a retirement or other brokerage account, then the CFPB is there to police the companies you deal with. It also protects people who are in a particularly vulnerable position, like those being pursued by a debt collection agency, or who are in foreclosure, or who rely on payday loans. The CFPB stands up for all those Americans — people who, as individuals, would stand little to no chance of getting redress for abuse committed by the companies with whom they interact.This agency exists almost completely because of Democrats. Elizabeth Warren came up with the idea and proposed it in 2007. In early 2010, she joined the Obama White House, and her job was to oversee the bureau’s development. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (only three GOP senators and three Republican House members voted for the final bill) created the CFPB, and Richard Cordray, former Ohio attorney general, became its first director. Presumably you all know what Elizabeth Warren has been up to since then.This week, Cordray published an opinion piece in the New York Times called “Let Consumers Sue Companies,” in which he laid out the stakes in the latest battle the CFPB is waging. It’s just another of the many this government agency has undertaken on behalf of consumers against those who would rip us off.Cordray begins by discussing what happened when banks lost big money after Home Depot failed to safeguard financial data. Rather than each bank individually filing its own lawsuit, they banded together to file a class action suit. This tactic is much more effective, both in terms of cost to those filing it, and in terms of forcing the defendant to make its victims whole by paying for damages.Most consumers used to be able to file class action suits as well. However, as Cordray explains, few are still able to because in order to open just about any kind of account, one has to sign away the right to join a group lawsuit. If you’ve ever bothered to scroll down and read one of those contracts to the end without nodding off, you’ll see what Cordray is talking about. Of course, if you’ve been wronged and explored joining a suit, you’ve likely already experienced these restrictions first hand. Few individuals have enough resources to file their own lawsuit against a bank.You might remember the Wells Fargo scandal, where they opened fake accounts on behalf of real customers. It’s a complicated story, but the point is that because the customers couldn’t sue as a group, Wells Fargo got away with paying them far less than if the case went before a judge and jury, and this for an absurdly egregious set of actions. Cordray explains the problem in general terms below:First, opponents claim that plaintiffs are better served by acting individually than by joining a group lawsuit. This claim is not supported by facts or common sense. Our study contained revealing data on the results of group lawsuits and individual actions. We found that group lawsuits get more money back to more people. In five years of group lawsuits, we tallied an average of $220 million paid to 6.8 million consumers per year. Yet in the arbitration cases we studied, on average, 16 people per year recovered less than $100,000 total.Don’t skip over this last point. Not only do we want a robust regulatory body to make crooked companies pay the people they’ve wronged, we want to make it painful enough that other institutions perpetrating the same practices will change their ways — thus benefiting millions of Americans now and going forward.The CFPB, after five years of study, drafted a rule that would override the clause in your bank account contract that prevents you from joining a class action if the bank treated you, in Cordray’s words, “unfairly.” What would the rule cost the financial industry as a whole? Under $1 billion per year out of their collective $171 billion in annual profits. And remember, the lion’s share of the “costs” are borne by the wrongdoers who should have to pay for their misdeeds.The battle over this rule is between the CFPB and the Republicans who, of course, are fighting on the side of the banks against consumers. Every Republican in the House except Rep. Walter Jones voted last month to block the CFPB’s proposed arbitration rule. Jones, it turns out, is the only remaining House Republican who voted for Dodd-Frank back in 2010. All Democrats stood with consumers and voted against the anti-CFPB House bill. Republican senators have introduced similar legislation and, if it passes, Donald Trump will sign it.In six years, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has accomplished a great deal. Furthermore, it exemplifies the difference between the two major parties. Republicans fought tooth and nail to prevent it from coming into being, and have made clear their desire to gut and get rid of it ever since. Why? Because they are on the side of the corporations who want to rip off vulnerable consumers. When conservatives call for small government and rail against regulation, they don’t want you to think about all the specific ways government works on your behalf, and the CFPB stands as a great example of that.Democrats like Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama fought to create the CFPB, and progressives are fighting to keep it working on behalf of vulnerable consumers. Progressives have a compelling, understandable story here about who really stands on the side of average Americans, and who stands on the side of the real elites. All we have to do is tell it."
48,ENTERTAINMENT,The Box Office Saw Its Worst Weekend In Years,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/worst-box-office-in-years-hitmans-bodyguard_us_59a34a3de4b06d67e3388235,"The movies were not good, and neither was their revenue.",2017-08-28,"Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson star in ""The Hitman's Bodyguard.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a3574f24000032004b9f94.jpeg?cache=w2pGkUxdmh&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Further dampening a murky summer at the movies, this weekend suffered the worst box office revenue in years. It would be easy to blame Saturday night’s Floyd Mayweather-Connor McGregor boxing match or the impact of Hurricane Harvey in Texas, but that lets the movies off the hook. As is sometimes the case in late August, once most of the flashy summer blockbusters have already opened, all of the new releases were lousy. Case in point: “The Hitman’s Bodyguard” ― a holdover from last week starring Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson ― maintained the No. 1 spot with a paltry $10 million. “Annabelle: Creation,” which opened two weeks ago, mustered $7.4 million in second place. The final calculations are still being crunched, but the total revenue ― currently estimated at $65 million ― is the lowest for a single weekend since at least 2014. It could even be the lowest since Sept. 21, 2001, which accrued $59 million in the wake of the World Trade Center terrorist attacks.Of the new releases, the animated girl-power comedy “Leap!” performed best, which isn’t saying much: It debuted at No. 3 with a mere $5 million, a particularly low number for a family-friendly movie that opened on more than 2,500 screens. Both well-reviewed, the crime thriller “Wind River” ($4.4 million) and the heist caper “Logan Lucky” ($4.3 million) rounded out the Top 5. For comparison’s sake, the movies that made the Top 5 during the same weekend last year earned nearly twice those sums.The weekend’s other new releases ― the martial arts film “Birth of a Dragon” and the faith-based drama “All Saints” ― were relegated to No. 8 and No. 13, respectively. Fathom and Mayweather Productions streamed the Mayweather-McGregor fight in 532 theaters; it notched the No. 9 spot. “Dunkirk” (No. 6), “Spider-Man: Homecoming” (No. 7) and “The Emoji Movie” (No. 10) filled the remainder of the Top 10.As North American moviegoers continue to show disinterest in certain sequels and franchise titles, the box office has trended downward throughout the summer. Financially speaking, it will likely be the weakest summer in 25 years, and the first not to crack $4 billion in ticket sales since 2006. "

On Saturday, the 30-year-old “Nip/Tuck” and “90210” actress posted a photograph of the family on both Instagram and Twitter, along with an open letter to Southwest Airlines. In the letter, McCord claimed she’d seen Southwest employees deny the men family boarding privileges because they are a same-sex couple. “Love is what these wonderful little girls have for their dads. Love does not separate, it unites,” she wrote. “I implore you, as a company that seeks to provide a happy experience for all of its customers, to hire individuals who despise hate, not love; who embrace difference, not look down on it.” Though McCord did not specify where the alleged incident took place, she identified the men involved in the incident as her “very close friends,” Jake and Dave, in a comment below her initial post on Instagram.Fans were quick to support McCord for speaking out. As of Monday afternoon, her Instagram post had received over 4,900 likes, while the subsequent tweet had been retweeted over 1,200 times. “How dare anyone say they are not a family. Thank you for continuing to make a difference and do the right thing to help others,” one person wrote. Added another, “The world needs less haters and more people like you who only want to do good and spread love!”A representative for the Texas-based airline told HuffPost they were unaware of any formal complaints regarding the family’s treatment, but noted they “regret any less than positive travel experience” the passengers may have had. “We don’t have any existing reports associated with the Customers’ travel experience but we have contacted the Employees involved for an internal review of what happened,” the spokeswoman said. “Our Customer Care Team reached out directly to the Customer and has not received a response. Our Employees work to carry out our Boarding policy for families traveling together, while also maintaining boarding priorities for all Customers.”She went on to note, “We welcome onboard more than 115 million customers each year and Southwest neither condones nor tolerates discrimination of any kind.”It’s the second time this year that Southwest Airlines has been hit with anti-LGBTQ discrimination claims. In May, Grant Morse and Samuel Ballachino said they were denied the company’s family boarding option on a flight because they are gay. The men had been traveling from Buffalo, New York to Fort Lauderdale, Florida with their three children and the children’s grandmother. A spokesperson for the airline denied the claims at the time, telling HuffPost the men had been declined only because Ballachino’s 83-year-old mother required special assistance while boarding.

Deadline reports that the film was pulled from the 2018 summer lineup after backlash during an August 11 screening that coincidentally ran the night of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.Starring Vivien Leigh as the pampered daughter of a southern plantation owner who faces hardship during the Civil War, many movie-goers in the community called the movie out as “racist” on the Orpheum’s official Facebook page. In response to the backlash, representative Brett Batterson issued a statement on Saturday announcing plans to drop the film:“The Orpheum appreciates feedback on its programming from all members of the mid-south community. The recent screening of Gone With the Wind at the Orpheum on Friday, August 11, 2017, generated numerous comments. The Orpheum carefully reviewed all of them … As an organization whose stated mission is to ‘entertain, educate and enlighten the communities it serves,’ the Orpheum cannot show a film that is insensitive to a large segment of its local population.”Batterson also told the Commercial Appeal on Monday that the choice to remove the film from the summer movie lineup was not in direct response to Charlottesville. “This is something that’s been questioned every year,” Batterson said. “But the social media storm this year really brought it home.”The cancellation has received some backlash of its own from people who believe The Orpheum “gave in” to pressure. Users on the theater’s Facebook page have stated that dropping the film is tantamount to book burning and artistic censorship.“SHAME on you all! This is art, depicting a time that is long past,” one user wrote. “You are some that want to erase history and that is a very STUPID thing to do.”Another commented, “Banning movies now? How about we burn books? Anything else to eradicate history in favor of one with an agenda? You guys really suck.”Representatives at The Orpheum did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment."

And thanks to Hurricane Harvey, which is now a tropical storm, it could get pounded with up to 50 inches of rain by the end of this week.That unprecedented rainfall ― and the flooding that accompanies it ― has forced oil and gas companies in the region to shut down critical infrastructure in the face of a potential environmental catastrophe.At least 10 refineries on the Texas coast have shut down. And whenever a refinery has to be closed or restarted, especially in emergency situations, its emissions far exceed what’s typically allowed.“Upsets or sudden shutdowns can release large plumes of sulfur dioxide or toxic chemicals in just a few hours, exposing downwind communities to peak levels of pollution that are much more likely to trigger asthma attacks and other respiratory systems,” a 2012 study by the Environmental Integrity Project found.The report goes on to note that “The working class and minority populations typical of neighborhoods near refineries and chemical plants bear the brunt of this pollution.” Indeed, that lines up with what locals say is happening in the wake of Harvey.On Sunday, Houston-area resident Stephanie Thomas told Houston Press “something powerful” hit her nostrils, describing the smell “like burnt rubber with a hint of something metallic thrown in.”Bryan Parras, a nonprofit worker who often visits Manchester, a community that lies near several chemical plants, told the paper he was certain the pollution was affecting him.“It was weird because I was getting a heartache and a scratchy throat, like the one I get when I take people on toxic tours of Manchester, but I was sitting at home,” Parras said. “The stuff was getting sucked into my house through the window air conditioning units.”On Monday, officials in the Houston-area cities of La Porte and Shoreacres issued a “shelter in place” order over a chemical leak, urging residents to close windows and doors and turn off air conditioning and ventilation.The La Porte Office of Emergency Management identified the chemical as anhydrous hydrogen chloride, a colorless gas that turns into a white mist of hydrochloric acid when exposed to moisture in the air. A Dow Chemical safety sheet warns that eye or skin contact causes severe burns, and that inhaling the fumes can be fatal.Air Alliance Houston estimates that the area’s petrochemical plants will release more than 1 million pounds of air pollution as a result of Harvey.Exxon Mobil’s Baytown facility, the largest petrochemical complex in the U.S., sustained damage in the storm and has been shut down. Company officials told CNN they’re trying to “minimize emissions,” but according to Exxon Mobil filings with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, those emissions are likely to last until Friday.(In April of this year, a federal judge ordered Exxon Mobil to pay $20 million in fines because the Baytown complex illegally spewed 8 million pounds of hazardous chemicals over a five year period.) Environment Texas says Baytown is likely emitting chemicals like 1,3-butadiene, benzene and ethylene, all of which can pose a significant health hazard given a large enough exposure.And people stuck breathing toxic fumes can’t simply go elsewhere. Because of the flooding and other dangers posed by Harvey, they’re effectively stuck where they are.“Air pollution is one of the unseen dangers of the storm,” stated Dr. Elena Craft, a senior health scientist at Environmental Defense Fund. “Poor air quality puts the most vulnerable among us, like children and seniors, at risk for asthma, heart attacks, strokes and other health problems.”This story has been updated with information about the “shelter in place” orders in La Porte and Shoreacres."

It’s not the wild, wild West.""",2017-08-28,"The Detroit, Michigan, skyline as photographed from the Windsor riverfront.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599f45571f00002a001aac82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before moving to Los Angeles and scoring a hit Comedy Central show, “Key & Peele” with Jordan Peele, Keegan-Michael Key spent a childhood in Detroit.While the city is best known around the U.S. for its auto industry and Motown hits, its 673,000 residents also know it as a buzzing center for contemporary culture outside of the country’s main coastal metropolises, with a history spanning hundreds of years that continues to flavor each neighborhood and main thoroughfare.Movies like “Detroit” and, years ago, “8 Mile” may have highlighted darker aspects of the city, which some may still know chiefly for landscapes of ruin. But Key would like to point out that, in 2017, Detroit might surprise a lot of would-be visitors. “It’s just not as dangerous as you think it is. It’s not the wild, wild West,” he told HuffPost. We spoke to the comedian about what it was like growing up in Detroit ahead of our reporting stop in the city, which you can learn more about here.Read on for Key’s memories of his Detroit neighborhood, his rave review of the Detroit Institute of Arts and thoughts the city’s promisingly bright future. What do you remember most about growing up in Detroit?I would say the biggest thing I remember ― the most specific thing I remember ― is that there was a field at the end of our block [where] we would play football with the neighbor kids. As an adult, and I look back, I remember really living in a neighborhood. I live in New York City now most of the time, and Los Angeles, but I remember everyone having a lawn, and I also remember living in a very diverse neighborhood where kids played in the streets until the streetlights came on. I remember there being a real sense of community just on our street. And then there’d be block parties, you know, where they cut off the road, and people had to go down another road. They’d set up a volleyball net and people would play volleyball right in front of my house. It was just really, really fantastic. There was a tight-knit sense that kids could walk up and down the street and go visit the other kids.Now, I also remember being a pre-teen and playing in that big field. I grew up on a street called Woodstock Drive that was just south of Woodward Avenue and 8 Mile Road, which you and every other American has heard of. I lived a block south of 8 Mile. I lived as far north of [downtown] Detroit as you could possibly live, and our major north-south thoroughfare was called Woodward Avenue. I also do remember inquiring to my mother when I was a young man, “Mommy, is that woman that man’s boyfriend?” And there was a girl in hot pants who was clearly a prostitute walking down our street. It was a very interesting dichotomy, because on 8 Mile and Woodward, there would be pros, and they would pick up johns, and sometimes they would come into our neighborhood, which was a well-manicured neighborhood with people who cared about their homes.So I’ll never forget that dichotomy, having all that fun playing with my friends football, baseball out in that field, which is a very strange thing to find in an urban center like that. There would just be: Here are a bunch of kids living the American dream of a childhood! I’m with my friends and I’m playing baseball in a field! There just happen to be prostitutes walking up and down the street right behind me in the outfield.Do you think growing up in that particular place has shaped your work at all?Yeah, I think, because I’m a person who likes to draw from their own experiences as a human when I’m building characters, or when I’m looking at a piece of subject matter for something that I might want to work on or produce. I think my history helps me in that regard because I grew up with lots of African-American kids, lots of white kids.The biggest thing for me was probably the way people spoke, which is kind of an earmark of my career. I love dialects and accents, they’re something that really resonate with me and that I find fascinating. And there were quite a few of them to absorb as a kid. So it certainly helps my work in that regard. Also, just seeing ― spending my time in a kind of lower-middle class to middle class neighborhood, but a neighborhood over where a bunch of my friends lived, they lived in a kind of middle-to-upper class neighborhood, right in real close proximity to each other. So it always allowed me to see how different people behaved. Why is that lady more conservative than my mom, but that lady over there is more liberal than my mom? I kind of kept my eyes open to new experiences as a kid in that way, so that’s always helped my work. It gives you an opportunity to know, “Oh, this is how I perform a person of means, and this is how I would perform a person who’s working class.” I got to have a lot of that in this sort of three-neighborhood area that I grew up in. Are there any misconceptions about Detroit you’d like to dispel?I’m trying to think of the most positive way to say this. You’re hearing a lot about Detroit. I think there are people who still believe that parts of Detroit are still like the wild, wild West. If anything, I would refute that claim and say that Detroit, if anything, now is more of an empty canvas. And what I would like us to do as civic leaders and people who live in the communities, in the neighborhoods, to embolden themselves for these communities, and say, “Let’s put some of the paint on that canvas away from downtown.” Somewhere more out in the neighborhoods. Because it’s the infrastructure of the neighborhoods that I think now we need to pay more attention to. Lots of people are spending lots of money and paying lots of attention to the downtown area. And that’s all well and good. I think that’s great. There’s this kind of central column in the downtown area and in our northern downtown area, but once you get about a quarter of a mile away from that downtown area, we still have some of the challenges we had even when I was a kid. I think that’s something we need to address.Another misconception is, we are Detroiters, and we are Midwesterners. Some of the friendliest, friendliest people you’re going to meet are going to be in Detroit. You and I both probably hold pride as Michiganders, being people from the North. We’re very kind, and we’ll sit and have a conversation with you. I think we’re met with the energy that we put out. You’ll find in Detroit, if you come with an open heart, we’ll just as soon accept and embrace you. I think having been the butt of jokes for so many years, you know, “Don’t go to Detroit without a gun!” Everybody used to have the T-shirts that used to say, “Detroit: Where the weak are killed and eaten.” It’s so funny because we’re one of the first places in the United States of America that experienced branding. It wasn’t good branding, but it was branding. I think in the last 30 years, we’ve turned it around, so the branding is positive. There are places to venture out in the city. You can go to the West side and find a really cool Middle Eastern restaurant, or go downtown and find really great soul food. I’ve been hearing more and more ― which just fills my heart with love and joy ― people say, “Yeah, I went to Detroit last year. It was fantastic! I loved it there.” But I also want people to explore places that they can find out in the neighborhoods. We need more of that. Listen, I think ― and maybe this isn’t super popular ― I think a little bit of gentrification is OK for any community. But you don’t want any community to lose its identity altogether. Another thing I would say is: It’s weird that in this country, the way you denote there’s some form of progress is if there’s a Starbucks in your neighborhood. I’ll go to Starbucks and get my coffee, but I’d love to go to Tommy and Tanisha’s coffee shop on Griswold so I’m supporting local people.And people don’t understand when they come to Detroit, it’s not that we were a music town. We are a music town. We are an art town. We boast one of the greatest art institutes on planet Earth. We hold some of the masters in our art museum and it’s unbelievable. I think everybody should take the opportunity, if they’re going to the Midwest, go to Detroit, Michigan, and go to the crown jewel of our city, the diamond that is the biggest piece of our civic pride, is that museum.It’s just not as dangerous as you think it is. It’s not the wild, wild West. There aren’t bullets flying everywhere. It just isn’t that place anymore. Is there any part of the city you’d still like to explore?Something I’d like to do is, they do these driving tours, where they’ll drive around these neighborhoods like Indian Village, and I’ve never done one of them. I have friends, very good friends, who give walking tours of the city, and I would like to do a walking tour of the city. I would like to invest more of my brain space in understanding the history of my city, because whenever I learn about the history of Detroit, it’s always so fascinating, from a little kind of beaver-trading post to the place where automobiles were manufactured. I learned much later in my life that “le détroit,” the phrase, means “the strait,” and technically the Detroit River is a strait, and that’s what they were calling it. It’s funny when you hear where the name actually comes from. When people hear the name “Detroit,” it invokes urban decay, it invokes industrialism, it invokes “rust belt.” But what it really was was this really bucolic place with these barges going up and down this little waterway with tons and tons of beaver pelts on it. That’s what we were there for.There are also museums in my city that I’ve never been to that I still want to go there. That’s what I want to do the next time that I visit, is to be able to go to museums that I skipped when I was in my 20s, when I left and went to school, then moved to LA ― all these places that I forgot about and haven’t visited, and then I’d like to visit the old museums I went to when I was a kid. There’s a lot of culture in this city! We are one of the grand cities of the United States. Do you go back often? Is your family still there?I go home as often as I can. My family’s still there, my brother and my mother are still there, I have aunts and uncles there. I have lots and lots of childhood friends who still live there. My two best friends from childhood are now firefighters, Detroit firefighters. It’s really lovely to go home, and see the people you grew up with, and see how it’s changed for the better. "

Ireland (Air Force Staff Sergeant), Sterling James Crutcher (Air Force Airman First Class), Laila Ireland (retired Army veteran) and Brynn Tannehill (Former Navy Lt. Commander).“Historically, the VMAs have been a huge platform for social issues that are currently happening, so being able to have that platform and share our stories is important to us,” Laila Ireland said to Billboard.Logan B. Ireland spoke out earlier this summer after Trump’s tweets about his intention to ban transgender service members from serving.“For the President to deny an able-bodied, fully qualified person the inherent right to raise their right hand and serve their country, potentially giving their own life for our freedoms, is doing this country an injustice,” he said at the time.Save for Brynn Tannehill, who was in uniform, the service members walked the VMAs red carpet Sunday night in jeans and black T-shirts identifying their military affiliation.Aside from having an important presence on the red carpet at the event, the service members were also enjoying the star-studded award show, meeting celebrities who joined in their support of transgender troops.Laila Ireland shared a photo of their red carpet passes before the event.The network announced its invitation to transgender service members Friday, with MTV President Chris McCarthy saying in a statement, “Any patriot who is putting their own life at risk to fight for our freedom and stands for equality is a hero at MTV, and to young people everywhere.”Tannehill, who served in the Navy for 17 years, said the invite “sends a clear and unambiguous message that we will not allow discrimination against trans people.”"
56,POLITICS,Much Ado About Nothing: Politico's Iran Deal Investigation Debunked,"Trita Parsi, ContributorPresident, National Iranian American Council",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/politico-iran-deal-giveaway_us_590727c9e4b05c39768097db,The talking point is the latest attempt by hawks in Washington to undermine diplomacy.,2017-05-01,"Secretary of State John Kerry listens as President Barack Obama meets with a group of veterans and Gold Star Mothers to discuss the Iran nuclear deal at the White House on September 10, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59072b6f2600003596c48968.jpeg?ops=crop_0_107_3500_2046%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"It is a sign of the times that when we need to march in defense of facts, of women deserving equal rights, and of science not being a Chinese conspiracy, we also have to defend something as self-evident as the undeniable value of the nuclear deal with Iran from 2015. But in a post-fact era, even diplomatic triumphs that saved the United States from both the threat of nuclear weapons and another endless war in the Middle East face perpetual relitigation.The latest example is Josh Meyer’s article in the Politico claiming to reveal that the Obama administration gave previously undisclosed concessions to the government in Tehran as part of the nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The article is not news, but comes across as yet another hit piece against the nuclear deal, promoted and celebrated by those in Washington who are unrelenting in their commitment to killing it.Meyer argues, based largely on interviews with what appears to be disgruntled, mid-level officials at the Department of Justice and Homeland Security, that the Obama administration slow-walked investigations against alleged Iranian smugglers serving Tehran’s nuclear program and dropped charges against other Iranian operatives. And Obama apparently did this all behind the back of his own Justice Department.From the outset, Meyer commits a critical error: He insinuates that any concessions in terms of dropping charges against potential Iranian smugglers were made as part of the nuclear deal. In reality, to the extent any concessions were made, they were made to win the release of Americans held in Iranian jails. The convolution appears intentional, as an article revealing additional concessions to win the release of innocent Americans lingering in Iranian jails would only receive a fraction of the attention of an article claiming those alleged concessions were made to secure the embattled nuclear deal. Few would like to adopt the line that the Obama administration shouldn’t have done what it took to win the release of journalist Jason Rezaian, Marine Corps and Iraq war veteran Amir Hekmati, and the other Americans held in Iran. Spinning the story to create a false link between these alleged concessions and the nuclear deal resolves that problem.The chronology of events and the mechanisms of the nuclear talks clarifies this. The nuclear negotiations concluded on July 14, 2015. Under the deal, the Iranians agreed to take the first steps to answer remaining questions by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in regard to their nuclear program by October 18. Once this was completed and verified by the IAEA, two simultaneous decisions were made: The Iranians began dismantling parts of their nuclear program, and the EU and the U.S. made a legally binding decision to lift or waive sanctions on Iran once the IAEA confirmed that Iran had fulfilled its commitments. This is a critical point: After October 18, the U.S. was obliged to lift sanctions as long as Iran implemented the final phase of the JCPOA roadmap. Meaning, having done all it was supposed to do, Iran had no remaining nuclear leverage to press the U.S. to give additional concessions on the prisoner issue. Indeed, even if the U.S. and Iran had not come to an agreement on a prisoner swap, the nuclear deal would have still proceeded as it was solely dependent upon the IAEA certifying Iran’s completion of the roadmap. This was formally done on January 16, 2016 ― Implementation Day ― after which the U.S. began waiving sanctions on Iran.Meyer writes that “administration representatives weren’t telling the whole story on Jan. 17, 2016, in their highly choreographed rollout of the prisoner swap and simultaneous implementation of the six-party nuclear deal.” In reality, the swap was more chaotic than it was choreographed. Just days before Implementation Day, 10 American sailors accidentally wandered into Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf and were apprehended by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Navy. The incident risked jeopardizing the prisoner swap, but was quickly resolved within just 16 hours.But contrary to the Politico article’s claim that the Iranians persistently extracted more concessions from the Obama administration, the Iranians released the American sailors without even demanding a single concession from the U.S. side. If the Iranian modus operandi was to link the prisoner swap with the nuclear issue and force Obama to give more and more to Iran since “the deal was sacrosanct [to Obama], and the Iranians knew it from the start,” as former Bush administration deputy national security adviser Juan Zarate told Politico, then why didn’t they use the 10 captured American sailors to bring Obama to his knees?In fact, as I describe in Losing An Enemy - Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy, the prisoner swap was scheduled to take place earlier but ended up getting delayed as the negotiations proved difficult. And it was the Iranians who originally opposed ― for their own domestic political reasons ― having the swap coincide with Implementation Day. Eventually, though, that is what happened.But this begs a more important question: What if the Obama administration did drop charges against a few alleged Iranian smugglers in order to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapons option? Why would such a trade-off cause a scandal in Washington? After all, for more than two decades, American and Israeli hawks claimed the Iranian nuclear program was an existential threat and that the heavens would fall if it wasn’t stopped. Yet, after the Obama administration put a lid on the Iranian program, the very same hawks now decry the nuclear deal on the (false) basis that as part of neutralizing this supposedly existential threat, charges were dropped against Iranian smugglers that the U.S. had no way of getting extradited anyway.One critic of the nuclear deal even told Politico that closing the investigations on these alleged smugglers did “significant and lasting damage” to America’s nonproliferation effort. Apparently, keeping hopeless procurement investigations open is more important to America’s credibility than blocking all of Iran’s paths to a nuclear weapon. Even if the nuclear talks were the reason for the closing of the investigations, who wouldn’t trade several likely hopeless procurement investigations for an agreement that cuts off Iran’s pathways to a nuclear weapon and forces Iran’s nuclear procurement into an official channel subject to the approval of the U.S. and other international powers?Still, the Politico article is very valuable. Not because it reveals anything nefarious about the nuclear talks, but because it gives a glimpse into the real reason some in Washington obsessively oppose the JCPOA.On the one hand, they oppose the very principle on which deal-making is based: That in order to get something, you have to give something. In their purist maximalist world, the United States should not have to offer any concessions to get concessions in return. Particularly not to a mid-size power such as Iran. To paraphrase arch-neoconservative Richard Perle, the only carrot the U.S. should provide is to offer not to bomb countries as long as they comply with American demands.If one approaches the rest of the world with such a bully-mentality, then closing investigations on alleged Iranian smugglers is unacceptable regardless of what the U.S. would gain in return. By definition, priorities cannot be established, because everything is equally important. Therefore, securing the freedom of American citizens does not take precedence over a procurement investigation ― not even blocking Iran’s pathways to a nuclear weapon would.Meyer’s investigation claims that “many participants [in counter-intelligence operations] said the way forward is still sufficiently unclear that they can’t, or won’t, proceed.” But who are these participants? Is the off-the-record testimony of mid-level operatives in the Justice Department ― who might only see their own small piece of the picture ― on par with the assessment of senior administration officials with higher security clearances who have the benefit of seeing the larger picture? If you are ideologically opposed to the idea of give-and-take, then yes.The Politico investigation also sheds light on another point: To large parts of the Washington foreign policy establishment the details of the deal is unimportant. If Iran’s nuclear program truly was the existential threat they had claimed all along, they should be celebrating the nuclear deal ― as parts of Israel’s security establishment does today. Refusing to do so suggests that what these hawks really oppose is the very idea of striking a deal ― any deal ― with the government in Tehran. To them, losing Iran as an enemy is the existential threat ― not Iran’s nuclear program.So much for the decades old U.S.-Iran enmity solely being an ideological obsession of Iran’s notorious hardliners.

Countries are assessed on human rights progress every five years, and the Bahraini government’s delegation had to sit and listen as country after country listed concerns about the country’s failure to introduce real reform despite promises made at its last UPR in 2012.While a few countries, including its repressive ally Saudi Arabia, played along with Bahrain’s claims to have made progress, delegations from across the world admonished the kingdom for its repression.One common theme was the resumption of executions in Bahrain this year for the first time since 2010. Another was Bahrain’s preventing civil society activists from attending the UPR session, raised by Estonia, Germany, Luxembourg, Ireland and others.Human Rights activists in the country regularly complain that the international community does little to prevent the repression against them, and while today’s criticism was expressions of displeasure from states and without promises of further sanction, the criticism was widespread and embarrassing.Even the U.K., whose condemnation of Bahrain is usually horribly muted, publicly “registered concern” at the resumption of executions, while the U.S. criticized the restrictions on political opposition groups, and specifically mentioned targets groups Al Wefaq and Wa’ad. The U.S. had also submitted a series of written questions to Bahrain before today’s hearing, including “How does the government of Bahrain plan to respect its international obligations with regard to freedom of association ... in light of recent legal action against political societies?” and “What is the status of the government’s efforts to create an inclusive place force, including at the leadership level?”The latter question refers to Bahrain’s failure to address the problem that its security forces are drawn almost exclusively from the ruling minority Sunni sect. Ghana also raised the issue of religious discrimination against the majority Shia population. Several countries including the Netherlands raised the issue of a new constitutional amendment that will allow civilians to be tried in military courts. “What human rights protections will be maintained in military courts to protect against abuses?” asked the U.S.Denmark raised the case of jailed human rights defender and Danish citizen Abdulhadi Al Khawaja. Iceland spoke about international human rights organizations still being denied access to Bahrain (thanks, Iceland), France expressed worry about freedom of the media and Chile about continuing reports of torture. It went on all morning, with Bahrain’s delegation being piñataed by countries from every continent. Austria urged Bahrain to finally allow the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture into the country, Switzerland and Slovenia pushed for the implementation of the recommendations of the 2011 independent inquiry into violations that year, and Mexico criticized the stripping of citizenship. Honduras also raised the issue of religious discrimination, Argentina and Bulgaria criticized the return to executions.The Bahraini delegation responded weakly, attempting to defend the indefensible, claiming untruthfully that Bahrain enjoys media freedom and freedom of expression. It’s a bad day for the ruling family.Today’s session won’t magically transform Bahrain overnight , but is some attempt by the international community to hold Bahrain accountable for its violations. Other governments clearly know what’s happening in Bahrain, and today they said they cared. The real test is what Bahrain’s allies will do about the repression, if they’re prepared to continue to enable it, or finally to confront it."

The U.S. had also submitted a series of written questions to Bahrain before today’s hearing, including “How does the government of Bahrain plan to respect its international obligations with regard to freedom of association ... in light of recent legal action against political societies?” and “What is the status of the government’s efforts to create an inclusive place force, including at the leadership level?”The latter question refers to Bahrain’s failure to address the problem that its security forces are drawn almost exclusively from the ruling minority Sunni sect. Ghana also raised the issue of religious discrimination against the majority Shia population. Several countries including the Netherlands raised the issue of a new constitutional amendment that will allow civilians to be tried in military courts. “What human rights protections will be maintained in military courts to protect against abuses?” asked the U.S.Denmark raised the case of jailed human rights defender and Danish citizen Abdulhadi Al Khawaja. Iceland spoke about international human rights organizations still being denied access to Bahrain (thanks, Iceland), France expressed worry about freedom of the media and Chile about continuing reports of torture. It went on all morning, with Bahrain’s delegation being piñataed by countries from every continent. Austria urged Bahrain to finally allow the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture into the country, Switzerland and Slovenia pushed for the implementation of the recommendations of the 2011 independent inquiry into violations that year, and Mexico criticized the stripping of citizenship. Honduras also raised the issue of religious discrimination, Argentina and Bulgaria criticized the return to executions.The Bahraini delegation responded weakly, attempting to defend the indefensible, claiming untruthfully that Bahrain enjoys media freedom and freedom of expression. It’s a bad day for the ruling family.Today’s session won’t magically transform Bahrain overnight , but is some attempt by the international community to hold Bahrain accountable for its violations. Other governments clearly know what’s happening in Bahrain, and today they said they cared. The real test is what Bahrain’s allies will do about the repression, if they’re prepared to continue to enable it, or finally to confront it."
59,THE WORLDPOST,Stop Seeing Refugees As A Problem And Start Seeing Their Potential,"The Aspen Institute New Voices Fellowship, ContributorA communications and advocacy program created at the Aspen Ins...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stop-seeing-refugees-as-a-problem-and-start-seeing_us_59074390e4b084f59b49fb00,"By Robert Hakiza From Syria, to Nigeria to Myanmar, the number of people fleeing war and persecution around the world is",2017-05-01,"<p>Refugees have breakfast in front of their huts in displaced persons camp, Juba, South Sudan, February 28, 2012. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590743de1400002a00a9cc1e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Robert HakizaFrom Syria, to Nigeria to Myanmar, the number of people fleeing war and persecution around the world is at unprecedented levels. The United Nations Refugee Agency estimates the total number seeking safety by the end of 2015 was 65 million worldwide. That’s equivalent to the entire population of Great Britain being uprooted and dispersed. And that was before the latest warnings of famine in parts of Africa and Yemen, before the latest upsurge in fighting in South Sudan and before the Iraqi military offensive against Islamic State. But rather than providing refugees with protection, more and more countries are deciding to lock them out by closing their borders. This is not just morally wrong. It is self-defeating. Refugees should not be seen as a financial burden or security threat but rather as a source of potential for host countries. Instead of wasting money on building walls, it would be better to support programs to help refugees to help themselves. I am living proof that the investment pays off. I am a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Conflict in my homeland forced me to flee to Uganda in 2008. My family joined a steady exodus of refugees who settled in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. Humanitarian assistance mostly focused on formal camps in rural areas, so surviving in the city was tough especially for those who didn’t speak English. But we didn’t want handouts. We wanted to work, to support ourselves. Uganda has been justifiably praised for its open and welcoming policy towards refugees, which guarantees freedom of movement, access to health care and education and - crucially - the right to work. It even gives registered new arrivals a plot of land on which to build a house and grow crops. Uganda actively encourages refugees to be self-sufficient and everyone benefits. Research conducted in 2013 by the Humanitarian Innovation Project showed the contribution refugees make to the Ugandan economy. 97 percent buy their daily goods from Ugandan run businesses while 40 percent of the workforce employed by refugee run businesses are local Ugandans. I too have repaid the hospitality that Uganda showed my family. I and two other Congolese exiles set up an organization to support other refugees. YARID (Young African Refugees for Integral Development) started with simple soccer matches to bring different communities, other refugees and local Ugandans, together. We progressed to teaching skills and trades —through things like English lessons and hosting sewing workshops. The emphasis from the beginning was on helping refugees gain the skills and confidence needed to be self-reliant. YARID now has 16 tax paying employees. However, it is true that there is a limit to the number of people any one country can support. Today, Uganda hosts more refugees and asylum seekers than any other country in Africa and the numbers keep growing. Every day, an average of more than a thousand refugees cross the border from South Sudan. The majority are women and children escaping conflict, rape and hunger. Other countries across Africa and around the world should step up. Not just in the name of humanity, but also recognizing the tangible benefits to their societies and economies. Refugees don’t leave their homes by choice and often leave behind every possession they have but not their skills and knowledge. They are doctors, engineers, teachers and students. All of whom could make useful contributions to their host country if they were allowed to live productive lives. This is also an argument made by Professors Alexander Betts and Paul Collier in their new book, “Refuge: Transforming a broken refugee system.” They cite the example of Jordan where refugees are given permission to work in special economic zones designed to attract international investment for new business enterprises. The authors see this as a model that could be replicated around the world with benefits for both refugees and host countries. Refugees want empowerment, not sporadic charity. They know their communities better than anyone else. They understand the challenges and opportunities they face to become self-reliant. I know better than anyone that initiatives created by refugees themselves work. Give us the support we deserve and we will pay you back with interest.

60,HEALTHY LIVING,F.A.S.T. Thinking Helped Lane Save His Mom,"Nancy Brown, ContributorCEO, American Heart Association",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fast-thinking-helped-lane-save-his-mom_us_590358ffe4b03b105b44b7d5,A second wave of publicity followed when he received a thank-you note from my organization. A third wave is likely to follow,2017-05-01,"<p>Lane and Flo Matte (left), and Vicky Dupuis outside Impressions Hair Salon.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59035b7f1c00001600e823dc.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Editor’s note: Stroke awareness is always important, and there’s extra emphasis on spreading the word in May, which is American Stroke Month. For instance, a survey released Monday showed that one-third of of U.S. adults have had symptoms consistent with a mini-stroke, but only 3 percent called 911 for help. Yet while facts and statistics make the point quite persuasively, the message is perhaps best told through the story of Lane and Flo Matte.Flo Matte is a Friday morning regular at the Impressions Hair Salon in Moss Bluff, Louisiana. It’s a great chance to get her hair done and to catch up on all the happenings around town.On the last Friday of January, she was scheduled to have foot surgery. That shook up her routine. She went to the salon on a Thursday afternoon instead. Then she did something even more unusual: In the middle of her appointment, she called her son, Lane.“Can you come pick me up?” she said. “I don’t feel good.”The words didn’t sound right to Lane. They seemed slurred, as if she was calling from the dentist’s office with her mouth packed in gauze.Immediately, a voice played in Lane’s head. The voice of an American Stroke Association public service announcement about how to spot a stroke “F.A.S.T.” The commercial is on heavy rotation at Super Talk 1400 out of Lake Charles, the conservative talk radio station Lane listens to all day, every weekday.Lane knew that speech difficulty is the S in the acronym F.A.S.T. He asked Flo to hand the phone to her beautician, Vicky Dupuis, to run through the rest of the letters: F for face drooping and A for arm weakness.Vicky noticed no drooping, but saw splotches on Flo’s face. She couldn’t tell if either arm was weak. Some people might’ve doubted the severity of the situation. Not Lane. Knowing that the T stands for time to call 911, he did exactly that, sending an ambulance to Impressions for a woman possibly suffering a stroke. Lane’s instincts were correct. Flo suffered what’s known as a “warning stroke,” technically called a transient ischemic attack or TIA. A TIA is a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain. The warning is that it could be an indicator of a full-blown stroke on the horizon.Flo had another TIA while at the local hospital, prompting the ER doctor to say Flo needed to be flown to New Orleans for more advanced care. Minutes later, a helicopter team walked in … completely by coincidence. It was a few weeks before Mardi Gras and the flight paramedics dropped in to deliver a king cake as a gift for the hospital staff. Since they were already in place, they jumped into action, getting Flo the advanced care she needed right away. After a week of testing and observation, doctors adjusted medications to control Flo’s blood pressure and she returned home. Flo, 74, has been doing fine ever since. There’s a saying in stroke care that “time lost is brain lost,” and everyone’s speedy actions seem to have prevented any long-term damage.“I don’t think I took a deep breath until she was discharged,” Lane said.Ever since, Lane’s been spreading the word that without the F.A.S.T. commercial, there’s no telling what might have happened to his mom.He started by sending a letter to my organization, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association. “I wanted to thank you so very much for creating that Public Service Announcement,” he wrote. “Had it not been for that commercial, and how frequently it was aired, I most likely would have just went and picked her up and brought her home like she asked. It is highly likely that your Public Service Announcement saved my mother’s life, and for that I cannot thank you enough!”A scanned copy of the note happened to reach my team while we were in Houston for the International Stroke Conference, the world’s premier event dedicated to the science and treatment of this disease. Our volunteer president, Dr. Steven Houser, read it minutes before delivering the opening address.Dr. Houser’s speech focused on the growing concern around the fact that stroke – the No. 2 killer worldwide, and No. 5 in the United States – is becoming a bigger problem. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show a rising death rate from stroke each of the past two years. The latest data shows an increase of about 20 deaths per day from stroke. Scientists and medical professionals are doing their part to reverse this trend. Other people, can, too. All it takes is knowing the warning signs and being prepared to act on them.Like Lane did.Lane spent 20 years as a police officer, working primarily on cases involving domestic violence, severe child abuse and sex crimes. He’s seen a lot of awful things and been trained to deal with them. He also was trained in CPR.But stroke?“All I really knew was that it was a problem with a blood vessel in the brain and that it could be fatal,” he said.He left law enforcement in 2014. His father died and Lane took over his business, Bob’s Rental Properties. He’s spent the past three years running the office from a building behind his mom’s house.Whether he’s in that office or in his truck visiting his properties, Lane listens to talk radio. Just like he can tell you each radio host’s view on various issues, he can also recite their most-played commercials. So when Lane sent his letter to my organization, he also contacted officials at the radio station to thank them. Producers and hosts already knew him – he’s a frequent caller – so they asked him to share his story on the air. He’s also posted it multiple places on Facebook. “Had I not heard that commercial so often, when she said to pick me up, I would’ve done exactly that – picked her up, took her home, laid her down to rest and said, `See you tomorrow,’” Lane said. “Who knows what would’ve happened if I’d done that.” A second wave of publicity followed when he received a thank-you note from my organization. A third wave is likely to follow the publication of this story.Lane is keeping the story going. As with his career in law enforcement, “I never wanted to be a hero, I just wanted to do my job and help people.”His message is simple: Everyone is at risk of a stroke. And anyone can help minimize the damage. All it takes is remembering four letters: F.A.S.T.“Know what to look for,” he said, “and call 911.”"

News organizations that previously jockeyed for Hollywood A-listers instead invited more of their own rank-and-file reporters and producers. Some outlets, like HuffPost and CNN, nodded toward the future generation of the craft by filling tables with high school and college journalists. Longtime attendees remarked how the vibe was different and more reminiscent of gatherings from decades past, before the ballroom was overrun by boldface names and selfie-snapping scribes. “I think it’s a great reset,” Washington Post publisher Fred Ryan told HuffPost, noting that the dinner had evolved from its core focus of saluting journalism to “quite a bit of a celebrity night.’“In the 12 years I’ve come to this dinner, I’m finally excited this is about the journalists who cover Washington and the White House and not about the celebrities,” said Thomas Burr, a correspondent for The Salt Lake Tribune and recent National Press Club president.Though some of the flashiest parties were canceled this year ― like the New Yorker’s Friday night soiree atop the W Hotel and the ultra-exclusive Vanity Fair-Bloomberg after-party ― there were still big late-night ragers, like the NBC News/ MSNBC post-dinner bash at the Organization of American States, and a slew of pre-parties and boozy brunches all over town. Journalists also flocked to the Saturday afternoon taping of Samantha Bee’s “Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner,” which aired against the last hour of the actual dinner. And they were entertained at the dinner by Hasan Minhaj’s hilarious, and at times moving, roast of the president and the press.But even as drinks flowed and trays of hor d’oeuvres passed by all weekend, broader existential questions were in the air.“Just like in the campaign, there is so much that is unprecedented, stuff that we’ve never seen before and we’re trying to figure out what our role is and how we do it best,” said Terence Samuel, a veteran Washington Post editor. “This weekend has always been some kind of weird Rorschach test about who we are and what we do. It’s even more pronounced this year.”What’s also unprecedented is that this year’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner didn’t include the White House.A sitting president hasn’t skipped the dinner in decades, and it’s the first time in the event’s nearly century-long history that no one attended from the White House. President Donald Trump, who privately courts the media while recklessly attacking journalists publicly as the “enemy of the people,” decided not to attend Saturday because of what he considers unfair treatment.Instead, Trump tried counter-programming the annual dinner by staging an event of his own in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and while in front of his faithful, unsurprisingly blasted the “fake news” media. But as Trump dusted off familiar press-bashing lines at a campaign-style rally, the journalists who cover the presidency were rallying around the First Amendment back home.RealClearPolitics dubbed its pre-dinner bash “A Toast to the First Amendment” and Washington editor Carl Cannon did just that while recalling how newspapers existed even before the presidency and published the Declaration of Independence. “The First Amendment is in the Constitution, but freedom of the press predates this country,” he said. “It’s an essential American trait that helped create the country, not the other way around.”Of the First Amendment theme, Emily Goodin, the site’s managing editor, said that “in a time when there’s accusations of fake news and actual fake news that is about there, it’s good to reframe the focus on the quality journalism that so many organizations do and toast that.”The First Amendment was everywhere in the Hilton Ballroom, from the banner onstage to the pins given out to all attendees. White House Correspondents’ Association President Jeff Mason even read the First Amendment during remarks in which he also pushed back against the president’s most heated anti-press rhetoric.“We are not fake news. We are not failing news organizations,” Mason said. “And we are not the enemy of the American people.”Legendary reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein next recalled their dogged pursuit of the “best obtainable version of the truth” that led to breaking the Watergate scandal and taking down a corrupt presidency. Woodward also echoed Mason in telling Trump in absentia, “Mr. President, the media is not fake news.”Such lines drew cheers, and at times standing ovations, from the journalists in attendance. But the real test of the solidarity evident in the room Saturday night will occur next time critical organizations get barred from a White House press briefing or if Trump’s Justice Department targets journalists for doing their jobs.But for a few hours Saturday night, journalists seemed to take pride in reaffirming the virtues of journalism and mingling with colleagues even if the feel was more upscale office party than Oscar party. “Perhaps this is one of the positive things Donald Trump has done,” Mother Jones Washington bureau chief David Corn said. “He’s taken away a little glitz from what is supposed to be an evening commemorating and celebrating journalism.”Corn said executives and advertisers have helped shift the event in recent decades to become “Hollywood on the Potomac,” resulting in many reporters, bookers and producers who do the work each day in newsrooms not getting inside the ballroom. If the dinner becomes “boring enough,” he said, “advertisers and executives won’t want to come back next year without celebrities.”But next year might not be so boring. As HuffPost pointed out to Corn, Trump just told Reuters he would “absolutely” come in 2018.“That’s the worst piece of news I’ve heard today,” he said."

In the five months before Frieden’s visit, Ebola had spread from a village in Guinea, across borders and into cities in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Médecins Sans Frontières, the first international responder on the scene, had run out of staff to treat the rising numbers of sick people and had deemed the outbreak “out of control” back in June.But when Frieden arrived in West Africa, the World Health Organization, the United Nations agency charged with coordinating the global response to disease outbreaks, had only just declared Ebola to be an international public health emergency. Although WHO had announced a $100 million Ebola action plan the week prior to that declaration, many major donors were still sitting on the sidelines.Frieden returned to the United States desperate to find more help. On Aug. 30, one day before a scheduled call with President Barack Obama, he emailed his point person for one of the key organizations in global public health. That person wasn’t at a U.N. affiliate or any other public agency — he was Chris Elias, president of the global development program at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. “We do not have a specific strategy or budget for emerging infections, but these are extraordinary times and I’d be willing to make the case internally if it makes sense,” Elias wrote back hours later.“Situation is incredibly dire,” Frieden replied very late that night. “I should brief you, Bill, and others next week. All of Africa is at risk. Support now is worth many times what support in a few weeks would be worth. Literally every day counts.”Frieden emailed again on Sept. 1. “I think Bill should hear directly and soon,” he wrote. “The situation is catastrophic.”Elias wrote back on Sept. 3 to say he had spoken with Bill Gates and foundation CEO Sue Desmond-Hellmann, who asked him to talk to Frieden, WHO and UNICEF about “what, if any, role the Foundation could/should play in supporting” the Ebola response. Frieden and Elias would later speak over the phone, although the CDC director did not talk to Gates himself about Ebola. Gates was “not in the office this week,” Elias wrote. (These and other emails sent during the Ebola crisis were obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.)Frieden’s frantic emails point to the current reality in global health: No single non-governmental institution or individual wields more influence, and no one’s support is more powerful, than the Gates Foundation and its namesake founders, Bill and Melinda Gates. The foundation has $39.6 billion in assets. It spent $2.9 billion on developmental assistance for global health in 2015 alone ― more than every country in the world except the U.S. and the U.K.In the first half of the 20th century, it was the Rockefeller Foundation that pioneered and directed efforts to control diseases worldwide, coordinating the work of doctors, researchers and public health specialists from multiple countries to focus on international health issues for the first time.It wasn’t until the United Nations formed WHO in 1948 that a publicly funded global health body, accountable to the nations of the world, took the lead. “Governments have a responsibility,” the preamble to WHO’s constitution says, “for the health of their peoples which can be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures.” The goal, it continues, is to “promote and protect the health of all peoples.”WHO has frequently fallen short of that goal. It absorbed much of the blame for the Ebola outbreak that began in 2014 and eventually killed more than 11,300 people. Its disease surveillance failed early on to detect the spike in cases of the hemorrhagic fever, and in a tweet that didn’t age particularly well, a WHO official initially downplayed the threat.Those failures, and others, have led some to question the decision to trust international bodies like WHO with global health — and even propose returning to a more philanthropy-focused model. Stephen Moore, an economist who advised President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, recently called for ending all non-emergency U.S. foreign aid, much of which goes to international organizations such as WHO. Trump’s budget blueprint proposes cuts in payments to the entire U.N. system.That means private charities such as the Gates Foundation might play an even larger role in protecting public health, which calls for scrutiny of the role that philanthropy has played in recent years. Nobody would be better off if Bill Gates pulled his money. But governments and private foundations are not interchangeable — in how they set their goals, in how they work with others, in how they are held accountable.When the Gates Foundation takes aim at a disease, it can elicit billions of dollars from governments and reshape the world’s agenda for scientific research. Take polio: The foundation has spent nearly $3 billion since 2003 on eradicating the disease. It is the largest global funder of the effort and has rallied other private foundations and national governments behind the cause. The foundation’s influence also runs deep within WHO. At the time of the Ebola outbreak, it was the organization’s second-largest donor, following only the U.S. government. Yet when a disease does not have the Gates Foundation’s attention, the global health community can struggle to do much at all. The Ebola crisis demonstrated that the foundation is disinclined to take on certain crucial work that governments and intergovernmental organizations are generally expected to handle. By the time of Frieden’s desperate email — five months after the first cases in Guinea were reported — the foundation had announced just $1 million to fight Ebola.Less than 15 years ago, the Gates Foundation was a minor player on the global health scene, and WHO was far more prominent and capable. In February 2003, a severe flu-like disease appeared in China’s Guangdong province. The disease spread quickly, but the governments of China and other affected nations refused to acknowledge the problem. It was the 21st century’s first big outbreak: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.Under the vigorous leadership of then Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland, WHO moved rapidly. The organization signaled an emergency when the outbreak was still small, with less than 200 reported cases and only four deaths. Working with the CDC and other health officials from around the world, WHO dispatched more than 60 medical teams to assess conditions on the ground. Four months after declaring an emergency, WHO announced it had successfully contained the disease. At the time, the Gates Foundation was only a few years old and led by the Microsoft billionaire’s father, William Gates Sr. “Brundtland wasn’t very concerned with Bill Gates,” Jon Lidén, one of the director-general’s senior staff, recalled in a 2013 interview. WHO leadership saw the foundation as “a very small operation,” Lidén said, “run from a garage and a bit odd.” But with judicious application of the world’s largest private fortune, the Gates Foundation rapidly expanded its influence. The first target was immunization. In 1999, the foundation put forward $750 million to form a public-private partnership called the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, or Gavi, with the goal of reinvigorating stalled efforts to vaccinate the world’s children — a job that had previously been the responsibility of WHO and UNICEF. On paper, WHO and UNICEF were the foundation’s equals at Gavi, with each entity holding a position on the board. But the Gates Foundation didn’t just provide unrestricted funding, opting instead to lodge its money in a separate entity, the Vaccine Fund, which Gavi had to petition to access.In 2008, Gavi and the Vaccine Fund merged. The rearranged board drastically reduced WHO’s and UNICEF’s strength — they were now just two of 28 voting members. The U.N. agencies effectively became subcontractors on a Gates-led project.Also starting in 1999, the Gates Foundation applied its generous grant-making to malaria research, almost single-handedly reviving the field. Bill Gates mused during a speech in San Jose, California, that with a $50 million grant, he’d been told he’d “just doubled the amount of private money that goes to malaria.” But the foundation didn’t want to just fund more research; it wanted to transform the way the world fought malaria. At a Gates-organized forum in Seattle in October 2007, Melinda Gates challenged the world’s top malaria researchers to shift their strategy from control to eradication. The foundation’s call set the malaria world “abuzz,” Science magazine reported. At the time, many researchers believed malaria eradication efforts were likely to end in failure. U.S.-backed DDT spraying in the 1950s and ‘60s had provided a temporary respite from the disease. But many people lost the immunity acquired when malaria maintains a constant presence, and as mosquitoes developed resistance to the pesticide, the disease resurged and the eradication effort collapsed.By 2007, however, the Gates Foundation had already handed out $1 billion in malaria research grants. The freshly funded scientists were loath to speak out. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan endorsed Gates’ call to action immediately — without consulting her top advisers, according to Science’s report.There were a few dissenters. Later that year, WHO malaria head Arata Kochi circulated a memo describing a “cartel” of leading malaria researchers funded by the Gates Foundation. His memo later leaked to The New York Times, and he was relieved of his role soon after. At WHO, there hasn’t been any outward opposition to or criticism of the Gates Foundation’s role in malaria funding in the nine years since Kochi was removed. Anthony Fauci, the head of infectious disease research at the National Institutes of Health, had once been a skeptic about eradicating malaria, but wrote in a 2009 CNN column that Gates’ advocacy had changed his mind: “As the idea began to sink in and we assessed the research landscape, a new sense of optimism emerged.” Malaria eradication eventually won support from the highest levels of government. In a last-minute addition to his January 2016 State of the Union address, Obama said the world was “on track” to end HIV/AIDS. “We have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria,” he said, promising to push Congress to fund eradication.After changing the global establishment’s views on malaria, the Gates Foundation took aim at what is now its biggest health priority: eradicating polio. WHO had launched its effort to eliminate the disease in 1988. Although the number of cases was dramatically reduced, the campaign missed its 2000 deadline and was well over budget. Bill Gates saw an opportunity not just to revive the polio effort, but to advance the whole idea of eradication. “The credibility, the energy from that will allow us to take the new tools we’ll have then and go after a malaria plan,” he explained in a 2014 interview. The Gates Foundation became the world’s largest underwriter of polio eradication in 2008 and the unofficial leader of the project, which includes the CDC, WHO, UNICEF and Rotary International. The foundation’s money has helped bring polio to the brink of extinction. The massive exertion required to eradicate every last vestige of the disease has also arguably drawn WHO staff and attention away from other priorities.WHO relies on voluntary contributions from countries and private donors, including the Gates Foundation, for around 80 percent of its budget. That makes the organization vulnerable to outside pressure, global health experts Devi Sridhar and Lawrence Gostin wrote in a 2011 study. Such contributions are often tied to the donors’ pet programs, which “skews global health priorities,” Gostin and Sridhar said. The 20 percent of WHO’s budget that comes from U.N. member states’ mandatory contributions can be used as the agency sees fit. But those contributions are based roughly on the size of the countries’ economies. Following the 2008 financial crisis, WHO was forced to make budget cuts. Before the Ebola outbreak, it had slashed its outbreak and crisis department by 51 percent and reduced its African regional office’s epidemic staff from 12 to four, according to a 2014 Reuters report.As the Ebola crisis began to unfold, WHO resources were disproportionately committed to fighting polio. A 2014 WHO study found that 38 percent of the organization’s 2,201 staffers in Africa were funded through polio funds the prior year. Polio was easily WHO’s best-funded program worldwide, with a budget of more than $700 million for 2014-15, over three times larger than the budget for outbreak and crisis response.Money follows money. The Gates Foundation had not only spent enormous sums of its own to underwrite polio eradication; it has also attracted others to the campaign. A Gates-orchestrated donor conference in Abu Dhabi in April 2013 garnered commitments of $4 billion from wealthy governments and private philanthropies, after the foundation primed the pump with $1.8 billion. With ample funding, polio’s place on the list of global health priorities rose — to the detriment of other efforts, such as childhood immunization for other potentially fatal but vaccine-preventable diseases like measles. A 2014 report from the polio program’s independent monitoring board warned that the program treated routine immunization “as a poor cousin” to its eradication efforts.The Gates Foundation’s role in elevating polio on WHO’s to-do list was “pretty significant,” Nils Daulaire, the former U.S. representative to the WHO executive board, said in a 2014 interview. “They have enormous influence in terms of pushing their priorities. So certainly the fact that Bill Gates took polio eradication as a personal priority and a personal challenge had a very meaningful impact on the global community and WHO’s decision to take this on as a major priority.”WHO leaders “have to make priority decisions all the time,” Daulaire added. “And those decisions are not autonomous. … A variety of key donors have a lot of influence in terms of what WHO does, [including] the U.S., the Gates Foundation, the European Union, the U.K., other major industrial economies.” Daulaire should know. In January 2014, he asked Director-General Chan to declare polio a public health emergency.Five months later, Chan did. WHO justified the declaration by citing “the international spread of polio to date in 2014.” At that point in the year, there had been just 65 polio cases in countries where the disease is endemic and just nine elsewhere. In the same period, nearly 250 people in two countries had already been diagnosed with Ebola — and 166 of them had died.WHO was notably slower in its response to Ebola. When SARS hit China in 2003, the organization had swiftly declared an emergency, sparking international efforts before the epidemic slipped beyond control. But not until Aug. 8, 2014 — three months after the polio declaration and more than four months after the first cases of Ebola were detected in West Africa — did WHO label the Ebola outbreak an emergency. Other issues also slowed the world’s reaction to Ebola, including a lack of trained medical teams able to deploy to the countries most in need. As that undersized response chased a growing outbreak, the cost ballooned. On July 27, news had broken that two American health care workers had contracted the virus in Liberia. Four days later, WHO announced the $100 million plan to “take the response to a new level,” Chan said. Over 700 people had died by then. “This will require increased resources,” she added. Frieden said the CDC was “surging” its response, noting that while “it will not be quick and it will not be easy, we do know how to stop Ebola.”The Gates Foundation hadn’t taken much action against Ebola at that juncture. Steve Landry, director of multilateral partnerships at the foundation, explained in a statement to HuffPost that emergency response “is not a core capacity of the Gates Foundation.” “We focus our global health investments on building long-term, sustainable access to health through the development of new products and by strengthening the delivery of proven, high-impact health interventions,” Landry said. The foundation designates approximately $20 million annually for emergency response grants, compared to total foundation disbursements of about $4 billion a year. Still, as a private entity, it can authorize and disburse funds faster than national governments or international organizations ― which is perhaps why one of Frieden’s first missives after touring Ebola-ravaged West Africa would go to the Gates Foundation. Initially, the foundation had lifted restrictions on an existing grant, allowing WHO to use those funds for Ebola. “[O]n the WHO front we had a request for funding and have given them latitude to tap into the strategic fund we have with them ― to be deployed as need[ed] so they should have enough funding for now,” wrote Trevor Mundel, the foundation’s president of global health, in a July 30 email to the directors of the U.K. philanthropy Wellcome Trust and the NIH. Mundel added that the foundation had also made “a smaller grant to Unicef for activities on the ground” of $1 million.Then on Aug. 4, health authorities in Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa, announced the first case transmitted within that country’s borders. Soon, there were 18 more cases in two Nigerian cities, Lagos and Port Harcourt, which have a combined population about as large as that of the three previously affected countries together. It was “the moment at which the world is at the edge of an abyss,” Frieden later told HuffPost.Nigeria rapidly quashed its local outbreak by identifying every person the infected traveler had met and isolating and testing those with symptoms. In written responses to HuffPost questions and in public statements, both WHO and the Gates Foundation attributed the success of Nigeria’s response to the vast system of disease surveillance it had created to eradicate polio. But this infrastructure was unique in the region. The current $5.5 billion polio eradication plan directs $1.5 billion to Nigeria as one of three major-focus countries in the world and the only one in Africa. Fortune magazine called the presence of the disease surveillance program there “one of the most important and lucky breaks in the fight against Ebola.”There were other measures that might have prevented the spread of Ebola into Nigeria in the first place. When WHO declares a public health emergency, it can compel member states to implement travel restrictions. The emergency declaration on polio, for instance, required travelers from Pakistan to show proof of polio vaccination. But absent a WHO-declared emergency, there had been no such requirement for Ebola screening in West Africa. On July 31, the CDC raised its travel warning for the region to the highest level and said it was “assisting with active screening and education efforts on the ground in West Africa to prevent sick travelers from getting on planes.” It turned out that by then, Ebola had already been in Nigeria for 11 days.On Aug. 6, the Gates Foundation publicly announced the $1 million it had already released to UNICEF to “help address the immediate need on the ground.” The grant would “provide critical medical and hygiene supplies, coordinate response efforts, and reach affected and at-risk communities with life-saving information,” Sue Desmond-Hellmann wrote in a blog post. But another post on the Gates website the following day downplayed the crisis. A Nigerian-born doctor warned that cerebro-spinal meningitis “could end up being far more destructive than the current Ebola epidemic” without the massive vaccination program the foundation was accustomed to sponsoring. “Unlike Ebola,” the author wrote, meningitis “can be easily prevented.”WHO’s Aug. 8 emergency declaration did little to change the funding shortage. “What you would expect is the whole world wakes up and goes, ‘Oh my gosh, this is a terrible problem, we have to deploy additional people and send money,’” WHO’s leading official for Ebola, Bruce Aylward, said in a 2015 Associated Press interview. Aylward had previously served as assistant director-general for polio and emergencies, but took the helm of the Ebola effort after the emergency declaration. Instead of pouring in resources, Aylward said, the world responded by imposing overly broad travel bans and isolating the affected region.By Aug. 15, the estimated human toll in the three most-affected countries had climbed past 2,000 cases and 1,000 deaths. Liberia, where the outbreak was accelerating the fastest, stepped up to commit $20 million to fight Ebola within its own borders — an incredible sum in a country where the entire health budget for that year was $11 million.Ebola had become a regular topic at White House press conferences and saturated international news. But WHO and the CDC, lacking both money and personnel, were still struggling to handle the crisis and to obtain more funds. Over email, Chan and Frieden agreed they would scale back their request for medical personnel on the ground — and even then, they didn’t expect to get what they asked for.“Our team in the field in Liberia thinks this estimate of need is very far below what the actual need is,” Frieden wrote Chan on Aug. 20. “This may be a moot point, however, since even getting the lower level of need met will be very difficult.”“You are exactly right, we feel this estimate falls short of the actual need,” Chan replied.That same day, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf ordered the military to quarantine an entire slum in the capital city of Monrovia in a desperate attempt to gain the upper hand on the outbreak. Some new estimates doubled the number of infected people in the city.“All agree numbers are much larger than reported,” Keiji Fukuda, WHO’s assistant director-general for health security, wrote to Frieden and Chan on Aug. 21. By that point, WHO was arranging for palliative care “under controlled conditions” — that is, planning for contained deaths to try to reduce the spread of the disease. (Fukuda did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) Frieden arrived in Liberia on Aug. 24. Just before returning to the U.S. a week later, he emailed the Gates Foundation’s Elias on Aug. 30, asking for an audience with Bill Gates. Less than an hour after arriving back in Atlanta on Sept. 1, he briefed President Obama by phone.Frieden and Elias exchanged emails over the next several days to set up a time to talk on the phone. Elias also offered to reroute a trip through Washington, D.C., to meet in person. Frieden declined, preferring to speak on the phone sooner.The two talked by phone on Sept. 6. (Asked later why he didn’t contact Bill Gates directly, Frieden said, “My route to connect to him is Chris.”) Money to insulate other countries from the Ebola threat topped Frieden’s list of needs. “Ideally there would be public sector dollars for this,” he wrote Elias the next day. “Foundation support to jumpstart it would be extraordinarily important.” At that time, the CDC had received no additional federal funds to battle the outbreak, making it difficult even to fly staff to West Africa, Frieden told HuffPost.Elias quickly moved new funds into the CDC Foundation, a nonprofit entity that allows private sector partners to support the CDC’s work. The money was “for you to use at your discretion without seeking prior permission,” he wrote Frieden on Sept. 7. But just as with UNICEF and WHO, the sums were not large. “I was thinking to start with $2 million,” Elias wrote.On Sept. 9, Frieden sent Elias a request on CDC Foundation letterhead seeking “at least $25 million” in outside support from foundations to fund emergency operations centers and border checkpoints in 57 countries in order to “harden” them against outbreaks. “Had these capabilities been in place in West Africa a year ago,” the proposal reads, “the outbreak would now be under control.” Foundation support could “jump-start progress while the remaining resources are identified.”Elias’ team responded to Frieden’s latest requests with impressive alacrity, pledging $50 million to the Ebola cause on Sept. 10. There was $5 million for WHO, $5 million for UNICEF and $2 million for the CDC. The rest went to various non-governmental entities operating in the region — such as Oxfam America, the Red Cross and the Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative — and to biomedical research. On Sept. 16, Scott Dowell, the foundation’s Ebola coordinator, wrote to Frieden that the foundation “would like to push hard for Ebola solutions, including a near term focus on hyper immune globulin production.” Frieden replied the same day clarifying the CDC’s top priorities for funding. “Actually, our top ask of [the foundation] is to ‘harden’ or help make more ‘fire-resistant’ the countries to which this might spread,” he wrote.If treatment with hyperimmune globulin — essentially, blood transfusions from Ebola survivors — had worked, it would have been a huge victory. At that point, however, hyperimmune globulin wasn’t known to be effective, and scientists would eventually determine that it didn’t work. According to information provided to HuffPost by the Gates Foundation, its largest single grant for Ebola, $11.2 million, funded a clinical trial testing the blood of Ebola survivors as a treatment.The Gates Foundation made another pledge in October, upping the total it directed toward the Ebola crisis to $75 million.A massive initiative to stop Ebola was finally launched in September — nearly half a year after the first reported cases. On Nov. 5, Obama requested $6 billion for the U.S. response, which, in an unprecedented move, would be headed by the Defense Department. Congress appropriated $5.4 billion in emergency funding the following month.That it took six months and more than 4,000 bodies to commit serious resources to Ebola struck many as a sign of major problems in the world health infrastructure. But Bill Gates sidestepped questions about the slow global response in a late September 2014 interview with Politico, calling the Ebola epidemic “very unique.” In an Oct. 6 blog post, he praised the effort made: “Although you can never move too fast at a time like this, it’s easy to forget just how much has been done.” And he defended the U.S. performance in an interview with news site Ozy later that month. “It’s amazing how the United States has responded to this,” he said.The next year, Gates reflected on those early difficulties in addressing the Ebola crisis. He wrote in a March 2015 New York Times op-ed that he hoped the experience would spur investment in public health systems, while also blaming the existing public health organizations. “[O]nce it became clear that a serious emergency was underway, trained personnel should have flooded the affected countries within days. Instead it took months,” he wrote. “Doctors Without Borders [Médecins Sans Frontières] deserves a lot of credit for mobilizing volunteers faster than any government did. But we should not count on nonprofit groups to mount a global response.”Gates did acknowledge in an April 2015 New England Journal of Medicine essay that WHO’s outbreak alert and response system “is severely understaffed and underfunded.” In the years since the epidemic, the Gates Foundation has committed more money and attention to emerging infectious diseases like Ebola. But its preference for ambitious eradication plans, technological solutions and working outside the U.N. system has endured. In 2015, the foundation committed $75 million to the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance network, or CHAMPS, which will help gather the data necessary to rapidly identify future outbreaks in poor countries. The CDC will act as a partner on that effort. More recently, the foundation committed $100 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, a new public-private organization to develop vaccines for emerging threats. The World Economic Forum and the governments of India and Norway are founding co-partners, while WHO holds only “observer” status. Guinea’s president, Alpha Condé, gave a qualified welcome to CEPI, speaking on a World Economic Forum panel with Bill Gates this past January. “Yes, we want vaccinations, but we believe with a better performing system, we will not need people to send us international experts,” he said. “We could do it ourselves.”Other health experts have echoed Condé. Earlier emphasis on the more mundane work of building up local health care systems “might have helped trigger more attention by other donors to ensuring countries build their core capacities in line with the International Health Regulations,” said Devi Sridhar, who co-authored a blue-ribbon panel report on the lessons of Ebola, in an email to HuffPost.The Gates Foundation is clear that it doesn’t want all the responsibilities of WHO’s job.“The Gates Foundation strongly believes that global health needs far outweigh available resources, and governments must play a leading role in providing affordable healthcare for their citizens and investing in [research and development] for new tools to fight disease,” said the foundation’s Landry in an email. “As a philanthropy, we concentrate our funding in areas where existing funds are insufficient, our support could have catalytic impact, and we can assume risks that others can’t.”“In response to Ebola, we had the capacity to provide fast, flexible funding to UNICEF, WHO, CDC and other first responders in August and September 2014,” said Landry. “Major donor governments like the United States and the United Kingdom then stepped in with the large-scale funding required to sustain the effort and bring the outbreak under control.”When the next health crisis hits, officials may again find themselves looking to the Gates Foundation and other private charities for similar help. Three years after Guinea first reported the Ebola outbreak, “the world remains grossly underprepared for outbreaks of infectious disease, which are likely to become more frequent in the coming decades,” according to a meta-analysis of post-Ebola studies published in January 2017. And President Trump and other Republicans are pushing to cut U.S. funding to international health efforts ― all but ensuring that private players will be expected to fill the void.Public funding remains critical to protecting public health, as Bill Gates has noted. “The key actor is the United States,” he said during a September 2014 panel on the Ebola outbreak and other global health challenges, “and the investments in a bipartisan way this country has stood behind for decades.” But private philanthropy, Gates added, is “on the rise” and “kind of a world of its own.”Philanthropists can wield influence without the pressure of elections. Under the Obama administration, Gates often visited the White House, meeting not only with the president but with the director of the Office of Management and Budget in the course of budget preparation. This March, Gates traveled again to Washington, where he talked with Trump and spoke out against reducing foreign aid. As on past visits, he also met with members of Congress, emphasizing the potential impact of budget cuts on programs that his foundation has backed, according to The Hill.Long before Trump’s election, Gates was asked if he might consider running for president. “No,” Gates answered. “I don’t think I’d be good at campaigning or even the kind of constraints you run into.” He preferred partnering with the people who get elected, he said, and having “the ability to learn every year” without the restriction of “a four-year limited term.” Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

His progressive platform, which includes support for a single-payer health care system, has helped to bring national attention to a special election for Montana’s only House seat, recently vacated by President Donald Trump’s interior secretary pick, Ryan Zinke.“To me, the war on drugs has been an abject failure,” Quist said when asked if he supported legalizing both medicinal and recreational marijuana. “I think the majority of Montanans and Americans agree they would like to see the decriminalization go forward and not criminalize people for something that should not be criminal.”Gianforte said he supported some access to medical marijuana but warned against legalization, comparing marijuana to more addictive drugs.The two candidates clashed over a wide range of issues in their only televised debate before the hotly contested May 25 special election.Gianforte, a tech millionaire who moved to the state from New Jersey, defended his wealth, amid recent reports of possible financial ties to Russian companies that received sanctions from the U.S.“This pejorative of a millionaire? Again, I’ve been clear: I’m in favor of prosperity. I’m an electrical engineer. Honestly, I think we have too many lawyers in Washington,” Gianforte said. “Maybe we need some more engineers. They’re trained to solve problems and we can actually do math, which is a desperately needed skill back there.”When Quist brought up the issue of Gianforte’s investments, Gianforte dismissed any concerns about them.“We have a broad range of investments. Anyone who invests in emerging markets around the world has investments in Russia,” he said. “This is a tiny portion of our portfolio.”Quist and Gianforte also staked out clear positions on Trump’s executive order to review national monument designations, which conservationists say could endanger public lands, a major issue in Montana. Both candidates have promoted themselves as advocates for preserving public lands.Quist warned that Trump’s order, which could affect at least two dozen monuments, could lead to their privatization.“People have worked on these monuments and some of these wilderness areas for years at a time, and they’re great economic boons for the areas that have them,” Quist said. “I really have deep concerns about this process, and I think the people of America are going to stand up against it.”Gianforte defended the order, attempting to thread a thin needle between environmental protection and resource extraction. “What we’re asking for is local input from the people,” Gianforte said. “This review process allows local input to occur.”On abortion and Planned Parenthood, Quist affirmed his pro-abortion rights views and condemned “the assault on women’s reproductive rights.” Gianforte said he supports defunding the organization, complaining that tax dollars are used to pay for abortion. (Most of the organization’s Title X federal funds actually go toward women’s health services that are not abortion.)“I don’t believe that organization has been a particularly good steward of resources,” Gianforte said.Libertarian candidate Mark Wicks compared himself and his opponents to cars, saying that Quist is similar to “a little half-ton pickup” and Gianforte a “luxury car.”“It’s really smooth and comfortable getting down the road. But at the end of the day, it just wants to be parked with the other luxury cars down at the country club,” Wicks said, before adding that, if elected, he would be “the work truck.”The Montana House race has drawn the interest of young Democrats hoping to make electoral gains amid a groundswell of anti-Trump activism.Quist got a boost earlier this month, when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced it would spend money in the race. But he reportedly turned down a visit from Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez, a source told HuffPost on Saturday. Quist has said he would welcome Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who previously announced that he would campaign with Quist as part of his efforts to expand the Democratic Party’s base. "

Tom Perriello (D-Va.) has had to defend a vote for an anti-abortion amendment in his race against Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59051beb1400001f00a9c9c7.jpeg?cache=t779EEPZ9X&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FAIRFAX, Va. ― In the first Virginia Democratic gubernatorial primary debate on Saturday evening, Virginia Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam declined to attack former Rep. Tom Perriello for a controversial anti-abortion vote Perriello made in Congress.Instead, both candidates emphasized their staunch support for abortion rights, promising to push back against restrictions proposed by the Republican-controlled Virginia legislature.“I strongly support a woman’s right to choose. I have long supported Roe v. Wade and believe that it’s not enough just to ensure that that right exists on paper, but that there is meaningful and affordable access to that right,” Perriello said.As a member of Congress in 2009, Perriello voted for the Stupak amendment, which would have barred federal funding from the Affordable Care Act from going toward insurance plans that cover abortions. He has since expressed “regret” for the vote, claiming he was trying to keep a promise to his constituents in a conservative district.Northam didn’t bring up Perriello’s vote on Saturday, despite making it an issue on the campaign trail. Instead, he used the debate to tout his advocacy for abortion rights, including fighting a trans-vaginal ultrasound bill as a state senator in 2012.“There is no excuse that a group of legislators ― by the way, most of them are men ― should be telling women what they should and shouldn’t be doing with their bodies. That needs to stop in Virginia,” Northam said.David Turner, a spokesman for Northam’s campaign, said Northam may still bring up Perriello’s voting record in the remaining four debates.“If Tom Perriello is going to minimize Ralph Northam’s role in blocking trans-vaginal ultrasound, we’re going to discuss his role in voting for a bill that Planned Parenthood said at the time was tantamount to banning abortion coverage,” Turner said.Perriello has criticized Northam for voting twice for former President George W. Bush, a staunch foe of abortion rights who appointed two opponents of Roe v. Wade to the Supreme Court. Northam, a pediatric neurologist from Norfolk, claims he was not attentive to politics at the time and would have voted differently knowing what he knows now.The two contenders’ strong stance on abortion rights comes as the Democratic Party struggles over whether to tolerate deviations from its pro-choice platform.Last week, reproductive rights activists, led by NARAL Pro-Choice America, criticized the Democratic National Committee and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for embracing Heath Mello, a mayoral candidate in Omaha, Nebraska, who backed abortion restrictions as a state lawmaker. (Mello has since declared that he would protect reproductive rights as mayor.)DNC Chair Tom Perez responded to the uproar with a statement publicly disagreeing with Mello and reaffirming the party’s strong commitment to abortion rights.Perriello’s vote for the Stupak amendment has so far done little to undermine his status as the progressive favorite in the race. As a young congressman, he developed a reputation for supporting the agenda of then-President Barack Obama, despite the growing contempt for the administration in his district. Perriello, now 42, went on to head the Center for American Progress action fund and serve as a State Department special envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa.Northam, 57, had all but locked up the Democratic nomination until the election of President Donald Trump inspired Perriello to jump in the race in January. The lieutenant governor enjoys the support of almost all of the Virginia Democratic establishment, including Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine.Perriello has also drawn national attention to the race, casting himself as the candidate best equipped to lead a state-level resistance to Trump’s policies. With hardline progressive positions like blanket opposition to the construction of oil and gas pipelines, he has attracted the support of high-profile progressives like Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).Northam has responded by tacking to the left and sprinkling his rhetoric with anti-Trump red meat. In his opening remarks, Northam declared that Virginians are both looking for someone willing to keep them safe and provide greater economic opportunities, as well as “someone who will stand up the narcissistic maniac on the other side of the Potomac River and not let him get near Virginia.”Perriello and Northam’s policy differences have blurred somewhat as the campaign has progressed. After Perriello came out in favor of gradually increasing Virginia’s minimum wage to $15 an hour ― the state currently abides by the federal minimum of $7.25 ― Northam followed suit.Yet Perriello’s agenda remains the more progressive of the two. He has proposed making pre-Kindergarten education universal in the state, as well as providing two free years of community college, paid for by a tax reform proposal that eliminates deductions for the wealthy. By contrast, Northam’s plan for free 2-year community college would require participants to dedicate two years to community service.The debate at Lanier Middle School on Saturday evening provided Perriello some opportunities to highlight these distinctions.Unlike Northam, Perriello has declined to accept campaign contributions from the mammoth, Richmond-based energy utility company Dominion. Dominion is hoping to construct the Atlantic Coastal pipeline, which Perriello opposes.Northam supports construction of the pipeline, but says he’s still for tough regulations. He sent a letter to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality backing a comprehensive review of the pipeline project’s environmental impact.In one of the tensest moments during the mostly genteel debate, Perriello pointedly asked Northam if he had consulted Dominion before sending the letter.“I’ve had a lot of discussions with a lot of different people, Tom,” Northam responded. “And I’m not gonna stand here on the witness stand with you and respond to what those discussions entail.”Most of the people in the audience appeared to have made up their minds as to whom they were supporting before the debate began, with many sporting stickers for their preferred candidate.“Ralph is the more appealing candidate because I feel like he understands Virginia very well given his experience and things that he’s done in state government already here. And I also feel like he has a unique perspective because he’s a veteran,” said Kia Thomas-Hamel, 42, of Fairfax, who is also a veteran. Northam has treated Thomas-Hamel’s son, who suffers from a rare neurological condition.Deep Sran, 45, came to the debate with two of his teenage students at the Loudoun School for the Gifted. Before the debate, he said he was undecided and leaning toward Perriello. Perriello’s performance not only won him over, it prompted him to donate to the campaign.“I was actually very impressed with Perriello in particular,” Sran said. “He’s talking about forward thinking when it comes to automation and consolidation.”The primary election will occur June 13. The most recent polling shows Perriello with a small lead.This article has been updated with perspectives from the audience of Saturday night’s debate."

It was one of over 300 such marches across the country and the world, and prior to marching en masse to the White House, the crowds braved sweltering heat and humidity on the National Mall. (Perhaps befittingly, the temperature of 91 degrees tied a 1974 heat record.)In our case, 600 marchers came from Massachusetts on 11 buses arranged by 350 Massachusetts; state organizations and colleges sent buses as well. Myriad environmental organizations hailing from other states as far away as Hawaii were represented, joined in protest against the climate-destroying measures instituted last month by President Donald Trump and his administration. Age ranges and nationalities (that also included many Native Americans in full traditional dress) made it a convergence that swelled to over 200,000 Vietnam-era to next-generation environmental advocates.On Thursday, in advance of Saturday's 100th day of the Trump administration, Democratic Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey unveiled the ""100 by '50 Act,"" legislation that would move the country off fossil fuels and toward a 100 percent renewable energy economy.Merkley and Markey were among Members of Congress and state and local officials who were joining the march. Along with Democrats Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez of New York, Senators Maria Cantwell of Washington and Tom Carper of Delaware, and Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts, they held a press event by the Capitol Reflecting Pool. The media advisory stated that they would urge action for jobs, justice and the climate.Merkley said the most important step for climate change is for attendees to bring the energy of the march to their communities. “We need to go to every organization we are part of, every city council, to fulfill this dream, overflow the phones, fill the mail slots, and please... run for office,” he said. “Let’s take this peoples’ power and build it right up — until we retake control of the building behind us.”Carper told the crowd that 70,000 clean energy and conservation jobs were created in America in the last year alone, and over the last 20 years, almost 3 million. “When someone tells you we can’t have both clean energy and jobs, I want you to say, ‘hogwash!’” he said.“Henry David Thoreau said, ‘what use is a home if you don’t have a tolerable planet to put it on?’” quoted Merkley, introducing Cantwell, who said that the time for climate change could not be more challenging. “After decades of progress...this administration is trying to roll back the policies that are going to save our planet in the future.” She posed a question for Trump: “Are you afraid of science?” and urged him to hire a “futurist.”Whitehouse gave a shoutout to Healey, saying that courts are a good place to talk about climate change: “When witnesses lie in court, they get punished; when lawyers lie in court, they get punished.” He cited three forms of pollution: In the atmosphere; and in our public debate, “due to spin and lies and calculated misinformation from a whole enterprise of science denial.” The third was “the pollution of that building behind us, with dark money, with unlimited Citizens United money, with the spending the fossil fuel industry is doing to protect a $700 billion dollar a year subsidy,” he said.“When people were unhappy with slavery, the abolitionist movement came here,” said Markey. “When women wanted to have the right to vote, the suffragettes came here. When the civil rights movement wanted a change in the laws so that African-Americans and all minorities had the same rights as white people in our country, they came here. They all said the same thing: ‘Free at Last, Free at Last, Thank God Almighty, We’re Free at Last.’”Markey said the green revolution is now saying this. “They will not stop this wind and solar revolution. They will not stop this all-electric vehicle revolution. They will not stop this energy efficiency revolution....The planet is running a fever; there are no emergency rooms for planets. The only way to do this correctly is to put the preventative programs in place, and renewable energy that will save the planet from a preventable death.” He promised to fight for science every day, “until Donald Trump is no longer the President of the United States.”Velázquez said it was shameful that the President, who comes from Manhattan, which is surrounded by water, could deny that climate change is an environmental issue. “This is an inspiration to see so many young people, seniors, women, blacks, Latinos, fighting,” she said, citing the hypocrisy of EPA head Scott Pruitt wanting to destroy that agency. “Not under our watch!” she said.Merkley called Healey one of the most powerful voices using the law to take on companies like ExxonMobil, and a real legal champion and force.“As states, we know how important this is. “We’ve done it before, and we’ll do it again,” said Healey.“To be clear, federal law requires those in power to protect our residents, to protect our environment, to protect clean air and water. We’ve sued them before, and we’ll sue them again,” she promised.”As the people’s lawyer to the people’s marchers,” she told the crowds, “let’s get out there, let’s raise our voices, and let’s send a message to Washington that no one is above the law, and this is about our planet, and humankind.”Healey spoke with HuffPost prior to the event. ""In Massachusetts, we care a lot about protecting the health and welfare of our residents,"" she said. ""It goes 10 years back, to when Massachusetts successfully sued the EPA under President George W. Bush. It is up to the states to help lead the way, when the current administration is taking us backwards and promoting an all-out assault on the environment and the economy.”Earlier this year, Healey won a major legal victory when she and New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman requested that ExxonMobil release 40 years of documentation on climate change that the company had withheld from its investors and consumers. She has emerged as a vocal and leading opponent of Trump’s controversial immigration, economic and environmental initiatives.Healey's political star has been on the rise. But when asked about her current stature, she attributed her victories to working with her predecessor Martha Coakley, under whom Healey served as the head of the Civil Rights Division, and later, as the Chief of the Public Protection and Business & Labor Bureaus. In that capacity, Healey successfully argued against the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).""Massachusetts has a tradition of leadership on economic, civil rights and environmental issues like clean tech and renewables,"" she told HuffPost. ""People look to our state to set an example."" Prior to the march, HuffPost spoke with Paul Getsos, who is the National Coordinator for the Peoples Climate Movement, the organization behind the 2014 Peoples Climate March in New York and the 2015 Global Climate March held on the eve of the Paris Climate Summit, as well as today's worldwide marches. ""We are here today to show that there is a strong and vibrant and broad-based movement that will resist [Trump’s] policies and attacks on the people, planet and our community,"" he said. According to the march press kit, famed speakers and celebrities were not on the agenda, so that the focus would remain on the community and its leaders. Getsos said that frontline members include workers, people of faith, students and youth. ""We are going to march to the White House, where we will surround it and sit around it in an actual sit in at approximately 2 p.m."" he said. ""From there, we will march to the Washington Monument, where we will do movement building activities,"" he said.Indeed, the current administration is an environmentalist's worst living nightmare, on a scale that is nearly unfathomable.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was the CEO of ExxonMobil, and said we would ""adapt"" to climate change.

As a Jew, he was consequently sent to a detention camp at Fossoli, which assembled all the various categories of persons no longer welcome in the recently established Fascist Republic. Two months later, following the inspection of a small squad of German SS men, he was loaded onto a train, together with all the other Jewish members of the camp, for expatriation from the Republic altogether. His destination, he was to learn, was Auschwitz; a name that at the time held no significance for him, but that initially provided a sense of relief, since it at least implied “some place on this earth”. Of the 650 who departed Fossoli that day, only three would return. Yet Levi’s magnificent testimony of the Lager, Se questo è un uomo (If This is a Man) – which he would compose in the immediate aftermath of the resumption of his life in Turin, and which was first published 70 years ago in 1947, making it one of the earliest eyewitness accounts we have – is far from a heroic description of his “survival in Auschwitz” (as the American title given to his text would have it). Although in an important sense it is also that. Indeed, what is striking about Levi’s contribution, still today, is the conspicuous absence of a heroic register from its pages, whose appropriateness in this context – which is in large part what Levi teaches us – must surely be as questionable as the temptation to invoke it is strong. With characteristic, but unsettling irony, it is the word fortune that appears instead in the very first sentence of his text (“It was my good fortune to be deported to Auschwitz only in 1944…”) and that sets the tone for all that follows. In the camp, it is not virtue that governs fortune; it is fortune that governs virtue.   Levi was sent to the detention camp at Fossoli after his capture. Jacqueline Poggi/Flickr, CC BY-SAIt is the original title of Levi’s book that in truth gives expression to what will be his principal concern. Yet this is easily misunderstood. It is not exactly a question, and certainly not one that solicits an answer. But it is not even a question whose answer would be provided by the text itself, which claims no such privilege. As we learn from the poem that opens the text, it must be understood instead to contain an implicit imperative: “Consider if this is man…” It is an order, a command (“I command these words to you”); one that is linked, moreover, to an imprecation: Carve them in your hearts … Repeat them to your children, Or may your house fall apart, May illness impede you, May your children turn their faces from you. It is thus an admonition that we (“You who live safe/In your warm houses”) not avert our gaze. But since Levi, remarkably, includes even himself in this category, it functions also as a kind of self-admonition.For the description of what Levi calls the “ambiguous life of the Lager” alters our understanding of the very structure of witnessing. And it does so by bringing to light the existence of a distinct oppositional pair much less evident in ordinary life: the drowned (i sommersi) and the saved (i salvati). In Auschwitz, all the ritual humiliations appeared as if designed to hasten the prisoner’s descent to what Levi termed “the bottom”. But this process was especially accelerated in the case of those he called the drowned: “they followed the slope down to the bottom, like streams that run down to the sea”. These were the prisoners who, for whatever reason (and the reasons were many), never adjusted to the brutal regimen of life in the camp; whose time in the camp was thus consequently very brief; yet whose number was apparently endless. In the jargon of the camp, these were the Muselmänner, the “Muslims”, whose tenuous existence, even prior to their imminent selection for the gas chamber, already hovered in an indistinct zone between life and death, human and non-human. These, according to Levi, were the ones who had truly seen all the way to the bottom: the ones who (as he would later powerfully record) had truly seen the Gorgon.With respect to the “anonymous mass” of the drowned, the number of the saved, on the other hand, was comparatively few. Yet by no means did it consist of the best, and certainly not of the elect. To invoke the guiding hand of providence in the midst of such atrocity was nothing short of abhorrent to Levi.   Primo Levi in the 1950s. Wikimedia CommonsHe is unflinching on precisely this delicate point: with rare exceptions, the saved comprised those who, in one way or another, whether through fortune or astuteness, had managed to gain some position of privilege in the structured hierarchy of the camp. More often than not, this entailed the renunciation of at least a part of the moral universe that existed outside the camp. Not that the saved, any more than the drowned, are to be judged on this account. As Levi insists, words such as good and evil, just and unjust, quickly cease to have any meaning on this side of the barbed wire. It was nonetheless his conviction that those who had not fathomed all the way to the bottom could not be the true witnesses. Yet far from invalidating the survivor’s testimony this made it all the more urgent. According to Levi, it is the saved who must bear witness for the drowned, but also to the drowned. For in him is mirrored what he himself saw. “Consider if this is a man…”: the imperative issued by Levi’s text is thus not that one should persist in seeing the human in the inhuman. It is more like its opposite: that one bear must witness to the inhuman in the human. And that our humanity in some sense depends on this.Nicholas Heron, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities, The University of QueenslandThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

74,POLITICS,Trump’s Tax Plan Is An Assault On Working Families,"Rep. Terri Sewell, ContributorRep. Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) is serving her fourth term represe...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-tax-plan-is-an-assault-on-working-families_us_59036608e4b084f59b49f874,"When the Trump administration says that the tax cuts our President proposed this week would be historic, they’re right in one sense.",2017-04-30,"<p>President Trump speaks at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590380791c00001600e82458.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the Trump administration says that the tax cuts our president proposed this week would be historic, they’re right in one sense. The plan president Trump put forward on Wednesday is one of the worst legislative proposals for working families in recent history.I agree that today’s tax code is in need of reform. Working American families need relief, American small businesses need help to compete in an increasingly global economy, and many of our nation’s wealthiest individuals use loopholes to avoid paying their fair share. Congress needs to find bipartisan, workable solutions for genuine tax reform that help all Americans make ends meet, and I am ready to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to make that happen.But President Trump’s tax plan fails to address our biggest economic challenges all while increasing the burden on low- and middle-income families by raising the deficit and laying the foundation for massive budget cuts.Out of the trillions of dollars in tax cuts that Trump proposed this week, nearly all of that money would end up in the pockets of America’s highest income households and corporations, like Trump and his family.By any measure, the president’s tax plan proposes massive giveaways to high-income individuals. For example, president Trump’s plan recommends dropping the top individual tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent – a change that would apply only to individuals making over $400,000 each year. President Trump would also scrap the Alternative Minimum Tax, a tax provision meant to ensure that the richest Americans pay their fair share. On top of that, Trump’s plan would also eliminate a tax created under the Affordable Care Act which applies only to individuals making over $200,000.Every day I’m honored to represent Alabama’s 7th District, which includes many underserved communities in the rural south. The average income in my district for a family of four is just $34,000 annually, and only one percent of the families in my congressional district make over $200,000.That means that more than 99 percent of the constituents in my district would see zero benefit from lowering the top income tax bracket and eliminating the healthcare tax.But Trump’s tax cuts don’t just target wealthy individuals, high-earning corporations are the other main beneficiaries of this week’s proposal. The Trump tax plan calls for reducing the corporate tax rate and “pass-through” tax rate to 15 percent, a proposal that helps wealthy corporations far more than the mom-and-pop businesses in Alabama’s 7th District.The real impact Trump’s tax proposal would have on my constituents comes in the form of a ballooning deficit and future cuts to essential government programs.The non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says that the Trump tax plan would reduce federal tax revenue by $3 trillion to $7 trillion over the next decade. At the high end, that represents over a third of our nation’s annual GDP.Attempting to balance those losses in the federal budget could be disastrous. Already President Trump’s proposed budget targets programs that many constituents in my district rely on, like Meals on Wheels and Community Development Block Grants. Together, these initiatives help to keep our seniors from going hungry and our infrastructure from deteriorating.But the elimination of programs like these does not even come close to paying for the $7 trillion in tax cuts proposed in Trump’s tax plan.To put $7 trillion of debt in perspective, consider that Social Security costs our nation about $900 billion annually, or that we spend about $600 billion annually to fund the United States military. Trying to balance $7 trillion in revenue loss doesn’t just mean cutting to the bone of our most important federal programs, it means cutting off limbs.President Trump is known for speaking in hyperbole, whether he’s discussing the size of his electoral victory or defending his claims that Mexico will pay for a border wall. But to call his tax plan “reform” is one of Trump’s greatest exaggerations to date.True reform means making our child tax credit refundable to provide struggling parents with the help they need raising a family. Reform means building a tax code that focuses relief on our nation’s small businesses and allows our workforce to compete in a global marketplace. Reform is about helping families make ends meet, giving entrepreneurs the leg up they need, and putting our country on solid financial footing. Instead, President Trump’s tax plan offers our nation’s wealthiest families the tax break of a lifetime. This tax plan isn’t just a missed opportunity, it actively works against reform by raising the deficit and laying the groundwork for damaging budget cuts.I know that this Congress can do better. Regardless of party, I believe that every lawmaker wants the best for their constituents and for the future of our country, because that is what brought me to Congress. I urge President Trump to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to craft legislation that gives all Americans the opportunity to succeed in today’s economy.My constituents have too much at stake and deserve nothing less."

As it turned out, with only 46% of the electorate voting for him, his victory fell far short of a mandate.That’s not to say he is without one, however. There is one set of issues on which the American people have given the President very clear direction. In response, he has worked tirelessly in his first 100 days to put the country on the opposite course.The President’s mandate consists of three interconnected parts: protect the environment, make renewable energy a higher priority than fossil fuels, and collaborate with the international community to prevent catastrophic climate disruption. These marching orders have been expressed through many credible public opinion polls. While Trump’s own election proved that polls are not infallible, good-quality polling is the best tool we have to understand the American people’s priorities between elections. So what have the people been saying?Environmental protection: Before the election, 74% of American adults told pollsters “the country should do whatever it takes to protect the environment”. The strength of that priority has been consistent for at least 20 years. In addition, polling by the Yale Project on Climate Change Communications showed that 69% of the American people want strict limits on CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants and 75% of adults want CO2 regulated as a pollutant. Research released last February found that nearly 60% of Trump voters say environmental protection should be a higher priority than oil, coal and gas production. Instead, Trump has initiated the greatest rollback of environmental protection in the nation’s history. He has taken steps to prevent limits on carbon pollution from power plants and methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure. Both are potent gases that accelerate global warming. In line with his campaign promise to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency, Trump has proposed that the agency’s budget be cut by 31%. Energy priorities: In January, the Pew Research Center found that 65% of Americans want renewable energy resources like wind and solar to be a higher priority than expanding oil, gas and coal production. Only 27% said the country should emphasize fossil fuels. Gallup found in March that nearly three-quarters of Americans (71%) agreed that alternative energy should be the nation’s highest priority. Instead, Trump has embraced a “drill baby drill” and “dig baby dig” energy policy. He has promised to revive the coal industry. In March, he issued an executive order directing the review of all federal regulations that “potentially burden” the production of oil, gas and coal. He is permitting the expansion of oil and gas drilling in the Arctic, off America’s coasts, and on public lands including wilderness areas currently protected as national monuments.The Paris agreement: In 2015, weeks before nearly 200 nations reached an international climate agreement in Paris, 63% of the American people including a majority of Republicans said they wanted the United States to sign on. After last fall’s election, 71% of the American people, including 57% of Republicans and 69% of registered voters said that the United States should remain in the Paris climate deal. Instead, Trump is considering withdrawing America from the agreement. Energy Secretary Rick Perry says he thinks the United States should remain a signatory but renegotiate the accord – an unrealistic prospect since it has been signed by 196 other countries as the result of more than 20 years of deliberations. Climate Change: In 2016, pollsters at the Yale Project reported that 70% of the American people acknowledge that global warming is already underway, 53% said it is caused by human activities and 71% said they trust climate scientists. Gallup found last month that “Americans are now expressing record- or near-record-high belief that global warming is happening, as well as concern about the issue.” The Yale Project has found that 51% of the public believes that climate change is already harming people in the U.S. and 70% say climate change will harm future generations. More than 60% of voters say Trump should not remove regulations designed to limit climate change. Nevertheless, while trying to upsize fossil energy production and downsize pollution controls, Trump has repealed at least six of President Obama’s orders that addressed climate change including Obama’s comprehensive climate action plan, the core of America’s commitments to the international community. Among the orders that Trump has rescinded were several that directed federal agencies to prepare for the impacts of climate change, ensuring that the government is ill-equipped to deal with the increasingly severe and disruptive effects of global warming.Energy research: 82% of the Americans polled by the Yale Project, including 71% of Trump voters, want more research on renewable resources. In another poll, 72% said it is a “bad idea” to cut funding for science research on the environment and climate change. Nevertheless, Trump has proposed devastating budget cuts for research at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the ARPA-E energy research program at DOE, atmospheric research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA’s earth science program, which studies climate changes and tracks its impacts. At the beginning of April, Gallup asked whether President Trump is doing a good job protecting the environment. Only 36% of the respondents said yes. Gallup asked whether the president is improving the nation’s energy policy. Only 46% said yes. To put it mildly in the words of one analyst, Trump’s actions so far have been “at odds with public opinion in America and…counter to market forces shaping the energy industry.” If President Trump wants a mandate, he has one. But in his first 100 days, he has done everything in his power to ignore it."

Dr. Travis Bradberry reveals the 10 they never make twice.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5900de601c00003c00e81daf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Everybody makes mistakes—that’s a given—but we don’t always learn from them. Sometimes we make the same mistakes over and over again, fail to make any real progress, and can’t figure out why.“Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.” – Bruce Lee When we make mistakes, it can be hard to admit them because doing so feels like an attack on our self-worth. This tendency poses a huge problem because new research proves something that common sense has told us for a very long time—fully acknowledging and embracing errors is the only way to avoid repeating them.Yet, many of us still struggle with this.Researchers from the Clinical Psychophysiology Lab at Michigan State University found that people fall into one of two camps when it comes to mistakes: those who have a fixed mind-set (“Forget this; I’ll never be good at it”) and those who have a growth mind-set (“What a wake-up call! Let’s see what I did wrong so I won’t do it again”).“By paying attention to mistakes, we invest more time and effort to correct them,” says study author Jason Moser. “The result is that you make the mistake work for you.” Those with a growth mind-set land on their feet because they acknowledge their mistakes and use them to get better. Those with a fixed mind-set are bound to repeat their mistakes because they try their best to ignore them.Smart, successful people are by no means immune to making mistakes; they simply have the tools in place to learn from their errors. In other words, they recognize the roots of their mix-ups quickly and never make the same mistake twice.“When you repeat a mistake it is not a mistake anymore: it is a decision.” – Paulo Coelho Some mistakes are so tempting that we all make them at one point or another. Here are 10 mistakes almost all of us make, but smart people only make once.#1 - Believing in someone or something that’s too good to be true. Some people are so charismatic and so confident that it can be tempting to follow anything they say. They speak endlessly of how successful their businesses are, how well liked they are, who they know, and how many opportunities they can offer you. While it’s, of course, true that some people really are successful and really want to help you, smart people only need to be tricked once before they start to think twice about a deal that sounds too good to be true. The results of naivety and a lack of due diligence can be catastrophic. Smart people ask serious questions before getting involved because they realize that no one, themselves included, are as good as they look.#2 - Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Albert Einstein said that insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. Despite his popularity and cutting insight, there are a lot of people who seem determined that two plus two will eventually equal five. Smart people, on the other hand, need only experience this frustration once. The fact is simple: if you keep the same approach, you’ll keep getting the same results, no matter how much you hope for the opposite. Smart people know that if they want a different result, they need to change their approach, even when it’s painful to do so.#3 - Failing to delay gratification. We live in a world where books instantly appear on our e-readers, news travels far and wide, and just about anything can show up at our doorsteps in as little as a day. Smart people know that gratification doesn’t come quickly and hard work comes long before the reward. They also know how to use this as motivation through every step of the arduous process that amounts to success because they’ve felt the pain and disappointment that come with selling themselves short.#4 - Operating without a budget.You can’t experience financial freedom until you operate under the constraint of a budget. Sticking to a budget, personally and professionally, forces us to make thoughtful choices about what we want and need. Smart people only have to face that insurmountable pile of bills once before getting their act together, starting with a thorough reckoning as to where their money is going. They realize that once you understand how much you’re spending and what you’re spending it on, the right choices become clear. A morning latte is a lot less tempting when you’re aware of the cost: $1,000 on average per year. Having a budget isn’t only about making sure that you have enough to pay the bills; smart people know that making and sticking to a strict budget means never having to pass up an opportunity because they’ve blown their precious capital on discretionary expenditures. Budgets establish discipline, and discipline is the foundation of quality work.#5 - Losing sight of the big picture. It’s so easy to become head-down busy, working so hard on what’s right in front of you that you lose sight of the big picture. But smart people learn how to keep this in check by weighing their daily priorities against a carefully calculated goal. It’s not that they don’t care about small-scale work, they just have the discipline and perspective to adjust their course as necessary. Life is all about the big picture, and when you lose sight of it, everything suffers.#6 - Not doing your homework. Everybody’s taken a shortcut at some point, whether it was copying a friend’s biology assignment or strolling into an important meeting unprepared. Smart people realize that while they may occasionally get lucky, that approach will hold them back from achieving their full potential. They don’t take chances, and they understand that there’s no substitute for hard work and due diligence. They know that if they don’t do their homework, they’ll never learn anything—and that’s a surefire way to bring your career to a screeching halt.#7 - Trying to be someone or something you’re not. It’s tempting to try to please people by being whom they want you to be, but no one likes a fake, and trying to be someone you’re not never ends well. Smart people figure that out the first time they get called out for being a phony, forget their lines, or drop out of character. Other people never seem to realize that everyone else can see right through their act. They don’t recognize the relationships they’ve damaged, the jobs they’ve lost, and the opportunities they’ve missed as a result of trying to be someone they’re not. Smart people, on the other hand, make that connection right away and realize that happiness and success demand authenticity.#8 - Trying to please everyone.Almost everyone makes this mistake at some point, but smart people realize quickly that it’s simply impossible to please everybody and trying to please everyone pleases no one. Smart people know that in order to be effective, you have to develop the courage to call the shots and to make the choices that you feel are right (not the choices that everyone will like).#9 - Playing the victim. News reports and our social media feeds are filled with stories of people who seem to get ahead by playing the victim. Smart people may try it once, but they realize quickly that it’s a form of manipulation and that any benefits will come to a screeching halt as soon as people see that it’s a game. But there’s a more subtle aspect of this strategy that only truly smart people grasp: to play the victim, you have to give up your power, and you can’t put a price on that.#10 - Trying to change someone. The only way that people change is through the desire and wherewithal to change themselves. Still, it’s tempting to try to change someone who doesn’t want to change, as if your sheer will and desire for them to improve will change them (as it has you). Some even actively choose people with problems, thinking that they can “fix” them. Smart people may make that mistake once, but then they realize that they’ll never be able to change anyone but themselves. Instead, they build their lives around genuine, positive people and work to avoid problematic people that bring them down.Bringing It All TogetherEmotionally intelligent people are successful because they never stop learning. They learn from their mistakes, they learn from their successes, and they’re always changing themselves for the better.Do you operate from a growth mind-set or a fixed mind-set?

The manic fandom typically reserved for Comic-Con and “Star Wars” assemblies was front and center when Francis Ford Coppola and the cast reunited Saturday at the Tribeca Film Festival’s closing night. Capping off a nine-hour event that included screenings of “The Godfather” and “The Godfather Part II,” a 45th-anniversary panel discussion found Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, James Caan, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall recounting the messy process of making a movie they never expected to become such a defining Hollywood signature.The sold-out crowd at Radio City Music Hall had been boisterous throughout both films, cheering at iconic dialogue and almost every gruesome death or Corleone victory. Just imagine how enthusiastic they were by the time this A-list group took the stage. “The Godfather” is one of the most chronicled movies in history, as proven by the nearly 800-page annotated book Coppola published last year. Much of Saturday’s panel retread well-told stories: Paramount’s resistance to casting the crotchety Marlon Brando, the studio threatening to fire Coppola out of fear that his directorial choices would jeopardize the success, the fateful single take in which Coppola added a cat to the opening scene. Frenzy erupted when moderator Taylor Hackford asked the audience to shout out questions. One fan posed something that further explained the film’s fervent following: Could “The Godfather” be made today?The answer, according to Coppola, is no.Well, it could be made, he said, but it would be an offer major studios would have to refuse.The first “Godfather” cost $6.5 million, Coppola explained. That’s the equivalent of about $38 million today, which would make it a mid-budget project in a market that’s overrun by tentpole titles costing well over $100 million apiece, he said. The “Godfather Part II” budget swelled to “$11 or $12 million,” or about $64 to $70 million nowadays. “It would never get through the process of getting an OK, or what they now call a green-light,” Coppola said. Contemporary Hollywood studios, he pointed out, are mostly interested in movies with built-in franchise potential ― “pretty much a Marvel comic,” a comment that provoked chuckles from the audience. “Basically there’s not enough wires,” Caan joked, referring to the suspension technique used to film superheroes and Hogwarts wizards in flight. Coppola and Caan’s assessment is painfully accurate: Original movies are no longer Hollywood’s breadwinners. The mid-budget adult release ― ranging from about $10 million to $70 million ― has become something of a relic over the past 15 years, replaced instead by comic-book adaptations, reboots and pre-determined cash cows. Even though it’s based on the popular novel by Mario Puzo, were Coppola to pitch “The Godfather” today, he would have a tough time securing the funds and support needed. The first installment made $245 million worldwide, which today amounts to $1.4 billion. For a film without animation or dazzling technical effects, that seems impossible in 2017.Coppola said former MGM owner Kirk Kerkorian once asked how one makes a movie that is both financially and artistically successful. “I said to him, ‘Risk,’” he said. “Nobody wants the risk when you get into business.”"

It’s the 30th movie in history ― and the second in the franchise, after 2015’s “Furious 7” ― to join the billionaires’ club. “The Fate of the Furious” pulled this off after just 17 days in theaters, the same amount it took “Furious 7.” The year’s first billion-dollar release, “Beauty and the Beast,” required almost a month to hit that mark. “Fate” is also the highest-grossing film directed by an African-American. This news comes as no surprise, given the increasing international fervor surrounding these high-octane movies. Since “Fast & Furious,” the fourth movie in the series, was released in 2009, each installment has outpaced its predecessor domestically and globally. Universal, which is enjoying a bang-up year at the box office thanks to “Fate,” “Get Out” and “Split,” already has two more “Fast and the Furious” sequels planned, and studio executives have reportedly discussed a potential spin-off surrounding Dwayne Johnson’s and Jason Statham’s characters. Plus, as we pointed out a couple of weeks ago, “The Fate of the Furious” introduces a certain baby who could extend the story’s shelf life far beyond its current expiration date. Other franchises with multiple $1 billion earners include “Star Wars,” “The Avengers,” “Transformers” and “Pirates of the Caribbean.”In other weekend box-office news, “How To Be a Latin Lover” opened to a decent $12 million, while the big-screen adaptation of Dave Eggers’ popular cyber-panic novel “The Circle” collected $9.1 million, a drowsy figure for a title released on more than 3,000 screens. The weekend’s big surprise was the Indian fantasy “Baahubali 2: The Conclusion,” which took in an estimated $10 million despite a mere 425-theater opening. The rest of the Top 10 includes “The Boss Baby,” “Beauty and the Beast,” “Going in Style,” “Gifted,” “Smurfs: The Lost Village” and “Born in China.”"
