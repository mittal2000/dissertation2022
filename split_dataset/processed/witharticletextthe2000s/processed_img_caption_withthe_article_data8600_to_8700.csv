Becker, ContributorEnergy & Climate Policy Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/who-charmed-whom_us_59712884e4b0f1feb89b424c,The Associated Press reports that French President Emmanuel Macron has been reminiscing about his meetings with Donald Trump,2017-07-21,<p>President Trump has proposed a major budget cut for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado. But the Lab could help him reenter the Paris climate accord. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5971298b2100001900fc7f90.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Associated Press reports that French President Emmanuel Macron has been reminiscing about his meetings with Donald Trump, including their conversation about the Paris climate accord. Macron hopes his “glamorous Paris charm offensive” changed the U.S. president's mind about climate change.Probably not. In a joint news event with Macron, Trump responded weakly, “If (rejoining the accord) happens, that will be wonderful, and if it doesn’t that will be OK too.” Perhaps he did the charming and convinced Macron that there is still a chance the United States will come back to the table. Those who are familiar with Trump’s style have seen this kind of “maybe, maybe not” position before. The President likes to leave us guessing with statements that create an expectation he doesn’t intend to fulfill. Another recent example was his hint in June that there might be tape recordings of his conversations with former FBI Director James Comey. Trump left the press and the country in suspense for two weeks before he admitted that no such tapes exist.Let’s play along, however, and assume that Trump really is open to reentering the Paris accord if the U.S. commitment is to his liking. What might that commitment include? Energy savings in federal agencies: Last March, President Trump ordered all federal agencies to improve government efficiency by identifying where they can eliminate unnecessary offices and programs.Unfortunately, the order ignored one of the quickest and most effective ways the government can increase its efficiency and reduce wasteful spending. The President can make sure the Executive Branch continues to improve the energy efficiency of its 600,000 vehicles and 350,00 buildings. The federal government is the nation’s biggest energy consumer. Its energy bill last year was more than $16 billion. Previous congresses and administrations have created energy standards and goals for federal agencies, including an ambitious and comprehensive executive order that President Barack Obama signed in 2009. Among other sustainability goals, it directed federal agencies to reduce their energy use 3% annually. By 2016, the inflation-adjusted federal energy bill had dropped to its lowest level in more than 40 years. The problem is, Trump’s energy policy focuses on producing and consuming rather than conserving fossil fuels. In another executive order he directs agencies to remove any “regulatory burdens” to the production of domestic fossil energy resources. His America First energy plan promotes an increase in production from the nation’s shale, oil and natural gas reserves, along with the revival of the coal industry. It mentions nothing about improving energy efficiency. In a new Paris plan, Trump could embrace and enforce the 3% goal. He could make sure that the Department of Energy’s Federal Energy Management Program, which provides technical assistance and training to agencies on energy efficiency measures, is fully funded. The President does not have to mention global climate change. But an important byproduct would be a significant reduction in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Energy efficiency in the U.S. armed forces: The Pentagon often is treated separately from the rest of government because of its size and unique mission. However, it is the biggest energy user within the federal system. It accounted for 78% of the government’s energy expenses in 2016 and 1% of America’s total electric consumption in 2015. Its electric bill that year was $4 billion. Energy waste takes money away from the military’s principal missions. That has an adverse impact on national security. A recent study commissioned by Pew Charitable Trusts found that the Department of Defense could reduce its energy consumption up to 35% and save $1 billion annually. That goal is in line with President Trump’s objective to increase funding for U.S. forces. Trump should also embrace the Pentagon’s commitment to obtain 25% of its energy from clean resources by 2025. Soon after he took office, senior military officials said they plan to “forge ahead under the new administration with a decade-long-effort to convert its fuel-hungry operations to renewable power.”Trump has not shown much enthusiasm for renewable energy, but in the same way he has delegated war-fighting decisions to military leaders, he should defer to the Pentagon to set its own energy goals, including greater reliance on renewable resources. Once again, the unstated co-benefit would be reductions in greenhouse gas pollution.Climate action by state and local governments: After President Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord, an encouraging number of states and localities said they would help keep the United States’ original commitment to reduce carbon emissions 26% by 2025 compared to 2005.In a nod to states’ rights, the President could keep the federal programs that help states and cities achieve their clean energy and carbon reduction objectives. In general, states and cities do not have the wherewithal to provide those services locally. An example is the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Colorado. Trump has proposed devastating budget cuts for the lab and its parent agency, DOE’s Office of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. States and localities cannot replicate the research and technical help provided by this 40-year-old world-class laboratory. Again, Trump need not base full funding on curbing climate change. Rather, he can focus on how the laboratory does joint research with American companies and offers technical assistance to states and localities. A growing number of them value indigenous renewable energy for cleaner air, greater energy autonomy, and more attractive business climates.Meantime, DOE, EPA and several other agencies can comply with Trump’s reorganization directive by figuring out how to consolidate the government’s disorganized or duplicative energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The programs currently are scattered across several departments and agencies. A 30% improvement in U.S. energy productivity. If American businesses are to be competitive in world markets, they must be as efficient and productive as possible. Energy productivity – the amount of energy used to produce a unit of goods or services – is one of the ways to keep prices down and profits up and to acquire the capital needed to expand plant and equipment, raise worker salaries and/or create additional jobs. A bipartisan commission organized by the Alliance to Save Energy (ASE) has developed a detailed strategy to improve national energy productivity 30% by 2030. The Department of Energy should partner actively with the ASE to get this done.Unleashed energy markets:  Free-market advocates rail against the government picking winners. They are vocal in their opposition to federal subsidies for solar energy, wind energy and other renewable energy resources, but we do not hear the same opposition to the many longstanding federal subsidies for fossil fuels. If the government is not to pick winners, it must either subsidize all energy resources equally or none at all. President Trump should twist congressional arms to phase out fossil energy subsidies on the same timetable Congress has established for ending renewable energy subsidies. Support for renewables: Let’s get real. Renewable energy is here to stay. Oil companies are beginning to accept this and to recognize that they should be investing in these rapidly emerging technologies rather than fighting them as threats to their industry. After analyzing current global energy trends, the director of research at Wood Mackenzie has concluded, “The momentum behind these [renewable] technologies is unstoppable now. They [the oil companies] are recognizing it is a megatrend; it’s not a fad, it’s not going away. There is definitely a risk to their core business.”President Trump would do the industry a favor by encouraging rather than discouraging its investment in renewables. For starters, he should issue the same directive to federal agencies as he issued regarding fossil fuels: The feds should remove any regulatory burdens to the production of energy from renewable resources. ***If you have read this far, then you may be an energy policy enthusiast with your own ideas about how President Trump could reenter the Paris agreement with substantive commitments that keep faith with right-of-center values.

Passed by former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, HB 2 institutionalized discrimination against transgender people by forcing them to use the public restroom that corresponds with the gender they were assigned at birth. It also set a precedent for a wave of similar pieces of legislation in other states across America.McCroy’s successor, Gov. Roy Cooper, and other lawmakers passed House Bill 142 earlier this year, a move that essentially replaced discriminatory HB 2 with a different kind of anti-trans discrimination. According to Buzzfeed News, HB 142 did two different things: “It blocked cities and counties from banning LGBT discrimination until 2020, and it prevented those local jurisdictions from enacting ordinances that let transgender people use restrooms matching their gender identity.” In other words, under HB 142, local government in North Carolina may not pass or amend LGBTQ anti-discrimination legislation for another three years.“After publicly vilifying transgender people for more than a year, legislators can’t just abandon transgender people to fend for themselves in the toxic environment of fear and animosity that the legislature itself created. HB 142 doubles down on many of the worst harms of HB 2 and leaves transgender people in a legal limbo where they remain uniquely vulnerable to discrimination,” said Lambda Legal counsel Tara Borelli. “Transgender people face an impossible situation where no door leads to safety. Anyone would find that intolerable.”Head here to read the amended lawsuit in full."

But one TLC star is hoping to break the silence around this topic.Adam Busby and his wife, Danielle, are stars of the TLC docuseries “Outdaughtered,” which follows their adventures raising six young daughters ― including the first all-girl quintuplets in the U.S.On the show, the dad has spoken about his emotional struggles after welcoming the quintuplets. On Tuesday, Busby opened up about his struggle with PPD on Twitter, in response to a tweet from a fan. Citing the statistic that around 10 percent of new dads experience PPD, Busby tweeted, “No one wants to talk about it though...”He added, “It’s not fun to talk about, but if me talking about this helps any dads out there then it’s all worth it.” Busby’s wife, Danielle, expressed her support for her husband on Twitter as well.Katherine Stone, founder of the blog and non-profit, Postpartum Progress, spoke to HuffPost about PPD in men in 2015. She said there’s a lack of awareness around this issue because people don’t realize men can get postpartum depression and the non-hormonal risk factors, like stress and sleep deprivation.Stone encourages men who’ve experienced PPD to talk openly about it.“It’s not silencing the voices of women and what they go through,” she said. “It’s just adding to the conversation in terms of what dads may experience.”H/T Romper"
3,POLITICS,Texas Senate’s First Day Of ‘Bathroom Bill’ Hearings Marked By Scathing Testimony,Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-bathroom-bill-hearing_us_59720c20e4b0e79ec198bde3,"""Sen. Kolkhorst might as well argue that black people be banned from the bathroom because rapists might wear blackface,"" one speaker said.",2017-07-21,"Transgender activist and San Antonio architect Ashley Smith speaks at a rally against the so-called “bathroom bill” being considered by the Republican-dominated Texas Senate at the Texas Capitol in Austin, Texas, U.S., July 21, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59724b9f1a00003300dbffa1.jpeg?cache=zgicplaQiz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you’re opposed to Texas’ proposed “bathroom bill,” you’ll have to get in line.Literally. After Texas’ Senate Committee on State Affairs opened the floor to public input on Senate Bill 3 on Friday, clerks said more than 230 people signed up to testify.With two minutes of speaking time allotted to each person, there could be over seven and a half hours of comment. In the first few hours, the vast majority of speakers came out against the bill.Reporters on the scene captured the long line of speakers snaking around a corner, down a flight of steps and down the hall.SB 3 would prevent trans people in Texas from using bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity, instead forcing them to use bathrooms that align with the gender they were assigned on their birth certificate.This is Texas’ second go at forcing through the bill this session. An earlier attempt during the regular session in April failed spectacularly, prompting Lt. Governor Dan Patrick (R), who introduced the bill, to block other must-pass legislation, thereby forcing a special session.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) named SB 3 a priority when he opened the 30-day special session on Tuesday.In opening remarks on Friday, the bill’s sponsor, state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst (R) portrayed the legislation as an effort to protect women, regardless of how much it might cost the state in terms of lost business.“I put daughters before dollars,” Kolkhorst said. On Twitter, she claimed the bill bolsters privacy while also protecting “women’s rights & female athletes.”Kolkhorst framed SB 3 as an extension of Title IX, the federal law that mandates equal opportunity for men and women, and says trans women have an unfair advantage in sports.Critics have dismissed that argument as absurd. “Do we really think that trans kids are transitioning to win local High School track meets?” Rebecca Marques, a strategist at the ACLU of Texas, asked on Twitter.Ashley Smith, one of the first women to testify on Friday, said the bill would force her to use the men’s restroom ― because Alabama, the state where she was born, won’t allow her to change the sex on her birth certificate.“What about my safety?” she asked during testimony. “There are people out there who hate me.”Last Saturday, Abbott posed for a photo with Smith, which went viral after she used it to criticize SB 3.“How will the Potty Police know I’m transgender if the Governor doesn’t?” Smith asked in the photo’s caption.If, as Kolkhorst maintains, SB 3 is intended to enshrine privacy by keeping men out of women’s bathrooms, one trans man told lawmakers it will be counterproductive. Rather than use the men’s room, as he does currently, SB 3 would actually force him to begin using facilities for women.“If the goal of these bills is to keep men out of women’s facilities,” he said, “you’re doing it wrong.”Others in the crowd held signs making similar arguments.“Sen. Kolkhorst might as well argue that black people be banned from the bathroom because rapists might wear blackface,” an SB 3 opponent argued.Another witness testified that trans people need more legal protections, not fewer. “Trans people are not the ones committing sexual violence,” said Austin resident Nia Goldstein. “They’re the ones experiencing it.”Police departments in Dallas, Austin, and El Paso, among other experts, have repeatedly debunked the idea that allowing people to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity threatens women’s safety.Senate Bill 3 has numerous opponents in the business community as well, including Roland Swenson, CEO and co-founder of South by Southwest, a nationally prominent technology and music festival in Austin.Swenson penned a letter in opposition to SB 3 on Thursday. In addition to decrying the bill as divisive and discriminatory, he warned it will prompt a backlash against Texas businesses.“The State of Texas faces a tangible economic impact from the legalization of this kind of discrimination,” he wrote. “Harming economic growth is not in the best interests of the state or its residents.”North Carolina, which passed a similar bill in 2016, faced a $3.76 billion dollar economic fallout as companies and the NCAA pulled their business from the state. The state has since partially repealed the measure.Tim Noonan of Visit Austin, a trade and tourism advocacy group, told the committee that Austin has already lost $10 million in conventions and stands to lose $133 million more should SB3 pass.Those concerns were echoed by Visit Dallas CEO Philip Jones, who predicted Dallas stands to lose upwards of $1 billion thanks to the legislation."
4,POLITICS,Few Americans Want To See The GOP Keep Trying To Repeal Obamacare,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/few-americans-gop-trying-obamacare-repeal-poll_us_59725a7ae4b09e5f6ccf4164,The public is split on whether or not they think a repeal is still in the picture.,2017-07-21,"Republican leaders, from left, John Cornyn of Texas, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and John Thune of South Dakota address the media after a lunch meeting on health care with President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday.

Just 26 percent say the GOP should keep trying to find votes and pass a bill, according to the poll, which was taken in the wake of the Senate’s most recent attempt to push through legislation, while 50 percent would rather see the party move on to other issues. An additional 24 percent aren’t sure.The public is now evenly divided on the likelihood that President Donald Trump and Congress will succeed in repealing Obamacare, with 40 percent saying it’s at least somewhat likely that they’ll do so and 38 percent saying that it’s not very or not at all likely. A third say they’d be disappointed if Obamacare wasn’t repealed, while 46 percent say they wouldn’t be disappointed.Only 25 percent favor leaving the current health care law in place but letting it fail, as Trump has proposed, and 29 percent favor repealing it but not replacing it with anything. Somewhat remarkably, both numbers outstrip the level of support for the Senate’s actual bill, which HuffPost most recently found to be polling at just 15 percent.Those who say they’d be disappointed to see Obamacare remain in place are split on who deserves the most blame for the failure of the Senate bill earlier this week, with 32 percent placing the lion’s share of the responsibility on congressional Republicans, 32 percent on congressional Democrats, 13 percent on the authors of the bill and 7 percent on Trump.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:Among those who say they’d be disappointed, a 57 percent majority say they place at least partial blame on the congressional Republicans who opposed the repeal bill, and 51 percent say that they view congressional Democrats as partially responsible. Just 29 percent say the authors of the bill should shoulder some responsibility, and just 12 percent say that they put any of the blame on Trump. (Another poll, from SurveyMonkey, found that Republicans primarily blamed Democratic senators.)Americans currently say by a 12-point margin, 37 percent to 25 percent, that they trust the Democratic Party over the Republican Party to handle health care issues.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted July 18 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling.

It just sounds like people are afraid. And the people who are afraid in general ― with due respect, and I am now one of them ― are older. Climate change deniers, by way of example, are older.

You made it political — clowns. You know, climate change is something we should all be very concerned about, and we should get to work on it as soon as we can.” Nye predicted that the ignorance that has dominated a number of scientific debates, including climate science and autism, won’t last. “I don’t think the celebration of ‘dingbatitude’ can stick with us because we’ll get out-competed by the non-dingbats,” he said. “People will want to look to non-dingbats to innovate and keep the United States competitive.”Read the full interview here.

You retracted it and issued me an apology. And I accepted the apology immediately.”Scaramucci, a financier and savvy pundit who has developed close relationships over the years with journalists, has lately become one of President Donald Trump’s best advocates on television, repeatedly dismissing the Russia scandal dogging his presidency as “nonsense.”He also reportedly scored major points with Trump after pushing back successfully against CNN’s flawed June article linking Scaramucci to a Russian investment fund ― an editorial debacle that led to the resignations of three prominent journalists. “Trump advisers say that Scaramucci’s stock climbed further after retracted CNN story,” Politico reporter John Dawsey tweeted Friday. “Trump ‘just loved it’ and still talks about it.”Trump has repeatedly attacked CNN as “fake news” in response to critical coverage of his administration, especially pertaining to links between his campaign and Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. He reportedly delighted in the network’s black eye over the Scaramucci story. Trump talked a lot about the CNN story on Twitter, seizing the screwup to attack Russia-related coverage more broadly. “Wow, CNN had to retract big story on ‘Russia,’ with 3 employees forced to resign,” Trump tweeted on June 27. “What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!” Days later, Trump tweeted that he was “extremely pleased to see that @CNN has finally been exposed as #FakeNews and garbage journalism.”Scaramucci, who the New York Post reported was considering a $100 million lawsuit against CNN for the story, quickly accepted the network’s apology when the story was retracted on June 24 and said he was “moving on.”But the CNN debacle unsurprisingly kept resurfacing during Scaramucci’s subsequent appearances on rival Fox News and Fox Business.Scaramucci recalled during an appearance last month on Trump-favorite “Fox & Friends” that he made “it very clear to [CNN] that the story was not accurate and that it was a defamatory story.” He said reports of lawsuit threats were overblown, but acknowledged reminding CNN “about my legal background.” He wouldn’t get into specifics about his conversations with Trump about the CNN story. But Scaramucci said on “Fox & Friends” that “there’s some level of vindication not just for the president, but for the entire team, that this is just a bunch of nonsense.”Scaramucci discussed his dispute with CNN later on Fox News’ “Media Buzz,” and described the media broadly as having an “an existential crisis” over Trump’s victory. Last week on Fox Business, Scaramucci said the experience with CNN has been part of “learning how to play the game here in Washington.” And he suggested Trump’s defenders could push back more aggressively against flawed coverage.  “I think Donald Trump Jr. will have to use the same tactics, the same skill set,” Scaramucci said. “This nonsense going on about Russia is, in my opinion, completely nonsense.”Scaramucci acknowledged on Friday that he has “never been a journalist,” but has “played a journalist on television.” He used the same line in recent Fox appearances discussing the CNN incident. Scaramucci is a former host of Fox Business’s “Wall Street Week,” a role he said gives him “empathy for journalists in terms of sometimes they’re going to get stories wrong.” “But I sort of don’t like the fake news,” he said, adding that it feels like “there’s a little bit of media bias” in coverage of Trump.  “And so what we hope we can do is de-escalate that and turn that around and let’s let the message from the president get out to the American people,” he said."

FAKE NEWS!” Days later, Trump tweeted that he was “extremely pleased to see that @CNN has finally been exposed as #FakeNews and garbage journalism.”Scaramucci, who the New York Post reported was considering a $100 million lawsuit against CNN for the story, quickly accepted the network’s apology when the story was retracted on June 24 and said he was “moving on.”But the CNN debacle unsurprisingly kept resurfacing during Scaramucci’s subsequent appearances on rival Fox News and Fox Business.Scaramucci recalled during an appearance last month on Trump-favorite “Fox & Friends” that he made “it very clear to [CNN] that the story was not accurate and that it was a defamatory story.” He said reports of lawsuit threats were overblown, but acknowledged reminding CNN “about my legal background.” He wouldn’t get into specifics about his conversations with Trump about the CNN story. But Scaramucci said on “Fox & Friends” that “there’s some level of vindication not just for the president, but for the entire team, that this is just a bunch of nonsense.”Scaramucci discussed his dispute with CNN later on Fox News’ “Media Buzz,” and described the media broadly as having an “an existential crisis” over Trump’s victory. Last week on Fox Business, Scaramucci said the experience with CNN has been part of “learning how to play the game here in Washington.” And he suggested Trump’s defenders could push back more aggressively against flawed coverage.  “I think Donald Trump Jr. will have to use the same tactics, the same skill set,” Scaramucci said. “This nonsense going on about Russia is, in my opinion, completely nonsense.”Scaramucci acknowledged on Friday that he has “never been a journalist,” but has “played a journalist on television.” He used the same line in recent Fox appearances discussing the CNN incident. Scaramucci is a former host of Fox Business’s “Wall Street Week,” a role he said gives him “empathy for journalists in terms of sometimes they’re going to get stories wrong.” “But I sort of don’t like the fake news,” he said, adding that it feels like “there’s a little bit of media bias” in coverage of Trump.  “And so what we hope we can do is de-escalate that and turn that around and let’s let the message from the president get out to the American people,” he said."

Before he even made a decision, he got a heavy dose of racist vitriol from internet trolls.",2017-07-20,"David French considered running as a third-party alternative to Donald Trump, above, in 2016. Before he even made a decision, he faced racist and hateful harassment via the internet.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5952c4be1500004b1f900655.jpeg?cache=0FowrKFpmS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When National Review writer David French was considering a long-shot run for president as an alternative to Donald Trump, he had little baggage to worry about. He had no name recognition and a resume that squared as the opposite of Trump: an Iraq War veteran, a lawyer and a conservative blogger. His biggest concern was simply that he was a nerd who loved video games. White supremacists and various racist trolls didn’t see it that way, though. The instant his name was floated as a possible third-party candidate in late spring of 2016, French immediately became a target of their vitriol. So did his 7-year-old daughter, who is African American and whose face was edited into images of gas chambers with a picture of Trump in a Nazi uniform pressing the button to kill her.In this episode of our “Candidate Confessional” podcast, French details the extent of the attacks he faced in the few days he was considered a potential presidential candidate. And he talks about the psychological toll it took on him and his family.The comments section of his wife’s blog, for example, became filled with pictures of African-American men and women being murdered or committing suicide. “It was horrific,” French says. “It was the kind of stuff that had I not been in Iraq and seen worse things with my own eyes, would have been scarring for life. ... Fortunately, I was able to delete it before my wife saw any of it.”The hate didn’t stop even after he announced that he’d decided not to run for president. His wife got an email from a Trump supporter in Georgia who told the couple it needed to shut up, he says. The writer explained he was a veteran and if they weren’t quiet he knew “which end of the gun the round comes out of.”Weeks later, his wife was on the phone with her dad when someone hacked into the phone call and started screaming, cursing and making pro-Trump declarations. It was “extremely bizarre,” French says.The experience gave French a fresh perspective on just how nasty, personal and, at times, scary being directly involved in politics can be. It also prompted a bit of self-reflection. Later in the campaign, he looked through the archives of his own writings to see if he had similarly crossed the line from professional to personal in any of his criticisms.French acknowledges the online vitriol weighed on his decision of whether to pursue a presidential bid. “I had this deep conviction that these hateful vicious trolls cannot win,” French says. “That their trolling cannot succeed. You cannot encourage more of this by surrendering to it. ... At the same time, I felt like I had a sacred obligation as a parent to my daughter to protect her, and those two feelings were moving simultaneously through me. And to this day, I would say that the threats were not dispositive in the decision … those two thoughts were going through at the same time but there were other factors that ultimately came into play.”Listen to the full episode above.“Candidate Confessional” is produced by Zach Young.

It followed the president’s admission that he would not have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions because he recused himself from the multiple investigations into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia.In a tweet Thursday, Yates called the DOJ’s independence “a bedrock principle of our democracy.”In an interview Wednesday with The New York Times, Trump said he “would have picked somebody else” had he known Sessions would recuse himself.“Sessions should have never recused himself and if he was going to recuse himself he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,” Trump said.“Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself, which frankly I think is very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, ‘Thanks, Jeff, but I’m not going to take you.’ It’s extremely unfair — and that’s a mild word — to the president.”Sessions recused himself earlier this year from the multiple investigations into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.The recusal came after The Washington Post discovered that Sessions did not disclose at least two meetings with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during his confirmation process to become attorney general. The then-senator was also one of Trump’s first prominent supporters during his presidential campaign.Trump dismissed Yates in January, after she refused to defend his executive order banning travel and immigration from several majority-Muslim countries, determining that the ban was unlawful.In May, she testified before the Senate that around the same time, she had warned White House officials about then-national security adviser Mike Flynn’s ties to Russia. Flynn resigned in February after misleading the administration about his interactions with Russian officials about sanctions.Yates is one of several Justice Department officials Trump has abruptly fired. Trump fired James Comey as FBI director amid the bureau’s investigation into his campaign. He also fired U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, reportedly after his office was investigating Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price.Bharara also weighed in on Trump’s comments late Wednesday, joking that Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could join him as law professors at New York University and “teach employment law together.”"
14,POLITICS,Why Donald Trump Can’t Quit 'The Failing' New York Times,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-new-york-times-relationship_us_5970d1b1e4b062ea5f905d5b,"Even as he constantly discredits the newspaper, he seems to seek its approval.",2017-07-20,"President Donald Trump speaks Wednesday to the commission he created on ""election integrity.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59710d4c2100003400fc7f2e.jpeg?cache=zNRcJUm5iX&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s no denying that President Donald Trump loves to hate The New York Times. But his latest sit-down with its reporters ― his second in just over a month ― is a reminder of his entwined relationship with the newspaper to which he keeps giving interviews. Since winning the presidency, Trump has fired off more than two dozen tweets attacking the legacy media outlet, almost exclusively referring to it as “the failing” New York Times ― even when he’s agreeing with its coverage. Since announcing his candidacy over two years ago, he’s consistently singled out the Times in his tirades against the media and accused the “Fake News Joke” of doing a hatchet job on him.Perhaps most alarmingly, his gripes with paper often come with implications that he’d like to crack down on press freedom. So why, then, does Trump continue to give the Times so much access, perhaps only rivaling that which he gives Fox News? After reading Wednesday’s excerpts from the Times’ interview ― an at-times rambling conversation in which he insisted French President Emmanuel Macron “loves to hold [his] hand” and contemplated the role cold weather played in world history ― Trump’s decision to once again sit down with the “dishonest” and “irresponsible” paper underscores that question. His draw to the Times may stem from the way its reporters communicate with him ― a skill that has not gone unnoticed. Maggie Haberman, one of the Times staffers who interviewed Trump in the most recent sit-down and, like the president, a native New Yorker, is “a master of the dark art of Trump charming,” Slate reporter Katy Waldman observed in April. “Trump is mostly an empty basket, but at the bottom of that basket lies a serpent, and Haberman knows how to conjure it forth: with flattery, simple questions, and boundless patience,” Waldman said.Those tactics are apparent in Wednesday’s excerpts. When Haberman agrees with Trump that Americans don’t want to lose health care coverage for pre-existing conditions, for example, the president is forthcoming with an explanation. TRUMP: Nothing changes. Nothing changes. Once you get something for pre-existing conditions, etc., etc. Once you get something, it’s awfully tough to take it away.Ultimately, others theorize, Trump is on a mission seeking approval, even from those he disparages. Despite what Trump says to discredit the Times, CNN political analyst David Gregory said on air Thursday, he has an irresistible desire for positive coverage from it. “It’s striking that the president who spends so much time trying to discredit the news media to convince his supporters simply not to believe outlets like The New York Times, in the end cannot quit Maggie Haberman and that’s just the bottom line,” he said. “Because he wants legitimacy and he knows you have to go to Maggie and her colleagues who are really the journalists of record on this Trump presidency.”His fixation on the Times is longstanding, Timothy O’Brien, a former Times reporter and author of the Trump biography TrumpNation told HuffPost last summer. “I think he’s always had a deep fascination with The New York Times and a need to get the paper’s broader approval of his career and who he is,” he said, suggesting Trump craves his hometown paper’s attention.At the end of this latest sit-down, Trump implored his interviewers to do him justice in the story. “I’m doing a good job. Just treat me fairly. Because I can take everything I said and put a stupid spin on it, or I can put a fair spin on it,” he said.He added later: “And if you’re fair to me, see you soon.”"

Susan Collins (R-Maine), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) ― have received both an outpouring of support and an ugly backlash online. Unsurprisingly ― and depressingly ― much of the aforementioned backlash seems wrapped up in the gender of the three senators. Collins, Murkowski and Capito have not only been labelled traitors to the Republican party and RINO’s (Republicans in Name Only), like some of their male colleagues who openly opposed the original Senate health care bill. They have also been referred to as “witches,” “feminazis” and “bitches” who have a “crazy look,” and are an example of why “women shouldn’t serve in government.” Gov. Mike Huckabee even went so far on Wednesday afternoon as to make a quip on Twitter about vacuuming the three senators out of office if they “won’t stop Planned Parenthood $$ to vacuum babies from womb.” (Both Sen. Collins and Sen. Murkowski have been consistent about voicing their concerns about legislation that would “defund” Planned Parenthood. The Hyde Amendment already prevents federal Medicaid coverage for abortion services, with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.)As Quartz pointed out, none of the three senators being targeted are up for reelection in 2018. It’s also worth noting that just 17 percent of Americans backed the Senate GOP health care bill, and that the Affordable Care Act’s popularity has consistently been on the rise since the 2016 election.H/T Quartz"

With the help of a friendly football jock (Ian Nelson), Billy decides to stand up to his tormenters by campaigning against a popular, Bible-thumping cheerleader (Abigail Breslin) for homecoming queen. (Catch a sneak peek at the movie, which is slated for a 2018 release, in the clip above.) Styler is making her directorial debut with the film, which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in February and was a closing night presentation at the 2017 Outfest in Los Angeles on Saturday. The actress and film producer, who is married to rock singer Sting, told HuffPost she connected with Billy’s story instantly, and jumped at the chance to tackle the project after an earlier director left the project, citing scheduling concerns.“I asked the producers if they’d consider me taking it on, as I’d done a lot of the homework already,” she said. Having served as an executive producer on Guy Ritchie’s “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” and Duncan Jones’s “Moon,” Styler was “used to getting the job done,” particularly when it came to working with emerging talents. “It just felt organic,” she said.Critical to the success of the film was the central role of Billy. Best known for playing a young Alan Turing in 2014’s “The Imitation Game,” Lawther was selected from a pool of about 100 actors and was Styler’s only choice for the role. “I thought, ‘Shit, if I don’t do this right, we are really, really screwed.’ We wouldn’t have a movie,” she recalled. “But within 10 minutes of meeting Alex, I knew we’d found Billy.” The actor also inspired a throwback take on the eccentric character; Lawther’s Billy references Boy George, “Pulp Fiction” and even Oscar Wilde. “There’s an ancient soul there – a philosopher of some intellect,” Styler said.Though filming wrapped almost a year before President Donald Trump entered the White House, Styler said she and screenwriters Patrick J. Clifton and Beth Rigazio were refining the “Freak Show” script right up to the final days on the set. As a result, a number of recurring Trump-isms ― including the campaign catchphrase “Make America great again” ― found their way into the film, and now feel eerily prophetic when referenced through Breslin’s mean girl character.For the small, but significant, role of Billy’s mother, Styler recruited her pal Bette Midler, whose longtime support of LGBTQ rights and gender equality aligned with the film’s message. Though Midler had been absent from the big screen since 2012’s “Parental Guidance,” Styler said working with her was, well, divine. “I’ve known Bette for many years.

Those of us working with WHO to eliminate leprosy began to sense that we were on the verge of a major breakthrough that would truly make a difference.In many cases, those who showed signs of leprosy were abandoned by their families and forced to live in sanatoriums or colonies. We worked to ensure that this effective medicine reached them. However, on visits to such colonies, what I witnessed was that even those who were cured of the disease continued to live there. They had nowhere to go and their lives did not change much even after being cured.They no longer had the disease that been the reason for their seclusion from society, but nothing had changed. In other words, once affected by the disease, they were forever stigmatized as “a former patient” and bore that label for the rest of their lives. And they continued to live in a leprosy colony as before. Some of the colonies were located on remote areas on hills or barren land, and others on a narrow strip along the railway tracks. Boundaries sometimes marked these spaces and walls separated them from the outside world. But they were also surrounded by invisible walls that were even stronger. Even after being cured, as “former leprosy patients,” they had to live within these boundaries. Witnessing this situation, I realized that I had been too optimistic about the problem of discrimination against leprosy and the stigma associated with it. I had simply assumed that if the disease could be cured, the problem of discrimination would resolve itself. But discrimination and stigma are not caused by bacteria. The root cause is in the minds of people. In the course of its long history, discrimination against leprosy has become entrenched in customs and culture. A change in consciousness is not an easy task. In the case of leprosy, misunderstanding and fear arising from ignorance have amplified the discrimination. This fear has also been fostered by religion, and the legal system has played a role in codifying discrimination.Until recent years and even today, laws and regulations in India, Thailand and Singapore have recognized leprosy as grounds for divorce, prohibiting the use of public transportation, discharge or denial of employment, disqualification from running in local elections, and restricting the right to receive an education. In the state of Orissa, India, Dhirendra Pandua was disqualified from holding municipal office in 2003 on the grounds that he had once had leprosy. He contested the law in court, but in 2008, India’s Supreme Court ruled that the state law did not violate the constitution. This law was later amended in 2012. In 2008, the organizing committee of the Beijing Olympic Games announced that in accordance with a 1989 regulation, they would not grant entry visas to foreign visitors with certain conditions including those suffering from leprosy. In communication with the committee, I stressed that leprosy was curable, only mildly infectious, effective medicines were available, and 95% of people have immunity to it. The ban was subsequently lifted. Despite the fact that leprosy is now curable, discriminatory laws are still on the books, and they serve to justify discrimination and isolation in daily life. As in the case of the Beijing Olympic Games, it is important for politicians and government officials to have access to current knowledge of leprosy. This will promote the lifting of old laws, regulations, and rules. Changing these rules and systems is a first step in changing public consciousness."

The marijuana legalization proposal was put forward by former President José Mujica in 2012 as part of a comprehensive package aimed at improving public safety. Uruguay’s parliament gave final approval to the measure in December 2013, making theirs the first country in the world to legally regulate the production, distribution and sale of marijuana for adults.In 2013, a broad coalition emerged to support the proposal, which included LGBT, women’s rights, health, student, environmental and human rights organizations, alongside trade unions, doctors, musicians, lawyers, athletes, writers, actors and academics, united under the campaign Regulación Responsable (“Responsible Regulation”).Uruguay’s model will look quite different from the eight U.S. states that have legalized marijuana. Since there is no one-size-fits-all marijuana legalization system, it’s important for each jurisdiction to tailor marijuana regulation to their local needs and contexts, providing the world with different models to learn from.The Uruguayan model allows four forms of access to marijuana: medical marijuana through the Ministry of Public Health; domestic cultivation of up to six plants per household; membership clubs where up to 45 members can collectively produce up to 99 plants; and licensed sale in pharmacies to adult residents. Regulation will be overseen by the government’s Institute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis (IRCCA). Sales to minors, driving under the influence of marijuana, and all forms of advertising are prohibited.Since the bill was passed in 2013, the government has been developing regulations, registering domestic cultivators and membership clubs, and preparing for the implementation of licensed sales in pharmacies. Two companies have received licenses to produce the marijuana sold in pharmacies, which will be available next week at $1.30 per gram. Each registered individual will be allowed to buy up to 40 grams a month.Marijuana reform gained remarkable momentum throughout the hemisphere in recent years. Twenty-nine U.S. states have legalized medical marijuana, while eight states and Washington D.C. have legalized marijuana more broadly. Jamaica decriminalized marijuana for medical, scientific and religious purposes; Colombia and Puerto Rico legalized medical marijuana through executive orders; Chile allows for marijuana cultivation for oncology patients; Mexico recently passed a medical marijuana bill a year after their Supreme Court ruled that prohibition of marijuana for personal consumption is unconstitutional; and Canada is set to become the next country to fully legalize marijuana. This is a historic moment. In recent years, Latin American leaders have decried the staggering human, environmental and financial costs of the War on Drugs in their region. Uruguay is boldly demonstrating that concrete alternatives to failed prohibitionist policies are possible.Hannah Hetzer is Senior International Policy Manager at the Drug Policy Alliance (www.drugpolicy.org)"

But nothing, she said, nothing was tougher than learning high school algebra.“I could not do it. My mind could just not process it. I was so irritated, I tried to quit,” said the 26-year-old Oakland resident. “Learning how to graph slopes was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.”With the help of her teachers at the Five Keys Charter School, Breaux eventually mastered algebra and earned her high school equivalency degree. In September, she’s headed to the Academy of Art University in San Francisco with hopes of becoming a photography teacher.She credits Five Keys with changing the course of her life.“I was a broken person,” she said. “I had no confidence. If it wasn’t for Five Keys, I’d probably be crying somewhere, clubbing, getting drunk, I don’t know what. I wouldn’t be the confident woman I am now. They stuck by me. They were always in my corner.”Five Keys is a San Francisco-based charter organization that helps students earn their high school diplomas or pass the general education development (GED) exam, after they’ve dropped out of traditional high schools. Many of the students are incarcerated or formerly incarcerated.This month, Five Keys is adding a new feature to its network of 70 classrooms in the Bay Area and Los Angeles: a mobile classroom in San Francisco, intended to serve students who can’t make it to regular classrooms because they can't afford the transportation costs or, in some cases, fear crossing into enemy gang territory.The Five Keys mobile classroom is a refurbished bus from San Francisco’s Municipal Railway transit system that has been outfitted with laptops, desks, chairs and sofas, a small library, wi-fi and posters of the periodic table of elements and genres of literature. It can accommodate 15 students at a time, and will make four stops a week in neighborhoods with higher-than-average crime and poverty rates, such as Bayview-Hunter's Point and the Sunnydale public housing project.The mobile classroom was funded mostly through a $100,000 Google Impact Challenge grant. Google awards 25 such grants annually, based in part on a public voting process, to Bay Area nonprofits that demonstrate a strong positive impact on life in the Bay Area.Five Keys hopes to eventually add more buses to serve Oakland and Los Angeles, said Five Keys executive director Steve Good.“The need is there,” he said. “With this bus, we can take education directly to our hardest-hit communities. Our hope is that it will be filled with students every place it goes.”At least 90,000 adults over age 25 — or about 10 percent of the population — in San Francisco do not have high school diplomas, according to the U.S. Census. Statewide, about 19 percent of California residents over age 25 do not have high school degrees or the equivalent. Among inmates, the figures are even higher: 70 percent of those in jail or prison do not have high school diplomas, Good said.Five Keys was founded in 2003 through the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department to educate inmates in the county jail. In 2007 the nonprofit expanded beyond the jail to educate anyone in the community who wanted to earn their high school diploma or pass the equivalency test. It later expanded beyond San Francisco, offering classes throughout the Bay Area and Los Angeles.Working closely with other nonprofits and government agencies, such as probation and social services, Five Keys provides classrooms and teachers in housing projects, community centers, churches, homeless shelters, the YMCA and other sites. Students can enroll at any time, typically attending class for a few hours once or twice a week and completing independent-study packets on their own.The standards match the state’s requirements for traditional high schools, and the school is fully accredited. But teachers have tweaked the curriculum to be more appealing to its student population — adults who’ve felt disconnected from traditional schools. For example, for students who need remedial reading material the teachers use books written in simple language for an older audience, instead of Dr. Seuss or easy-reader books. For a lesson in world history, civics and economics, teachers might focus on immigration. A topic for an English essay might be how different countries use restorative justice.At First Place for Youth, an Oakland-based nonprofit that helps California foster youth find jobs and housing and enroll in school, Five Keys has helped 20 young people earn their high school diplomas or the equivalent since it opened classrooms at its Oakland and Los Angeles facilities two years ago, said education director Erica Stowers.Some of the graduates have gone on to community college, gotten higher-paying jobs, earned nursing certificates or otherwise advanced their careers, she said.“These students sometimes haven’t done well in traditional schools. But Five Keys creates an atmosphere where the kids can learn at their own pace, with lots of support, removing barriers they might face otherwise,” Stowers said. “They really go above and beyond.”Enrollment in Five Keys is voluntary, although some students attend as a requirement of probation or public assistance and Five Keys offers incentives such as pizza, Starbucks cards, bus tokens and free backpacks. About 3,000 students are enrolled statewide, with 2,400 actively attending classes, Good said. Since 2003, about 2,000 students have graduated.But the real success stories might be graduates like Breaux, who said the school provided her more than just a high school degree.“The teachers stuck with me and really cared,” she said. “I’d never had that before. I’d text my teacher at 10 p.m. and ask for help with a math problem, and she got right back to me and stayed with me until I got it. The teachers never gave up on me, even though I’m sure I drove them crazy.”Breaux began getting into trouble when she was a kid growing up in Stockton, and stopped attending school almost entirely after 8th grade. She had been arrested several times for fighting and shoplifting. By age 23, she had three sons but had to fight for sole custody of them after she and her husband divorced.At age 23, once she had relocated to Oakland, her mother encouraged her to try Five Keys.“My goal was to show my kids that no matter what your circumstances are, you can always try again,” she said. “Never give up.”After three attempts, she finally passed the GED in January, 2016. She got a job at an Oakland-based environmental group, Clean Water Action, and won a scholarship to art college.“At Five Keys, we all came from different backgrounds but left it at the door when we got to the classroom,” she said. “We were all friends, supporting each other. Your hardships, your heartaches, they were always there for you. It really is like a family.”This story originally appeared on EdSource."

Simpson looking at a new pair of Aris extra-large gloves that prosecutors had him put on during his double-murder trial in Los Angeles. 1995.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5970941815000021008b2b7f.jpeg?cache=LAChVssQ9V&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The story of O.J. Simpson is one of strength and celebrity. This is so to both his staunchest critics and his most dedicated disciples.Those inclined to believe O.J. slithered from the law’s grasp in his 1995 murder trial through a host of sinister, deceptive means imagine the former star running back as one gilded by stardom. In him, they see a man of great stature who mutilated those in his path and employed a craven campaign of racial victimization to elude justice.Those invested in his innocence contrarily imagine Simpson as a crafty executor of American privilege; one who used tools typically not afforded affluent black men to best an oppressive legal system and emerge the chivalrous Adonis they came to love.There are, too, those who set up camp somewhere in the middle: those who believe neither in the innocence of O.J. nor the innocence of the system that tried him. Even these people, however, will concede that Simpson’s power ― both his physical power and his social power — added layers to a trial complexly intersected by race and gender politics.Simpson’s charted mistreatment of his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, converged with the notorious history of the Los Angeles Police Department to provide an environment for the most sensationalized news event in American history. But there are reasons to believe that America has, in significant ways, mutated beyond the narratives that drove the O.J. Simpson trial in 1995 and colored the person Simpson was between then and his ultimate imprisonment for armed robbery in 2008. This is not at all to suggest we’ve matured as a nation, but simply that the sources of our activism and our national appetite for absurdity have transformed since Simpson disappeared behind bars nearly a decade ago. Simpson, who faces possible parole on Thursday, seems primed for re-entry into society. If and when he is released, it will be to a world that has seemingly evolved in ways that make his tale less unique than we once believed it to be.The racial overtones of Simpson’s 1995 murder trial, centered on the deaths of his wife and her associate Ron Goldman, were not to be mistaken — they were explicit strategy, employed first by Simpson’s legal team and infamously bungled thereafter by lawyers representing the state of California.Attorneys for Simpson successfully instilled doubt in the minds of jurors concerning the efficacy of the LAPD, which for years found itself embroiled in controversy over its racist practices.These controversies allowed for Simpson to become a seeming stand-in for black Americans and the plight enforced upon them by departments across the country. This, ironically, for a man whose entire collegiate and professional careers were spent placating white fear, ingratiating himself with affluent whites and downplaying the existence of racism.When, for example, activist and athlete Harry Edwards attempted in 1968 to draft Simpson into an Olympic boycott urging fairer treatment for blacks throughout the nation, Simpson’s response betrayed little foresight for how he’d fare in his later years.Edwards spoke to this in Ezra Edelman’s Oscar-winning documentary, “O.J.: Made in America.”“O.J. was approached because he was the biggest name in collegiate athletics at that time. He was also a world record-holding track star, so here, we’ve got two-for-one. When I asked him, I said, ‘We’re trying to get black athletes to understand they have a role in the current civil rights movement,’ his response was, ‘I’m not black, I’m O.J..’”Our social environment has evolved in such a way that we currently want not for black martyrs — they are ubiquitous, many memorialized in hashtags for eternity. What this means for Simpson is that he no longer serves as a singular, galvanizing figure, particularly among social justice movements largely helmed by youths who lack reverence for Simpson’s persona and have had the privilege of assessing his trials and actions in retrospect.While there is much to be gleaned from Simpson’s first criminal trial concerning the ways our nation grapples with race, Simpson the individual will factor minimally — if at all — in movements toward racial justice.His story, while a fascinating psychological case, will hereby be reduced to one merely of squandered, disgraced celebrity.There are, too, the matters of Simpson’s post-acquittal life and his ultimate armed robbery conviction that also seem relatively unremarkable given recent developments.O.J. Simpson’s life, in the wake of his acquittal, took an ominous turn. Having lost a reported $33 million wrongful death lawsuit to Goldman’s family, Simpson resorted to a host of calloused and bizarre quick-money ventures to stay afloat. These included a hidden camera show and, perhaps most infamously, a book titled “If I Did It,” which ponders the way Simpson’s alleged double-murder could have played out.(The Goldman family preemptively won rights to the book in a lawsuit and promptly changed the title to “If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer” before publishing.)Public distaste toward Simpson drove him into obscurity. His eventual 2008 robbery charge resulted from the former Heisman Trophy winner attempting to reclaim items of his that he insisted were stolen from him by a memorabilia dealer.But interestingly enough, a newly freed O.J. Simpson will find that even grotesque capitalization on infamy is a practice far more inculcated into our society than it was when he departed.Where Simpson was once seemingly anomalous in his brazen and calloused capitalism, we now afford others of his ilk ample opportunity to reap rewards for their actions.In the near-decade since Simpson’s incarceration, we have been hyper-exposed to the levels of crassness that once thrust him to the periphery of our society. O.J. Simpson left a free world in which the perversion of power and celebrity was infrequently celebrated in public — he was, at the time, a most glaring example of this perversion.He will, however, return to freedom without this distinction. And today, America cannot feign our disgust as we did then.Not as we line the coffers of our most reviled killers.Not as we ingratiate our most collusive law enforcement officers.And not, the least, when we elevate the most outspoken of our culture’s deviants to incomparable positions of power.O.J. Simpson will rejoin a nation far less jarred by sensationalism than that of 2008 — far less genuinely shaken by absurdity, meaning a life of obscurity truly is his for the taking should he want it. And given the current normalcy of his once-audacious behavior, his value to us as a social figure will be very little."

They will consider factors including “Simpson’s age, whether his conviction was for a violent crime, his prior criminal record and his plans after release” when deciding whether to grant him further parole, the board has said.Legal experts widely expected Simpson to be informed that he will be released from prison on Thursday, including now-retired district attorney David Roger, who served as prosecutor in the Simpson case.In 2008, Simpson received a nine-to-33-year prison sentence for charges including armed robbery and kidnapping as a result of a group effort to steal memorabilia from two men inside the Palace Station Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.Four of the other men involved in the crime only ever received probation, and a fifth was released from prison in 2011. Many have described Simpson’s near-decade-long imprisonment as unspoken retribution for his acquittal in the murder of his estranged wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman in 1994. "
25,WOMEN,Another Reason Why It's Great The BBC Revealed Anchors' Salaries,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bbc-salaries-gender_us_597100fde4b0aa14ea78a1d6,Transparency is the only path to solve the gender pay gap.,2017-07-20,The BBC's Chris Evans is making more than five times the highest-earning woman at the network,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597103302100003400fc7f03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When it comes to paying men and women fairly, most big companies get away with vague claims. Men and women are paid equally, without discrimination, they’ll say. And that’s it.Most companies won’t show you the salary data to prove their case. Such a maneuver would be less acceptable if we were talking about, say, sales data or profit ― public companies are required to report real numbers in those categories.But this week, the BBC did something remarkable. The publicly funded British media company released detailed salary information for the network’s on-air talent, revealing that men earn a lot more money than women. Women make up just one-third of the network’s highest-paid on-air talent, defined as those making more than 150,000 pounds, or about $195,000, a year. The highest paid man, Chris Evans, earns between 2.2 and 2.5 million pounds. The highest paid woman, Claudia Winkleman, makes 450,000 to 500,000 pounds.The BBC only released the data because former Prime Minister David Cameron and his successor, Theresa May, ordered the disclosure.The push for the information actually had nothing to do with gender equality. The idea was to find out if certain BBC stars were overpaid, a years-long campaign waged by The Daily Mail, which argued that because the network is funded through fees paid by U.K. citizens, the public had a right to know.The release of the information raised little clamor about how much these stars make, and a lot of fuss over the gender pay gap.The network said it will fix the disparity. “By 2020 we will have equality between men and women on air, and we will also have the pay gap sorted by then too,” said BBC director general Tony Hall, who fought against releasing the information.The whole affair reveals an obvious truth: Without transparency, the gender pay gap won’t go away. Only when pay gaps come to light can they be addressed.“If you don’t have the information, you can’t act on it,” Elise Gould, a senior economist at the progressive Economic Policy Institute who studies the pay gap, told HuffPost. She pointed out that in unionized workplaces, where employees have more information about pay, there are smaller pay disparities between genders.In any workplace, information is power. Workers can’t advocate for equal pay until they know where they stand, compared with their colleagues. Public pressure that comes from releasing detailed information helps, too, Gould added. The gender pay gap exists in nearly every industry, at every level ― even when you account for outside factors. On average, women in the U.S. make 80 percent of what men make, according to federal data. The gap is far wider for black and Hispanic women. Even studies that take into account a worker’s level of experience, education and other mitigating factors still find disparity in pay.Yet most employers will say they pay their workers fairly. “When you talk to a company, this is typically what you hear: ‘We don’t have a pay gap and we don’t discriminate,’” said Julie Gorte, a vice president at Pax World, a investment group with a social mission that’s pushing public companies to publish information about gender and pay. Gorte’s organization has met with a handful of companies, including Apple, Amazon and Goldman Sachs, and pressed them to release pay data. All the companies have said they pay fairly.“Unless all of the pay gap resides in companies no one ever talks to, there’s something weird going on,” Gorte said. Under pressure from Pax and a few other investment outfits with social justice agendas, Apple and Amazon last year both proudly announced that they audited salaries and found that they paid their employees fairly. Neither would provide data to back up their claims.The Wall Street Journal’s parent company, Dow Jones, recently said that it had hired an outside firm to audit pay practices and found that a small percentage of employees weren’t being paid fairly. Dow Jones said it was working on raising salaries for those people. But the company didn’t release details, so it’s impossible to know how the consultants reached their conclusions.And that’s what typically happens, Gorte said. Companies hire consultants who use a mysterious methodology to conclude there’s no gap, or a small one that will be fixed.That’s not enough.Under a new rule, established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the Obama administration, a select group of employers were supposed to start reporting pay data by gender and race starting next year. It’s unclear if the Trump administration will ever let that requirement see the light of day. Occasionally, a woman will discover she’s being underpaid on her own. Lilly Ledbetter learned she was being paid less than male peers after 19 years working at a Goodyear factory in Alabama ― and she took action, suing the company. Though she ultimately lost her case, Ledbetter’s lawsuit led to a new federal law on pay passed in 2009.A few Hollywood stars have spoken up about being underpaid ― and have seen disparities rectified. It’s great that the BBC aims to have gender equality in 2020. But the company hasn’t yet explained how it will do this. What this flood of salary information has really done is empower the network’s women stars to get the raises they deserve. "
26,POLITICS,"For Shocked Australians, America's Gun Nightmare Hits Home",Chloe Angyal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justine-damond-australia-gun-violence_us_5970fefee4b062ea5f90b35d,"Australians know about America’s police violence problem. But this week, America’s problem became Australia’s problem, too.",2017-07-20,"The parents of Justine Damond, John Ruszczyk and Maryan Heffernan, throw a flower into the water during a vigil for their daughter at Freshwater Beach on July 19, 2017 in Sydney.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597102302100003400fc7efd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sunday mornings on Sydney’s Freshwater Beach are a rowdy affair. Hundreds of children and teenagers descend down the dunes and wade into the water, competing in swim-and-run races as part of Australia’s junior surf rescue training program. With coffees in hand, parents look on and cheer. Race organizers keep control with bullhorns and whistles.This week, however, the beach hosted a silent vigil for Justine Damond, the 40-year-old yoga instructor who was shot, unarmed, by a police officer in Minneapolis last Saturday. Damond lived around the corner from the beach, known locally as “Freshie,” until she moved to the U.S. in 2015. More than 300 friends and family members attended the vigil, where candles were lit and someone played a didgeridoo against the backdrop of the crashing surf.Australians have been aware of America’s police violence problem ― a grotesque collision of the nation’s fixation on guns and its overdependence on police enforcement ― since protests erupted over the killing of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in 2014. The tragedy in Ferguson, Missouri, made international headlines.This week, however, America’s problem became Australia’s problem, too.In the United States, police shootings of unarmed civilians have become so frequent that a week without a highly publicized incident feels like the exception to a rule. More than 540 people have been shot by police in 2017, and it’s barely mid-July. In Australia, police shootings are exceedingly rare: Between 2007 and 2011, in a nation of about 24 million, police shot and killed 14 people.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called Damon’s killing “shocking” and “inexplicable.” She was shot by Minneapolis officer Mohamed Noor, a Somali-American who has been on the force for two years. She reportedly called 911 late at night to report a possible sexual assault, and was talking to Noor and his partner when Noor fired at her out of the car window ― reportedly, he was startled by a sudden noise and feared an ambush, perhaps an armed one.“How can a woman out in the street in her pyjamas seeking assistance from the police be shot like that?” Turnbull asked, in an interview with Australia’s Channel 9. “We are demanding answers on behalf of her family.” In Australia, the story has been front page news all week, the headlines roaring with outrage and incomprehension.Australia is often held up as an example of how a country can, with courageous and conscious policymaking, largely rid itself of gun violence. After a horrific mass shooting in 1996, conservative Prime Minister John Howard tightened firearms laws and instituted a gun buyback program, collecting and destroying 700,000 guns. This year, in response to an uptick in illegal firearms and facing a threat of terrorism, Australia implemented another gun amnesty.By contrast, U.S. lawmakers, particularly on the right, have resisted common-sense gun law reforms. While state and citywide gun buybacks have been implemented occasionally, in the pitched political climate of 2017, it is all but impossible to imagine such a program happening on a federal level.Using the loosest possible definition of the term, Australia has seen two mass shootings since 1996. The United States has seen over 154 mass shootings in 2017 alone. The nation’s deadliest modern mass shooting occurred barely a year ago, at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.The United States is not Australia, and what works in one country probably would not work in the other. Americans view government with far more suspicion and fear than Australians do, sentiments the U.S. gun lobby devotes enormous resources to encouraging and entrenching. And beyond that, many Americans just like guns. They romanticize and deify them. The firearm occupies a place in American culture that, even as an Australian who has lived in the U.S. for 12 years, still boggles my mind. That the slaying of nearly two dozen 5- and 6-year-olds in their classroom did not result in even basic congressional action on gun law reform is a telling, stunning indictment of the sanctity of guns in American culture.Here, Turnbull’s words about Damond’s death are half right: It is inexplicable.But it is not shocking ― or, at least, it is not surprising. It is the natural consequence of a country’s obsession with guns. In a nation overrun by legal and illegal firearms and dependent on militarized and fiercely unionized police who fear armed ambush ― and who have seen time and again that they will face little or no consequences for killing on the job ― this kind of carnage, exacerbated by racist stereotypes about crime and violence, feels all but inevitable.The reaction to Damond’s death, in the U.S. and in her home country, cannot be separated from the racial realities of the tragic situation.Australia, like the U.S., has lately experienced a spike in virulent Islamophobia. In the U.S., black men are disproportionately likely to be killed by police, and the nation has a long and ugly history of brutalizing black men in the name of protecting white women. That Noor is a black man with a Muslim-sounding name and Damond was a white woman is surely shaping public responses to this particular instance of police violence in both hemispheres.Nonetheless, Damond’s death could also remind Americans for whom the national firearm fixation has come to feel normal and acceptable that this is not normal. This doesn’t happen in other countries. It doesn’t have to be this way.Damond’s father described losing his daughter as “our worst nightmare.” It is a horror into which countless American families are plunged every year. This week, Australia got a glimpse of this uniquely American nightmare. It has long been a national disgrace, and now it is undeniably an international one."
27,POLITICS,GOP Leaders Offer To Make Obamacare Repeal Bill Slightly Less Awful,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-repeal-senate-gop-changes_us_5970c4a4e4b0aa14ea781e3f,Apparently they hope wavering Republican senators can't do basic math.,2017-07-20,"Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Seema Verma has outlined a state ""wraparound"" proposal for Senate Republicans.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59711f631a00003300dbfd74.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Senate Republican leaders and Trump administration officials, trying to rally support for their health care bill, are apparently dangling an offer of some new money to help low-income people get health insurance. It could be as much as $200 billion over 10 years, according to reports in Bloomberg and The Hill. The plan also involves giving states more flexibility on how to implement federal health programs.The details are still fuzzy, and it’s not clear how far discussions have gone, but the basic math of what party leaders have in mind is straightforward. And that basic math is stark.The Better Care Reconciliation Act, the proposal that Senate leaders are trying to bring to the floor next week, would take $756 billion out of Medicaid over the next 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bill would also reduce tax credits for people buying private insurance on their own, bringing the total reduction in federal spending to $1.2 trillion.Putting something like $200 billion of that back into health coverage isn’t nearly enough to blunt the effects. A cynic might even say the primary goal in offering this money is to trick wavering Republican senators or to give them an easy excuse for voting yes, rather than to provide health insurance for the people who stand to lose it should the Senate bill become law.The stakes are huge. CBO data estimates 15 million fewer people would receive Medicaid coverage under the Senate bill by 2026. The majority of those people would have qualified for the program under the Affordable Care Act’s expansion ― an expansion that the Senate bill would mostly end, by cutting off the extra federal funds that make it financially possible for the states to carry out. The masses losing access to Medicaid would mostly be the working poor ― people who have jobs or live in households with breadwinners, but have income below or just above the poverty line. (The official threshold is 133 percent of the federal poverty line, which works out to $16,040 in annual income for an individual and $27,159 for a family of three.) On their own, they would have no way to shell out the thousands of dollars a year it would take to buy regularly priced private health insurance policies on the open market.In theory, the Senate bill anticipates this by expanding eligibility for health insurance tax credits, so that nobody living on poverty wages or less would have to pay more than 2.14 percent of his or her income, with adjustments, to get coverage. In practice, that subsidy would purchase a relatively skimpy policy similar to what sells currently as a “bronze” plan, with deductibles of more than $6,000 in today’s dollars.The coverage would be effectively worthless, because these families don’t even have hundreds, let alone thousands, of dollars lying around to pay medical bills before their insurance benefits kick in. Most would not bother getting insurance and even those who did would be exposed to crippling medical bills. They would skimp on treatments they need, dodge debt collectors for the care they get, and come to rely on safety net hospitals ― who, in turn, would be on the hook for more and more uncompensated care.And that’s just the effect of rolling back the expansion. Over time, the Senate bill would also impose a new funding formula for Medicaid, almost certainly creating a gap between what states need to cover enrollees and what they would be getting from Washington.The gap would get bigger over time, and most states would scale back their programs in response ― by reducing what Medicaid pays providers, shrinking the benefits it includes, and simply offering insurance to fewer people.Republican Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Dean Heller of Nevada, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rob Portman of Ohio have all spoken out against the Medicaid cuts and said they cannot support the Senate bill in its current form. Not coincidentally, all come from one of the 31 states that expanded Medicaid, along with the District of Columbia.To win over those senators, administration officials are now saying they can let states tap into some extra funds ― maybe as much as $200 billion, although senators who met with administration officials last night said no specific numbers were discussed.Under one scheme that Seema Verma, director of Medicare and Medicaid, has sketched out for Republican officials, the states could use the money to create supplemental coverage ― or a “wraparound” ― that would reduce out-of-pocket costs in private plans for people at low incomes. The idea, according to media accounts and health policy experts who have heard about the proposal, is to make those policies affordable and more similar to Medicaid, which in most states has virtually no cost-sharing whatsoever.The kinds of private policies that people get through large employers tend to offer wider physician access than Medicaid does. And surely many people would appreciate that. But those plans probably aren’t the policies most low-income people would be buying under the Senate bill, because they’d be hunting for the cheapest available options and those are the policies that, like Medicaid, have limited physician access.And even generous private policies aren’t always a good substitute for Medicaid, because they don’t guarantee the same exhaustive set of benefits. This is especially true for children, who under Medicaid are entitled to extra screenings ― for lead poisoning, just to pick an example ― as well as any treatments physicians deem medically necessary.The GOP scheme also raises some legal issues, because of the rules of how states can spend Medicaid money. This is the kind of problem that sounds trivial but can create major implementation challenges, unless the architects of legislation have spent the time necessary to figure out the constraints and work around them. It’s unclear whether administration officials and their Senate counterparts have studied the policy at this level of detail and figured out how to actually make such a scheme work.But the biggest issue, by far, is that even $200 billion would not go that far ― especially because insuring people under private coverage generally costs more than insuring them under Medicaid, which, whatever its flaws, is dirt-cheap for the government to run. “It’s only going to be more expensive to cover these people through private plans with a wrap,” said Aviva Aron-Dine, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “So you’re talking about covering a minority of the expansion population at best.”The wraparound scheme could have some serious budgetary implications, too ― the kind a CBO assessment would reveal if the agency had a chance to analyze it before a vote took place.Any effort to make private insurance more attractive to lower-income consumers would require the federal government to finance subsidies for more people. There’s a chance it could increase the total cost of the bill ― and that’s before taking into account the effects of the amendment, from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), to undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions. That amendment could also increase the bill’s cost.Merely by offering the states extra money, administration officials and Senate leaders would seem to be conceding what they have tried so hard to deny: that the broader Medicaid cuts in their proposals would be damaging. But by offering an insufficient sum, these leaders are also showing they remain committed to deep cuts in the program anyway. Capito, Heller, and the other holdouts have said repeatedly they cannot accept that. They may soon get the chance to prove it with their votes."

They affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,000 commercial flights arriving daily in the United States, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries.Airlines that fail to meet the new security requirements could face in-cabin electronics restrictions.The United Kingdom continues to enforce a similar in-cabin ban on electronics ban on flights from some Middle Eastern airports. Those restrictions apply to flights from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia."

Midway through the episode, the Hound (Rory McCann) looks into the flames of a fire at the behest of Thoros of Myr (Paul Kaye), a follower of the Lord of Light.Asked what he sees ― besides “logs burning” ― the Hound describes his chilling vision: “Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall. It’s where the wall meets the sea. There’s a castle there. There’s a mountain, looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past. Thousands of them.”Much of the Hound’s vision is self-explanatory. All the North knows that an army of the dead is marching on the Wall, led by White Walkers seemingly intent on murdering every living person in their path. But if we assume, as Jon Snow (Kit Harington) does in the episode, that the dead will try to breach the Wall around Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, the nearest point to Hardhome ― where Jon saw them last ― that makes the Hound’s note about a “mountain” puzzling.There is no geographical mountain around Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. The fan-created map Quartermaester.info reveals flat terrain for quite a distance: Could the “mountain” actually refer to the Mountain (Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson)?Could the “arrowhead” refer to the long-anticipated battle between the brothers, who’ve been at odds with each other since childhood? (The Mountain is the one who caused the Hound’s disfigurement, after shoving his face in a fire as retaliation for borrowing a toy. Read more about it at i09.)Maybe. We know “Game of Thrones” wastes no line of dialogue. The island across from the castle, Skagos, is mountainous, but it’s a bit far away from the Wall. On the other hand, George R.R. Martin’s The World of Ice & Fire mentions arrowheads on Skagos ― dragonglass arrowheads, perfect for fighting White Walkers. So it’s possible he’s just talking about an island off the coast. It’s possible Jon Snow was wrong, and the White Walkers are actually coming through at the western-most point on the wall, Westwatch-by-the-Bridge, which also meets the sea and is surrounded by mountains.Or it’s possible we’re getting a Cleganebowl.The Mountain’s appearance in the North would be somewhat odd, since he’s all the way down in King’s Landing at the moment. However, as Sansa (Sophie Turner) pointed out, Cersei (Lena Headey) will always find a way to murder her enemies. With Jon Snow going around introducing himself as King in the North, Cersei sees him as a big enemy ― possibly one she’d send the Mountain after. Ahem."

Over the past three years, Brazil’s ever-growing corruption scandal has enveloped hundreds of politicians. President Dilma Rousseff was impeached last fall. And last Wednesday, Brazil’s problems got even worse: A federal judge convicted the country’s former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, on charges of corruption and money laundering.The conviction and potential imprisonment of a former president, especially one who was a leading candidate for next year’s presidential election, will throw Brazil even deeper into crisis. But it should also cause concern for the rest of the world. Without a stable Brazil, it will be hard — perhaps impossible — to solve the planet’s most pressing international problems.“The world needs Brazil,” said Mark Langevin, the head of the Brazil Institute at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs.The country’s largest natural resource, the Amazon rainforest, is crucial in the global fight against climate change, and the debate over how to protect it continues to rage in Brazil. Brazilian President Michel Temer is currently pushing legislation that would remove protections from an area of the Amazon the size of Portugal. And after years of substantial progress cutting greenhouse gas emissions during Silva’s time in office, such emissions have increased in recent years.Brazil is also on track to become the largest exporter of food and agricultural products over the next decade. It is home to nearly one-fifth of the world’s available freshwater and is among the leading producers of sustainable biofuels, meaning the country is positioned to help address potential effects of climate change — including food and water scarcity in certain parts of the world.Brazil’s strong relations with China and improving relations with other world powers — including the U.S., Russia and the European Union — also allow it to engage in “a great balancing act” between nations with more adversarial relationships, Langevin said.“You cannot have a serious discussion on climate change, on sustainability, on food security, if Brazil is not at the table,” said Paulo Sotero, the head of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a Washington-based think tank. But, he added, “the Brazil that has to be at the table is a credible Brazil, a Brazil that is managing itself and its economy in a proper way.”Therein lies the problem. Right now, Brazil’s seat at the table often seems unoccupied.The corruption scandal is a big reason for that. Da Silva ― popularly known as “Lula” ― is not the first, nor will he be the last, politician to succumb to Operation Car Wash, the expansive corruption probe that began as a simple money laundering investigation in 2014 but has since grown into the world’s broadest political scandal.Temer, Brazil’s current president, is also facing allegations of corruption and bribery that could spark impeachment proceedings in Congress, and his critics have alleged that his support for the Amazonian deforestation bill is a horse-trading maneuver meant to win the backing of influential actors in the battle to save his job. Brazil’s struggles in addressing climate change, some observers have asserted, even kept Temer from effectively criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump for pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement.Those same allegations of bribery nearly caused Temer to skip this month’s G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. Once Temer finally decided to attend, he was largely an afterthought: He didn’t conduct a single closed-door meeting with another head of state (Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles went to two in his place), and, perhaps due to his waffling on even attending the conference, Temer saw his name omitted from the press program that listed other foreign leaders. When he did speak, he insisted that Brazil wasn’t actually facing an economic crisis.To many Brazilians, da Silva has seemed like the solution to the country’s many problems. He was perhaps the most transformational elected official in Brazilian history: a former labor leader with little formal education who became Brazil’s first working-class president. A member of the leftist Workers’ Party, da Silva enacted social and economic policies that helped distribute the nation’s rapid economic gains to people with underprivileged backgrounds similar to his own.Da Silva’s Brazil lifted some 30 million people out of poverty. His expansive social welfare policies helped lead to Brazil’s removal from the United Nations world hunger map. Brazil experienced vast advances in literacy, education and public health, while da Silva’s affirmative action policies for government hiring brought black Brazilians and women into positions of power they’d rarely, if ever, held.Da Silva’s popularity has dipped from the astronomically high approval ratings he enjoyed when he left office, but he is still among the most popular politicians in a country where they are scarce. A poll at the end of June, prior to his conviction, showed that he was a favorite to win the presidency again in 2018.His conviction, however, has jeopardized that, since Brazilian law prohibits politicians convicted of crimes from seeking public office. Da Silva has vowed to run anyway. He called himself the “victim of a lie” and said that “only the Brazilian people have the right to decree my end” after the conviction was handed down. But if an appeals court does uphold the conviction, the 2018 race could become a wide-open affair.That concerns Brazilian political experts. Da Silva’s absence from the race could open up space for any number of candidates, and the dueling political and economic crises could create “a temptation to rely on a completely unprepared politician,” Sotero said.One who may be in a position to capitalize on his downfall is Jair Bolsonaro, a member of the Chamber of Deputies from Rio de Janeiro. Bolsonaro, like da Silva, is a populist. Unlike the former president, however, he is a creature of Brazil’s extreme right, a sort of anti-Lula who is opposed to the country’s feminist movements, immigration and programs to promote racial equality. The former Army parachutist has expressed support for the military junta that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985, raising concerns that he has the sort of authoritarian streak Brazilian voters have avoided since returning to democratic governance. (Last year, when he cast his vote to impeach Rousseff, he dedicated his action to the man who ran the program that tortured her and many others during the dictatorship.)“There is the concern that these authoritarian forces might take advantage of this situation,” said Bruno Brandão, the Brazil country manager for Transparency International, a global anti-corruption nonprofit. “They are capturing the discourse of anti-corruption, these populist, authoritarian forces, and trying to profit from the general discontent. They’re using the speech of anti-corruption, and that’s particularly worrisome,” he said.Many experts have dismissed Bolsonaro as an outsider from a small party with little chance of ascending to the presidency. But he has consistently shown up as the second or third most popular choice in early election polls, and his popularity has risen from only a few percentage points last year to as high as 18 percent last month.It’s too early to declare Bolsonaro a real contender, and if da Silva is indeed prevented from running, the former president’s supporters could turn to other, more traditional candidates. But the country’s two largest center/center-right political parties, the PMDB and PSDB, are already wary of Bolsonaro ― as HuffPost Brazil reported last week, they have held discussions about agreeing on a candidate to thwart his rise. For all the global significance of Brazil’s ongoing crises, though, the biggest reason for concern is what they mean for Brazil. Brazil’s recession ― the worst in more than a century ― has devastated the country. A record 14 million Brazilians are out of work, while 3.6 million are in jeopardy of falling back into poverty. Brazil is at risk of returning to the UN’s hunger map in what would be a sad marker for a country that once claimed its policies had nearly eliminated extreme poverty. Ongoing budget problems have created fears that Lula-era social welfare programs could face even more cuts. Human rights groups have warned of rising rates of violence in cities like Rio de Janeiro, where already-high violent crime numbers disproportionately affect the poor, minorities and young people.Operation Car Wash, meanwhile, has paralyzed and demoralized the country. Temer is hanging on to his job but has seen his approval rating fall into the single digits after the corruption allegations against him emerged. In one poll, a near majority of the country’s residents said they were ashamed to be Brazilian. Others have shown declining faith in the government itself, a troubling sign for what is already a “young, fragile democracy,” said Joel Velasco, a former adviser at the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia whose work as a consultant at the Albright-Stonebridge Group focuses largely on Latin America. And now, the man who once exemplified Brazil’s promise ― both to the country and to the world ― has fallen from grace, too.“I think there is some degree of fatigue for all of this,” Velasco said. “That’s what concerns me more. There comes a point where respect for the government is kind of zilch.”“At the end of the day, we do need people to accept that there is a government,” he added. “But if everybody in government is corrupt ― it’s a little similar to the U.S., where ‘Washington is broken’ becomes a campaign motto. But at some point, somebody has to step up and fix Washington.”There are, however, reasons to be hopeful about Brazil.Operation Car Wash has been dismissed by its critics as a political witch hunt. Da Silva’s supporters on the left view it as such, partly because the investigation targeted Workers’ Party politicians in its earliest stages, partly because da Silva’s alleged misdeeds don’t seem quite as bad as Temer’s, and partly because of da Silva’s rabid popularity ― there are “millions of Brazilians,” Americas Quarterly’s Brian Winter wrote in May, “who ― still ― believe Lula is the only politician who ever did anything for them.”The left’s criticism of Operation Car Wash is somewhat harder to square now that the probe has targeted right-wing politicians too, and Car Wash polls well, even as there are indications that it is beginning to wind down. That Judge Sérgio Moro, the investigation’s leader, dared take on a politician as popular as da Silva has inspired hope in some observers that Brazil’s judicial system is serious about rooting out systemic corruption, no matter its source. “It’s the president that took Brazil to relevance,” Alana Rizzo, a U.S.-based Brazilian journalist, said of da Silva. “That’s the figure that [internationally] people know. When you have this guy getting convicted, now anyone can get convicted.”Lula’s appeal could go either way ― even those who watch closest won’t dare make a prediction. He still has four other charges to face in separate cases, meaning the turmoil of Operation Car Wash, for both him and Brazil, isn’t over yet. There are those who believe that it may be time to move beyond the investigation to begin focusing on the political reforms necessary to prevent such widespread corruption in the future. Others want to keep pushing. But if Brazil can commit to anti-corruption ideals and reforms, it could serve as an example to the rest of the world — not just for developing countries, but for superpowers, too.“Brazil is, under very difficult circumstances, responding to the self-inflicted problems that we face,” Sotero said. “I have a hopeful attitude. I’m not trying to be Pollyanna here, but we can do this. To me, it is very clear that the world should look to Brazil — and maybe even cheer for us.”"

Over the past three years, Brazil’s ever-growing corruption scandal has enveloped hundreds of politicians. President Dilma Rousseff was impeached last fall. And last Wednesday, Brazil’s problems got even worse: A federal judge convicted the country’s former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, on charges of corruption and money laundering.The conviction and potential imprisonment of a former president, especially one who was a leading candidate for next year’s presidential election, will throw Brazil even deeper into crisis. But it should also cause concern for the rest of the world. Without a stable Brazil, it will be hard — perhaps impossible — to solve the planet’s most pressing international problems.“The world needs Brazil,” said Mark Langevin, the head of the Brazil Institute at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs.The country’s largest natural resource, the Amazon rainforest, is crucial in the global fight against climate change, and the debate over how to protect it continues to rage in Brazil. Brazilian President Michel Temer is currently pushing legislation that would remove protections from an area of the Amazon the size of Portugal.

On",2017-07-19,Sex education in Ghana must address the needs of girls.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596f7a3b1a00003400dbf911.jpeg?cache=J0SONl1zAf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For Esenam Amuzu’s peers in Ghana, teen pregnancy, gender-based violence and risky sexual behavior are often the norm. On World Population Day, she explains how sex education and access to contraception can turn girls’ lives around.LABADI, GHANA – Education about sexuality and reproductive health is a serious political issue in many Western countries. But in Ghana, and in many other developing countries, family planning is a matter of life and death, especially for girls and young women.Six years ago, when I was a girl growing up in a slum in southern Ghana, it was normal to hear stories of teenagers having abortions; of 14-year-olds giving birth; and of 18-year-old men beating their prepubescent girlfriends because they refused to wash their partner’s clothes. No one in a position of authority – like parents or teachers – seemed concerned that the victims were unmarried girls, often below the legal age of consent.This was my “normal.” Many classmates dropped out of school after becoming pregnant. Others died as they opted for abortions in unlicensed facilities.If I could see these problems so clearly, why couldn’t the adults in my life do something about them?In the part of Ghana where I grew up, education about sexuality was the limiting factor. Young women and girls lacked access to even the most basic information about reproductive health. The subject was not taught in schools, owing to “cultural sensitivities.”Parents and educators were not much help, either; many believed that talking about sex with children would cause them to be more promiscuous. So, instead of being the first place to turn, family and teachers became a last resort. Many of us turned to one another; others went online, where information is often inaccurate.The lack of sex education has caused severe harm to Ghana’s youth. According to a recent survey by the U.S.-based Guttmacher Institute, 12 percent of Ghanaian girls under 15 have had sex at least once (compared to 9 percent of boys). Of those who are sexually active today, only 30 percent use any form contraceptive, and just 22 percent use a modern one (like condoms). In a country with high teenage birthrates and staggering levels of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, these percentages are deeply troubling.Birth control can be a lifeline for young women in particular. The United Nations Population Fund, for example, estimates that increased use of contraceptives in developing countries would reduce annual maternal deaths by 70,000, and infant deaths by 500,000. In Ghana, broadening access to modern contraception is a crucial starting point for improving the long-term health of children and expectant mothers.For starters, governments should emphasize young people’s sexual health by offering a comprehensive instruction in reproductive health issues, including topics related to contraceptive methods, how to communicate in relationships and where to access information and support related to HIVand other sexually transmitted diseases. Governments must also increase partnerships with civil society groups.And yet Ghana’s young people cannot rely on adults to do all the work; we must advocate on our own behalf. Earlier this year, I helped launch a youth-led initiative called My Teen Life, to give young people a voice in how we talk about sexuality in rural parts of Ghana. Thanks to the generous support of the Global Changemakers initiative in Switzerland, this project is off to a promising start. It is already educating parents and guardians about how to talk to their children about sexual health; providing skills training to teenage mothers; and working to break the cycle of poverty and early childbirth.To date, My Teen Life has reached more than a hundred teenagers and their families, and a first group of teen mothers has been trained to make jewelry and slippers to generate income. We hope to expand these and other outreach efforts to many more Ghanaian and other African teens in the coming months and years.Such initiatives are meant to appeal to girls in ways that government programs do not. Until recently, “family planning” in Ghana was offered only to married couples. Though that has changed somewhat, many women, even those who are married, are still prevented from accessing quality services because of patriarchal family structures.In our small way, My Teen Life is reaching out to young people. We are helping them learn and understand what happens as they grow, and how best to make decisions that will set their future course in life. We are empowering every young girl we work with to stay in school, and stressing that if they express their sexuality, they must retain control over what happens to their body.Much more work remains to be done, but my colleagues and I believe that when young people provide solutions to their own problems, lasting change is more likely to follow.Esenam Amuzu is a European Development Days 2017 Young Leader.

(REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596f8bc315000020008b2970.jpeg?cache=uWFI4jWF3i&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Pete SchroederWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress could act within weeks to kill a new rule that bars financial companies from blocking consumers who wish to file class-action lawsuits, according to a key Republican senator.Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Senate Banking Committee writing legislation to tackle the rule, said Wednesday he was optimistic that Congress could pass a resolution revoking the new regulation authored by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within weeks.“I’m going to do all I can to repeal this regulation in the next three weeks of this congressional session,” he said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Cotton is drafting legislation that would repeal the CFPB’s new ban on mandatory arbitration clauses often found in financial contracts. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can pass legislation repealing any new regulations with a simple majority.Mandatory arbitration clauses, found across a range of financial contracts, require consumers to resolve any disputes through arbitration instead of joining together in class-action lawsuits.Consumer advocates have hailed the CFPB rulemaking, arguing that the fine print frequently found in financial contracts unfairly bars consumers from seeking that option.If Republican majorities in the House and Senate rally around the bill, they would be able to eliminate the new rule, which the CFPB formally finalized on Tuesday.Cotton said he was working with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo on the bill, and was optimistic it would garner broad support.He went so far as to predict “half a dozen or so” Democrats in the Senate could join Republicans in eliminating the rule, although Democrats are generally supportive of the CFPB’s regulatory work and no Democratic senator has publicly criticized the rule.The House is expected to move first on a repeal bill, passing a measure next week, according toCotton.Republican efforts to repeal the regulation via legislation is one of several fronts in an attack on the CFPB initiative.Other financial regulators could consider challenging the rule, and business groups have indicated a legal challenge is on the way as well.“The agency has shirked its obligation to properly study the arbitration issue, as it was mandated by Congress,” said Lisa Rickard, president of the Chamber of Commerce’s Institute for Legal Reform. “The courts will have their say.”(Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)"

I was watching a video clip of men in Iraqi army uniforms throwing a detainee off a cliff onto the banks of a river and opening fire on him. As he fell and landed next to another motionless body, I couldn’t help but think that this footage could breathe new life into the self-proclaimed Islamic State or ISIS or whatever ISIS 2.0 will be called now that its Iraqi “capital” has fallen. Such unchecked abuse, I thought, as Baghdad celebrated the liberation of Mosul on the streets below, would likely drive more enraged men into the hands of these extremists. I first came across the clip, one of many depicting Iraqi forces committing abuses such as torture and execution, the day before on Facebook. It stood out because it featured a particularly disturbing form of execution and took place in a location that was far too familiar to me. Within five minutes of its release, my colleague at Human Rights Watch who specializes in satellite imagery analysis, had identified the exact building and cliff in west Mosul where this video was filmed. What he saw in the images, which were spaced out over several days leading up to the date the video was circulated online, was Iraqi army vehicles present around the place from which the man in the footage had been thrown. This strongly suggests that the video is real and recent. The government has yet to properly comment.If it is authentic, it wouldn’t be the first video of its kind to be released. Other videos of the Emergency Response Division of the Iraqi Ministry of Interior surfaced a few months ago and up until that point were perhaps the most disturbing abuse videos to come out of the battle to reclaim the fallen Iraqi city. But seeing this July 11 video emerge just after the prime minister declared victory over ISIS in Mosul, made me feel especially pessimistic about the future of Iraq and the potential defeat of ISIS. It was as if in the final phase of their campaign, Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition forces, who had launched the offensive months earlier, were saying, “Let’s get this over with as quickly as possible,” and disregarding respect for and commitment to the laws of war. Such a pervasive attitude will surely not go unnoticed and will likely backfire to embolden the future version of ISIS by drawing in more recruits.In fact, despite celebrations in Iraq and media reports to the contrary, the recent defeat of ISIS in Mosul does not mean the end of ISIS. It means the end of an ISIS that controls territory. This is a blow to the so-called caliphate, but it’s also the beginning of a new phase, one that could be just as, if not more, frightening.In the last few months as it’s lost ground in Mosul and its “capital” of Raqqa in Syria, ISIS has also been morphing quickly back into a traditional extremist insurgent group, carrying out bombings in Iraq and Syria. A key part of why it will continue to attract recruits is exactly because of videos like the one I saw earlier this month. Such footage, which seemingly hypocritically showcases Iraqi soldiers using this battle to not only continue to abuse the civilian population, but also stoop to ISIS’ level when doing so, only further inflames the tensions ISIS thrives in.While the first months of the Mosul offensive were relatively clean, this horrible video marked yet another instance of the government’s cruelty. Evidence of abuse by Iraqi troops from Mosul and from previous operations against ISIS in Iraq have, as I mentioned earlier, been seen before. Human Rights Watch has documented summary executions of suspected ISIS fighters, detention in inhumane conditions and collective punishment against family members of ISIS fighters, including home demolitions and forced deportations to “rehabilitation camps” at the hands of Iraq’s government. We have also documented the arbitrary detention of over 1,000 Sunnis displaced from the fighting around Mosul. But even this striking footage on the heels of Mosul’s liberation was an unfortunate wake-up call at a critical time for the country.Worse, this video serves as a reminder of exploitation by the Iraqi government in years prior to ISIS. Since 2003, Iraqi forces and mostly Shia non-state and government armed groups have carried out abuses against the civilian population with complete impunity, mainly targeting Sunni Arabs. They have executed campaigns of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture, extrajudicial killings and forcible displacement. These experiences no doubt pushed young Sunni Arab men to join extremist groups in Iraq in the past. Families of those who have joined ISIS have told me this, and there’s no reason why the government’s ramped up abuse now will not continue to serve as a recruitment tool as ISIS seeks to reassert itself after its loss in Mosul.Every Iraqi and coalition representative I’ve spoken with agrees that the battle against ISIS is not simply a military one, but also a political one to stem the push factors that most likely have encouraged young Sunni Arab men to turn to extremist groups. Part of this fight, perhaps more challenging than the military one, is to end the reign of impunity, and for Baghdad authorities to show the Iraqi public that they are investigating and holding their own forces and commanders accountable even while fighting back against ISIS.But so far Human Rights Watch has not seen a single example of such accountability since 2014, including after grotesque videos of Iraqi officers from the Interior Ministry’s elite Emergency Response Division torturing and executing alleged ISIS affiliates and their family members were published in May. We heard from an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on July 14 that the government would announce action against the officers involved, but not for some time, because it would “interfere with the current congratulatory victory messages.”This suggests to me that Abadi does not fully appreciate how damaging these abuses continue to be. The battle for Mosul is meant to be the final battle in Iraq against ISIS, yet it has opened the floodgates to the very abuses that Baghdad has met with silence for years. Right now, Abadi should represent not only his constituency who desire a military blow to ISIS, but also the more than 1 million civilians who have lived under ISIS control for the past three years. He should demonstrate as quickly as possible that he also has their interests at heart, is taking steps to end the abuses that have marginalized them, and reintegrate them into an Iraq that aims to reconcile communities and rejects calls for retribution. Abadi’s window is closing fast. Videos like the one on July 11 have eaten away at the feelings of optimism I had for where things are heading in Iraq ― not only in Mosul. It demonstrated that the country, even at the highest levels of government, is determined to sew more seeds of resentment rather than address grievances.If Baghdad doesn’t act now, we will not only fail to see an end to extremist groups in Iraq anytime soon, but we will also see the cycle of marginalization continue and an ISIS 2.0 unleash itself on the world."

Earlier this year, the family traveled to Orlando, Florida, to visit Disney World and go to the Star Wars Celebration event. Janielle and Elijah, who are biological siblings, knew Courtney and Tom wanted to adopt them then, but they didn't know when it would become official. That’s when Mickey Mouse stepped in.Courtney and her husband booked a FastPass so the kids could meet Mickey at the Magic Kingdom and initially thought they could surprise the kids by slipping the character a sign that revealed their official adoption date. The Disney team took it a step further, though, and booked a private meet-and-greet with Mickey for the family after seeing a Twitter post from Courtney. She had shared a photo of the buttons the family planned on wearing that showed they were celebrating the kids’ adoption.″[Disney was] so thankful they were able to help us when we were the ones that should have been thankful, and we were,” Courtney told HuffPost. Courtney shared a video of the surprise on Facebook on July 6. The video, which has more than 1.5 million views as of Wednesday afternoon, shows Janielle and Elijah in shock after learning their adoption would be finalized in a matter of weeks. Courtney told HuffPost the kids immediately began figuring out how many more days they had until their adoption was finalized. She and her husband were glad they managed to pull the surprise off.“I try to trick them with vacations and stuff and they always guess them, but this time we actually got it,” she said. "

The campaign features compelling stories from people across the United States who have been affected by mental illness, including Lisa’s story below.By Lisa B.My home was rarely without music—either of my own creation or from the Broadway musical soundtracks that I have loved all of my life. Then, without warning, at 57, I—an energetic music teacher who loved introducing my students to sounds of the world—suddenly lost all hope and joy in my life.I could not play music. I had no desire to eat. I no longer wanted to go to the job I loved. I had no interest in the things that once brought me joy. Depression left me unable to function.I was in such a dark place, looking back on that time, I remember not even knowing who I was anymore. Everything just seemed so bleak.The day before Thanksgiving 2012, my family became so concerned about my behavior and dark thoughts that they arranged for me to have a psychiatric evaluation. I was diagnosed with severe depression and was immediately admitted into an inpatient program.That was the hardest time in my life. I was in the hospital and just felt like the weight of the world was bearing down on me.Having grown up in an Irish Catholic family, I was raised not to talk about my problems and to never let on in public that anything was wrong.Admitting out loud that I was depressed and needed help was its own struggle. But I knew I needed to get better—if not for me, for the people who loved and supported me.With the determination to battle depression head-on, I embraced my treatment and about a week into the program—thanks to medication and group and individual therapy—I started to feel more like my old self.No one ever wants to go into the hospital. It’s scary on many levels, but I am thankful for each day that I went. By the time I left, I was playing the piano again. I was reading and reconnecting with old friends. I felt like I regained my life.While I continue to struggle with depression—I still see a therapist regularly—I speak openly about my challenges to all who will listen because I hope that they will learn from my experience.If I can help even just one person not get to the desperate place I got to, then I’ll feel accomplished.Lisa is a 63-year-old retired music teacher from Pennsylvania.

And workers believed candidate Donald Trump when he pledged to stop corporations from exporting American factories. Workers cast votes based on Trump swearing he would end the trade cheating that kills American jobs.This week, though, workers got bad news from Washington, D.C. President Trump proposed virtually eliminating funding for a Labor Department bureau that helps prevent U.S. workers from having to compete with forced and child labor overseas. In addition, the administration issued only vague objectives for renegotiating the job-killing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).When NAFTA has cost at least 900,000 Americans their jobs, vague is unacceptable. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said his first rule in negotiations for a new NAFTA would be to “do no harm.” That’s not good enough. That’s the status quo, and promises were made. The first rule should be to “do substantial good.”Substantial good would start with clear, firm goals for renegotiating NAFTA. That would include returning those 900,000 jobs to the United States. That would include restoring the jobs the United States continues to lose, like the 350 that disappeared this year when Rexnord closed its Indianapolis ball bearing factory and moved production to Mexico. And like the 632 jobs at Carrier in Indianapolis that will begin vanishing this week when the first layoff notices are issued because the heating and air conditioning manufacturer shifted some production to Mexico.In Monterrey, where both Rexnord and Carrier moved jobs, the minimum wage is $3.90 a day. Not an hour. It’s $3.90 a day. There is no way for American workers to compete with that. What they were looking for from the NAFTA renegotiation goals is some help.Instead, they got pabulum. Yes, there’s a whole section on labor, and it says the labor provisions should be in the main document, not in a side agreement. But the fuzzy language doesn’t provide much hope for workers like those who just lost their jobs at Carrier and Rexnord.It says, for example, that NAFTA countries should have laws regarding minimum wage, hours of work and occupational health and safety. That’s great. But Mexico has a minimum wage. It’s one so low that, as former presidential candidate Ross Perot would say, it sucks American factories right across Rio Grande.The NAFTA negotiation targets don’t say that the minimum wage should be a living wage or specify how it would be policed to prevent forced and child labor.Within the U.S. Department of Labor, there’s a section called the Bureau of International Labor Affairs that monitors compliance with labor provisions in international trade agreements and pays for programs to reduce child and forced labor internationally. The intent is to prevent American manufacturing workers earning family-supporting wages from competing with third world children paid with bread and blankets.The administration has, however, said it wants to gut that program, cutting its funding by 80 percent. In addition to workers, American food and clothing corporations have objected. Nate Herman, a senior vice president for the American Apparel and Footwear Association, told the Washington Post that without the bureau’s efforts, “you’re saying, basically, that it’s okay for forced labor and child labor to run rampant, which undercuts our own labor force.”Without specific protections in NAFTA and without even the Bureau of International Labor Affairs programs, U.S. workers are subjected to a no-win competition with exploited foreign workers. The Americans end up unemployed, like those at Carrier and Rexnord. The foreign workers continue to be abused.Promises were made to American workers. They need to be kept. Big league, not halfway.For example, the solution to Carrier, owned by United Technologies, moving out of Indiana was a half measure.United Technologies spared about 700 jobs at the Indianapolis Carrier plant only after Vice President Mike Pence, then governor of the state, handed the corporation $7 million. None of the 700 jobs at the other United Technologies plant in Indiana was saved. All of those went to Mexico.That’s not what Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail. At a rally in Indianapolis last spring, he pledged: “Here’s what’s going to happen. They’re going to call me, and they are going to say, ’Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana . . . One hundred percent. It’s not like we have an 80 percent chance of keeping them or a 95 percent. 100 percent.”But then, it was President-elect Trump who called Carrier. And it wasn’t 100 percent. It wasn’t even 80 percent. And, to make matters worse, United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes said that the millions he’d promised to invest in the plant would be spent on automation, further reducing jobs.This is, according to the Trump administration, Made in America Week. It began at the White House Monday with a showcase of products produced in every American state, from fire trucks to door hinges. But to really revive American manufacturing, the administration must keep its campaign promises. And that means strong language in a renegotiated NAFTA and strong enforcement of other international trade deals and trade laws.“No harm” is not enough for the administration that promised to cure the injury that international trade inflicted on workers."

July 8.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596e36c31500002000bfe2ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIRUT — The Iraqi city of Mosul has been liberated from the so-called Islamic State. Now, Iraqis and their international partners have an opportunity — as happened after the liberation of Fallujah, Tikrit and other towns that ISIS once controlled — to implement policies that achieve three intimately linked goals.The reconstruction and revival of the city in a manner that serves all residents.This will require movement on two levels to cement the gains from the military defeat of ISIS in Mosul and other parts of northwestern Iraq and reduce the likelihood that ISIS or something worse rises again from the rubble of devastated Arab societies. First, we need deep and sustained reforms in the dysfunctional, corrupt governance systems across many Arab lands, so that citizens have a stronger voice in their societies and their basic needs are better met. Second, we need an end to the nonstop foreign military attacks and domestic civil wars that continue to create zones of chaos in which local governments collapse and terror groups thrive.In the urgent context of post-ISIS Mosul, Iraqis must identify a set of several actions to spur progress to restore normal life. The most important areas for action are daily security under the rule of law applied to all; inclusive governance and power-sharing that leaves no citizen feeling marginalized and heals divisions; reducing corruption, nepotism and abuse of power by official and unofficial groups who now act with impunity; and reliable delivery of basic services like water, electricity and health care. The immense scale of destruction makes physical reconstruction in a secure context the obvious top priority, given that 80 percent of the city is in ruins and tens of thousands of people’s homes have been severely damaged.Some ambitious actions could seek to achieve several of these aims simultaneously. Local city and provincial government councils should be established to allow all sectarian groups to share in decision-making locally. Independent courts and new checks-and-balances systems should hold power accountable under the rule of law that is administered by local courts, audit systems and other such authorities. The government should prioritize expenditures on projects that the people of Mosul themselves deem most important to them.The single matter that encapsulates all these linked dynamics is the behavior of security services, whether official government forces, informal tribal-sectarian groups, or private and freelance armed groups. Iraqis who have suffered the ravages of war and abuse by their own and foreign powers express a clear and widespread desire to be treated fairly and decently by security forces from all sides. Mosul’s reconstruction must quickly allow all its citizens to feel that they will no longer be arbitrarily arrested, robbed, kidnapped, tortured, killed or evicted from their homes, as has been the case for some decades now.Iraqis are disgusted and terrified by the impunity enjoyed by gun-wielding men from all quarters ― including the army, police, local Sunni or Shiite militias, Iran-backed fighters, gangs and others — who commit criminal acts at will. Arresting and trying perpetrators for their actions would quickly reduce this threat. Corruption and nepotism, which are tightly linked with sectarian identity, also must be addressed. The government must remove from its payroll the estimated hundreds of thousands of citizens around the country who get paid but do little to no work. The government should instead use the money to fund reconstruction projects that create immediate jobs for Mosul residents. A new audit mechanism should be implemented to ensure that people registered as working for the government are actually alive and doing the work. A multi-sectarian review committee of Mosul locals should oversee such an accountability process, which would be protected by the city’s residents if they see that it generates jobs and better services for them.Mosul offers an opportunity that was missed many times before in Iraq in recent years: the state can apply the law evenly and spend its funds equitably to serve all citizens in a manner that reduces corruption and nepotism, enhances quality of life, improves sense of belonging and security, and consequently eliminates the marginalization, humiliation and helplessness that have driven so many desperate men and women to ISIS and its cruel, false promises.The Iraqi government has emerged from its campaign to evict ISIS from Mosul with enhanced capabilities and credibility. It should immediately apply these in the governance sphere in rebuilding Mosul to regain respect there as it has on the battlefield. "

The state is expected to see a growing number of wildfires caused by lightning as the climate warms.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596f78ae1a00003400dbf907.jpeg?cache=b5uiOKf5vB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Longer hot, dry spells in the boreal forests that stretch across Alaska and the Northwest Territories create the conditions for wildfires triggered by lightning strikes.SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT on June 22, 2015, lightning struck along Alaska’s Elliott Highway, 48km (30 miles) northwest of Fairbanks, igniting black spruce forests and tinder-dry grasses. The Aggie Creek Fire, as it was later called, would go on to burn for more than two months, scorching some 12,100 hectares (30,000 acres) and threatening the state’s Alyeska oil pipeline. By the end of 2015, more than 2.06 million hectares (5.1 million acres) had burned in 770 fires across Alaska, an area roughly the size of Connecticut and second to only 2004’s record-breaking 2.67 million hectares (6.6 million acres). In 2014, Northwest Territories saw the worst fire season since 1975, when 385 fires burned 3.4 million hectares (8.4million acres) in the Canadian territory.The majority of fires in the North are started by lightning – not humans, as is the case in the lower 48 states. In the hot summer months, it’s not unheard of for more than 2,000 lightning strikes to hit Alaska’s lowlands in a single day. But due to a lack of reliable monitoring systems, it wasn’t clear just how large a role lightning played in the 2014 and 2015 wildfires – or how lightning will affect future fire seasons.In a recent study in Nature Climate Change, researchers looked at variations from year to year and found that between 1975 and 2015, 76 percent of large wildfires and 82 percent of burned area in the Northwest Territories originated from lightning. In interior Alaska, those numbers increased to 87 percent of large fires and 95 percent of burned area. With lightning strikes predicted to increase by up to 59 percent by mid-century, these findings have significant implications for the boreal forest and tundra. If fire size remains the same, researchers project that changes in lightning ignitions will ultimately see 35 percent more area burned in the Northwest Territories and 55 percent more area burned in interior Alaska by 2050.Fire is a natural part of boreal forest ecosystems, with forest stands burning every 60 to 100 years. But Arctic warming has disrupted the natural cycle. Over the past 50 years, Alaska has warmed by about 2C (3.6F) – twice the rate of the rest of the planet. At the same time, wildfires have become more frequent and more severe, with the fire season lengthening by about four days per decade.According to the study, this longer fire season may increase the number of lightning ignitions by also lengthening the period of thermal convection and thunderstorm formation. Earlier snowmelt and dry vegetation, researchers posit, will then exacerbate ignition rates. “In the boreal forest, the fuel load is always there,” said Randi Jandt, fire ecologist with the Alaska Fire Science Consortium. “You only need two weeks to dry out Spanish moss and then it starts behaving like a dead fuel.”But while the dense fuel loads of the boreal forest have long been recognized for their fire potential, lightning has largely been overlooked in past models. “Lightning as a driver of ecosystem change, and potentially a biome shift, has remained underestimated,” said Sander Veraverbeke, lead author of the study. “Till now, we did not appreciate well that lightning can bring fire to areas that did not experience fire before.”Though a network of ground-based lightning sensor towers exist across Alaska and Canada, inconsistencies have made it difficult for researchers to rely on the data. For one thing, the towers, Veraverbeke said, are not spread out equally over the landscape, with more towers located in forested regions and none near treeline. That makes it difficult for researchers to detect changes in lightning in the transitional zone between boreal forest and tundra.Secondly, lightning sensors have been continuously upgraded, which makes it impossible for scientists to accurately analyze trends over time. “A new and better lightning network was installed in Alaska in 2012,” noted Veraverbeke. “This is great for the current detection accuracy. However, it’s difficult to compare the new data with the pre-2012 data.”As it stands, there are no space-based sensors that collect lightning data in the high latitudes with enough detail to enable scientists to study lighting-fire interactions. Veraverbeke said such a detector in a polar orbit would provide consistent data for not only boreal North America, but also boreal Eurasia.This article originally appeared on Arctic Deeply.

Tom Horne, a Republican who also served as the state’s attorney general from 2011 to 2015, made the comments on the witness stand in the second week of a trial over whether conservative officials discriminated against Hispanics by abolishing a controversial Mexican-American studies curriculum from Tucson public schools. Republican officials, led by Horne, accused the teachers of the Mexican-American studies classes of politicizing students and fostering resentment against white people. But supporters of the program cite independent research showing that the classes encouraged college-level critical thinking skills and that students who took them scored higher on state tests and graduated at a higher rate. Jim Quinn, one of six lawyers representing Tucson students suing to overturn the ethnic studies law, grilled Horne over his decision to use it exclusively to shut down the Tucson classes, despite their positive results. But Horne insisted he wanted all ethnic studies banned from the state and wrote the law broadly enough to achieve that goal over time.  “We had a tough enough time with the MAS program,” Horne said of his efforts to ban Mexican-American studies from Tucson schools, which he launched in 2006. “I hoped to eventually eliminate them all.” The 2010 law contained four provisions limiting ethnic studies in the state’s school system. It forbade classes that encourage the overthrow of the U.S. government, that breed racial resentment, treat students as members of a group rather than individuals, or that are designed for a specific ethnic group. The latter provision, in theory, would have allowed the state government to also shut down African-American, Native American and Asian-American studies classes as well. But neither Horne nor his successor as superintendent of public instruction, John Huppenthal, ever found those classes out of compliance with the ethnic studies law.Instead, Horne targeted only the Mexican-American studies classes in Tucson, citing an investigation he led based on comments from five current and former Tucson teachers who said the program’s instructors had accused them of racism or fostered ethnic nationalism among the district’s students. One of the teachers Horne cited said some students who took the class were “dissed” for being white.Horne’s investigation was supplemented by excerpts from materials used in the classes that he found offensive, including Rodolfo Acuña’s Occupied America: A History of Chicanos. “The mere title shows what kind of propaganda it is,” Horne said. Acuña served as a professor for decades at California State University, Northridge and his book is widely considered a classic in the field of Mexican-American history. Horne likewise took issue with the use of Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed. While that book is commonly used in university-level education programs, Horne described Freire as a Communist who expressed un-American values. “These kids should be taught that they should work hard so they can achieve their dreams,” Horne said. Horne described his all-encompassing opposition to ethnic studies as part of an anti-racist ideology that he holds as one of his core political beliefs. He testified that his parents fled Nazi-occupied Poland and several of his relatives died in the Holocaust. He noted that he attended the speech at which Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech and spends his downtime reading Mexican history books in Spanish. “My whole life has been a crusade against racism,” Horne said. But he continues to view any classes designed to serve a particular ethnicity as fundamentally racist. When Quinn asked him why he only targeted Tucson’s Mexican-American studies classes when authoring and implementing the new law, Horne said it was the only curriculum that he’d received complaints about or compiled evidence on. “It was a pure historical accident that a group of radical teachers created that program,” Horne said. Quinn noted that Horne also received a complaint about one of the state’s Native American studies classes. But Horne said he didn’t try to shut it down because it was protected by federal law. It’s unclear whether Horne’s comments will affect U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima’s ruling in the two-week bench trial. Tashima ruled in 2013 that the provision barring classes designed specifically for one ethnicity violated the Constitution. A three-judge panel at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling in 2015, when it ordered Tashima to hold the trial that began last month over the constitutionality of the law’s other provisions. Horne began his attack on ethnic studies in 2006, after civil rights leader Dolores Huerta gave a speech at a Tucson high school in which she said that “Republicans hate Latinos” ― a reference to the contentious immigration debate. In response, Horne dispatched his assistant, Margaret Dugan, a Hispanic Republican, to offer a counter-speech. Some students, upset that they weren’t permitted to ask questions, stood up while she was talking, turned their backs, raised their fists and put tape across their mouths in protest. The episode angered Horne further. On Tuesday, he described the protest as “rude,” and accused the Mexican-American studies teachers of encouraging students to carry it out ― a charge they deny. Quinn likened the students’ protest to the famous moment in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, when African-American sprinters John Carlos and Tommie Smith bowed their heads and raised their fists on the podium to protest the mistreatment of black people in the United States, as many fought for civil rights.Horne was unmoved by the comparison. “I thought it was rude as heck,” Horne said of the 1968 protest. “They were representing this country and I was not pleased.” Ethnic studies classes are taught at many American universities and have increasingly been adopted in public schools across the country ― partly in response to the publicity generated by Arizona Republicans’ ban of the Tucson classes.

On Tuesday, the group announced 250Kby2030, a campaign which aims to achieve gender parity in politics by 2030. There are 500,000 elected positions in the U.S. ― of which women currently make up less than 25 percent. So parity might seem like a lofty goal to achieve in just 13 years, but She Should Run is most definitely ready. Founder and CEO of She Should Run, Erin Loos Cutraro, told Axios on Tuesday that the organization wants to capitalize on the recent rise in women running for office since Donald Trump was elected. Cutraro said that over 11,000 women have joined She Should Run to run for office on different local, state and national levels since November. Additionally, more than 16,000 women have signed up to run for office through Emily’s List, a similar organization that recruits women to run for office.“We’re really taking advantage of this surge and saying, ‘Now is our chance to build this path,’” Cutraro said. “And that means these women who are thinking about running can be whatever type of leader they want to be and that there isn’t ― and by the way has never been ― an exact formula to get elected.”She Should Run has created a few actionable steps in order to reach gender parity, including a call-to-action to female leaders like journalists, activists and lawmakers to join the campaign as mentors for women interested in running. Other ways women can get involved include asking a woman in your community to run for office, hosting a fundraiser, donating money and/or organizing a training session. According to The Cut, once She Should Run pairs mentors with new candidates, the organization will create a community referral program that offers resources close to home to help candidates through the campaign process. “Research backs that women question their qualifications in a way that men don’t, and we see that come in a variety of forms as women come into the community,” Cutraro told Axios.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596fda2115000020008b2a9e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Thirty-two million fewer people would have health coverage, health insurance premiums would double and the insurance market would destabilize over the next 10 years under legislation the Senate may take up next week, according to a report the Congressional Budget Office published Wednesday.This isn’t the Better Care Reconciliation Act, the measure to repeal and “replace” the Affordable Care Act that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) shelved Monday because it lacked enough support to pass ― and that President Donald Trump and some Republican senators are trying to revive.Instead, McConnell said he plans to bring up legislation bluntly entitled the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act, which is based on a bill Congress passed in 2015 and that President Barack Obama vetoed last year.Both the House-passed American Health Care Act and the Better Care Reconciliation Act sought to erect new health insurance systems and new, less generous forms of financial assistance as well as eliminate many of the Affordable Care Act’s regulations and consumer protections.The Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act, by contrast, would merely eliminate the Affordable Care Act’s tax credits for private insurance, funding for its Medicaid expansion, the individual mandate that most Americans obtain health coverage or face tax penalties, the mandate that large employers offer health benefits to workers, and the taxes on wealthy people and health care corporations.The result of those policies, the Congressional Budget Office projected in its report Wednesday, would be vastly more uninsured people and an unsustainable health insurance market.Taking away financial assistance for private insurance and funding for states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would cause millions to lose coverage, including 17 million next year alone.But the damage to the health care system would go deeper. Absent the individual mandate ― which encourages low-cost healthy people to enroll in coverage ― and the tax credits for insurance policies sold on the exchanges, insurers would be forced to increase premiums to cover the expense of treating those customers who are sick enough that they are motivated to buy coverage.That’s largely because the bill would leave in place guarantees of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions as well as regulations that make coverage more generous. And that mix of policies would create a nightmarish scenario for insurers, according to the Congressional Budget Office.The outcome, the Congressional Budget Office expects, is health insurance companies would exit the segment of the market for people who buy their insurance directly or through an exchange. About three-quarters of the country’s population would live in geographic areas with no health insurance providers by 2026, the report says. These consequences would be even more severe than those the Congressional Budget Office projected for the House-passed bill and McConnell’s legislation. Under the American Health Care Act, 23 million fewer people would have health coverage by 2026, and under the Better Care Reconciliation Act, 22 million fewer would be covered.At times, Trump and GOP congressional leaders have called for a two-step legislative process ― dubbed “repeal and delay” ― that would entail first passing legislation like the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act that undoes major parts of the Affordable Care Act, and then subsequently enacting a “replacement” bill.That process in and of itself could cause chaos in the health insurance market as insurers and consumers would be left in limbo until the second phase of legislating is concluded. And that’s even assuming the Republicans can come together on a set of health care reforms, which they have been incapable of doing in the seven-plus years since the Affordable Care Act became law.

51,MEDIA,How A Political Scientist Broke The News Of Trump's Meeting With Putin,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ian-bremmer-trump-putin-meeting_us_596f7676e4b0000eb197bbfd,"Ian Bremmer explains the most ""unnerving"" part of Trump's conversation.",2017-07-19,Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer broke the news about President Donald Trump's undisclosed meeting with Vladimir Putin.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596f771515000020008b290f.jpeg?cache=sivNR8VsOF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At 8 a.m. on Monday, Ian Bremmer, the president of global consulting firm Eurasia Group, did something unexpected in his weekly briefing for clients, foreign dignitaries and friends: He broke major news. Bremmer is a renowned political scientist and not a reporter. That’s evident in Bremmer’s Monday dispatch, the first 700 words of which featured analysis of the recent G-20 summit before dropping a scoop that any news organization would’ve been quick to promote. He revealed that President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke for roughly an hour during a July 7 dinner of world leaders in addition to having a widely covered two-hour meeting earlier that day.In an interview with HuffPost, Bremmer said he first learned details of the Trump-Putin meeting last week and began writing his weekly report on Saturday. Yet it would still be three days, and after an appearance on “Charlie Rose,” before the news spread widely. Bremer said he has “enormous respect” for journalists, but doesn’t see it as his role to be first with a scoop.“I’m not in the news breaking business,” he said. “What I do ― both the Eurasia Group and as a political scientist ― is to help people better understand the world, and I don’t think a breaking news headline is necessarily the best way to do that.”The big news break that Trump and Putin had an undisclosed meeting isn’t as troubling as how the situation unfolded, Bremmer said.He said G-20 attendees found it specifically “unnerving” that Trump would walk over and sit down alone, at length, with Putin ― and that the pair demonstrated a collegial body language that departs from the president’s comparatively colder behavior with traditional U.S. allies.The fact that the conversation occurred with only a Russian translator present raises concerns about Trump’s lack of foreign policy experience, Bremmer said. The details of the exchange otherwise remain a mystery. Bremmer, who is also an editor-at-large at Time magazine and a foreign affairs pundit on TV, has cultivated relationships with foreign officials for decades through his work with Eurasia Group. He understandably won’t reveal his sources for the report, but acknowledged that he personally knows attendees of the G-20 summit.Bremmer’s analytic team reads over his weekly briefings before the company blasts them out on Monday morning. One of the recipients of the email was Bremmer’s friend Charlie Rose, the “CBS This Morning” anchor and host of his eponymous talk show on Bloomberg News and PBS. Bremmer was already scheduled to appear on Rose’s Monday night show, and unsurprisingly, the host led off the discussion with news of the Trump-Putin meeting.Bremmer said Rose’s show was the ideal venue to discuss the meeting, since it allows for longer conversations in which he could provide context and analysis of why the discussion was important, and not just say that it occurred. On the show, Bremmer described the leaders’ conversation as one “that no one’s even heard of.”Though there was a line buried in a July 8 BuzzFeed story that Trump had had another “long chat” with Putin “after” a G-20 dinner, not during it, the meeting went otherwise unreported. The clip of Bremmer’s appearance on “Charlie Rose” didn’t begin circulating widely until Tuesday afternoon, more than a half day after it aired, at which point other news organizations pressed the White House for information.The White House confirmed the meeting on Tuesday evening, but downplayed its significance. And the president characteristically dismissed the latest revelations about his administration as “fake news” and “sick.”Bremmer summed up the chronology of events on Twitter. While it’s common for world leaders to have casual conversations at summit dinners, it’s unusual for the president to speak for an hour to a world leader without his own translator ― and for such an encounter to not be disclosed to the public and summarized in a readout.Ben Rhodes, a top foreign policy adviser to former President Barack Obama, tweeted that the previous White House “used to read out these types of interactions with Putin at Summits given the public interest.”And public interest in the U.S. president’s dealings with Putin has heightened significantly since the Obama administration. The undisclosed Trump-Putin meeting comes after the president has repeatedly praised the Russian leader and resisted the conclusion of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia interfered in the presidential election to support his campaign. Meanwhile, there are ongoing investigations into links between Trump associates and Putin, and the revelations are still dripping out about Donald Trump Jr. meeting with Kremlin-linked Russians during the 2016 campaign under the promise of receiving potentially damaging information about Trump’s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Clearly, any lengthy exchange between Trump and Putin is newsworthy ― and yet the White House has continued a pattern of disclosing insufficient information to the public about the president’s dealings with world leaders and officials. It was Russian state media that revealed in May that Trump met in the Oval Office with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak the morning after the president fired FBI director James Comey in part because of his investigation into Trump allies’ ties to Russia. The White House had barred the U.S. press from the May meeting with Russian officials, forcing news organizations to rely on photographs distributed by Russian news agency Tass. In other instances, the Trump White House has provided terse or vague readouts of meetings with world leaders, which offer few details about what transpires during those conversations. This has allowed foreign governments, whether through official releases or state-run media, to frame the discussion for the public. The U.S. government may not even be in a position to best frame the Putin-Trump conversation, since only a Russian translator was present. “Unfortunately, the only people who know the content of the meeting is the Kremlin,” Bremmer said. “Trump isn’t going to a have a good readout of the meeting, and this is the most disturbing.”"
52,POLITICS,"Trump Jr.'s Meeting Was Wrong, Americans Say, But Fewer See It As Out Of The Norm",Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americans-think-trump-jrs-meeting-was-wrong-but-fewer-are-sure-its-out-of-the-norm_us_596fc425e4b062ea5f8eecb6,If you can't drain the swamp ... join it?,2017-07-19,"Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump welcomes his son, Donald Trump Jr., to the stage at one of the New England Council's ""Politics and Eggs"" breakfasts in Manchester, N.H., in November 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596fc4792100003400fc7c32.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump has defended his eldest son’s decision to meet with a Kremlin-linked lawyer last year in hopes of obtaining damaging information about Hillary Clinton by saying it was nothing out of the ordinary.“Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent,” Trump tweeted on Monday. “That’s politics!”Prominent GOP campaign veterans have been quick to dismiss that argument.“I’ve been involved in 9 presidential campaigns ... never happened, never would happen for all kinds of reasons,” Republican consultant John Weaver told HuffPost earlier this month.But with Americans’ trust in their political leaders continuing to slump to historic lows, Trump’s argument rings true to a significant share of the public, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds. To be sure, 52 percent of those polled view it as inappropriate for a U.S. politician to get damaging information on an opponent from people linked to a foreign government, with 25 percent saying it would be okay.But by a small margin, more agree than disagree with the point Trump’s been making ― 41 percent say it’s likely most politicians would agree to such a meeting, while 36 percent say most would not.Trump wasn’t explicitly mentioned in the question. But the significant political divide among the respondents ― Trump voters were more than 10 times likelier than Clinton voters to consider such a meeting appropriate ― suggests that people were picking up on the not-so-subtle context for the survey. (An earlier survey that did use Trump’s name garnered largely similar results.)Accordingly, Trump voters are much more likely to accept his claim that Donald Trump Jr.’s decision to take the meeting was par for the course ― 86 percent of the president’s backers say they believe most politicians would have done the same, while just 10 percent of Clinton voters agree.That divide persists even when the survey respondents are asked about politicians from a specific party. Most Clinton voters say they believe that both Republican and Democratic politicians would decline such a meeting (although a greater number say a Democrat would do so). Trump voters overwhelmingly say they think most Democratic politicians would attend ― even more so than Republicans. Among the remainder of those polled ― Americans who didn’t vote or who chose a third-party candidate in 2016 ― 51 percent say that a meeting of the kind Trump Jr. participated in is inappropriate, with 22 percent saying it isn’t. But they’re about evenly split on whether most politicians would do so anyway, with 34 percent saying they would and 32 percent that they would not. This group is about equally likely to think Democrats and Republicans would attend.Trump’s claim that most politicians would have behaved similarly to his son may help to normalize his administration’s behavior in his supporters’ eyes, and to play into the existing mistrust of the government among many Americans. But Trump’s stance may not be the greatest argument for a president who spent much of his campaign promising to “drain the swamp” in Washington. Just a quarter of Americans view Trump as more honest and trustworthy than the average U.S. politician, with 45 percent saying he’s less honest and trustworthy and 19 percent considering him about the norm.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted July 18 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

And ― as the film dramatically shows ― the battle culminated in Paris, just weeks after the terrible attacks at the Bataclan Theatre left more than 100 dead.The Paris Accord was ratified, and the world was finally aligned to fight climate change.Then Trump happened.“When President Trump made his speech withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris agreement I was worried that other countries would follow his lead” said Gore to a packed screening audience organized by The Producers Guild in New York. “But instead, the entire rest of the world doubled down on their commitments. Now it looks like the U.S. will meet its commitments regardless of what Donald Trump tweets.”And will the U.S. really act on Trump’s promise to leave Paris, Gore says there are details worth considering on this. Important details. “Withdrawing from the Paris agreement. This is not entirely a coincidence” said Gore. “There is a three-year waiting period and then there is a multi-month notification period the first date on which the U.S. could legally act in the Paris agreement happens to be the day after the next presidential election.”Ttruth is inconvenient for themselves and so they want to smother the truth and a whole ton of lies and falsehoods.” said Gore.“There’s a there’s a saying Tennessee where I live, an old saying, that you see a turtle on top of a fence post you could be pretty sure it didn’t get there by itself.

Kristol had encouraged former GOP nominee Mitt Romney to think about a last-ditch bid and had similar talks with Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.). By late May, with few viable options left, Kristol had a private dinner in Washington, D.C., with a National Review writer named David French. Up until that point, French hadn’t remotely thought about being a presidential candidate, though he shared Kristol’s views on Trump. The subject of French mounting a bid never actually came up during the course of the meal. It was only after French left that Kristol and another dinner companion began discussing how French, an Iraq War veteran and lawyer, had an appealing resume.The next morning, Kristol, without warning, floated French’s name as a possible Trump foil in a Weekly Standard piece. “I happen to know David French,” he wrote in the piece, which later appeared in the June 6 issue of the magazine. “To say that he would be a better and a more responsible president than Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is to state a truth that would become self-evident as more Americans got to know him.”In the latest episode of our “Candidate Confessional” podcast, French recalls being “absolutely stunned” by the piece. Later in the day, he and Kristol jumped on the phone to discuss the idea. “He said, ‘I’m completely serious about this,’” French remembers.French agreed to give it some serious thought. But before he could come to a decision, Kristol once again upped the pressure. “Just a heads up over this holiday weekend,” he tweeted on May 29, ”There will be an independent candidate ― an impressive one, with a strong team and a real chance.”It wasn’t too much of a mystery who Kristol’s mystery candidate was. But French was left alone to deal with the fallout. Right after sending the tweet, Kristol jumped on a plane to Israel.“It certainly accelerated and put the process on steroids. There is no doubt about it,” French recalls. “I like Bill a great deal. I respect Bill a great deal. I’m not upset about this. Let me say this: In hindsight it had a beneficial effect and that beneficial effect was to immediately impress upon [me] the gravity of the decision.”What French soon discovered was that you don’t need to be a formal presidential candidate to be scrutinized as one. The reaction was quick and not kind. New York Magazine described Kristol as “desperate.” A writer for Slate asked: “Wait. Who? You know, conservative magazine staff writer, David French. Tennessee lawyer David French? Still nothing? Well, fear not, you’re not alone.”By that point, French still hadn’t ruled out running. In fact, he began making calls to prospective campaign managers, looking at his fundraising potential and even mapping out ballot access laws and electoral strategy. But fairly quickly, the narrative surrounding his potential bid was getting well beyond his control, and he did the one thing politicians shouldn’t do: He began reading his coverage online. “Don’t do what I did, which was unplug for 90 percent of the day and then right when the day is winding down and you should be getting much-needed rest, then opening your Twitter app and then starting to go down that rabbit hole at midnight and start reading everything that’s been said, which if you’re a human being ― if you’re a normal human being even somebody with a relatively thick skin ― that is opening Pandora’s box,” French explains. “You are getting alternatively mad, thankful, grateful as you see what people are saying, exasperated, frustrated. That just destroys any rest you’re going to have.”Listen to the full episode above.“Candidate Confessional” is produced by Zach Young. To listen to this podcast later, download it on Apple Podcasts.

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/al-gore-single-payer_us_596eb69ae4b00db3d0f3ec88,The former vice president blamed the “morass” surrounding Obamacare passage in 2009 for tanking a cap-and-trade bill that would have curbed pollution.,2017-07-19,Former Vice President Al Gore speaks at a TimesTalks event in Tribeca in New York on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596eb8af1500002000bfe485.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Al Gore called for single-payer health care on Tuesday, one day after a revolt by GOP senators dashed Republican hopes of passing a bill to repeal Obamacare.Speaking at an event to promote his new climate change documentary, the former vice president said health insurance companies have failed to offer cost-effective coverage, even under the Affordable Care Act. A government-run, single-payer system would provide taxpayer-funded basic health care coverage for everyone.“The private sector has not shown any ability to provide good, affordable health care for all,” Gore told a packed auditorium at Borough of Manhattan Community College. “I believe we ought to have single-payer health care.” The statement makes the 2000 presidential nominee one of the first high-profile Democrats to advocate the so-called Medicare-for-all option since Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) failed yet again this week to rally at least 50 of 52 Republican senators to pass a bill to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. Lacking the votes to flat-out repeal the law without a replacement, President Donald Trump vowed to stand by and allow Obamacare to collapse without the support needed from his agencies. Gore blamed what he called the “morass” surrounding the passage of Obamacare in 2009 for tanking a cap-and-trade bill at the time in the Senate. The legislation would have established a limit on planet-warming carbon emissions and a system in which big companies could trade permits to pollute. “In 2009, President Obama passed it in the House and he succeeded, but it was different when it came to the Senate,” Gore said at the 90-minute talk hosted by The New York Times to publicize his new movie, “An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power.” “I think we could have passed it in the Senate in 2009, and we could have gone to the climate negotiation in Copenhagen with a stronger hand, but that’s water under the dam.”Gore did not include a universal government health care option in his platform during his unsuccessful bid for the White House in 2000. But, in 2002, indicated he “favored” such a policy. “I think we’ve reached a point where the entire health care system is in impending crisis,” Gore said at an ABC News panel at the time. “I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we should begin drafting a single-payer national health insurance plan.”Progressives, backed by strong grassroots support from the party’s base, moved swiftly to embrace single-payer proposals as the long-anticipated Republican assault on Obamacare began this year. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) launched a “Medicare for all” push in March. In June, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called it “the next step” for Democrats. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) endorsed the policy last month, declaring, “we should have Medicare for all.”Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), widely considered a contender for the 2020 presidential race, said earlier this month that “as a concept, I’m completely in support of single pay,” but insisted, “we’ve got to work out the details, and the details matter on that.” Others on the establishment wing of the party have been more reluctant. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) ducked questions about universal government care, saying only that he was “looking at” Sanders’ bill, which hasn’t yet been publicly released. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has refused to sign on to Ellison’s bill, and flatly said “no” when asked in May if single-payer health care should be part of the party’s 2018 platform.

Larissa Waters ― who made history this year as the first person to breastfeed a baby in Australia’s Parliament ― stepped down from her post with what she called “great shock and sadness” on Tuesday, after discovering that she is still a Canadian citizen. She made a public, tearful apology later in the day and vowed to renounce her Canadian citizenship.“I was born in Canada and I left at 11 months [of age]. My parents are Australian. I’ve never been back [to Canada],” Waters explained. “I thought I was naturalized as an Australian, but it seems that the law was changed a week after I was born, and in fact, I should have actively renounced Canadian citizenship.”It appears Waters may have been alerted to the law because days earlier, fellow Greens party member and co-deputy leader Sen. Scott Ludlam resigned after learning that he remains a citizen of New Zealand, where he was born and lived until he was 3 years old.“Recently it was brought to my attention that I hold dual citizenship of Australia and New Zealand ... I apologize unreservedly for this mistake,” he said in a statement, noting that the news has left him “devastated.”Greens leader Richard Di Natale reacted by saying Parliament and Australia “are worse off as a result,” and has committed his party to an “urgent root-and-branch” review.The former senators’ abrupt political departures have turned attention to more than 20 other parliamentarians who could be affected by Section 44 of the Australian Constitution, which applies to any person “who is under any acknowledgment of allegiance obedience or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power.”Pundits worry the dated legislation will continue to pose issues down the road, as the country and its parliament become increasingly diverse. Over 28 percent of Australians were born overseas ― the highest proportion in over a century ― according to the country’s latest census figures.Australia’s Parliamentary Library has a public online catalogue listing all senators and members of Parliament by their place of birth. As HuffPost Australia’s Josh Butler reports, this list featuring 24 foreign-born parliamentarians ― including Ludlam and Waters ― was last updated in March, and is not currently up to date.The recent resignations have prompted many of the listed politicians to swiftly assure constituents and critics that they are legally qualified to serve in Parliament.Sam Dastyari, an Iranian-born senator, responded to backlash on Facebook and Twitter by explaining he had already worked to meet the constitutional requirements to hold his position, in what he described as a “difficult, expensive, lengthy and precarious” process costing $25,000 in legal fees.When asked if he still held Iranian citizenship, he reportedly replied: “I’m not that friggin’ stupid.”And in an effort to support his proclaimed lack of Indian citizenship, Sen. Malcolm Roberts made the bizarre statement on Twitter that he has never owned a 7-Eleven store, accompanied by the hashtag #NotIndian.Several others have come out on social media in defense of their sole Australian citizenship:"

South Korean authorities are investigating why she might have returned to North Korea.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596e48361500006303bfe318.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A recent propaganda video out of Pyongyang has South Korean authorities investigating whether a North Korean defector was kidnapped and taken back across the border.Lim Ji-hyun, 26, who defected from North Korea in 2014, fled to South Korea and eventually appeared in several TV shows there, gaining a following in the country. On South Korean television, she sometimes told audiences about life under North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and once visited a talk show in a North Korean military uniform, laughing with hosts about her experiences.But on Sunday, a woman resembling Lim and identifying herself as Jeon Hye-sung (the name Lim used when she was in North Korea) appeared in a propaganda video posted on the North Korean state-run website Uriminzokkiri. In it, she denounces South Korea and claims she has returned to the “bosom of the fatherland.”South Korean authorities believe Lim is indeed no longer in South Korea, and are currently investigating the circumstances that might have taken her back to North Korea.The woman in the nearly half-hour video sits with former defector Kim Man-bok and an interviewer to discuss life in South Korea, which she describes as “hell.” She also says she was forced to slander Pyongyang during her time there.She adds that she was lured to South Korea by the “fantasy” that she “could eat well and make a lot of money,” but became lonely and missed her family. She also criticizes South Korea’s capitalist society and speaks of her struggle to find work there. She says she is now living with her parents in her hometown, Anju.It is still unclear whether Lim’s apparent return to North Korea was forced or voluntary. Twenty-five defectors have returned to the country since 2012.But most people who make it out of the authoritarian country do not return, despite facing a difficult path in adjusting to life outside of Kim’s totalitarian regime. Around 30,000 North Korean defectors are currently estimated to live in South Korea.Lim’s story is unusual not only because defectors rarely return, but because nothing about her life in South Korea seemed publicly amiss. It’s unclear when she went missing or whether anyone alerted authorities about her disappearance before the video’s release.South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo reported that Lim had thanked her fans in April and called her birthday “possibly the happiest birthday of my life.”There was even an online fan club dedicated to Lim, which has now been shut down following her apparent return to North Korea."

And she only needs to sway the federal judge overseeing a landmark lawsuit brought by herself and 20 other young Americans to force the U.S. government to slash planet-warming emissions.Former NASA scientist James Hansen, Kivlehan’s granddad as well as the “grandfather of global warming,” published a paper on Tuesday arguing that preventing catastrophic climate change requires far more drastic policy shifts than any government has taken so far.“There’s a narrative out there that because of the Paris accord and because solar panels are becoming cheap, we’ve turned the corner on dealing with the climate problem,” Hansen said on a call with reporters. “In fact, what we show … is that the growth rate of these greenhouse gases is actually accelerating in the last several years, so not only do they continue to grow, they grow faster and faster.”The research compared the currently projected warming of more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius, by the end of the century to the only slightly lower global temperatures during the Eemian, an interglacial period that ran from 130,000 to 115,000 years ago. During that time, sea levels surged six to nine meters, or 19 to 30 feet.At those levels, modern coastal cities would easily be submerged.To avoid such massive coastal flooding, Hansen argues that the current temperature rise needs to be capped at 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 degree Celsius, through aggressive steps such as mass reforestation, widespread use of carbon sequestration technology and radical curtailing of fossil fuel production.The study gives weight to the lawsuit by 21 kids and young adults who accuse the federal government of violating their constitutional rights to life, liberty and property by promoting fossil fuel production and failing to implement efforts to curb climate change. The suit was filed in 2015 with the help of the Oregon-based nonprofit Our Children’s Trust.Although it originally targeted the Obama administration, the case is now proceeding against President Donald Trump, whose administration has moved to roll back environmental regulations and bolster oil, gas and coal production.“We will leave young people in the intractable situation in which climate change is occurring out of their control and costs of trying to maintain a livable planet may become too high to bear,” Hansen said.Hansen, who is also a plaintiff in the suit, has a long history of raising the alarm about global warming. He has become a sort of bogeyman among conservative skeptics who dismiss his warnings as “alarmist.”But his latest report, which he produced with a team of 14 co-authors whose expertise ranges from paleoclimatology to carbon cycles, was tested by three different peer reviewers before being published by the European Geosciences Union.“The paper should be judged on its scientific merits,” Hansen said. “This is hard science, and it’s been very severely put through the wringer to make sure everything is well justified and clear.”Its conclusions are also not controversial. The United Nations-brokered Paris Agreement, which was signed by every country but Syria and Nicaragua, urges an ultimate goal of reducing emissions enough to halt warming at an increase of 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The official 3.6 degree target was adopted in the spirit of pragmatic compromise. (Trump announced plans to pull the U.S. out of the pact in June, but cannot legally initiate the process for another two years.)Still, Hansen’s study isn’t aimed at convincing the hard-core doubters who embrace the industry-backed pseudoscience often pushed on right-wing news sites like Breitbart. The paper “is intended to make the human impact on the climate clear to the educated lay person, including judges in court,” Hansen said.“In particular, our case focuses on putting the best available science in the courtroom to show how our youngest generation and future generations will be burdened by the continued high fossil fuel emissions,” the plaintiffs’ co-lead counsel Phillip Gregory said on the call."

64,POLITICS,"As Trumpcare Falters, President Still Hazy On What His Plan Should Do",S.V. Date and Kaeli Subberwal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tremendous-healthcare_us_596e807ce4b00db3d0f3d1d3,The president does not seem to understand the health care system he says he wants to overhaul.,2017-07-18,President Donald Trump speaks about the Senate health care bill during a lunch with members of the US military in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Tuesday. Trump railed against dissenters in his party who dashed his months-long effort to dismantle former President Barack Obama's landmark health care law.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596e82801500002000bfe3fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has promised a “tremendous” health care plan, one that would cost Americans “a tiny fraction” of what they’re paying now, and would also be “beautiful.”What does any of that mean?As the Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act lies in critical condition in the Senate, what precisely the president would do to revive it and the details of what the ideal Trump health care plan would look like remain as hazy as ever.Trump, who has astounded even Republican members of Congress by his lack of knowledge on the issue, on Tuesday again spoke about the matter in only general terms. “It’s a great plan for a lot of people,” he told reporters during a White House photo opportunity. “And eventually we’re going to get something done, and it’s going to be very good.”Trump’s staff claims he has been constantly engaged in the health care legislative process, with numerous phone call and meetings with GOP senators to round up support ― including a White House dinner with some of those lawmakers Monday night. His aides also dispute that Trump does not understand the details of what he calls one of his top priorities.“I think the president has shown he has extensive knowledge. He’s laid out the priorities that are important for him to be included in the legislation,” deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday.Sanders’ assessment seems dubious at best. During the GOP primaries and the general election campaign, as other candidates laid out detailed proposals to replace or improve Obamacare, Trump stuck to generic assertions that the existing system was terrible and that he, because of his business acumen and great intellect, was the only one equipped to fix it.“You’re going to have such great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost, and it’s going to be so easy,” he predicted last October.During a February 2016 GOP presidential primary debate in Houston, Trump was mocked by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for relying on the removal of “the lines around the states” in the sale of health insurance as the sole policy detail he could come up with, when pressed for particulars.“What is your plan? I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means. This is not a game where you draw maps,” Rubio said.After taking office Trump did, in a moment of candor, concede that the issue was perhaps more complex than he had imagined. “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated,” he said during a February meeting with governors at the White House.The boasts about his subject mastery, though, quickly resumed. “In a short period of time I understood everything there was to know about health care,” he said in a May interview with Time magazine.But even Monday night, as two GOP senators released a joint statement announcing their opposition to the Senate health care bill, effectively killing it, Trump reportedly was again asking his dining companions about removing the “lines around the states.”Whether Trump’s lack of knowledge about the issue matters is unclear.The Republican Party’s devotion to repealing the Affordable Care Act predates Trump’s interest in that goal by several years. And while Trump did call President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement “virtually useless” and “a disaster” in his 2015 candidate announcement speech, he devoted far more time to attacking undocumented immigrants and vowing to build a southern border wall.“Presidential leadership certainly makes a difference,” said Avik Roy, a conservative health care policy analyst who worked for Rubio’s primary campaign. He pointed to President Lyndon Johnson’s wrangling support from various disparate factions to pass Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s.Roy said Trump’s lack of familiarity with the complexities of the health cr e debate wasn’t necessarily a drawback, but that his failure to give Congress some basic guidelines has created problems. If Trump truly believes that every American should be covered, Roy said, then he should have made that clear to House and Senate Republicans.“He could have easily played a greater role, if he wanted to. And he still can,” Roy said. But he then allowed that at some point Trump’s approach would be problematic. “When negotiations are thorny, it’s good to have command have of details,” he said."

All the country can do now is look to the heavens and ask: “How did this happen?”But until a celestial being gives someone ― anyone ― an answer, you might as well read on.Back in June, Noah and “The Daily Show” debuted The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library. The very real pop-up institution dedicated to Trump’s Twitter feed documented the president’s past messages on the social medium. It was actually an impressive feat for that team and definitely a funny one.The physical library didn’t last very long, but the show has a virtual version you can still tour. As part of that exhibit, “The Daily Show” had a video series called “Verified Survivor.” These videos showcased famous figures ― such as Stephen King and Mark Cuban ― talking about what it was like to be attacked by the president on Twitter.Then, earlier this month, Colbert and “The Late Show” unveiled a concept called “The Trump Attacked Me on Twitter” Hall of Fame. Although not a physical space, Colbert immediately inducted various public figures, including Mika Brzezinski, Joe Scarborough and John Oliver, in videos that went viral.Now, not to be outdone, “The Daily Show” has finally published the “Verified Survivor” videos on YouTube for a more wide audience. You can watch them on the show’s YouTube channel.“I am, ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, a Trump-less American,” says King of the fact Trump blocked him on Twitter in his “Verified Survivor” video. It remains to be seen whether Colbert and “The Late Show” will try to outdo this latest Trump mockery. His team was recently nominated for an Outstanding Variety Talk Series Emmy award, while Noah’s team was not ― perhaps Colbert now has less to prove.But with the actually incredible Twitter library and this new publication of the series coming from the opposition ― not to mention Noah calling Trump a penis-shaped deadly asteroid last week ― the onus should be on “The Late Show” to go one step further. If one of these programs lands a good enough Trump joke, that means he’s no longer president, right?UPDATE: This article has been updated to reflect that the “Verified Survivor” series was originally a part of “The Daily Show” Twitter library. It was the publication of the videos on YouTube that was new."

The U.S. citizen, who was implicated in a money laundering scheme in 2000, is a senior vice president at Russian real estate developer Aras Agalarov’s company.Agalarov’s son, Emin, is a singer represented by Rob Goldstone, the music publicist who arranged the meeting via emails with Donald Trump Jr. After The New York Times uncovered the meeting, Trump Jr. tweeted images of the emails last week, which he said was an effort to be “totally transparent.” The emails mention those involved with the meeting as: Goldstone, Trump Jr., Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. But in the days since, three more people who attended the meeting have been revealed: a lobbyist working with Veselnitskaya, an independent translator hired by Veselnitskaya, and now, Kaveladze.An attorney for the Agalarovs, Scott Balber, confirmed to both CNN and The Washington Post that Kaveladze attended the Trump Tower meeting as the family’s representative, adding he is a U.S. citizen and has “never had any engagement with the Russian government in any capacity.” Balber told the Post that he believes there were no other attendees of the meeting.Aras Agalarov had tried to develop a project in Moscow with Trump, and he and Goldstone helped convince Trump to hold the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, which Trump then owned, in Russia.Balber said Tuesday that he received a phone call from the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, one of several probes looking into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russian officials. This signals Mueller’s probe is actively looking into Trump Jr.’s meeting, which is the clearest indication yet that Trump’s campaign may have colluded with the country.According to a public records search, Kaveladze, whose full name is Irakly Kaveladze, was born in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia in 1965, immigrated to the U.S. in 1991 and now lives in California. Kaveladze has worked for Crocus Group, the Agalarovs’ company, since 2004. According to his several personal websites, his duties have included negotiating with Chinese and other international contractors, the construction of the Far Eastern Federal University in Russia, and developing “a chain of Russian do-it-yourself home improvement superstores known as Tvoy Dom,” which he described as “similar to Home Depot or Lowe’s” in the U.S.In 2000, he was implicated in a money laundering scheme, in which he “set up more than 2,000 corporations in Delaware for Russian brokers and then opened the bank accounts for them, without knowing who owned the corporations,” The New York Times reported at the time. In total, more than $1.4 billion was transferred through the accounts that he opened. “What I see here is another Russian witch hunt in the United States,” he said in response to a congressional investigation that uncovered his scheme.Read more on Trump Jr.’s meeting and its attendees here.This story has been updated throughout with more background on the meeting and on Kaveladze."

According to The Trace, Washington will be the first state to enact a law that requires law enforcement to alert victims when their abusers attempt to buy a gun. The bill was signed by Washington Governor Jay Inslee in May and will take effect on July 23. In the U.S. it’s currently illegal for anyone who’s been convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence or is under a protective order for domestic abuse to purchase or possess a firearm. Washington’s new legislation will create a grant program that would help authorities conduct investigations into failed attempts to purchase firearms or when someone tries to buy a gun but fails the background check. These failed attempts are also known as “lie and try” attempts. The new law only applies to victims whose abusers were convicted in court or have obtained a court-ordered restraining order. The victim’s order will be registered to a “computer-based criminal intelligence information system available in Washington, used by law enforcement agencies to list outstanding warrants,” according to the billThe legislation requires gun dealers and store owners to alert the Washington Association of Sheriffs And Police Chiefs (WASPC) within five days of a “lie and try” attempt. WASPC must then notify the Washington State Patrol (WSP) and that sector is required to incorporate the failed attempt to buy a gun into the state’s electronic database, which state law enforcement agencies can access.The grant program will fund a statewide notification system that will alert any registered person when an abuser attempts to buy a firearm but fails the background check. The bill states that the notification system must allow a person to register using a toll-free phone number or a public website. Drew Hansen (D-Wash.), a lawmaker who was the driving force of the bill, explained to the Associated Press why this legislation is so revolutionary. “Never before in this state has there been a requirement that when some knucklehead goes to try to buy a firearm and knows he shouldn’t have a firearm, that there’s some followup on that,” Hansen said. “We want there to be follow up on that. We want there to be criminal consequences if you knowingly illegally try to purchase a firearm.” According to a report from local news outlets KING 5 TV and Northwest News Network, there were over 3,000 “like and try” attempts in January and December 2016 in Washington alone. None of those attempts were ever investigated further. Linda Seabrook, the General Counsel and Director of Legal Programs at Futures Without Violence, told HuffPost that this legislation can be life-changing for survivors. “State and federal gun laws that prohibit an abuser’s legal access to firearms, when enforced, are often enforced without the victim’s input, and sometimes, without her knowledge or participation,” Seabrook said. “Safety responses work better when victims are able to be part of the process, are informed, and are provided with some control.” Seabrook pointed out that victims are five times more likely to end up dead, if their abuser has access to a gun. “The best person to assess an abuser’s future dangerousness, as well as the lethality of the situation, is the victim,” she said. “Knowledge is power and information is critical for her ability to assess her situation, and seek out assistance from a victim services professional to develop a plan for the safety and well-being of herself and her family.”"
70,HEALTHY LIVING,“To The Bone” Didn’t Teach Me Glamour. It Taught Me Respect.,"Mycah Hazel, Contributorblogger, equal opportunity enthusiast",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/to-the-bone-didnt-teach-me-glamour-it-taught-me_us_596d50afe4b05561da5a5a0c,"Oftentimes, films or TV shows about eating disorders try to convince victims to stop by showing them their sickly thin appearance",2017-07-18,<p>Actress Lily Collins and Director Marti Noxon </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596d54a12100001b00fc75a7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before Netflix’s “To The Bone” even came out, the internet was flooded with articles, many by people who had experienced eating disorders and argued that it would just be another film that “glamourizes” them. So, after taking in the outrage, I did what any logical person would do: I watched “To The Bone.”I can’t say criticism of the trailer had no impact on my viewing experience. Even while watching the lead character Ellen (Lily Collins), I was still thinking about the traumatic experiences bravely shared by people online. I ended up thinking that there had to be some huge mental break down or chilling scene in the movie for it to be an accurate portrayal. However, by the end of the film, my focus wasn’t on how uncomfortable the film made me feel. My focus was on the respect that I had gained for the people involved in it.Glamourizing something means making a situation or condition seem “excitingly attractive”– even if the situation is dangerous. When people complained that the “To The Bone” trailer glamourized eating disorders, they were expressing fear that the film would make having an eating disorder seem appealing or less harmful than it is, whether by making the recovery process seem fun or equating having an eating disorder to some cool phase in adolescence. After viewing the film, I saw no reason for myself or anyone else to find Ellen’s situation attractive. If anything, the film portrayed a truth about anorexia that I haven’t seen reiterated in a long time: eating disorders aren’t just about the danger of looking too skinny - they’re about the danger of dying. Oftentimes, films or TV shows about eating disorders try to convince victims to stop by showing them their sickly thin appearance. These films promote that the way to encourage victims is to tell them that they’ve only made themselves uglier – a tactic that seems pretty counterproductive considering many eating disorder victims and survivors, including Collins, were driven to the disorder by self-esteem issues. “To The Bone” emphasizes that eating disorders don’t just rob people of their looks. You’ll lose your life, and the experiences, feelings, and emotions that come with it. The reminders and references to death in the film tell the audience that eating disorders don’t just lead to an exposed ribcage. The real risk is death. Instead of focusing on whether or not “To The Bone” attempts to glamourize eating disorders, viewers should be focusing on the effort put in by Lily Collins and the film’s writer/director, Marti Noxon. This film doesn’t show any intention by the actress and director to spruce up the topic of anorexia. Instead, it shows an actress and director’s will to return to a mindset that caused them years of pain in order to prevent other people from enduring it too. Collins actually brought two parts of herself into the film. On the one hand, she delved into her past as a teenager who suffered from bulimia and anorexia. On the other hand, through her character, Collins delves into the distant relationship she had with her father. In recent interviews for her book, Unfiltered, Collins opens up about previously feeling distant from her father, who was often touring throughout her childhood, and the difficulty of enduring two parental divorces, one between her father and her mother in 1996, and another between her father and stepmother in 2008. The film tackles two big issues, anorexia and divorce, pretty well, and shows that eating disorders can also stem from parental issues. Before we label movies as too glamorous, we need to recognize that even if these films are covering serious subjects like eating orders, they’re still films, after all. In a documentary about a girl’s experience with bulimia, a romantic plot line would be unnecessary. In a film, a little romance can help move the plot forward and develop the character. There’s also an inherent beauty in film that shouldn’t be mistaken for glamourizing. Creating enticing visuals, even when covering topics that are far from, is nothing new. That’s what most directors strive to do. This isn’t to censor things or make them seem less difficult than they actually are. Directors create these stunning visuals so that the viewer can connect with them visually and then emotionally. In an era where more movies are trying to tackle difficult situations experienced by large groups, it’s hard to hit the nail on the head. There can be so many variations of one experience. The experiences Collins and Noxon had with eating disorders may seem lighter than experiences others have gone through, or too cinematic for some to watch, but that doesn’t make their stories any less real. Instead of being quick to call someone’s experience too glamourized or censored, we need to understand that these experiences, and the work put in to portray them, are still legitimate, and deserve respect. If you’re struggling with an eating disorder, call the National Eating Disorder Association hotline at 1-800-931-2237."

They are all senators. They are all Republicans. They are all women. And they all near-immediately opposed Mitch McConnell’s plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act with a delayed replacement. After the GOP Senate health care bill was effectively killed from within on Monday night ― Sens. Jerry Moran and Mike Lee from the conservative wing of the Republican Party dealt the bill its final blow ― McConnell, the Senate majority leader, announced he would move forward with legislation that would effectively repeal the Affordable Care Act without replacing it. The repeal of key parts of the ACA would be delayed until two years after the vote, which McConnell told reporters he wanted to hold in the “very near future.” (The same legislation was vetoed by former President Barack Obama in 2015.) By Tuesday afternoon, three Republican senators ― Collins, Capito and Murkowski ― became the first to announce that they would oppose a motion to proceed on a repeal of the ACA without a replacement. Capito released a statement Tuesday morning emphasizing that she “did not come to Washington to hurt people,” pointing to 173,000 people in her state of West Virginia who gained health coverage due to Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. “My position on this issue is driven by its impact on West Virginians,” she continued. “With that in mind, I cannot vote to repeal Obamacare without a replacement plan that addresses my concerns and the needs of West Virginians.”Soon after, Collins, who had publicly opposed the GOP Senate health care bill, and voted against the same repeal legislation in 2015, tweeted that she too would vote no on the motion to proceed. “I do not think that it’s constructive to repeal a law that is so interwoven within our health care system without having a replacement plan in place,” the Maine senator said, recommending that the Senate Health Committee hold hearings to look at ways to fix the ACA. Following Collins, Murkowski, a senator from Alaska, announced that she would not vote to proceed to repeal the ACA, encouraging the Senate to “take a step back and engage in a bipartisan process to address the failures of the ACA and stabilize the individual markets.” As many pointed out on Twitter, these three senators are all women. This is notable for two reasons: First, because research has shown that GOP women in Congress are actually the most likely to work across the aisle ― especially when it comes to legislation that impacts health, education and social welfare.Second, although the initial Senate working group on health care was made up of 13 men and no women ― after major criticism, Capito was invited to join a meeting ― three women ultimately decided the fate of the GOP’s push to overturn the ACA. Sometimes, irony is sweet. "

Although tuberculosis (TB) is preventable and curable, many people in the United States still suffer from this disease. Persons with TB disease can be found in every state; in rural areas and cities; in schools, workplaces, and many other places where people are in close contact. TB bacteria usually attack the lungs, but can also attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain. In 2015, for the first time in 23 years, the number of TB cases in the United States increased in 2015. The following year, 2016, TB incidence slightly decreased; however, epidemiological modeling shows that if similar slow rates of decline continue, the goal of US TB elimination will not be reached this century. This underscores the need for more comprehensive public health approaches in TB prevention and control. The only vaccine against TB in use today, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), is a live attenuated strain from a Mycobacterium bovis strain isolated from cattle, which is administered at birth in most countries. Despite its effectiveness in reducing the incidence of the disseminated forms of TB in children, it is inconsistent in preventing pulmonary TB, the most common form of the disease in adolescents and adults, and is responsible for the majority of TB transmission. Therefore new, life-saving vaccines are urgently needed.MTBVAC is the first and only live attenuated vaccine based on a human isolate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis designed and constructed by the research groups of Carlos Martin of the University of Zaragoza and of Brigitte Gicquel of Institut Pasteur in Paris, developed as BCG-replacement strategy in newborns that has entered first-in-human adult clinical trials. MTBVAC has been the first and only live attenuated M. tuberculosis vaccine approved to enter into clinical trials. A first-in-human clinical trial was recently conducted successfully in healthy adults in Lausanne (Switzerland).The promising results of the Phase I study was followed by a clinical phase 1b study, dose-escalation safety and immunogenicity study to compare MTBVAC to BCG in newborns with a safety arm in adults started in 2015 by South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI) in South Africa where TB is and is expected being finalized end 2017. A phase 2a study in neonates in South Africa is planned to begin in early 2018.In a recent study by Aguilo et al, the team at the University of Zaragoza provided the first evidence for this hypothesis through the discovery that two M. tuberculosis antigens of MTBVAC, ESAT-6 and CFP-10, which are both not present in BCG, are key contributors to the superior protection that is induced by MTBVAC in mice. Furthermore, through a collaboration with researchers at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland, the study describes that also in humans MTBVAC (but not BCG) triggers a specific immune response against ESAT6 and CFP10. The findings uncover a first mechanism of the improved protection of MTBVAC as compared to BCG, and it is important to further explore this response as a potential biomarker of protection for MTBVAC. According to Dr. Nacho Aguiló first author of the study, ""there are no specific antigens associated with the efficacy of a vaccine against tuberculosis and thus the need for protection biomarkers that can demonstrate the efficacy of a new vaccine is urgent because they will help achieve the goal of eliminating tuberculosis in the world by the year 2035”.

MTBVAC has been the first and only live attenuated M. tuberculosis vaccine approved to enter into clinical trials. A first-in-human clinical trial was recently conducted successfully in healthy adults in Lausanne (Switzerland).The promising results of the Phase I study was followed by a clinical phase 1b study, dose-escalation safety and immunogenicity study to compare MTBVAC to BCG in newborns with a safety arm in adults started in 2015 by South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI) in South Africa where TB is and is expected being finalized end 2017. A phase 2a study in neonates in South Africa is planned to begin in early 2018.In a recent study by Aguilo et al, the team at the University of Zaragoza provided the first evidence for this hypothesis through the discovery that two M. tuberculosis antigens of MTBVAC, ESAT-6 and CFP-10, which are both not present in BCG, are key contributors to the superior protection that is induced by MTBVAC in mice. Furthermore, through a collaboration with researchers at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland, the study describes that also in humans MTBVAC (but not BCG) triggers a specific immune response against ESAT6 and CFP10. The findings uncover a first mechanism of the improved protection of MTBVAC as compared to BCG, and it is important to further explore this response as a potential biomarker of protection for MTBVAC. According to Dr. Nacho Aguiló first author of the study, ""there are no specific antigens associated with the efficacy of a vaccine against tuberculosis and thus the need for protection biomarkers that can demonstrate the efficacy of a new vaccine is urgent because they will help achieve the goal of eliminating tuberculosis in the world by the year 2035”. Carlos Martin of the University of Zaragoza says “If MTBVAC successfully runs through all phases of clinical evaluation and is shown to be more effective; it could save millions of lives”. "

That second, private meeting took place after Trump’s formal sit-down with the Russian president, which lasted more than two hours.The White House then confirmed to NBC News and Reuters that the meeting had in fact taken place. According to Bremmer, the second meeting lasted an hour, and the only person present aside from Trump and Putin was a Russian interpreter. No American interpreter was present. As Time’s Zeke Miller points out, no White House officials were present at the dinner.In a statement later Tuesday to reporters, the White House disputed the characterization of the encounter as a “second meeting,” instead describing it as a “brief conversation at the end of a dinner,” during which first lady Melania Trump had been seated next to Putin. “President Trump spoke with many leaders during the course of the evening,” reads the statement. “As the dinner was concluding, President Trump went over to Mrs. Trump, where he spoke briefly with President Putin.” “The insinuation that the White House has tried to ‘hide’ a second meeting is false, malicious and absurd,” continues the statement. “It is not merely perfectly normal, it is part of a President’s duties, to interact with world leaders.” Nevertheless, the circumstances of the meeting as well as the initial decision by White House officials not to disclose it have again drawn scrutiny to Trump’s relationship with Moscow. “You have an hour that evening that no one’s even heard of,” said Bremmer in an interviewing airing on Bloomberg and PBS. “We clearly know that Trump does not care what the media has to say about his desire to have a close, personal relationship with the Russian president, and what drives it.”He continued: “Never in my life as a political scientist have I seen two countries, major countries, with a constellation of national interests that are as dissonant, while the two leaders seem to be doing everything possible to make nice and be close to each other.”Watch the full interview here.There is no official government record of the meeting. Ben Rhodes, a former national security adviser for former President Barack Obama, said that the previous administration had a policy of disclosing such interactions. It’s also unusual for an American president to speak with a non-English-speaking foreign leader without the aid of a White House interpreter. (Putin reportedly understands most English.) Interpreter for both leaders, along with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, attended the earlier meeting. Even in that encounter, there was some dispute over what the two leaders actually said to one another.A White House official told the Washington Post that Trump did not have his own interpreter during the post-dinner talk with the Russian leader because he only brought a Japanese-English interpreter to the dinner to help him communicate with his companion for the meal, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In a series of messages posted on Twitter on Tuesday night, President Trump slammed the accounts of his post-dinner talk with Putin. “Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is “sick,” the president tweeted. News of the second meeting comes amid multiple investigations into whether the president’s associates actively colluded with Russian officials to sway the outcome of the 2016 election in Trump’s favor. Most recently, the Trump administration was rocked by the revelation that the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., met last summer with a Kremlin-linked attorney who had promised to provide damaging information about campaign opponent Hillary Clinton. The president’s son in-law, Jared Kushner, and his then-campaign-manager, Paul Manafort, also attended the meeting. The president has denied having prior knowledge of that meeting.In recent months, other disclosures about meetings between Trump associates and Russian officials have emerged. In May, the Justice Department said Attorney General Jeff Sessions had twice met with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., during the 2016 election and did not disclose those meetings during his confirmation hearings. In May, it was reported that Kushner had also had several previously undisclosed conversations with Kislyak, during which Kushner allegedly floated the idea of creating a secret communication backchannel for Trump’s transition team to use to communicate with the Russian government. And in February, Michael Flynn was ousted as national security adviser after it was revealed he had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Kislyak prior to Trump’s administration and later lied about the nature of their conversation. This was a breaking story and has been updated throughout."
