Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/france-policeman-posthumous-wedding_us_593018eee4b09ec37c32168e,The posthumous wedding is believed to be a first for France and the world.,2017-06-01,Etienne Cardiles (left) spoke at an April memorial for Xavier Jugelé.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593019212300003b003482e9.jpeg?cache=diY5dyNqzn&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A gay police officer killed by a gunman in Paris was married in a posthumous wedding that’s believed to be a historic first. Xavier Jugelé, 37, was shot dead April 20 on the Champs-Élysées three days before the French presidential election. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack, which left two other officers wounded. The gunman, identified as Karim Cheurfi, was shot dead by security forces.Though details of Wednesday’s nuptials are scarce, Etienne Cardiles married Jugelé in a ceremony attended by former French president François Hollande and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, The Guardian reports. It’s believed to be the first posthumous same-sex wedding to take place in France (where marriage equality has been the law of the land since 2013) and possibly the world, according to the BBC. The U.S. does not recognize posthumous matrimony under federal law, but its origins in France can be traced back to 1803. The practice became particularly popular during World War I, when it allowed women to wed slain soldiers, thus legitimizing any children conceived beforehand and entitling them to a pension. France’s current legislation allowing people to marry the dead dates back to 1959, when a woman named Irène Jodard requested permission from former French President Charles de Gaulle to wed her fiancé, André Capra, after he had drowned. Hundreds of people have since applied for post-mortem matrimony under the law, which requires applicants to send a formal request to the president, according to The New York Times. Cardiles made global headlines when he delivered an impassioned eulogy at an April 26 memorial service for Jugelé. His longtime partner had also been deployed during the Nov. 13 terror attacks in Paris. “As far as I’m concerned, I’m suffering without hate,” Cardiles said in the speech, which was transcribed by Time magazine. “This hate, Xavier, I don’t have it because it never existed in you... Because tolerance, dialogue and temperance were your best weapons. Because behind the policeman there was the man. Because you become a policeman by choice; the choice to help others and to fight against injustice.”An associate described Jugelé as having been “really committed” to queer causes. Mickaël Bucheron, who is the president of Flag, a French association for LGBTQ police officers, said Jugelé had been active with the group for several years. “He protested with us when there was the homosexual propaganda ban at the Sochi Olympic Games,” Bucheron told The New York Times. Here’s to hoping the union gives Cardiles some comfort following his tragic loss. Don’t miss the latest LGBTQ news! Subscribe to the Queer Voices newsletter. "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59305dad2000003c00bdfee1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The family of a black man who was unarmed when he was shot dead by police in Milwaukee in 2014 received a $2.3 million dollar settlement, the family’s attorneys said on Wednesday.Dontre Hamilton’s family settled the claims made in a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city and former Milwaukee Police Department officer Christopher Manney, who is white, the attorneys said in a joint statement.Milwaukee’s police department has faced criticism in the past over complaints about racial profiling and targeting, and last year the city experienced rioting and arson after a fatal police shooting.Manney was fired after shooting 31-year-old Hamilton, whose family said he was mentally ill, in a park in downtown Milwaukee in 2014. Manney was not criminally charged by county or federal prosecutors.Hamilton’s estate filed a lawsuit nearly two years after the incident, alleging his constitutional rights were violated by Milwaukee police and the department had a culture that facilitated misconduct.Lawyers for the family said in a joint statement that policymakers and courts recognized that Manney violated Hamilton’s constitutional rights “by conducting an illegal pat-down search, which started a chain of events that resulted in the tragic death.”The statement was released by the family’s law firms: Samster, Konkel & Safran; Alex Flynn & Associates; Law Offices of Jovan Blacknell and Law Offices of Ian Wallach.A spokeswoman for the city attorney’s office said that settlements are recommended in order to avoid the risk of litigation. She offered no further comment. The police department was not listed as a defendant in the case.Hamilton’s parents and brothers who filed the lawsuit will not benefit financially from the proceeds and the settlement will instead be placed in a fund Hamilton’s son will receive after he becomes an adult, the lawyers said.The 46-page complaint, filed in 2016, said two officers checked on Hamilton twice during the afternoon of his death as he was resting at a park and determined he was not doing anything wrong.Manney had been called to check on Hamilton earlier, but was unaware of the checks by the other officers and went to the park, the lawsuit said. When Manney arrived, he conducted a pat-down search of Hamilton without cause.The two began arguing and Manney then started striking Hamilton with his baton, the lawsuit said. Manney shot Hamilton 14 times after he grabbed the baton.Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn previously said Manney acted without malice, but failed to follow police policies when addressing mentally ill people.(Reporting by Gina Cherelus in New York)"
2,EDUCATION,"With Summer Break Comes The Danger Of Students ""Doing Nothing.""","Jennifer Sampson, ContributorPresident and Chief Executive Officer United Way of Metropolit...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/summer-is-here-and-so-is-the-importance-of-doing-nothing_us_59309871e4b00573ab57a1f4,"Preventing summer learning loss must be a priority, particularly for those teaching in low-income areas.",2017-06-01,Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings reads to children at the Once Upon a Month book launch at the J Erik Jonsson Library in Dallas,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5935982b2200003d00c6c526.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Children learn when they are doing “nothing” ― playing, exploring, dreaming and reading for fun instead of for school. But many kids ― especially lower income kids ― don’t have this opportunity. “Doing nothing,” for low income kids, is fundamentally different than the American ideal of “doing nothing” in the summer. Children from lower income families often spend summers in apartments buildings without playgrounds, with a variety of care arrangements and little access to play time and unfettered days. For them, a screen—television or tablet—is often the predominant source of summer time communication and entertainment. And sadly, they aren’t reading—often because they don’t have access to books—especially those they can relate to.The warm weeks can also be a time of “summer slide,” when kids forget a lot of what they learned in school. This is especially true for children who live in lower-income neighborhoods. Research shows that achievement gaps between low and higher income students widen significantly during the summer. Every summer, low-income youth lose two to three months in reading. These losses add up. By fifth grade, summer learning loss can leave low income students two and a half to three years behind their peers. Failure to ignite a joy in learning and reading in the summertime can further exacerbate the “opportunity gap” that contributes to widening gaps in achievement, employment and college and career success.So how do we prevent summer learning loss?School districts across the country send stacks of books and summer reading suggestions home with students in hopes of combating the summer brain drain. But a study by researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center showed that these summer reading programs can be made significantly more effective with only a small tweak: Let the kids choose the books. The study, conducted in kindergarten, first, and second-grade classrooms in the Rochester City School District, showed that students allowed to choose their own summer reading saw lower levels of literacy loss over the summer months.But, to be able to choose books, children must have books to read in the first place. Think back to your own childhood. Now think about the possibility it didn’t involve books. Outrageous, right? Outrageous but real. Two thirds of America’s children living in poverty have no books at home. There are many programs across the country created to eliminate one of the main reasons why children don’t read and parents don’t read to their children: lack of access to books. First Book, a group based in Washington, D.C., has given away more than 130 million books since its founding in 1992. Reading Is Fundamental is committed to a literate America where all children have the opportunity that literacy provides. And Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, developed in 1995 for her hometown in Sevier County, Tennessee, has been replicated in communities across the country and abroad to bring books into the homes of preschool children.And in my hometown of Dallas, Texas ― where the child poverty rate is 38 percent and thousands of local children don’t have the simple luxury of owning even one book ― United Way of Metropolitan Dallas, The Boone Family Foundation, and The Ferst Foundation for Childhood Literacy have partnered to launch Once Upon a Month in June, a program that provides one free book each month to young children in Dallas.Books represent some of the first opportunities children have to explore the world. And while there are lots of great reads with diverse main or supporting characters these books are usually far less diverse than the children reading them. Of children’s books published from 1994 to 2014, an average of 10 percent featured multicultural content, though that may be slowly increasing: The 2014 rate reached 14 percent. The campaign We Need Diverse Books was established in 2014 to advocate for more diverse representation in children’s literature. And in 2015, at age 11, Marley Dias started the Twitter hashtag #1000blackgirlbooks. Frustrated by the homogeneity of stories she read in school, Marley collected books featuring black girls to benefit underprivileged students. Education professor Rudine Sims Bishop uses the metaphor of windows, sliding glass doors and mirrors to illustrate why diverse literature is so important. Books can be windows into worlds previously unknown; they open like sliding glass doors to invite the reader inside. But books can also be mirrors. When they reflect our own experiences it tells readers their lives and experiences are valued. And when they do not, the message is just as clear.So while we continue to cherish the American summer ideal of the importance of doing “nothing,” we must also remember that doing “nothing” comes at a high cost—especially to low income students and the schools that serve them. And until we address the summer slide, our efforts to close the achievement gap will continue to fall short.Or we can rewrite children’s stories this summer by redefining “nothing” as a trip through the imagination while reading a good book."

Trump is fighting every day to make America horrible again. His administration is negatively reforming healthcare, wrongfully enforcing laws, and destroying families by mass deportation. Now the White House administration has chosen to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement for naïve reasons, leaving Americans embarrassed and feeling guilty. The President promises to keep jobs in America, but to what extent?It may be true that some Americans support the withdraw since they believe it will allow them to keep their manufacturing jobs in the short term, but it also negatively impacts those who want to keep our planet clean for future generations in longer terms. In other words, manufacturing jobs are temporary, but the well-being of our planet is essential to sustain life. Many celebrities and political leaders have expressed their concerns. The withdraw doesn’t only represent the White House administration, it also represents the GOP. Many Republicans fail to realize that Trump is a representation of the entire party, and so far, he’s driving them into a downward spiral. Trump has proven to other nations that the administration cares more about the American economy than the well-being of our planet and the species living in it - which is a huge problem. By withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, the current administration is nearly securing the win for Democrats and Independents in future elections.Although Trump admitted that he is willing to “immediately work with Democratic leaders” to “negotiate the U.S. back into Paris”, it’s highly unlikely we will see it in action since a number of European nations have already expressed renegotiation won’t be happening. While this puts the U.S. in a sticky situation, the next individual running for office will have to agree to the original terms of the Paris Climate Agreement - an unlikely doing for Republicans.It’s not clear how the withdraw will directly affect our planet, especially since many corporations have already reacted by stating they will continue to remain in the Paris Climate Agreement. Even French president Emmanuel Macron has confirmed the Paris Climate Agreement will “remain irreversible.”An unintentional yet essential outcome of the withdraw will be how Trump paved the way for the death of the Republican party and most of their antiquated ideologies. He is the unconsciously brave yet manipulative soldier to seal the end for a dangerous group of people who selfishly intend to benefit themselves. Republicans are simply enjoying the time they have left as a ruling political party while ruining the reputation of America - leaving the next leader to pick up the pieces. To say the least, millennials are pissed. Like a determined PR corporation, political parties and running individuals for future elections will use this move to gain popularity and secure votes. They will refer to June 1st, 2017 as the day Donald J. Trump told the world to drop dead. That alone will motivate millennials and anyone who remotely cares about our planet’s longevity to vote against Republican - specifically Trump. In the serenading words of the Democratic party: na na na na, hey hey hey, #GOODBYE. "

The United States now joins only two other nations, Syria and Nicaragua, in standing on the sidelines in the fight against climate change. While this decision may further tarnish the reputation of the United States on the world stage, it can’t stop the inevitable transition to the low carbon global economy of the future. As a CEO, I often to have to make decisions that meet the short term needs of my business without undermining our long term competitiveness. I’ve made capital investments in our St. Albans, Vermont ice cream factory that reduce energy use and thus the costs we pay to buy energy from the grid. Instead of making that investment in efficiency, I could have put more money to my bottom line in that particular quarter, but it would have cost me down the road and made me less competitive in the marketplace in the long term. Our withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is a bad short term decision that undermines both the long term health of our planet and the future competitiveness of the United States in the global economy. As our first real CEO President, I’d hoped Donald Trump would understand the importance of ensuring that short term decisions don't undermine our ability to be competitive in the future. Regardless of what President Trump says, as a CEO I know that climate change is the real job killer, not the Paris Climate Agreement.Despite this decision there is much good news. It is clear that the global economy is transitioning away from polluting fossil fuels to cleaner renewable sources. Solar energy is now the fastest growing source of energy in the world, driven not by regulation but market forces. The spectacular drop in the cost of generating energy from the sun has led to a doubling of solar capacity every 20 months. In the United States, solar-energy jobs are growing at a rate 12 times faster than the overall economy at large, and a recent Department of Energy report shows more than five times as many American paychecks come from working in the renewable energy than the fossil fuel industry. Coal jobs are not coming back but the growth in the clean energy and tech sectors is more than offsetting the decline in fossil fuel jobs. We’re seeing the positive impacts of this transition right here at home in Vermont. We recently brought a solar array online at our Waterbury, Vermont ice cream factory. The solar array generates nearly 20% of the energy we use at the plant at a price that is lower than what I was paying to purchase electricity from the grid. Even better, that price is locked in place for the life of the array, something I could never do with traditional fossil fuel energy sources. The project at our plant is part of a larger transition to solar in the state of Vermont which is greening our grid and creating new jobs and economic growth. In fact, Vermont now has the second highest per capita solar jobs in the country, despite our long dark winters. Whether Donald Trump believes that climate change is real or a hoax just doesn’t matter to the global economy. Trump’s willingness to ignore the laws of science can’t change the fundamental laws of economics. As the cost of generating energy from clean renewable sources continues to drop it will only accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. This is good news for people and our planet. The only question is whether the United States will be positioned to take advantage of the economic growth and job creation that will come from being a leader in fight against climate change. Will the United States continue to be the world leader in innovation that drives the clean energy economy or will U.S. companies and workers be left behind by China and Europe?I remain deeply committed to working with the many CEOs and business leaders representing trillions of dollars in revenue that strongly supported the Paris Agreement. As a business community, we're proud to stand with the millions of Americans who care about the climate crisis and have been taking to the streets in demonstrations like the Peoples Climate March to show their support for clean energy solutions. If President Trump won’t provide the leadership required to fight climate change, create jobs, and drive innovation and economic growth, then the rest of us will."

In fact, you released a written guarantee “to make sure all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselves.”Now regardless if you are a Republican, a Democrat, or an Independent, those are your words, your promise, and that is a fact. The truth is something you cannot escape. And here is the truth, the United States of America is in the middle of the deadliest health crisis in the history of our nation.If somehow our country’s future combines the Republican-backed HealthCare Plan with Trump’s recent budget it will cripple potential recovery for millions of Americans with substance abuse disorders and rocket the heroin epidemic into outer space.The budget is a head fake. On paper, it looks like a 2% increase in heroin treatment spending. But unfortunately for the President, facts get in the way again. That 2% includes the $500 million added by the 21st Century Cures Act, which was approved by Congress and signed into law by Obama. Take that out, and Trump’s budget dramatically cuts spending on drug treatment this year.But the biggest head-fake to the American public who elected Trump is the fact that the Cures Act money was only allocated for fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Once those funds go away, heroin addicts that are now dying at record numbers in West Virginia and New Hampshire, 41.5 per hundred thousand people and 34.3 per hundred thousand respectively, have a high probability to be placed in body bags stacked in makeshift morgues.No joke, this year, for the sixth straight year, West Virginia’s indigent burial fund, which helps families who can’t afford a funeral pay for one, ran out of money. In fact, Fred Kitchen, the president of the West Virginia Funeral Directors Association, said, “Families take out second mortgages, cash in 401(k)s, and go broke to try and save a son or daughter, who then overdoses and dies.”Bottom-line, Mr. President, you broke your promise to America. The budget you recently proposed will cut Medicaid 47% over ten years, will take away 400 million to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, cut hundreds of millions to mental health block grants, and gravely reduce access to those you President Trump personally guaranteed to help.Mr. President, I implore you to rethink your administration’s strategy on how to combat this worsening health crisis. The track you are on is just a whole lot of dumb. But the solution is simple. We need treatment facilities, we need them now, and we need to create a radical model to accomplish the herculean task.Take Tim Grover, a Massachusetts businessman, who buried his 26-year old daughter, Megan in 2014. On Christmas Eve, Megan had to leave a treatment center because of red tape. It is not clear exactly what happened that evening, but it had something to do with insurance mandates for the separation and clarification of detox facilities versus treatment centers.Again, no joke, it was something along the lines of my friend’s son who first detoxed himself off heroin in the basement of his mother’s house and then pounded the streets looking for a 30-day treatment facility. The only problem, he was shut-out because he had to be ‘referred by a licensed detox facility.”He had no choice but to get high, go to a detox and then attempt long term treatment. Desperate, he did just that. But now his mother visits him in the cemetery. The first bag of heroin he bought was Fentanyl, and it ended his life.Back to Tim Grover and his daughter, Megan. The Christmas Eve debacle wasn’t their first rodeo. After a serious automobile accident when Megan was 17, she was prescribed OxyContin to treat pain from her injuries. That, unfortunately, like so many countless others, rang the bell that sounded rehab after rehab and relapse after relapse.But on the night of December 29, 2014, Tim received a phone call from Megan. She was extremely happy. There was a bed available in a Boston treatment facility the next morning. Tim told Megan he loved her and went to bed at rest.Tomorrow never came. Tim Grover buried Megan, on January 5, 2015, and 24 hours later, Tim purchased a vacant Riverside School in Lowell, Massachusetts and opened the residential treatment home for women, Megan’s House, on September 30, 2015. Tim Grover was angry at God, angry at the system that failed his daughter, and felt socially responsible for helping other young women like Megan.The Megan House is a free opioid treatment facility for all its residents. They receive no federal funding and only in the past couple of months have received state funding. But how do they survive? It costs money to feed residents and pay for staff. Nothing is free, right?Tim Grover owns businesses in 14 states. From New Jersey to Florida, to Illinois, Grover has amassed a small fortune using sound business principles just like Trump.In fact, Tim also believes strongly in conservative principles. He doesn’t think it is government’s place to pay for everything in our society. But he firmly believes that people in his tax brackets do have a social responsibility to help end this heroin epidemic.The Megan House model Grover has initiated and plans to take all over the United States is simply remarkable. For example, The Megan House Raffle envelopes the same emotional stimuli that ensure gambling casinos and state lottery agencies such a profitable business: The chance to win something that potentially changes a person’s life.Mr. President, if you persist in patrolling Twitter in the early hours of the morning, jump on Megan House Twitter and check out Tim Grover’s business model for diminishing the undeniable fact that opioid overdoses now claims one life every four minutes in America.Finally, Mr. President, Congress and the millions of Americans who are financially stable, it is time to be socially responsible and unite against this health crisis. We can never Make America Great Again if we just stand by and watch the impact heroin is having on poverty, joblessness, crime, and the deteriorating communities of the Heartland of our great nation.President Trump, nobody likes to be called a liar. But it’s never too late to do the right thing."

Yep, five weeks before my first wedding anniversary I was delivering my first son. I didn’t know anything about babies. I was an only child and each of my parents had passed away while I was in my twenties. Not a sob story, just fact. So, in early September my husband and I were stuck in rush hour traffic while I hee-heed my way to the hospital. I wasn’t panicked but I was definitely anxious.When we arrived at the hospital I was wheeled to my room and went into the restroom to change into my gown. There was a beautiful nurse standing there to help me and I said through the door, “I won’t miss these jeans, that’s for sure.” And, so sweetly, so lovingly, so tenderly, my husband said to me and the nurse, “She thinks she’s tired of them,” as if it had been such a burden on him to look at my hideous body in those horrid discount store jeans. In my head I was saying, “I thought I was having a baby but it appears that there is already one in the room. But, I was busy at that moment so I let it go. We got pregnant much faster than we had anticipated and to say that we weren’t quite ready is an understatement. I took the pregnancy test on my birthday and went into the kitchen and told my husband the good news. He didn’t speak to me for two days. Somehow, I had managed to do this on my own.Back to the delivery room, where we spent less than an hour. I was pretty speedy at popping out babies. It was an easy delivery, as if there is such a thing. Maybe because I made it look so easy my husband didn’t feel the enormity of the occasion: the enormity of having a small turkey come out of your private parts! I was wheeled into my room and got settled in with my new baby boy and my husband said to me, “Well, I have an 11 o’clock that I can still make.” And with that, he was gone.I didn’t mind being alone with my baby. I loved him, and in those first few hours before real life set in it was just the two of us. I thought it would be three of us. I felt so lonely, so lonely. The only family I had was a day away so my husband was it for me. And, what first time dad would want to leave when he had a new baby boy? It just didn’t make sense to me. Being alone, no problem, but the loneliness that I felt in those first few hours of parenthood was crushing.When I look back at that time I want to tell that young mother that what she was feeling was real, and justified and it wasn’t just in her head. That she wasn’t being needy, she was being normal. And sadly, that it would continue through the life of the marriage. Now that about a million years have passed and I am no longer in the marriage, I know that the loneliness was real, it was not imagined or manufactured by me. That I told my husband often how lonely I was. That I was lonely when we were sitting in the same room.Loneliness isn’t just in your head. You might feel neglected, or you might feel unappreciated, but all roads lead to loneliness. And, in my opinion, continued loneliness can lead to isolation: it creates a sadness that can’t quite be defined.If you are spending a lot of time alone and you are happy, that’s great. But, if you are constantly around people and you are feeling lonely, take some action to figure out what you can do to climb out of that hole. It may be professional help or it may be that your marriage or relationship needs a tune up, but make the necessary changes to get you on the road to contentment."

It’s a food so ubiquitous that it doesn’t need an invitation to breakfast. It just kind of shows up. And that’s never a problem. Scrambled eggs, when cooked just right, have a buttery, custardy texture that puts hotel sheet pan scrambles to shame. But even a perfect food gets tiresome after your millionth time eating it.That’s why, from time to time, we need some fresh ideas when it comes to eggs. So we asked some professional egg scramblers (read: chefs). From Israeli-style eggs to a Thai scramble, some of our favorite chefs from across the country are here to upgrade your scramble game. Get out the non-stick pan. Grab your silicon spatula. It’s time to go to work.Jessica Koslow, Sqirl, L.A.“Oh man. I’m such a purist. Good eggs, whipped well before cooking, their texture is so glorious I hate to add too much to it. Maybe finishing it with a smidgen of chive and serving it with some gorgeous prosciutto from Cesare Casella. At Sqirl, we’ve also been serving scrambled eggs next to a stewy tomato mixture, as the tomatoes are just getting so good. Separate...yet...together.”Bobby Flay, Gato, New York City ""I like to do my scramble with a little bit of scallions and romesco, which is a peppery, Spanish, pesto-like sauce. I also like to run some rivers of goat cheese through the eggs with a big spoon. Those eggs are awesome. I serve something like them at Gato.""Beverly Clark, Parachute, Chicago ""My add-ins are shallot, garlic, Thai chili, cabbage, Thai oyster sauce, Thai golden seasoning, fish sauce, sugar, lime and cilantro! I like to eat that scramble with fresh jasmine rice. Sometimes, I need to eat something that is fast to make, has protein and vegetables, but packs in a lot of flavor. The combination of the Thai oyster sauce, golden seasoning, and fish sauce gives it the deep salty flavor. The chilies give heat. The garlic and shallots give a nice savory allium note, and the cabbage gives good texture.""Michael Solomonov, Zahav, Dizengoff, and Rooster Soup Co., Philadelphia ""If I'm not baking a big cast-iron of shakshuka, I'm adding chopped olives and crumbled Bulgarian feta to softly scrambled eggs. I eat my eggs with toasted challah and a good spoonful of harif, which is Yemenite hot sauce. I chop-up some cucumbers and fresh tomato drizzled with good olive oil and salt for Israeli salad, and pour myself a big cup of Turkish coffee like I'm in a cafe in Israel.""Mashama Bailey, The Grey, Savannah, GA ""I love eggs, and one of my favorite ways to eat them are soft-scrambled with a touch of cream and a bit of bacon fat. The cream keeps the eggs light and fluffy, while the bacon fat adds a porky element that is a perfect marriage of flavor.""More from Bon Appetit: When Life Hands You Lemons, Make These Lemon Desserts No-Cook Pasta Sauces You Should Have Up Your Sleeve at All Times 35 Make-Ahead Breakfasts so You Can Sleep in and Eat Well All Week Our 50 Favorite Weeknight Dinners 24 Recipes Everyone Should Know How to Cook 75 Fast & Easy Weeknight Dinner Ideas"

For movie audiences in 1982, the rain-soaked Los Angeles of Blade Runner looked like downtown Tokyo. By 2014, the City of Angels in the Spike Jonze film Her had more of a Shanghai vibe. This upcoming October, with the release of Blade Runner 2049, Los Angeles will likely resemble Seoul.Off-screen as well, Asia has been almost as good as a time machine. When I was coming of age, it was the place to go for anyone hankering for the next big thing. After college, a number of my classmates traveled to Japan to strike gold teaching English. Today, recent grads are more likely to visit the big cities of South Korea and China, or head further south to Singapore and Malaysia. They all come back, as I did in 2001 after three years in Asia, with stories of the future: bullet trains, otherworldly urban landscapes, the latest electronic gizmos.So, it’s not surprising that when foreign policy elites think about what will replace a U.S. superpower in relative decline ― speculation that has grown more feverish in the Trump era ― they, too, look East. But no longer to Japan, which is passé, or South Korea, which has also perhaps peaked. Instead, they tremble before China, which has already surpassed the United States in gross economic output, while steadily enhancing its military capabilities. It seems like the only country remotely capable of challenging the United States as the world’s sole superpower.The anxiety of declining U.S. influence became so intense during the Obama years that the notion of a Group of Two (G2) gained considerable currency: if we can’t beat ‘em, went the thinking at the time, then maybe we should join ‘em. However seriously intended such a proposal to co-rule the world with China might have been, the Obama administration never followed up beyond agreements on climate change and bilateral investment.Ambitious and impatient, Beijing decided to strike out on its own. It has unveiled a twenty-first-century, industrial-strength version of the post-World War II Marshall Plan with which the U.S. once put a devastated Europe back on its feet. China’s vision, however, focuses on the building up of all the countries on its periphery and some even further afield, as it tries to draw the whole Eurasian continent into its sphere of influence. Although it’s expected to provide an estimated $1 trillion to more than 60 countries, this “One Belt, One Road” plan is anything but a charity mission. It will direct a major influx of resources to Chinese construction companies, bring minerals and energy to Chinese factories, and promise a better potential return on investment than U.S. treasury bonds. Some infrastructure projects will also allay security concerns, like the energy pipelines to be built through Myanmar that will bypass the watery bottleneck of the Malacca Straits where a determined adversary could potentially shut off 80% of Beijing’s oil imports.The victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 elections has only deepened anxiety over China’s ascendance among Washington’s policymakers and pundits. During his campaign, Trump frightened both the neocons and more conventional militarists with his talk of avoiding military entanglements overseas. As president, he has pledged to boost military spending but seems to have no idea of how to use all the Pentagon’s new toys other than to bomb the stuffing out of the militants of the Islamic State.Nor does Trump care a whit about the soft power the United States has traditionally used to cultivate international support. For instance, Washington had long promoted international financial institutions and free trade agreements, but Trump has railed against the “false song of globalism.” China, meanwhile, is positioning itself to become the new overlord of global capitalism, even going so far as to set up a parallel international financial system to realize its vision. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which began operations in January 2016 without the support of the United States or the European Union, will function like the World Bank in providing financing for China’s various building projects abroad. Whereas Beijing controls less than 5% of the votes at the World Bank, it commands 28% of the shares in the AIIB. Although still a small operation compared to China’s commercial banks, it will be quite capable of scaling up if the opportunity arises.The contrast between Beijing and Washington has become even sharper around climate change. Trump’s denial of global warming ― he once labeled it a Chinese “hoax” ― has whetted the Beijing leadership’s appetite for global influence. As one of its top climate change negotiators said shortly after Trump won the November election, “China’s influence and voice are likely to increase in global climate governance, which will then spill over into other areas of global governance and increase China’s global standing, power, and leadership.”All of this is part of a larger trend of power flowing from West to East. In 2010, North America and Western Europe were responsible for 40% of the global gross national product. By 2050, that share, the Economist Intelligence Unit estimates, will fall to 21%, with Asia’s share rising to a commanding 48.1%.But don’t rush out to begin that crash course in Mandarin and exchange your dollars for yuan quite yet. The showdown between Beijing and Washington is unlikely to play out exactly as the Chinese hope and Americans fear.The Decline of the United StatesOn a visit to Beijing in October 2016, in the presence of the Chinese leadership, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte declared, “America has lost now. I’ve realigned myself in your ideological flow.” He went on to imagine a new axis of Russia, China, and the Philippines arrayed against the arrogance of American power.Talk about shockers. The Philippines has traditionally been a cornerstone of U.S. influence in Asia, a place for Washington to station troops, dock ships, and, in the post-9/11 era, send military advisors to help suppress a Muslim insurgency. Moreover, Manila had gone toe to toe with Beijing over disputed islands in the South China Sea, even submitting its case to an international tribunal for arbitration. But that was before Duterte became president in May 2016 and labeled President Obama, who took a dim view of Duterte’s gruesome record of extrajudicial killings, a “son of a whore.”The apparent defection of the Philippines was the coup de grâce for one of the Obama administration’s most heralded foreign policy efforts aimed at staving off American decline. In October 2011, just before the Arab Spring broke out, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authored an article in Foreign Policy laying out what would become known as the “Pacific pivot.” The United States, at the time, was fitfully trying to extricate itself from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thanks to imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as investments in shale fracking and sustainable energy, Washington was no longer quite so dependent on Middle Eastern oil. The Obama administration felt that it might finally put the failures of the Bush years behind it and turn to new horizons.The Pacific pivot should have been called the Willie Sutton policy. When Sutton was asked why he robbed banks, he replied, “That’s where the money is.” So, too, with Asia. It contains four of the top 11 economies in the world: China’s, Japan’s, India’s, and South Korea’s. With the United States focused on losing bets in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen, China has been cornering this rich Asian market. By now, it has become the leading trading partner for South Korea, Japan, Australia, and virtually all of Southeast Asia.To recapture its edge in the region, the Obama administration promoted a free trade compact known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). U.S. negotiators managed to achieve the near-impossible by getting a dozen disparate countries on the same page while leaving China out of the picture. But Congress proved, at best, lukewarm on the deal. And sentiment among the American public ran even colder ― so cold, in fact, that one of its chief architects, Hillary Clinton, fearing that the trade agreement might take her presidential bid down in flames, came out against it in 2016. Withdrawing from the TPP would, of course, be one of Donald Trump’s first acts as president.The United States, in fact, faces more than just an economic challenge in Asia. Washington had long considered the Pacific to be an “American lake.” It currently has 375,000 military and civilian personnel stationed within the Pacific Command’s ambit and devotes roughly half its naval capacity to Pacific waters. It maintains treaty alliances with Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, as well as dozens of military bases in the region. But China, after more than a decade of double-digit increases in military spending, has begun pushing back against American pretensions to be the only Pacific power around. It has developed new weapons to deny the U.S. military access to its coastal waters and has come to excel at cyberwarfare, vacuuming up huge amounts of confidential data by hacking into U.S. government agencies. Meanwhile, in the world of spy versus spy, China has managed to plug leaks on its end by jailing or killing more than a dozen U.S. intelligence assets.Even before the ascension of Donald Trump, the Pentagon’s effort to pivot eastward had come up short. For all its overwhelming military edge, Washington has increasingly found itself unable to dictate outcomes through force anywhere in the Greater Middle East. The rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and turmoil in Yemen and Libya have all continued to bedevil the U.S. military.In the meantime, the Obama administration made some token rearrangements of its forces in the Pacific, sold some high-tech weaponry to its allies in the region, and threw some brush-back pitches at Beijing. But in the end, as with so many of Obama’s initiatives, the Pacific pivot proved largely aspirational. The U.S. never really pivoted out of the Greater Middle East. As a presidential candidate, Trump was content to bluster about Chinese threats, even as he also threatened to withdraw the U.S. nuclear umbrella from both Tokyo and Seoul. He demanded that U.S. allies pony up more money for American help and protection, while offering no new ways of anchoring the United States in the Pacific.Now in the Oval Office, Trump has sent mixed signals. He’s repaired relations with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but he’s also been pushing a major rise in the Pentagon budget. And what country would be the target of those additional tens of billions of dollars in military spending? The U.S. Navy certainly doesn’t need a 350-ship force to counter the Islamic State. Trump has welcomed the election of South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, but also insists that he wants to renegotiate “bad” trade and security deals with South Korea. He has tried to bully North Korea, but has also held out the possibility of meeting personally with that “pretty smart cookie,” Kim Jong-un.Thanks to his erratic pronouncements, even though it’s early in Trump’s term, American influence in the region is already dropping as inexorably as the president’s approval ratings at home. Add to this mix a president who only wants big wins but doesn’t see the likelihood of that happening in Asia and you have the definition of decline.That decline has, in recent years, often been calculated in terms of approaching horizons: when North Korean missiles can reach the West Coast; when China’s military spending pulls closer to the Pentagon’s; when Japan and South Korea, like the Philippines, begin to reconsider their allegiances. Now, in the Trump era, add one more item to the list: when Asia faces an incompetent, corrupt, and self-defeating administration in Washington.The way seems clear enough for China, the strongest country in Asia, to fill the potential vacuum. But, as they say, the best-laid plans oft do go astray.The Weakness of AsiaJapan is the incredible shrinking country. Between 2010 and 2015, the population of America’s most steadfast ally in the Pacific dropped by a million people to just over 127 million. As a result of a strikingly low fertility rate and negligible immigration, there could, according to official projections, be only 85-95 million Japanese by 2050. By 2135, after living in a fossilized society, the last Japanese, at the age of 118, could breathe his or her final breath. This worst-case scenario, as spelled out by former trade negotiator Clyde Prestowitz in his recent book Japan Restored, is perhaps far-fetched, but Japan is nevertheless on a path toward what looks like national seppuku: ritual suicide by attrition.Ah, well, that’s Japan, you might think. It’s been in a fiscal funk since its economic bubble burst back in 1990. But the rise, stagnation, and shrinkage of that country remains a cautionary tale for all the other lands that have followed its path of export-led and state-facilitated growth.After all, South Korea has entered its own period of diminished economic expectations, with anemic growth, widening inequality, and pervasive corporate corruption. Young South Koreans, facing the prospect of unemployment or poorly compensated contract labor, refer to their country as “Hell Choson,” a play on the Choson dynasty that ruled from 1392 to 1897. Taiwan, another member of the “flying geese of industrialization” responsible for Asia’s tremendous economic growth, faces a strikingly similar set of problems, according to economist Frank Hsiao, including “low and stagnating wage rates, increasing income inequality, the hollowing out of domestic industries, and languishing exports.”Some of the shine is even wearing off China’s economic miracle. The days of annual double-digit growth in its gross national product are long past. Officials are happy now if they can cite growth figures closer to 7% (and even those are believed to be overstated). The Chinese labor force has been contracting since 2012. Strikes and labor protests increased dramatically in 2016, while unrest continues in China’s westernmost provinces of Xinjiang and Tibet. The government’s official anti-corruption campaign, despite netting some highly placed individuals, has only driven the corrupt into more discrete forms of graft.Meanwhile, it’s not only Japan that faces a demographic crisis. The fertility rates of both Taiwan (1.12) and South Korea (1.25) are even lower than Japan’s (1.41), while China’s (1.6) is only a bit higher. None of them is close to the replacement rate of 2.1. Approaching 2050, all four countries will have to dig deep to pay the retirement benefits and healthcare costs of all the industrious workers currently outperforming their counterparts elsewhere in the world. What was once called “Japan passing” ― investors skipping that country in search of better opportunities elsewhere in the region ― is already morphing into “China passing.” Financial flows are also going to be affected by the rising waters of climate change, which, later in the century, will threaten major cities like Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore.Predicting the coming supremacy of the East has been a veritable cottage industry in the West, and its stock is still rising as China’s One Belt, One Road venture, meant to tie the vast Eurasian continent together, goes head to head with Trump’s “my way or the highway.” The future, however, promises to be far messier than China or its boosters imagine. Demographics, corruption, and reduced economic growth ― not to mention environmental degradation and the declining legitimacy of its ruling party’s ideology ― are by no means the only problems that Beijing faces.Asia’s New NationalismThe United States once billed itself as the antidote to nationalism in Asia. After World War II, it established a permanent military presence across the region to prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism. It portrayed itself as a neutral party, with no territorial ambitions. It restored the island of Okinawa to Japan in 1972. It refused to take sides in several island disputes in the region. In this way, its liberal internationalism squared off against the illiberal Communisms of China, North Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.Both these supranational ideologies, which flourished in the region during the Cold War, have entered hospice care in the twenty-first century. Communism has functionally disappeared from the region, replaced by nationalisms of varying degrees of intensity. Xi Jinping’s China and Kim Jong-un’s North Korea are hardly the only places where nationalism has taken root.In Japan, for instance, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is busy trying to rebuild the very militarism that the United States once professed to despise. A succession of U.S. administrations has aided and abetted this right-wing nationalist effort to dispense with the country’s post-World War II “peace constitution” and push the Japanese Self-Defense Forces onto the offensive.Nationalist leaders, meanwhile, have assumed power throughout Southeast Asia: the murderous president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte; the former military commander, now prime minister of Thailand, Prayuth Chan-ocha; and the corrupt Najib Razak, prime minister of Malaysia. Even more ominously, nationalism has taken hold in South Asia, particularly in India, which recently replaced Great Britain as the world’s sixth largest economy and where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made Hindu exceptionalism the heart and soul of his ruling party.One obvious result of this rising nationalism has been escalating arms imports across the region. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, India became the world’s largest arms importer in 2012-2016. During that period, Southeast Asia’s arms imports rose by more than 6%, with Vietnam jumping to 10th place globally. In 2012, for the first time, Asia surpassed Europe in overall military spending.Both the nationalist rhetoric and those weapons imports are certainly linked to regional perceptions of the waxing and waning of great powers. To reinforce their claims to the South China Sea and several other disputed territories, countries in the region feel the need to arm themselves in the face of a newly aggressive China and a perennially distracted United States.At the moment, those two countries are cooperating in one key area: pouring money into the kind of military hardware that could someday lead to a catastrophic showdown. This reality has led ever more foreign policy analysts to invoke the “Thucydides trap,” in which a rising power like Athens (read: China) takes on the hitherto dominant power Sparta (read: America) in a long, debilitating conflict like the Peloponnesian War (read: World War III).But the conflicts in Asia may, in fact, shape up quite differently. Movements for greater self-determination are undercutting the reach of both the rising and the reigning superpower. Consider the contrasting examples of Myanmar and South Korea.China is the largest investor in Myanmar, and at one time the two countries were as thick as thieves. But relations between them have grown tense. In 2011, the new civilian-led government in Myanmar stopped work on the Myitsone dam, one of a number of mega-projects financed by Beijing. “Plenty of Burmese blame China for helping to prop up the military junta,” writes journalist Tom Miller in his new book, China’s Asian Dream. Newly enfranchised, the Burmese have taken aim at projects like Myitsone, where 90% of the electricity generated would have gone to China. Myanmar’s leader Aung San Suu Kyi must now decide between permanently mothballing the dam, which would require paying back the $800 million owed Chinese financiers, or going forward with a deeply unpopular project she previously opposed.  The example of Myanmar is not unique. Sri Lanka has recently swung away from China and back toward India. Filipino President Duterte has recently edged back toward a United States led by Donald Trump, who has praised the Philippine leader’s drug war (despite its massive human rights violations). Vietnam is perennially suspicious of China’s geopolitical intentions, but anti-Chinese sentiment has also been building in Laos, Indonesia, and Malaysia. One Belt, One Road might outstrip the Marshall Plan in size, but it lacks the underlying regional political solidarity that ensured the latter’s success.And yet China is not alone in feeling a backlash in the region. In South Korea, for instance, a decade of conservative rule came to a crashing end with the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye on corruption charges, a hastily organized election, and the victory of progressive Moon Jae-in. The new South Korean leader is no firebrand, so don’t expect a dramatic break with Washington. South Korea has been subservient to the United States for too long to risk that any time soon. Moon has, however, promised to take another look at the missile defense system ― the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ― that the United States worked so hard to deploy in South Korea before he took office. The new president also wants to mend fences with China, the country’s largest trading partner, and revive a more cooperative relationship with North Korea as well.Meanwhile, in Japan, opposition from politicians, activists, and ordinary citizens in Okinawa has blocked a plan hammered out in Tokyo and Washington to close an old U.S. military base in the city of Futenma, only to build a replacement elsewhere on the island. Okinawa is where America houses a good deal of its Pacific firepower. The refusal of Okinawan inhabitants to support the construction of the new base has not only scrambled the Pacific plans of both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton but given new legitimacy to the idea of withdrawing U.S. forces from Japan and South Korea to a secondary tier of islands like Guam.The growing willingness of Asian countries to put their own interests above those of their putative patrons has also made it more difficult for the region to find common ground. “Asia is not remotely cohesive,” writes Jessica Mathews of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “There is no ‘East’ comparable to the ‘West.’ Though the region is integrating economically, it is riven by active conflicts, bitter historical memories, and deep cultural divisions.”Past as Prologue?If liberal internationalism no longer appeals to U.S. allies in Asia ― or, indeed, to the new leadership in Washington ― it might be easy enough to assume that the future will be a replay of the past: the return to a Sinocentric universe that prevailed for 1,000 years or more in the region. Instead of local satraps loaded with gifts visiting an emperor in Beijing, the leaders of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and the Philippines will build dams and ports and pipelines with Chinese money and then repatriate much of the proceeds to that country.As it happens, though, the intensification of nationalism in Asia has greatly complicated this picture and may leave leaders like Duterte playing Beijing off against Washington, or striking out on their own, or perhaps seeking help from India ― or even Saudi Arabia, which has made a bid for greater influence among Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. If the rise of China has caused much anxiety in the West, so has the possibility that no country will become dominant in Asia in the wake of U.S. decline and that a new kind of chaos will descend on the region.“The idea of a multipolar world, without dominant powers and guided solely by the rule of law, is theoretically attractive,“ Financial Times journalist Gideon Rachman writes in his recent book Easternization. But he adds, “I fear that just such a multipolar world is already emerging and proving to be unstable and dangerous: the ‘rules’ are very hard to enforce without a dominant power in the background.”For years, Asia has contemplated an alternative to both Chinese and American hegemony. Following the example of the European Union, politicians and scholars have imagined a future of economic and political integration. But the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and similar efforts continue to fall far short of the EU ideal (which itself looks increasingly shaky and fragmented).In other words, despite all those dreams of Asia’s glittering future, it’s unlikely to resemble the peaceful prosperity of Europe, nor is it likely to see a continuation of U.S. hegemony or a repeat of the China-centered system of centuries past. It’s likely, however, to involve population decline, economic contraction, heightened nationalism, and rising waters ― a future, in short, filled with troubles and dangers of every sort.Although Washington still commands considerable power in the region, it could stand back, Trump-like, and just watch everything unravel. Or, alongside Beijing, it could make a serious investment in a new organization of security and economic cooperation, in which the United States and China would be equal partners, the region could have its collective say, and the new nationalism would be deprived of its major raison d’être.Without such a supranational vision that could bring the region together around the twin threats of climate change and economic inequality, one thing is essentially guaranteed. The Asia to come won’t look shiny and new like some Hollywood movie. The future may not look like Asia at all, but more like Europe circa 1913, at the edge of conflict and cataclysm.John Feffer is the author of the new dystopian novel, Splinterlands (a Dispatch Books original with Haymarket Books), which Publishers Weekly hails as “a chilling, thoughtful, and intuitive warning.” He is the director of Foreign Policy In Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies and a TomDispatch regular.Follow TomDispatch on Twitter and join us on Facebook.

Will it be a livable, progressive city that presents an alternative to everything that is wrong with America or will it become another megalopolis ridden with police violence, racist attacks, unbridled gentrification and homelessness?In the wake of the horrific stabbings of three people by a right-wing libertarian, Jeremy Christian, Portland is in a state of shock. The city is bracing for a confrontation between a pro-Trump group that has planned a rally for June 4th in the name of “Free Speech” and anti-fascists who have organized a counter-protest a block away. Multnomah County Republican Party chair has suggested hiring right-wing militia groups to provide security.The “Free Speech” Trump group had organized a similar rally on April 29, at which Christian shouted racist slurs and gave the Nazi salute. A video shows Trump supporters at that rally telling Christian he was not welcome there and asking him to leave.Mayor Ted Wheeler asked the federal government to retract the permit for the “Free Speech” rally that is to take place on federal property claiming “public safety” concerns as the reason. The federal government has declined to revoke the permit.While the mayor’s heart is in the right place, his efforts to block this rally is clearly unconstitutional as no evidence has been presented that links the organizers to imminent direct threats against individuals. The activist response is divided, with the ACLU calling the Mayor’s demand for revocation of a permit unconstitutional, others demanding that Portland block hate speech given the recent acts of racist violence, and Rose City Antifa arguing against any state intervention at all.Although this Sunday’s showdown between the Trump rally and counter-protestors has focused our attention on white supremacy, racist violence, and how to balance free speech with public safety, the solutions to these problems will not be found by punching a Nazi, much as that might feel good in the moment.Revoking a permit for right-wing white nationalists to speak in a public square might seem like the appropriate response to the deadly stabbings, but the most effective response to white supremacy and racism would be to address the serious criminal justice issues facing Portland that are actually within the power of the mayor, who is Portland’s Police Commissioner.Here are four things that the activist group Portland’s Resistance has proposed that Mayor Ted Wheeler could do today to make Portland safer and less racist.1) End broken windows policing.Police enforcement of low-level offenses like public urination, public transit fare evasion, and jaywalking was supposed to make our cities safer. The result of these policies across the country has been the disproportionate targeting of communities of color, leading to arrests, jail time, and mass incarceration.The evidence of such racist targeting in Portland is overwhelming with black people being charged at 27 times the rate of white people for spitting, 8 times the rate of white people for jaywalking, and 15 times the rate of white people for failure to cross the street at a right angle. Furthermore, stops for these petty offenses often lead to charges for disorderly conduct, interfering with an officer, and resisting arrest.In response to a December study by Portland State University that showed blacks more likely to face an escalated penalty than whites for the same offenses, Multnomah County District Attorney Rod Underhill said prosecutors would stop pursuing charges for fare evasion.This a good start, but Police Commissioner Wheeler can stop these harmful practices today by telling his police to focus their attention on solving serious violent crimes and not waste their time on victimless low-level offenses.2.) Stop criminalizing the houseless.Portland has one of the highest rates of rent hikes in the entire country, with some residents facing 30 to 40 percent increases. Housing prices have gone up by almost 10 percent since last year, the second highest jump in the country, just behind Seattle. Gentrification leads to housing unaffordability, which inevitably results in increasing homelessness. A stroll through any part of the city shows the extent of the housing crisis.Until Portland can adopt meaningful emergency rent control measures and develop a plan to build more affordable housing, the city must make life easier and not harder for those who find themselves living on the streets. Criminalizing the basic human activities of houseless people like public urination and erecting a tent leads to arrest and jail time for people who are just trying to survive.Mayor Wheeler can instruct the police to stop the routine sweeps of homeless people that merely shift them to another location, and often result in property loss, arrests and confrontations.3.) Abolish the Gang DatabaseIf the gang database has any purpose, it should be to alert the police to people who are likely to commit violent acts. However, the fact that Jeremy Christian was not in the database suggests that at its best, it is an ineffective tool. Christian was a public figure who repeatedly threatened people of color and assaulted a black woman with a bottle of Gatorade at a Trimet station the day before the stabbings. Yet, he was not considered enough of a threat to public safety to be placed in the gang database.Meanwhile, 64 percent of the people on the gang database are black and 81 percent are racial or ethnic minorities. The police use a guilt-by-association model to place people on the list for having a tattoo, wearing particular clothes or hanging out with people known to be gang members. In essence, the gang database has become a list to criminalize non-white people and target them for enforcement.Mayor Wheeler can end this discriminatory policing practice today by abolishing the database.4) Strengthen sanctuary protections for immigrants.Portland’s City Council unanimously passed a sanctuary city resolution in March. While this is a good first step, many immigrants continue to be delivered into the hands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) when they are arrested for minor offenses. Furthermore, there have been repeated violations of Oregon’s Sanctuary statute with County jail officials cooperating with ICE agents or stalking immigrants who come into court for appointments.Mayor Wheeler can strengthen protections of immigrants by ending broken windows policing through which people have been torn from their families and deported because they were arrested for petty low-level offenses. The city has already committed $50,000 to the Immigrant Protection Project to provide free legal services to refugees and immigrants, but we must do more if we want to give immigrants adequate legal representation.It is easy in moments of crisis to forget the importance of protecting civil liberties. It happened during World War II when more than 100,000 Japanese and Japanese-Americans were locked up as enemy aliens. It happened after September 11th when Muslims across the country were targeted by law enforcement. And it is happening today in Portland as the City Council uses the horrific stabbings as the reason to try to cancel a public rally.Even if one could stop this rally from taking place in Portland, would that stop the racism and threat from white supremacists in our midst? No. The most effective way for the government to fight racism and white supremacy is by doing the hard work of ending its own complicity in these ills by reforming criminal justice and policing.Making Portland a truly inclusive, livable and progressive beacon in this country is a long-term project that will require the city’s residents to confront their racist legacy as well as the racism that persists today.Mayor Wheeler has the power to make Portland safer and less racist. Does he have the will?"
13,WORLD NEWS,Robot Priest Is Ringing In The 500th Anniversary Of The Reformation,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robot-priest-is-ringing-in-the-500th-anniversary-of-the-reformation_us_592ec924e4b09ec37c3087fc,Talk about deus ex machina.,2017-05-31,BlessU-2 is an experiment of the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau for the 500th Anniversary of the Reformation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592ed6172100002a006fe9fc.jpeg?cache=UyQAG4xGLZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Watch BlessU-2 deliver a blessing in English above.About 500 years after Martin Luther posted his 95 theses to a church door in Wittenberg, Germany, a new kind of priest is making waves in that same town. BlessU-2 is a robot priest that can lift its arms, wiggle its eyebrows, flash light from its hands and deliver blessings in seven languages ― including German, English, French, Spanish, Polish and a local German dialect. The project, spearheaded by the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau, is meant to be a provocative way to ring in the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation, which was sparked by Luther in 1517.Volker Rahn, a press officer for the church, told HuffPost that BlessU-2 is meant to challenge people to think about what a blessing is, and whether it can be delivered by a machine. “The idea is to stimulate debate and thinking about the future of the church in a world full of electronic devices – all that with a twinkle in our eye,” he told HuffPost in an email.The church turned to Alexander Wiedekind-Klein, the founder of a German robotics magazine, for help creating BlessU-2. Users can choose what type of blessing they wish to receive and whether to hear from a male or female voice. The robot then chooses a special blessing for the user, based on more than 40 Bible verses. BlessU-2 can even print the blessing out for users to keep. Watch BlessU-2 in action below.The robot will be doling out blessings at the World Reformation Exhibition in Wittenberg until September. Anyone can receive blessings from the robot. Rahn said that children are particularly fascinated by the machine. It’s clear to him that pastors can’t be replaced by robots. “Worshipers needn’t worry about clergy being replaced with machines. We know: Robots could never substitute for pastoral care,” Rahn wrote. “We don’t want to robotize our church work, but see if we can bring a theological perspective to a machine and a world full of high-technology.”"
14,POLITICS,Former NAACP President Ben Jealous Announces Run For Maryland Governor,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-jealous-running-for-maryland-governor_us_592ef5a1e4b0540ffc83c252,The Bernie Sanders supporter has strong ties in the progressive community.,2017-05-31,"Former NAACP president Ben Jealous speaks at the Young Democrats convention in Lanham, Maryland, on April 1. He announced his candidacy for governor on Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592ef5fa2100002a006fea8c.jpeg?cache=B3RTJwaknH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former NAACP President Ben Jealous is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor of Maryland, the civil rights leader announced in Baltimore on Wednesday.Jealous, 44, is the second Democrat to jump into the race against incumbent Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, a relative moderate up for re-election in November 2018. Alec Ross, a 45-year-old technology entrepreneur and former adviser in the Barack Obama administration, announced his candidacy in April.Hogan boasts a high approval rating in the state, but a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll from March showed him leading a hypothetical Democratic challenger by just 4 percentage points among registered voters.Jealous’ candidacy is liable to nationalize the primary, turning it into yet another proxy war between the party’s progressive and establishment wings. Jealous endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 presidential election and now sits on the board of the campaign legacy organization Our Revolution. But during his campaign announcement outside Baltimore Blossom Studio, a floral shop his cousin opened after civil unrest in the city in 2015, he trained his fire on Republicans, claiming Hogan has failed to stand up to President Donald Trump.“Every week our governor becomes a little more like the lion in ‘The Wizard of Oz’: all strength and no political courage,” Jealous said. “We have for 50 years, as progressives as civil rights activists, bemoaned the transfer of power from the federal government to our states,” he added later. “But in this moment, when extremists are running our federal government, let’s just celebrate what is, make full use of the power we have and move our families forward together no matter what they do in Washington.”Hogan said ahead of the election that he wouldn’t vote for Trump, claiming he was “not pleased with the candidates in either party.”Since the inauguration, however, Hogan hasn’t been as antagonistic toward the administration as his Democratic peers in other states. He appeared alongside Education Secretary Besty DeVos at a school in Bethesda in March, and ignored a request by the state’s Democratic attorney general to challenge Trump’s travel ban. Maryland’s Democratic legislature subsequently empowered the attorney general to pursue lawsuits without the governor’s approval.Hogan also announced last week that he plans to veto paid sick leave legislation, a move that rankles liberal activists in the state.Jealous is running on a firmly progressive platform of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, ensuring quality teachers in every classroom, reducing student debt, protecting the Chesapeake Bay, investing in clean energy, ensuring affordable health care and upgrading public transportation.He said he plans to pay for new investments with such tactics as closing corporate tax loopholes and reducing the state’s incarceration levels.Jealous addressed both police brutality and rising levels of violent crime, two issues that have scarred the city. “We will cut the murder rate,” he said. “We will lock up the shooters.”“And we will restore trust by both better training officers, but also, yes, by also holding officers who kill unarmed civilians fully accountable,” he added, eliciting loud applause from those assembled to support him.Jealous is a partner at Kapor Capital, a venture capital firm in Oakland, California, that focuses on socially progressive investments. In his remarks on Wednesday, Jealous suggested his experience there equipped him to attract investments from tech companies that might want to diversify their workforces, because Maryland boasts a high rate of black scientists and engineers.In 2008, 35-year-old Jealous became the youngest person to ever lead the NAACP. Over the course of his five-year tenure at the organization, Jealous presided over significant membership and revenue growth, registered hundreds of thousands of voters, and participated in successful fights to ban the death penalty in Connecticut and Maryland.Jealous was born and raised in California, but his mother hails from Baltimore and he frequently visited his grandparents there. His parents met in the city, but they couldn’t get married there because his father is white and Maryland prohibited interracial marriage until 1967.Jealous is likely to become the progressive favorite in the race, thanks in no small part to his work on behalf of the Sanders campaign and Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison’s bid for chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee.The national office of Our Revolution, which live-tweeted Jealous’ announcement, has said it will base its endorsement in the race on who its Maryland chapter supports. ”I am glad to see a life-time organizer with a track record of advancing civil rights and equality for the people who need it most in this country pose a REAL challenge to the status quo,” Winnie Wong, co-founder of the People for Bernie, said in an email. Wong is also a chief organizer of the People’s Summit, a national gathering of progressive activists in Chicago later this month at which Jealous is scheduled to speak. Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), former Attorney General Douglas Gansler, Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker, Baltimore County executive Kevin Kamenetz, Baltimore attorney James Shea and state Sen. Richard Madaleno are all reportedly considering running for Maryland’s Democratic gubernatorial nomination."

Hugh Barry shot Deborah Danner in her apartment in October.,2017-05-31,"A NYPD sergeant fatally shot, Deborah Danner, a 66-year-old woman who suffered from mental illness, in her apartment last October.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592f002e2300003b00348045.gif?cache=1B2LpePidM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A New York City police sergeant was arrested and charged with second-degree murder on Wednesday for the fatal shooting of a 66-year-old mentally ill woman in her apartment last year.Sgt. Hugh Barry, an eight-year NYPD veteran, responded to a 911 call on Oct. 18 regarding an emotionally disturbed person in a Bronx apartment building. Minutes later, police say officers found a distressed Deborah Danner, who’d previously written about her struggles with schizophrenia, clutching a pair of scissors in a hallway.When Barry ordered Danner to drop the scissors, she instead retreated into her apartment. Barry followed her in, and eventually convinced her to put down the scissors. But police say Danner then picked up a baseball bat and swung it at Barry. Barry claims he feared for his safety and responded by opening fire on Danner, striking her twice in the torso. She died at a nearby hospital a short time later.In addition to second-degree murder, a Bronx grand jury also indicted Barry on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Wednesday afternoon and was released on $100,000 bail.Barry is currently suspended without pay, an NYPD official told The New York Times.“I want to express my condolences again to the Danner family for the heartbreaking loss they have suffered,” said Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark in a statement. “The men and women of the NYPD protect and serve us, and face the possibility of danger every time they respond to calls of emotionally disturbed persons, domestic violence incidents and other crises. They answer thousands of these calls each year without incident. I hope that measures will be taken to prevent another tragedy such as this.”In his statement, Clark also claims “Barry did not avail himself of other options before using deadly physical force.”If convicted of murder, Barry could face up to life in prison.City and police officials were quick to criticize Barry’s handling of the confrontation. The day after the shooting, Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) admitted that the sergeant had not followed proper protocol for dealing with individuals suffering episodes of mental illness. He added Barry shouldn’t have approached Danner without the support of officers specially trained to handle such situations. De Blasio also questioned why Barry hadn’t used his Taser.“Deborah Danner should be alive right now. Period,” de Blasio said. NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill responded swiftly after the incident by stripping Barry of his badge and gun. Barry had been sued twice before for alleged excessive force.“That’s not how it’s supposed to go. That’s not how we train, our first obligation is to preserve life,” said O’Neill a day after the shooting. “What is clear in this one instance, we failed.” Barry is white, and Danner was black. The October shooting touched off another round of protests from activists who saw Danner’s death as part of a pattern of police being too quick to use lethal force on mentally ill individuals, and especially those who are people of color. Barry is the third police officer so far this year to be charged with murder or manslaughter for a fatal on-duty shooting, Philip Stinson, an associate professor of criminology at Ohio’s Bowling Green State University, told HuffPost. According to his data, a total of at least 82 officers across the country have faced murder or manslaughter charges for on-duty shootings since the beginning of 2005.Just 29 of those cases have ended in conviction, though a number are still pending. Among those was NYPD officer Peter Liang, who was convicted of manslaughter in 2016 for the killing of 28-year-old Akai Gurley in the stairwell of a Brooklyn apartment building in November 2014. In a statement Wednesday, the New York City Sergeants Benevolent Association came to Barry’s defense, calling the charges an “absolutely travesty of justice.”The union, which had previously criticized de Blasio and O’Neill for publicly criticizing Barry, said their comments had “poisoned the well” in favor of an indictment.“They did not just throw Sgt. Barry under the bus; in the court of public opinion, they ran him over with a steam roller,” read the statement posted on social media.The New York Times highlighted that Danner’s previous essay on living with schizophrenia called for improving the way law enforcement interact with people with mental illness.“We are all aware of the all too frequent news stories of the mentally ill who come up against law enforcement instead of mental health professionals and end up dead,” Danner wrote. “We should all be aware that these circumstances represent very, very serious problems that need addressing.”"

She says that, because she is a member of India’s Dalit caste, the village chief gives her only a portion of the monthly rice allowance that the government allocates to the poorest families in Jharkhand. “We are facing discrimination,” she says. “We are getting only 9 kilograms (20 pounds) of rice per month while other [castes] are getting 30 kilograms (65 pounds). The poor people will die. The authorities want to kill us off by starving us.”Many women suffer from anemia due to malnutrition in Harijan Mahala, the colony in Satbarwa, Jharkhand state, where Panpati and other Dalits live segregated from other castes.Mahatma Gandhi referred to them as “Harijans” or “Children of God,” but Dalits have traditionally been viewed within India’s caste system as “untouchables” and have long suffered discrimination and abuse. Although the practice of “untouchability” was abolished under India’s constitution in 1950, it is still rife. Dalits remain among the country’s most impoverished and exploited people.In many parts of the country, Dalits continue to exist in a system of modern-day slavery and bonded labor, performing degrading tasks such as manual scavenging, removing dead animal carcasses or cleaning the streets. They also face ostracism and humiliation from members of upper castes. “They don’t allow us to enter any house, and we are not allowed to sit [with them],” says Rubymalik, a 16-year-old girl from Bihar who now lives across the border in Barmajhiya, Nepal. “We are the same, we are all human beings, we are the same blood. So when the upper caste dominates, it feels bad.”The combination of low social status and gender makes Dalit women one of the most vulnerable groups in Indian society. According to Human Rights Watch, there are nearly 100 million Dalit women living in India, and the National Crime Records Bureau has found that four are raped every day.A journey across South Asia to document the lives of Dalit women captures a range of circumstances, simple joys and almost daily heartbreak – united by unwavering resilience and dignity.“Whether he is blind or not, I still have to do all the work,” Hasina, 63, says of her husband. Hasina and her family are Muslims living among Hindu Dalits in Panipat, Haryana, a village located directly next to the highway. Hasina’s husband lost his sight due to old age. She says his anger and aggression has increased since he went blind.Megha Kumari, 9, is massaged by her mother and other villagers after she lost feeling in her legs following a seizure. Households in the village of Harijan Mahala in Jharkhand do not receive their full rations of rice due to discrimination, villagers say. Most households in the village have at least one female family member who suffers from anemia, which leads to a range of medical complications.Nanpatiya Kumar, 41, plays with Jyoti, her neighbor’s baby, in the village of Kolodohar, Jharkhand state. Nanpatiya lost her husband three years ago when he succumbed to a long-term respiratory illness. She couldn’t afford a doctor to help him. “If my husband had been here, I wouldn’t worry so much,” says Kumar, who has five children. “Now I worry about the kids all the time. How will I get them married?” In Kolodohar, even women who haven’t lost their husbands often find themselves caring for their families alone, as many men have migrated to other states for work.A girl from the Dalit village of Harirajpur, in Odisha, chases a kite on the dried-up Mahanadi riverbed. This is the primary source of water for many villagers, who, living in one of India’s poorest states, bear the brunt of the dry season by having to walk long distances to retrieve drinking water.Though the caste system originated in India, it has spread across South Asia affecting the lives of millions who remain “untouchables.” Taramalik, 22, her husband Surajmalik, 25, and their children live in Bhokraha, Nepal. Taramalik and Surajmalik were both born into a pig farming sub-caste of Dalits named “Doom,” and were married when they were just four and seven, respectively. Taramalik is originally from Bihar, India, and like many others of her caste, she crossed the border into Nepal because of her arranged marriage.Darshani, 41, prays in her home in Bhapur, in India’s Haryana state. “I bought the gold I wear for myself … and I own this house,” she says. After two years of physical abuse by her alcoholic husband, Darshani left for her mother’s village, took out a loan and did agricultural work to build her own life and raise her two children.

Just 17 percent label the media friendly and 13 percent view it as an ally, with 26 percent not sure.Those figures are similar to the ones in the February poll.The latest survey follows a string of recent anti-press incidents. Four journalists were either manhandled or arrested while reporting in May, and a Kentucky newspaper’s windows were shattered.Trump, who often lashed out against journalists during his presidential campaign, has continued to do so as president. On Wednesday afternoon, his campaign texted backers a fundraising appeal including the phrase, “FAKE NEWS is the enemy.”As noted in February, the rating scale ― ally, friendly, unfriendly, enemy ― is one YouGov typically uses to measure Americans’ views of foreign countries rather than the Fourth Estate. But the metric seems newly appropriate for domestic use given Trump’s attitude toward the press, as well as record levels of political animosity.Indeed, 49 percent of Republicans consider the Democratic Party to be the “enemy,” while almost the exact same number of Democrats ― 48 percent ― say that about the GOP.As for attitudes toward Trump, 40 percent of Americans consider him an ally or a friend to people like themselves, with 16 percent considering him unfriendly and 27 percent an enemy.Ill-feelings from the contentious election linger, with 86 percent of Trump voters saying Hillary Clinton voters are either the enemy of people like themselves or unfriendly. Among Clinton’s supporters, 81 percent apply one of those characterizations to Trump voters.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 26-27 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

(You can watch it above.)WARNING: The song is aggressively catchy and will lodge itself in your head for days on end. Seriously. Like, no joke.Why is Gadlin willing to go to such extreme lengths, such as including crudely animated cartoon animals in his video, just to sell 1,000 raccoon penis bones?Apparently because no one believes he can actually do it. Not his family, not his friends and certainly not anyone who’s not in the market for a raccoon penis bone.Gadlin has a whole bag of them just in case he can hit the magic number. He even promises to send them in a plastic tube, presumably for that certain je ne sais quoi.Can you say no to a face like this? (You don’t have to answer. It’s a rhetorical question). Gadlin doesn’t seem to care exactly what his potential customer base does with the raccoon penis bones, but notes that some people “turn them into earrings, necklaces, and other forms of jewelry” and sell them on Etsy.So far, the world isn’t exactly jumping to buy Gadlin’s 1,000 raccoon penis bones: He originally attracted only $360 toward his $19,000 goal, only to have Kickstarter pull the campaign.Now he’s starting at ground zero on IndieGogo.However, the campaign runs until August 1 so maybe he has time to convince 1,000 Americans to purchase his raccoon penis bones.This story has been updated to reflect that Gadlin moved his campaign to IndieGogo.

21,POLITICS,Trump Buys Into Putin Plan To Melt The Arctic,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/putin-trump-arctic-climate-change_us_592ecd03e4b09ec37c309105,Russia is moving ahead with drilling plans in the region.,2017-05-31,Russian President Vladimir Putin has grand plans for using the Arctic region to benefit his country.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592ed7872300002c00347f7b.jpeg?cache=IH1825mAIh&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON –- The genius of Vladimir Putin is that he makes his aims crystal clear, as clear as a block of ice in the Arctic. Ice and cold have always defined and limited his vast country. For centuries the chief Russian geopolitical imperative was the search for “warm-water” ports to its south. Now the grand aim is to allow global climate change to melt the Arctic and turn the water at the top of the world into a lucrative oil and gas field, as well as a network of efficient new sea lines Russia will control.Putin, in essence, is gaining U.S. backing for his vision as his pal, President Donald Trump, signals that America will withdraw from the Paris Agreement on combating climate change.The Russian leader has made no secret of his plan. In fact, he has proclaimed it from the literal rooftop of the world, most recently at a conference on the future of the Arctic region in March. “Climate change brings in more favorable conditions and improves the economic potential of this region,” Putin said told CNBC while attending the International Arctic Forum in Arkhangelsk, Russia. “Today, Russia’s GDP is the result of the economic activity of this region.”Russia planted a flag on the floor of the Arctic Sea in 2007 and claimed most of it based on an extensive continental shelf beneath.Exxon Mobil ― notwithstanding its official support for the Paris accord ― and Russia have extensive plans to drill in the Arctic. But so far even the Trump administration has been unwilling to lift sanctions on those projects imposed after Russia invaded the Ukraine.But Russia has other places and other partners in the region, and is racing ahead with its drilling plans. And it is probably only a matter of time before Exxon Mobil and its allies get a sanctions rollback. The Russian military, meanwhile, is rapidly expanding land and sea forces in the Arctic region in what Putin hopes will be new short-cut routes to Europe.“We see what the Russians are up to,” a top European diplomat in Washington told HuffPost in an interview, speaking on background to avoid confronting the administration by name. “It seems to us that President Trump wants Putin to succeed. Maybe we will get cheaper gasoline, but at what cost to the world?”"

Democrats have their best opportunity this year to flip a seat from red to blue, a move that would bolster the Donald Trump resistance and give the party unified control of the Garden State’s government ― a distinction it currently holds in only six states.The June 6 party primaries have largely been eclipsed by contests in other states, however. Special elections in Kansas, Montana and Georgia, as well as the Virginia gubernatorial race, have drawn more news coverage. The four Democratic primary contenders have contributed to the problem by struggling to differentiate themselves from one another on policy.“I think all four candidates have said basically the same thing. They have essentially the same broad principles; they each say it slightly differently,” said Catherine Riihimaki, a member of Indivisible Garden State Values, a grassroots resistance group in the state.The front-runner in the Democratic primary, Phil Murphy, is a onetime Goldman Sachs executive and a former U.S. ambassador to Germany in President Barack Obama’s administration. The 59-year-old millionaire has the backing of much of the Democratic establishment ― including Biden, who recently stumped on his behalf. Murphy is liked by the unions, an influential constituency in the state. He also holds a massive cash advantage: The candidate has poured at least $20 million into his campaign so far. (On Wednesday, in a sign of confidence, Murphy’s campaign announced he will participate in the state’s public financing program if he wins the primary, which would limit his spending for the Nov. 7 general election.)A poll conducted by Stockton University last week found Murphy leading his nearest Democratic competitor by a 3-to-1 margin. On the Republican side, New Jersey Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, Christie’s favored successor, leads Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli by a similar margin. The Democratic nominee is expected to hold an advantage over the Republican in November, partly because of the drag that Christie’s unpopularity has had on the GOP field and partly because the state favored Democrat Hillary Clinton by a wide 14-point margin in the presidential election last year.The fact that New Jersey Democrats are coalescing around a wealthy banking executive so soon after the fall of Jon Corzine, a Goldman Sachs executive turned politician whose one term as governor was derailed by a widespread corruption scandal in 2009, is a little surprising. However, the state is home to many Wall Street executives.Murphy’s competitors have seized on his banking background in hopes of appealing to supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). An ad released last week by attorney Jim Johnson, a distant second in the Stockton University poll, ripped Murphy for making his fortune “in a rigged system” and blasted state Democrats for lining up “with Murphy and his millions.” State Assemblyman John Wisniewski, another candidate in the Democratic primary who chaired Sanders’ New Jersey presidential campaign, blasted Murphy as “a Goldman Sachs banker masquerading as a progressive” in an email to supporters earlier this year.That line of attack has not proved very effective. Sanders’ son, Levi, has endorsed Murphy. Democrats and activists in New Jersey who spoke with HuffPost this week also described Murphy as the real deal, a fresh voice with progressive credentials who would bring change to the government in Trenton.“He didn’t just wake up and decide he wants to be governor. He’s been in the field for the last three years,” as a community organizer, said Lizette Delgado-Polanco, the vice chair of the New Jersey State Democratic Committee. “He’s not a Johnny-come-lately. He has been working in our communities.”Riihimaki, too, said that concerns about how Murphy made his money years ago are overblown.“He’s gotten a lot of grief for having been professionally successful. I’m uncomfortable with labeling someone as corrupt or greedy just based on where they worked,” she told HuffPost.Johnson, the underdog in the primary, would become the state’s first African-American governor if elected in November. The former Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration, who has a compelling personal history, has built his campaign around the themes of social justice and economic equality. In an interview with HuffPost this week, the 56-year-old former criminal attorney said he would be the best choice to bring New Jersey out of the Christie era and join Democratic governors in pushing back against the Trump administration’s assault on immigrant rights and criminal justice reform.“The state needs an advocate as well as an executive,” he said, citing his experience helping prosecute men who were burning churches across the South in the 1990s.Johnson also said lawmakers in Washington should begin impeachment proceedings if an independent review by former FBI Director Robert Mueller, with whom Johnson is acquainted, finds Trump obstructed justice in urging the FBI to end its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.“If after an independent review the findings are such … then that would be an appropriate course of action,” he said. “It has to be a process ― and very clear that it has been fair.”Christie’s failed tenure looms large in the GOP race. Ciattarelli has attacked Guadagno for her proximity to the governor, and with good reason. A survey from Quinnipiac University released earlier this month showed Christie with a shockingly low 18 percent approval rating.“Seven years with him have done a lot of damage to her,” said Delgado-Polanco. “He ruled by a strong arm, and he really did not let her shine during his reign. It’s very difficult for people to forget that.” Guadagno will likely look to distance herself from Christie by embracing another brash voice with ties to Atlantic City: former real estate mogul and casino owner Donald Trump. The lieutenant governor said last week she’d welcome the president to campaign with her in the general election.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said only two states’ governments were held by Democrats. There are six states in which Democrats control the governorship and both houses of the legislature."

It had been left in an exhibit on segregation, Smithsonian spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas told HuffPost.Two of the visitors who discovered the noose “were very upset,” St. Thomas said. The gallery was “closed pretty quickly” and remained closed for about an hour. It’s the second time in less than a week that a noose has been found on or around museum grounds on the National Mall. Last Friday, a noose was hanging from a tree outside the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, St. Thomas said.“We don’t know how long that was there,” St. Thomas said of Friday’s discovery. “It was in a public space outside, but this [newly discovered noose] was obviously intended to be in the segregation exhibition.” In an internal email to staff obtained by HuffPost, Secretary of the Smithsonian David Skorton said he must “again share with you some deeply disturbing news” about Wednesday’s incident.“The Smithsonian family stands together in condemning this act of hatred and intolerance, especially repugnant in a museum that affirms and celebrates the American values of inclusion and diversity,” Skorton wrote.St. Thomas said the museum has “full security,” including metal detectors and bag screening. But a small noose would not have set off any immediate alarms, she said.The U.S. Park Police are now investigating the incident.“We will not be intimidated,” Skorton wrote in his email. “With new urgency, we will tell the story of our nation and all its people. We will continue to fight this sort of ignorance with knowledge. Cowardly acts like these will not, for one moment, prevent us from the vital work we do. We will remain vigilant and, in spite of these deplorable acts, we will become a stronger institution for all Americans.”"

This is where Lebanon holds radicalized criminals, where suicide bombings have allegedly been planned. It has been called an “operations room” for the so-called Islamic State by the country’s own interior minister. When Lebanese sisters Maya and Nancy Yamout first began interviewing convicted jihadists in the prison, they aroused confusion and suspicion among guards and prisoners alike.The Yamouts’ interest began with a university project, but it took the support of the former minister of justice to get them inside Roumieh. It was unheard-of for two young women, even professionals, to attempt such a project. The sisters are forensic social workers, which means they tackle issues relating to law and legal systems, such as recommendations about mental status, child custody or neglect. “It was strange for ISF [Internal Security Forces] to see us in prison … [we] were asked, ‘Why do you want to do this? Go pick another topic,’” Maya says. Even the ISF guards who helped them showed no interest in their interviews.Seven years on, after a Masters thesis about The Role of Forensic Social Work in Terrorism and its impact on society, the pair have become prison regulars. Apart from lawyers and family members, the sisters are the only civilians the Block B prisoners meet. They regularly interview more than 70 inmates – about 10 percent of the block’s total population – from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Turkey, Russia and Sudan. Roughly half are said to have been deradicalized, and are finishing their prison time. Prisons are key recruiting centers for radicalization, putting Maya and Nancy into a potential cauldron of violent extremism.For the two women in their late 20s, gaining the confidence of Block B prisoners, many of whom fear retribution from other inmates for speaking, was no easy task. But Maya and Nancy say they use the same techniques as jihadist recruiters: trust, respect and empathy. In some cases, their gender was an advantage. Nancy says: “We reminded them of their own sisters or mothers.”Instead of cigarettes, the pair bring in trays of maamoul biscuits with fruit or nuts. “The sense of smell is very evocative and powerful,” says Nancy. “Cigarettes will remind the prisoner of jail, jihad and the guards interrogating them; sweets will bring them back to their family life before jihad.”Through their interviews with the men in Roumieh, the sisters gained a unique insight into the multiple roles women have in maintaining and propagating the extremist ideology, and how they can play a vital part in deradicalization. “Women are key in continuing the ideology, they have an active role in ISIS, although it does not come out in the propaganda,” Nancy says.The public perception of women in ISIS is generally limited to the all-female al-Khansaa brigade, known for its snipers and skills with IEDs, along with the many accounts of “ISIS brides.” But far from acting solely as “wives,” the women who support ISIS often help with logistics and smuggling jihadists from one place to another.Such was the case with Jumana Hmayed – the only woman the two social workers interviewed directly. She was jailed for transporting bomb-rigged cars into Lebanon and was freed as part of a 2015 prisoner swap for kidnapped Lebanese soldiers. In her case, the real motivation was financial, according to the sisters.According to Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, women who join these extremist organizations think they are being progressive. They see themselves as “part of a social movement. They are dedicated to the cause and really believe in it.”He cites the example of Marika Salouit, who was recruiting women through the Nymbar al Jihad website in Afghanistan. But women’s role is not confined to recruiting others of their gender: They also play a part in shaming men to join.There is no official estimate of the number of women who have joined ISISor al-Qaida, but Dalia Ghanem-Yazbeck, author of “The Female Face of Jihadism,” puts the number at roughly 550 western female jihadists, and thousands from the Middle East and North Africa. “In Tunisia alone, 700 are believed to have joined ISIS while in the West the French and British constitute the highest contingent,” she says.As mothers, sisters and wives, women help to spread jihadist ideology. And ISIS fighters have noticed. They specifically appeal to women to join, making war appear glorious and trivializing violence. Umm Ubaydah, allegedly a Western woman in Manbij, “gives advice” to other women planning on travelling to Syria to join ISIS, where “their contribution comes in the home and through reaching out to other women online,” New York magazine reported.Dr. Yazbeck expects “women’s role as recruiters and facilitators is going to continue, and is currently evolving on the battlefield.” She cites recent incidents involving female snipers seen in Sirte, Libya, as well as in Mosul, along with the foiled attack on the Notre Dame in Paris last September.As ISIS suffers losses in the battle for Mosul, it is reaching into new territory for support. “ISIS are now trying to lure women nurses and doctors to join them; they need these people now with these skills on the battlefield in Mosul,” Aymen Dean, a former al-Qaida recruiter turned informant to British intelligence, told Syria Deeply.He also explained how the real recruiting is now done via video sharing, not on Facebook or Twitter, and via one-on-one phone apps such as Telegram or Whatsapp. Technology has increased the reach of recruiting exponentially, which only heightens the urgency of the job of in-person deradicalization by people like the Yamout sisters.“[ISIS] recruiters are extremely smart,” says Nancy. The ‘fishers’ in Lebanon, as she refers to them, are astute and know how to target multiple groups, which is why it is so difficult to stop them. Jihadist groups often become substitutes for gainful employment. But it’s not just about money. With weapons, the group offers the illusion of power, and with ideology offers an identity and sense of belonging. It’s a broad appeal that cuts across social classes.The motives of the interviewed individuals can be grouped into four categories: “psychopaths,” ethnic and geopolitical reasons, religion, retribution. Despite this broad range, the sisters can measure success in deradicalizing an inmate by observing changes throughout their interviews, Maya says.Though “in prison they can’t show they changed in an overt way because they are afraid that the prisoners might be abused by other fanatic inmates,” most released prisoners contact the social workers, giving them an opportunity to observe any real changes. So far, results from rehabilitating two prisoners and conducting group therapy for another four have been positive. But not every case is a success; Maya says some of the prisoners who contacted them did not want to change, and two such men returned to Syria and Turkey.The sisters’ successful cases, however, could play a key role in deradicalizing others by offering a voice to those who have deradicalized, Yazbek said. Returnees are seen as legitimate and they know how to talk to their own communities, she explained. Someone considering joining a jihadist group is more likely to trust a “returnee” than an institutional officer. Offering them a sense of purpose and a different option is key.The sisters’ work with people both before and after radicalization has highlighted the need to focus on those who have been successfully deradicalized. Armed with insights from years of interviewing prisoners in Roumieh, they founded Rescue Me, an NGO dedicated to crime prevention and combating radicalization, operating where the community needs them most, with teens and children in particular, and implementing programs targeting schools and dropouts.“We need to focus on the success stories and shed light on them. Not only on negativity, we must spread this knowledge,” says Nancy.This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

But despite dramatic obituaries for structures like Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and mounting concern that there’s limited time to save them, scientists say there is still hope for the structures.“We’re trying to get past the gloom and doom,” said study lead author Terry Hughes, director of Australia’s ARC Centre for Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. “There’s no shortage of people saying that 90 percent of the reefs will be dead soon. We’re trying to find a way forward.”“We can still have reefs in the future that will look OK in terms of supporting reef tourism and fisheries and the other benefits that they provide to people,” he added. “They’re just going to be very different ecosystems.”Hughes and his co-authors from organizations including the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, the Smithsonian Institution and the National Center for Atmospheric Research called for radical changes in the management and governance of the world’s reefs. This would include attempts to meet emissions targets that the Paris climate agreement set in 2016 to thwart the worst effects of climate change, diminish overfishing and reduce poverty around reef ecosystems.Global warming often garners the majority of attention, as it is by far the biggest threat to coral formations sensitive to even slight changes in temperature. But the paper’s authors say many reefs are also suffering “death by a thousand cuts.”“Reefs suffer simultaneously from dredging, over-harvesting, pollution, sewage, sediments and steadily increasing temperatures,” said Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute marine ecologist Jeremy Jackson, a co-author of the paper, in a statement.Human activity has already dramatically altered many of the planet’s coral reefs in recent years. Most recently, the Great Barrier Reef was hit with the worst mass bleaching event in history and researchers said up to 95 percent of parts of the reef had been affected. It was just the third mass bleaching event recorded and killed more than two-thirds of parts of the Great Barrier after the reef was baked in warm water for months.Scientists predict such events could happen with far greater frequency as climate change continues. The paper’s authors write the world now faces “a fundamentally different reality [where] it is no longer possible to restore coral reefs to their past configurations.”“A lot of people are still looking to preserve reefs to what they looked like in the past,” Hughes said. “We don’t think that’s feasible anymore ... We’re arguing that people’s behavior and how they interact with coral reefs needs to be addressed. The coral reef crisis is a crisis of governance.”The group points to recent efforts like those made by the Coral Triangle Initiative, a partnership between six governments in Southeast Asia and several environmental groups to craft a sustainable plan to save local reefs. Such efforts allow multiple stakeholders to address a problem bigger than any could tackle on its own.Hughes said that despite the terrifying news surrounding reefs in recent months, “they’re not doomed.” But time is of the essence and “there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity.”The group ended the paper with a call to persist in the conservation fight.“We should not give up hope for the persistence of Earth’s coral reefs,” the authors write. “To steer coral reefs through the next century, we will need to be bold, to embrace change and to recognize that securing essential services from coral reefs will require a new approach to science, management and governance.”"

But the paper’s authors say many reefs are also suffering “death by a thousand cuts.”“Reefs suffer simultaneously from dredging, over-harvesting, pollution, sewage, sediments and steadily increasing temperatures,” said Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute marine ecologist Jeremy Jackson, a co-author of the paper, in a statement.Human activity has already dramatically altered many of the planet’s coral reefs in recent years. Most recently, the Great Barrier Reef was hit with the worst mass bleaching event in history and researchers said up to 95 percent of parts of the reef had been affected. It was just the third mass bleaching event recorded and killed more than two-thirds of parts of the Great Barrier after the reef was baked in warm water for months.Scientists predict such events could happen with far greater frequency as climate change continues. The paper’s authors write the world now faces “a fundamentally different reality [where] it is no longer possible to restore coral reefs to their past configurations.”“A lot of people are still looking to preserve reefs to what they looked like in the past,” Hughes said. “We don’t think that’s feasible anymore ... We’re arguing that people’s behavior and how they interact with coral reefs needs to be addressed. The coral reef crisis is a crisis of governance.”The group points to recent efforts like those made by the Coral Triangle Initiative, a partnership between six governments in Southeast Asia and several environmental groups to craft a sustainable plan to save local reefs. Such efforts allow multiple stakeholders to address a problem bigger than any could tackle on its own.Hughes said that despite the terrifying news surrounding reefs in recent months, “they’re not doomed.” But time is of the essence and “there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity.”The group ended the paper with a call to persist in the conservation fight.“We should not give up hope for the persistence of Earth’s coral reefs,” the authors write. “To steer coral reefs through the next century, we will need to be bold, to embrace change and to recognize that securing essential services from coral reefs will require a new approach to science, management and governance.”"

He agreed to leave the U.S. in May, pending the outcome of his 9th Circuit appeal, according to court documents.“It was fully within the government’s power to once more grant his reasonable request,” Reinhardt noted. “Instead, it has ordered him deported immediately.”As a result of the government’s hardline stance, Magana Ortiz turned to the courts, hoping to get an order that would allow him to remain in the U.S. while his wife’s petition on his behalf was processed by immigration authorities. Under the law, however, there was nothing his court could do, Reinhardt said, which in turn became the catalyst for his judicial frustration.“In doing so, the government forces us to participate in ripping apart a family,” he wrote, adding that Magana Ortiz’s deportation would leave his American children — ages 20, 14 and 12 — with an impossible choice.“Moving with their father would uproot their lives, interrupt their educations, and deprive them of the opportunities afforded by growing up in this country,” Reinhardt continued. “If they remain in the United States, however, the children would not only lose a parent, but might also be deprived of their home, their opportunity for higher education, and their financial support.“Subjecting vulnerable children to a choice between expulsion to a foreign land or losing the care and support of their father is not how this nation should treat its citizens,” the judge added.The 9th Circuit, which is considering a Hawaii court ruling that blocked a revised version of Trump’s travel ban on certain Muslim countries, ultimately denied Magana Ortiz’s request, citing a lack of legal authority to intervene. The 9th Circuit is also the court that ruled in February against Trump’s original executive order restricting travel to the U.S. from the Muslim countries.Reinhardt didn’t let the constraints on his court in the Magana Ortiz case constrain him from penning a sharp rebuke of the president and his government.“President Trump has claimed that his immigration policies would target the ‘bad hombres,’” he said. “The government’s decision to remove Magana Ortiz shows that even the ‘good hombres’ are not safe. Magana Ortiz is by all accounts a pillar of his community and a devoted father and husband. It is difficult to see how the government’s decision to expel him is consistent with the president’s promise of an immigration system with ‘a lot of heart.’ I find no such compassion in the government’s choice to deport Magana Ortiz.”The judge’s entire opinion is worth reading. But it’s his closing paragraph that evokes the untold exasperation many judges and lawyers must feel in the area of immigration — where the law is deficient and often doesn’t match up with American ideals.“We are unable to prevent Magana Ortiz’s removal, yet it is contrary to the values of this nation and its legal system,” Reinhardt wrote. “Indeed, the government’s decision to remove Magana Ortiz diminishes not only our country but our courts, which are supposedly dedicated to the pursuit of justice. Magana Ortiz and his family are in truth not the only victims. Among the others are judges who, forced to participate in such inhumane acts, suffer a loss of dignity and humanity as well.”He concluded: “I concur as a judge, but as a citizen I do not.”"
36,POLITICS,Democrats Have Buyer's Remorse About Trump's Homeland Security Chief,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kelly-homeland-security-democrats_us_592da624e4b0df57cbfdc101,John Kelly just keeps carrying out some of the president's most controversial policies.,2017-05-31,Secretary John Kelly (right) says the law requires him to deport lots of people and there's nothing he can do about that.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592f27761400001f00480161.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When 37 Democrats cast their votes to confirm Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly in January, they did so in spite of heavy opposition to the policies he would be tasked to carry out: more deportations, a southern border wall and a travel ban targeting Muslims.Their hope was that the former Marine general would be a moderating influence on President Donald Trump and a better option than other names floated for the post. Kelly wasn’t known for being a virulent crusader against unauthorized immigration, and he had experience with Central and South America as former head of the U.S. Southern Command. He said in his confirmation hearing that he opposed a registry based on ethnicity or religion, which Trump once floated for Muslims.Four months later, some of the Senate Democrats who voted for Kelly are exasperated, disappointed and, in some cases, even wondering if they made a mistake. Arrests of non-criminal undocumented immigrants are up significantly, plans for a border wall are underway, and Kelly has joined Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions in framing immigration almost exclusively in terms of crime. He defended the now-blocked ban on refugees and most travelers from several Muslim-majority nations and joked with Trump about using a saber “on the press.”“I think the secretary has gone above and beyond even what the president’s dictates are and I’m disappointed in the way he’s acted,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who supported Kelly’s confirmation, told HuffPost.The senator said he wouldn’t vote for Kelly if he had the chance now.Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) voted for Kelly as well, but went on to publicly spar with him over the deportation of a Honduran mother and child who had been detained in Pennsylvania. Casey wouldn’t go so far as to say he regretted his vote, remarking instead that he would “try to work with Secretary Kelly and encourage him and the Administration to move in a better direction.”But the senator acknowledged that he’s frustrated by the administration’s decisions to deport children and families. His “hope that Secretary Kelly would be more evenhanded on enforcement ... hasn’t been borne out.”“The administration’s approach is not only wrong, but it also doesn’t make our nation safer,” said Casey via email. “When you talk to Secretary Kelly, he says he’s just following order[s] but he was confirmed to lead, not just to go along with some wrongheaded immigration approach that was cooked up during the campaign.”Kelly, more than most figures in Trump’s orbit, illustrates the stain that the administration’s policies can leave on an individual’s public standing. The secretary has been at the forefront of both the legally contentious travel ban and the highly controversial crackdown on undocumented immigrants. His willingness to defend both has given him a reputation as the kind, respected face of draconian initiatives.Kelly has chafed at such criticisms. He has argued that if agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection encounter people who are removable from the U.S., they must work to remove them. His officials have said that even people without criminal records and with longstanding ties to the U.S. can fit that category under the law and they won’t be exempt from removal, although they were often passed over under President Barack Obama.This focus on what the law broadly directs has come up repeatedly, including when Kelly responded to Casey’s call to stop the deportation of the Honduran mother and child.“I say it over and over again: If the laws are not good laws, then change them,” Kelly declared during a speech in early May. “Don’t call me, or Twitter or tweet, or go to the press with outrageous stories about how we do business or why we’re deporting somebody.”Homeland Security spokeswoman Joanne Talbot made the same point in a statement to HuffPost: “Secretary Kelly has said that if lawmakers do not like the laws they’ve passed and we are charged to enforce, then they should work to adopt legislation instead of asking DHS to ignore existing law and court orders. The Secretary— like all DHS law enforcement officers— has taken an oath to follow the Constitution.”Kelly “firmly believes that the policies adopted by the President to secure our borders and combat terrorism and transnational criminal organization are Constitutional,” Talbot said.Other Democratic senators still support for Kelly and say that some of their hopes for the secretary have been borne out, at least behind the scenes. At a hearing last week, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who voted for Kelly’s confirmation, told the secretary that he and many of his colleagues “are so proud that you have agreed to serve in this position, makes us all feel a lot better.”Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mt.) was similarly enthusiastic at that hearing.“When I voted for your confirmation, Mr. Secretary ― and I would do it again today ― I said you are one of the adults in the room that I am dependent on to make good decisions for this country’s security,” Tester said. “I still believe that.”Even one of the toughest critics of Trump’s immigration policies suggested that Kelly has been a moderating influence. At the time he voted for Kelly, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said he wouldn’t have backed him if the confirmation vote were “a referendum on President Donald Trump’s immigration policy.” Earlier this month, Durbin told HuffPost that behind the scenes, when senators have brought specific cases to Kelly, “he has dealt with them quickly and honestly, and that’s all I can ask.”Even as the controversies piled up, Durbin was willing to give the secretary a bit more leeway to make his mark.“I’ve maintained a closer-than-usual relationship with him and frequent conversation, and I think there have been forces within the administration which want to move him into a more radical position,” Durbin said. “Am I happy with everything he’s done? No. But I want to continue to work with him.” According to Democratic House members, Kelly has insinuated in private meetings that he helped save the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows some undocumented young people to stay in the U.S. Trump promised to end the program immediately and yet he still hasn’t. In March, Kelly repeatedly told House Democrats that he was the “best thing that ever happened to DACA folks,” Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.) said at the time.Kelly’s critics say no one should be surprised by the early results of his tenure. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) was one of 11 Democrats to vote against his confirmation. Her staff emailed other Democratic senators ahead of the vote to note that at his confirmation hearing, Kelly hadn’t committed to not sharing the personal information of DACA recipients with ICE or to shield them from deportation.She told HuffPost that those concerns persist today, as do concerns about the travel ban, standards for hiring border patrol agents and Kelly’s “ability to manage the department as it relates to giving clear guidance to the tens of thousands of people that work in that department about the policies of the administration writ large and his policies as the director of that agency.”Whether surprising or not, Kelly’s actions are disappointing to immigration reform supporters who had been cautiously optimistic about him. Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) said that Kelly’s experience with Central America should have given him “a better appreciation of the factors pushing refugees to flee the region and factors driving migration in other parts of the world.”“[B]ut there have been no indications of compassion, expertise, or cooperation coming from the DHS Secretary or his senior staff,” Gutiérrez said in an email. “DHS seems to wish Congress would just go away and stop asking them about what they are doing and why, which is not an option.”Immigrant rights advocates argue that Kelly is wrong to claim his hands are tied by the law. He has the discretion to avoid deporting certain people and focus on others, as previous homeland security secretaries did, said Clarissa Martínez-de-Castro of the National Council of La Raza. Thus far, she doesn’t think he has used it.“There was a sense that perhaps given his experience he would bring a more tempered approach to the issue of immigration and immigration enforcement,” Martínez-de-Castro said. “I think that based on what we’ve seen, now the question is whether he is a helpless executioner or a willing one of what are, at the very least, ethically questionable policies.”"

Parnell is due to square off against Norman, a conservative former state representative, on June 20, leaving him less than three weeks to pull off an upset.The special election to fill the seat vacated by White House budget director Mick Mulvaney will occur the same day Democrats hope to take control of Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, where Democrat Jon Ossoff is up against Republican Karen Handel, with polls showing him ahead but in a close contest. Parnell’s bid has received a fraction of the national attention and resources showered on the Georgia contest, which is on track to be the most expensive House race in history.The political fundamentals of the South Carolina district make it clear why Democrats are wary of jumping in the race with greater gusto. Although President Donald Trump won by less than 2 percentage points in Georgia’s affluent 6th District, he won by nearly 20 points in South Carolina’s 5th. Mulvaney modestly surpassed that margin with his landslide win in November.And in Montana, where Trump also won the state by 20 percentage points, Republican Greg Gianforte defeated Democrat Rob Quist by 6 points last Thursday despite being charged with assaulting a reporter the day before.The Republican hold on South Carolina’s 5th District is relatively recent, however. Mulvaney, who took the seat in the tea party wave of 2010, was the first Republican to represent the district since Reconstruction.Parnell is hoping that anger at Trump will energize Democrats, particularly the district’s sizable population of black voters, enough to drive up turnout in an off-year election where participation is normally low.The internal poll shows that 50 percent of the district’s Democrats believe the election is “more important than most elections,” compared with 26 percent of Republican voters.But Parnell is also betting that the passage of the Affordable Care Act replacement bill in the Republican-controlled House can help him win over some independent or even Republican voters.Fifty percent of voters in the district oppose the GOP bill to replace Obamacare, compared with 42 percent who support it, according to the campaign’s poll.Norman, who defeated a more moderate rival in a close primary, is an ardent proponent of Obamacare repeal and has said he would consider joining the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus if elected. (Mulvaney was a founding member of the group.)Parnell, by contrast, has campaigned against the Republican health care bill and backs safe importation of prescription drugs as a way to lower drug prices.The cerebral and soft-spoken Parnell hardly embodies the populist mood currently sweeping the Democratic Party; he most recently held a top post at Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs.But Parnell claims that his colleagues at the liberal bogeyman called him the “policeman” for his work overseeing financial compliance and that his deep knowledge of the tax code equips him to fight for reforms that would make corporations pay their “fair share.” In a new video advertisement released Tuesday, Parnell makes light of his wonkish disposition by contrasting himself favorably with Frank Underwood, the debonair, Machiavellian protagonist of the TV series “House of Cards,” whose fictional district resembles Parnell’s.Parnell mixes goofy, Underwood-style one-liners with actual facts about Trump’s presidency as the theme music of the Netflix show plays in the background.The ad concludes with text onscreen saying, “Archie Parnell is no Frank Underwood. And Washington shouldn’t be like ‘House of Cards.’” "

Although the adolescent birth rate in the United States has dropped by more than 60 percent in the past 25 years, it is still higher than that of most developed nations ― more than twice the rate of France, and five times that of Japan. Teen pregnancy also disproportionately affects young women of color. The vast majority of teen births ― 95 percent ― occur in developing regions, the report states, where populations are largely people of color.And in the U.S., according to the CDC, the birth rate for Hispanic teens in 2015 was more than two times higher than for white teens; for black teens, it was almost twice as high as for white teens; and for Native teens, it was more than one and a half times higher than the white teen birth rate.Asked why its video featured a white girl when far more young women of color are teen moms in the U.S. and around the world, Save The Children declined to comment on the record. This video is one of three the group released with its report on “Stolen Childhoods” ― the other two, on extreme violence and child labor, feature children of color.Save The Children’s U.S. section of its report concludes by calling for Congress to fund programs that support healthy and secure childhoods, from early childhood education to maternal and infant home visits.President Donald Trump has proposed several policies that affect girls and women’s access to reproductive health care worldwide, placing more girls at risk of early pregnancy. Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order reinstating the global gag rule, which blocks U.S. funding to international nonprofits that provide or advise on family planning and reproductive health services if these include abortion. Last week, Trump proposed a budget that would cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood, which provides contraceptives and other reproductive health care to women. This week, the administration is expected to roll back a federal rule that requires employers to cover birth control in health insurance plans at no cost to women, replacing it with a new rule that has alarmed civil liberties organizations and progressive advocacy groups.

Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order reinstating the global gag rule, which blocks U.S. funding to international nonprofits that provide or advise on family planning and reproductive health services if these include abortion. Last week, Trump proposed a budget that would cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood, which provides contraceptives and other reproductive health care to women. This week, the administration is expected to roll back a federal rule that requires employers to cover birth control in health insurance plans at no cost to women, replacing it with a new rule that has alarmed civil liberties organizations and progressive advocacy groups.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592ec75b2100002b006fe9cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ariel Winter isn’t about that unrealistic “beach body” ideal.The 19-year-old actress recently sat down with Refinery29 to discuss her role as Alex on “Modern Family,” how she’s dealt with critics in her rise to fame and her journey to self-acceptance and body love. The interview is part of R29’s new Take Back The Beach series, which debunks the dreaded notion that a woman needs a “beach body” (i.e. a thin body that conforms to often unachieavable standards of standards of beauty) in order to happily wear swimsuits in the summer. Winter told R29 that loving your body all the time is hard work and that’s OK; the beach “should be a safe space” either way, she said.“It’s hard to be positive about your body all the time,” she said. “I know because I’m honest about my insecurities that people think I’m 100 percent positive about my body all the time, but I’m not. I get really uncomfortable, too. But I just remind myself that this is the body I was given. This is who I am.” The “Modern Family” actress also spoke about body positivity in the context of the Trump administration. President Trump is notorious for objectifying women: He fat-shamed a former Miss Universe and called her “Miss Piggy;” he said that a woman must be attractive in order to be a journalist; and he’s also openly fat-shamed and criticized multiple famous women for their looks and weight. “Our leadership is really anti-women right now,” Winter told R29. “Thanks to Donald Trump, we’re being objectified and made to feel bad about ourselves, so I think it’s really important for women to stick together and do the opposite of that; to let their bodies be seen and be heard, and to empower each other; to remind each other that what they look like is not the only thing that’s important when it comes to who they are.”And unfortunately, the young actress knows all too well what it’s like to be objectified by critics. Winter has been the target of relentless body-shaming, whether it’s about wearing revealing dresses or her breast reduction scars.Winter told R29 that her 2015 breast reduction surgery helped her feel more comfortable in her skin. “When I got the breast reduction it helped me feel so much better about my body. I used to have full-scale meltdowns in bathing suit shops because there was nothing I could find to wear. I always felt like crap about myself,” she told R29. “... My best friend, she’s super tall and skinny and she’ll wear the same bathing suit as me, but people will automatically look at me and call me out as a slut or write headlines about ‘Ariel Winter’s cleavage.’ Meanwhile they look at her like, ‘Oh she looks so cute!’ But I’ve learned to not care about that as much. I’m comfortable in a bathing suit, scars and all.”Head over to R29 to read Winter’s full interview."

His administration intends to make clear, however, that Trump remains committed to the promise he made during the 2016 presidential campaign, though it will not set a specific timetable for doing so, officials said.Asked whether Trump would sign the waiver, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Wednesday:“Once we have a decision, we’ll put it out,” adding there would be “something very soon on that.”While there have been divisions among Trump’s aides on the issue, the view that appears to have prevailed is that the United States should keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for now to avoid angering the Palestinians, Arab governments and Western allies while the president seeks to nurture peace efforts.Trump avoided any public mention of a potential embassy move during his visit to Israel and the West Bank in May. Despite that, most experts are skeptical of Trump’s chances for achieving a peace deal that eluded other U.S. presidents.The status of Jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, a move not recognized internationally. Israel considers all of the city its indivisible capital.PRO-ISRAEL RHETORICThe Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Jerusalem is home to holy sites of the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions.Shifting the U.S. Embassy would be widely seen as Washington’s recognition of the Israeli position on Jerusalem’s status, which successive U.S. administrations have said must be decided in negotiations between the two sides.Former President Barack Obama renewed the waiver in December, setting off a six-month clock for Trump. CNN was first to report that Trump was expected to sign the waiver.On the campaign trail, Trump’s pro-Israel rhetoric raised expectations that he would act quickly to move the embassy. But after he took office in January, the issue lost momentum as he met Arab leaders who warned it would be hard to rejuvenate long-stalled peace efforts unless he acted as a fair mediator.Some of Trump’s top aides have pushed for him to keep his campaign promise, not only because it would be welcomed by most Israelis but to satisfy the pro-Israel, right-wing base that helped him win the presidency. The State Department, however recommended against an embassy move, one U.S. official said.“The president is still committed to moving the embassy,” one U.S. official said. “It’s not a question of whether but when it will be done.”The Jerusalem Embassy Act passed by Congress in 1995 mandating relocation of embassy to Jerusalem allows the president to waive the requirement in accordance with U.S. national security interests.(Reporting by Matt Spetalnick and Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Yara Bayoumy and Sandra Maler)"
42,POLITICS,Donald Trump Reportedly Plans To Withdraw From Paris Climate Deal,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-paris-agreement_us_592dae29e4b0c0608e8bb885,The U.S. would join Syria and Nicaragua in rejecting the historic pact to address global warming.,2017-05-31,"Then-Secretary of State John Kerry holds his 2-year-old granddaughter as he signs the Paris Agreement on climate change at United Nations Headquarters in New York City on April 22, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592ead942300002c00347f1e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, multiple outlets reported Wednesday. This would make the United States one of just three countries outside the historic pact to reduce planet-warming emissions. Trump pledged during his campaign to “cancel” the deal, but delayed a decision for months amid a split in the administration on the issue. But in recent weeks, the camp opposing the accord seems to have convinced the president to abandon it ― despite few political advantages and harsh economic and diplomatic consequences.Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that he will make an official announcement on the Paris agreement “over the next few days”:In exiting the deal, Trump would have the support of the 22 Republican senators who last week wrote him a letter urging him to do so. But he would also face rebuke from many members of the business and environmental communities who have said the agreement offers an opportunity for global cooperation and consistent climate policies.Under the terms of the deal, the U.S. cannot officially withdraw until November 2019. But even an announcement that the country is looking to leave the deal shows that the White House has no plans to meet earlier targets for slashing greenhouse gas emissions. That much was already clear. In March, Trump ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to review the Clean Power Plan ― a sweeping regulation passed by former President Barack Obama to limit emissions from the utility sector, by far the country’s biggest emitter. The policy was already stayed by the Supreme Court in February 2016 as a result of a lawsuit filed by former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who is now Trump’s head of the EPA. Without the Clean Power Plan, the U.S. wouldn’t even come close to meeting its goals laid out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Trump vowed to jumpstart the U.S. economy by eliminating environmental regulations he blamed for holding back companies. In particular, he positioned himself as a staunch advocate for fossil fuels, nixing climate change funding from his proposed budget and scrapping rules that discourage pollution and boost renewable energy. But, somewhat ironically, major oil, gas and coal companies ― along with a plethora of other big corporations ― urged Trump to keep the U.S. in the Paris Agreement. Environmental groups have little legal recourse given that the Obama administration bypassed the Senate to ratify the deal, arguing it did not constitute a treaty. But the Trump administration is still required to regulate carbon dioxide emissions as a public health threat under a 2007 Supreme Court ruling. How it plans to fulfill that legal responsibility that is unclear.Quitting the Paris Agreement strikes a major diplomatic blow to the U.S. Only war-torn Syria and Nicaragua, the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, are not included in the accord. Retreating from the agreement, which the U.S. took a lead role in brokering, brands the nation as a “rogue country” and a “climate pariah,” diplomats said. Without a seat at the table, the U.S. loses leverage over policy action on global warming, and cedes influence to rival superpower China, which has vowed to support poorer countries’ efforts to adapt to climate change.United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned on Tuesday that U.S. rivals such as China, Russia and Iran would “fill the void” on climate action if Trump chose to withdraw. “Who cares?” Myron Ebell, a top climate change denier who led Trump’s EPA transition team, told HuffPost on Tuesday. “If countries are moving in the wrong direction, I don’t think the leader of that movement has much to look forward to. It seems to me that President Trump has a chance to not only turn the direction of the country around but the direction of the world around. Good luck to China.”Yet few credible, peer-reviewed scientists believe manmade climate change isn’t a major problem, and a growing number of investors are already pouring money into transforming the energy economy.The economic effects of leaving the Paris Agreement would likely be devastating. The U.S. is poised to lose access to fast-growing clean energy markets as Europe, India and China gain major footholds in an industry estimated to be worth $6 trillion by 2030. Countries that tax emissions could now put a tariff on American-made imports, complicating Trump’s plans to reclaim the U.S. mantle as a top manufacturing hub.“It’s very clear that the energy economy is heading in a direction that, if you don’t engage with climate change, you’re going to miss out on a large number of jobs that have already emerged,” David Waskow, director of the World Resource Institute’s international climate program, told HuffPost on Tuesday. “Withdrawing and retreating would have very negative implications for the U.S. economically.”It’s unclear what Trump gains politically from the withdrawal. The deal had overwhelming support. Sixty-one percent of Americans said the country should remain in the deal, while just 17 percent support withdrawing and 21 percent aren’t sure, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted earlier this month. And more than 400 U.S. cities, 37 states, 800 universities and nearly half of all Fortune 500 companies have already set their own clean energy and emissions targets.This is a developing story and has been updated throughout.

I won’t miss it. It was the slowest and most scenic train I’ve ever taken in my life. Like climbing Everest, I suspect most everyone else who took it also did so because it’s there. Why else stay in that percolating rust-box for a full day? Flying from Nairobi to Mombasa takes less than an hour. Even driving, overland, just about eight hours. A very principled train, though, takes twice that, from 7:00 PM to 10:00 AM the next day. When I got on board at Mombasa on a Sunday evening, 24 hours before my flight home from Nairobi, I thought myself clever for padding the transit. Even if the train took twenty hours, I’d be fine. And it was just my luck, I was told, only the Sunday trains leave on time.At hour twelve on board, I realized my grievous mistake. We were still in Tsavo National Park. Just percolating. We hadn’t moved all night. I had to jump ship around 9:00 AM, near a small town called Kibwezi, and take a serious of matatus and buses until I reached Nairobi airport moments before the gate closed. I suppose I’ve released the dramatic tension here, so feel free to stop reading.The sunrise on the train was spectacular. The food in the dining car was not. A cloudy soup, yellow rice, and diffidently unspiced peas and carrots curry. I was seated with a Belgian man and his cherubic half-Tanzanian son. The former was a bore, lecturing me from soup to nuts on what Trump’s rise looks like to “the world,” which I guess he represented. Spare me, I thought (if you remember what life was like back then). I don’t deserve this conversation for some hiccup in the electoral system of the country my parents moved to 21 years ago.Those parents, I thought, could have moved anywhere. Even here! In fact, Indian-Kenyan laborers, picked up in one wing of the British Empire and dropped off in another, built much of the Lunatic Express at the end of the 19th century. And now a different kind of empire, the one realized by Chinese infrastructure, with a different Asian workforce, was directing the replacement railroad. Where was Kenya between these bookends?48 hours earlier I’d spent some long days in Nairobi National Park, where the new, China-funded Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) would (maybe?) slice through in its final phase. How could it still be unclear? Basically everyone except the Kenya Railway Commission was in the dark.The new line was supposed to take four and a half hours where the old one took eight. Based on the total hilarity of the latter number, I thought the SGR would do well to make the trip in 12ish. About four workers died for each mile of the Lunatic Express.The memorable tragedy was the man-eating lions of Tsavo, who snacked on laborers to no real effect until they unwisely scaled up to British management. Today’s SGR was apparently upsetting elephant migration routes. I wondered if they, too, might go rogue on interlopers. But elephants are vegetarian. It was all different.Speaking of which, the week I was there, the National Park was in a febrile state of excitement because they were going to burn a lot of ivory, as a symbolic rejection of the ivory trade. There were huge pyres of tusks and figurines in the heart of the park. The gesture, even though it wasn’t the first time, was elegant and powerful. But the universe has a way of correcting gestures, even ones that stand to save a lot of elephants.When I hightailed it off the Lunatic Express around 8:00 AM, in Kibwezi, I walked for an hour or so into town in the shadow of the SGR with a police officer. It looked sturdy. All triangles. Even the cement, somehow, had to be imported, 6000 metric tons, to get the ball rolling. They could have planned this better, everyone in Nairobi kept telling me. We have domestic cement, they said, but not on a few months’ notice.There is no economic or financial case for a new railway in East Africa, according to a World Bank report. Even among the dire predictions of that report, Kenya ended up choosing the most expensive option, and was long-outpaced the price estimates with over a year to go.Kenya Wildlife Service, one of the bodies that was not consulted in the railway plan, is, by one estimate, responsible for 75 percent of the country’s tourism revenue.“Where were we?” Paul Gathitu, KWS’s deputy director, asked me, rhetorically. “No one knows who makes these decisions.”I arranged to meet up at the park with an old Kenyan friend, from five years ago, who, in a remarkable coincidence, had spent the intermediate years as a mechanical engineering student whose last summer job was at - sing it - the China Road & Bridge Corporation. We trekked over to CRBC offices together where I met a supervising official who unsurprisingly refused to talk on the record and whose cigarettes, even, were Chinese. In two months, he said, the office would shut down and the campus, near the Northern Bypass, by repurposed. It was interesting that the M.O. of the world’s most ambitious infrastructure company was, in this sense, “leave no trace.”The railway will start running this June and I guess we’ll see who or what uses it. The land was already reclaiming the Mombasa train station when I was there. An abandoned carriage had become a de facto chicken coop. In time, the savannah will reclaim the Lunatic tracks too. And, let’s be real, in the next century, although no one can call my bluff on this, it will do the same to the SGR.Reporting for this story was made possible by the WITS China-Africa Reporting Grant.

For decades, even as the United States has steadily strengthened its ties, it has pressured Hanoi on political prisoners, religious liberty, and labor rights. But how can those efforts possibly continue in a Trump administration? Even if the administration cared about human rights, it now lacks credibility.For its part, Hanoi is interested in arms deals, and possibly a new bilateral trade agreement, with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) on ice. Most of Vietnam’s export market is tied to its neighbor China, and the government has been looking to hedge its position by improving ties with the US. (They are also negotiating a trade agreement with the EU and others.)But if Prime Minister Phuc thinks he will have a free ride in Washington, he may be in for a rude surprise. President Trump constitutionally leads on foreign policy, but Congress as always advises and consents, and can throw up roadblocks to closer US-Vietnam ties if members don’t like what they see. Congress must endorse trade agreements, and it can block arms deals.There is broad bipartisan concern in Congress about Vietnam’s troubling human rights record: it is an issue that unites members from both parties, and has brought together liberals and conservatives—from Senators Patrick Leahy to John Cornyn—to work together on legislation and resolutions. The Vietnamese-American community is active politically in the United States and has repeatedly and effectively pressed members to focus on Vietnam’s human rights record.This is the reality the Trump administration officials have to face: they may not want to promote human rights, but political realities demand that they must. US officials can present the realities like a middleman would in a negotiation: “Look, Congress needs to be won over if the US-Vietnam relationship is going to make any significant progress. Leaders in Congress have made it clear that your government needs to release prisoners, stop attacks on dissidents, and undertake legal reforms, or they will place limits on any agreements we might reach.”There are plenty of cases for Vietnam to address. There is the detention of dissident blogger Tran Huynh Duy Thuc, who is serving a 16-year prison sentence for his internet writings and attempts to form a group to promote democracy. The cases of religious activists Ngo Hao and Nguyen Cong Chinh, who are serving 15- and 11-year prison sentences respectively for their advocacy on religious freedom. There is lawyer Nguyen Van Dai, bloggers Nguyen Huu Vinh, Nguyen Dinh Ngoc, Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh (“Mother Mushroom”) and Ho Van Hai, and the longtime human rights advocates Tran Anh Kim and Le Thanh Tung.When US leaders raise names publicly, it can often lead to those prisoners being treated better in prison—and released sooner. That is reason enough to mention them by name.US officials should also raise concerns with the troubling rise in cases of harassment and violence against dissidents by so-called government thugs—widely assumed to be plainclothes government agents. Human Rights Watch has documented numerous cases in the last year of unidentified men in civilian clothing beating dissidents, vandalizing their property, and threatening them with impunity, sometimes in plain view of the official police.The Vietnamese government needs to hear that its record is a problem. After all, the Politburo, while generally retrogressive and recalcitrant, remains sensitive to criticism. The violence of plainclothes thugs is demonstrative: it suggests that the government may be trying to evade international criticism, as the use of thugs provides a measure of deniability, however implausible.And outside pressure can lead to concrete results. Take the now-defunct TPP. While highly problematic, the agreement contained provisions that would have compelled Vietnam to improve its labor record. Those provisions were there in large part because Congress pressed for them.President Trump’s apparent apathy about human rights aside, Congressional concerns about Vietnam’s record remain, and if there are to be trade agreements or arms deals, the government will need to undertake reforms and ease its persecution of dissidents.If nothing else, one positive outcome for this visit would be for Prime Minister Phuc to return to Hanoi and tell the Politburo that human rights issues are still a major topic in Washington. It is up to Congress to make sure that message is sent.John Sifton is the Asia Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch."
47,RELIGION,From Syria To Los Angeles: A Muslim Teen's Coming Of Age,"Morena Duwe, ContributorMusic & Culture Journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/from-syria-to-los-angeles-a-muslim-teens-coming-of_us_592dfe3fe4b075342b52c129,Rudayna Aksh and her daughter Dalya Zeno fled from Aleppo to Los Angeles in 2012 and moved in with Rudayna’s son Mustafa,2017-05-31,<p>Dalya at the LAX protests against the Muslim ban this past January</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592e03cf21000014006fe8a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rudayna Aksh and her daughter Dalya Zeno fled from Aleppo to Los Angeles in 2012 and moved in with Rudayna’s son Mustafa Zeno who had already been living and studying in the U.S. Because of a previous 10-year stint more than 20 years ago, Rudayna was already granted citizenship. Even as American citizens, however, this family still faced the many challenges that Muslim Americans encounter.Filmmaker Julia Meltzer’s new documentary Dalya’s Other Country follows Dalya Zeno, a teenage girl and self-proclaimed feminist who is adjusting to life in Los Angeles as the only Muslim in an all-girl Catholic school. Along with her older brother Mustafa and her mother Rudayna, we follow the family as they navigate their way through our starkly different culture.Dalya’s father, with whom she is very close, chose to remain closer to his Syrian roots by making a home in Turkey. Though he makes a few appearances in the film, his love for his family does not overpower his disdain for American culture. He and Rudayna separated before their exit from Aleppo and remain estranged. Mustafa then stepped in as the head of household, making his mother and sister his priority, taking on the responsibilities of a father at a young age. While each family member does play an integral role in the film, the main narrative is that of Dalya’s.Meltzer tells Dalya’s story by elegantly weaving together pieces of her life as a typical American teenager and her deep, ever-present Islamic values. As we get to know Dalya, we discover that she is a highly adaptable and intelligent girl who appreciates both the traditions of her culture as well as the frivolity of teenage existence in the U.S. While she indulges in standard high school activities such as playing basketball, socializing with friends and of course, prom, she holds on to her identity as a Syrian Muslim and feels no shame in displaying it.“I do not wear the hijab because I want to cover myself or protect myself from men,” says Dalya in a scene from the documentary. “What made me love my hijab is my life experiences; it was a constant reminder for me of who I am, where I’m from. It was a constant reminder to me that you don’t need to let your hair down or show your skin to be able to be beautiful.”Dalya’s Other Country began shooting in 2013 and was completed in early 2017. Dalya was just 14 in the beginning of the film and by the end, she is 18 and on the verge of graduating high school. While the documentary touches on the unavoidable topics of Muslim immigration and discrimination in a Trump-era political climate, the film as a whole embodies a coming-of-age tale.Though Dalya seems to adapt to the American lifestyle with ease, she still faces a unique set of struggles that only amplify her faith instead of diminish it. The 2015 Paris attack occurs during the film as well as Trump’s pre-presidential promise of banning all Muslims. Rudayna reacts with outrage and disappointment, as did many Muslims and liberals. Dalya, however, seemed to take a more levelheaded stance on Trump’s claim. Though she disagrees with the ban, she sees it as an empty promise. Dalya even jokes with her school friends about it as they discuss where Dalya will go if she gets deported because returning to Aleppo is no longer an option. Her friends affectionately tell her that she can go to Mexico with them and their families.“Donald Trump says stuff about every single nationality,” Dalya jokes in the documentary. “He doesn’t like Muslims, he doesn’t like Mexicans, he doesn’t like—who does he like? If he’s gonna kick us out, he’s gonna kick all of us out.”Meltzer’s film captures modern immigration issues through the eyes of a Syrian teenager who displays one of humanity’s most evolutionary attributes: adaptability. In a Catholic school, she does not pray to Jesus, but she does feel the presence of God. She goes to prom, but respects her mother’s rules and dresses according to her faith. And in the Trump-era, where Islamophobia is on the rise, she proudly wears her hijab, even when her own mother covers hers with a hat to protect herself from discrimination. Dalya is a feminist who loves her family and her religion and supports LGBT rights. She does not believe in some of the ways of her parent’s generation, especially those that pertain to women’s rights. She is the next generation of Islam and is dispelling the fear and preconceived notions that exist around her faith.Instead of propagating the Middle Eastern terrorist stereotype that is often found in Hollywood cinema, Meltzer is sharing Dalya and Rudayna’s stories of love, faith, and acceptance. While Rudayna is still very traditional in her customs, she is also a strong woman who quietly rebelled against the antiquated ways of her parent’s generation.“In our country, the woman is always the one to submit,” Rudayna tells Dalya in a scene from the film as they nostalgically pore over old wedding photographs. “He [Dalya’s father] often said: ‘I want a woman to be like dough, to mold however I want…die, die, live, live,’ she does whatever he says, and I couldn’t.”Dalya’s Other Country is a poignant expression of adaptation and acceptance. As Dalya, Rudayna, and Mustafa struggle to adapt, they also find acceptance in each other, themselves, and even in those who choose not to accept them. They are understanding, loving, and strong, and just the kind of Islamic role models that America needs.Dalya’s Other Country will be screening at the Los Angeles Film Festival on Saturday, June 17 at 1:20pm and will make its broadcast premiere on PBS’s series “POV” on Monday, June 26.

50,POLITICS,Trump’s Global Health Agenda Exposes Lies And Deception,"Serra Sippel, ContributorPresident, Center for Health and Gender Equity",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-global-health-agenda-exposes-lies-and-deception_us_592ed71ae4b00afe556b09fe,It is time to push Congress for a humane budget that shows the world that the U.S. cares about women and girls.,2017-05-31,<p>Protestors marched to the White House on International Women’s Day to resist Trump’s deadly global gag rule.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592ed8891400002700480002.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When it comes to the health and lives of women and girls, the president’s proposed global health budget is a death warrant: Zero funding for family planning and reproductive health, 10 percent less funding for HIV prevention and treatment, and what appears to be the elimination of the Commodity Fund, which provides life-saving male and female condoms that prevent sexually transmitted infections like HIV and HPV, as well as unwanted pregnancies.Yet, one week before the release of Trump’s proposed FY18 budget, the State Department included family planning and reproductive health as an international health program supported by U.S. global health assistance.The State Department’s announcement was made in a special briefing to the press on Trump’s expansion of the global gag rule – the notorious policy restriction on U.S. global health assistance that prohibits medical providers from using non-U.S. funds to provide information or services related to abortion, and from advocating for changes in local abortion laws.At that briefing, State Department officials listed the programs that would be impacted by Trump’s global gag rule. That the State Department would list family planning and reproductive health among health programs impacted by the policy when they knew such funding would be eliminated in Trump’s FY18 global health budget is deceptive.The State Department maintained that Trump’s global gag rule would apply to $8.8 billion in global health assistance (FY17), and that the policy was not a cut in global health assistance since funding for non-compliant groups would be redirected to compliant groups. What they failed to say is that the President’s proposed budget for FY18—which would be released one week later—would account for only $6.5 billion in global health assistance, which would be 26 percent less funding (with no funding allocated for family planning and reproductive health) that could be redirected.The State Department’s assurances that funding will simply be redirected to organizations that will comply with the global gag rule restrictions rings hollow. There has been no assessment of how many U.S. funded groups will be unable to comply with the new policy and if there even exists qualified organizations that could both comply with the policy and also carry out evidence-based programs on the ground.A common narrative that is embedded with wishful thinking is that the president’s budget is “dead on arrival,” a statement made by Senator John Cornyn and that has been repeated by many in the global development community. Yes, there is a ways to go in the budget process and Congress will have its turn to remedy much of the damage in Trump’s budget. But that should not diminish cause for concern or silence outrage over how the Trump administration is treating the health and rights of women and girls and other marginalized populations through its policies and funding.The twofold action of restricting all global health assistance and eliminating family planning and reproductive health funding reinforces what many global health advocates and experts know: Trump’s agenda has nothing to do with global health and everything to do with cutting off access to family planning and reproductive health services.An estimated 225 million women globally have an unmet need for family planning, meaning that they do not desire to have a child at this time, yet are not using effective contraception. This lack of access to family planning methods is a contributor to the preventable deaths of 303,000 women annually due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Additionally, according to UNAIDS, adolescent girls and young women aged 15-24 are at an increasingly high risk of HIV acquisition, comprising 20 percent of new HIV incidences among adults globally in 2015, despite accounting for only 11 percent of the adult population.This is not a time for advocates to scramble for crumbs from the table. It is the time to push Congress for a humane budget that shows the world that the U.S. cares about women and girls. They can start by fully funding a global health agenda that includes family planning and reproductive health and HIV prevention and treatment."
51,POLITICS,Michael Flynn Reportedly Plans To Hand Over Some Documents In Senate Russia Probe,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-flynn-senate-subpoena_us_592deceee4b0c0608e8c5127,He previously declined to cooperate with the investigation.,2017-05-30,Former national security adviser Michael Flynn walks through Trump Tower in New York City on Jan. 4. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592dee3c2100002b006fe85a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former national security adviser Michael Flynn allegedly plans to comply with a Senate Intelligence Committee subpoena of documents related to its investigation of the retired lieutenant general’s ties to Russia, The Associated Press reported Tuesday. Flynn plans to hand over documents from his businesses as well as some personal documents by next week, according to the report. The AP cited a source “close to Flynn.” Reuters also reported that Flynn’s representatives had informed the Senate committee that he plans to turn over some of the documents. NBC News also confirmed the report.Spokespeople for the committee’s chairman, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), and vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), didn’t immediately return requests for comment. Nor did Flynn’s attorney. The Senate probe is one of several investigations into whether President Donald Trump’s campaign team actively colluded with Russian officials to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. Flynn, who served as a national security adviser on the campaign, is also under FBI investigation due to his financial ties to Russia as well as his work lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government. Flynn was fired from his role in the Trump administration after it was revealed he lied about discussing sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak.In March, Flynn allegedly sought immunity in exchange for testifying before the groups investigating the potential collusion. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, said at the time that his client “certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,” but added that “no reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution.”Burr and Warner announced on May 10 that they would subpoena Flynn for documents related to their investigation after he declined to comply with an earlier request. Flynn again declined to cooperate, instead invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The heads of the Senate committee then took a different route: subpoenaing his businesses and documents, which they argued are not covered by the Fifth Amendment, and threatening to hold him in contempt if he did not comply.The Senate committee then voted to give its leaders “blanket authority” to issue any subpoenas related to the Russian investigation, essentially giving them a fast-track to seek information without first getting approval from their fellow committee members. Amid all of this, Trump has stood by Flynn. He’s repeatedly praised the general and claimed Flynn did nothing wrong aside from lying about his communications with Kislyak. And in February, he allegedly asked then-FBI Director James Comey to end his agency’s investigation of Flynn, telling Comey that Flynn is a “good guy.”CORRECTION: Due to an editorial error, this story initially misstated the first name of former FBI Director James Comey."

Unlike U.S. President Donald Trump, who met the pope last week, Trudeau and Francis agree that climate change is caused by human activity.“We talked about how important it is to highlight the scientific basis of protecting our planet and the moral and ethical obligations to lead, to build a better future for all people on this earth,” Trudeau said.At last week’s Group of Seven (G7) summit in Sicily, Trump refused to back a landmark international agreement reached in Paris in 2015 to reduce global warming.Trump said he would decide this week on whether to pull out of the accord, which was backed by his predecessor Barack Obama.Trudeau, who is Catholic, said he had “a deeply personal and wide-ranging, thoughtful conversation with the leader of my own faith”.(Reporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Tom Heneghan)"

Another 19 percent aren’t sure.Ninety-three percent of voters who supported Trump in last year’s election approve of how he handled the trip, compared to 14 percent of those who supported Hillary Clinton and 39 percent of those who supported a third-party candidate or didn’t vote. Trump declared himself pleased with the trip, announcing Saturday that “I think we hit a home run no matter where we are.” He was met with largely warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but received a chillier reception during his later stops. HuffPost’s S.V. Date reported:At the unveiling of a memorial at NATO headquarters to the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, Trump used the occasion to scorch America’s military allies for failing to spend as much on defense in recent years as Trump would have wanted. In his view, their failure to do so unfairly burdened U.S. taxpayers ― an opinion other NATO members do not share, a sentiment made clear by their facial expressions as he spoke.The poll was conducted last Wednesday through Friday, partially before the NATO and G-7 meetings.Perhaps more relevantly to Trump’s image domestically, the trip briefly pivoted the news cycle from questions about his campaign’s relationship with Russia, as well as the GOP’s unpopular efforts to repeal Obamacare. The trip also ushered in a relatively fallow period for Trump’s usually frenetic Twitter account.That may have helped to stanch Trump’s falling approval ratings after they hit a new low earlier this month. After a string of mid-March surveys found him with less than 40 percent approval, the latest round of surveys puts him largely back in the low 40s.Few Americans, however, indicated that they think Trump is well-respected abroad. Fifty percent say they don’t think leaders of other countries around the world have much respect for Trump, while just 29 percent believe he is internationally respected.In a March HuffPost/YouGov poll, 55 percent of Americans said that they did not believe Trump was respected abroad, with just 24 percent saying he held international leaders’ respect. That survey was taken just after Trump held a tense meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and claimed that British intelligence had helped to wiretap him.Three-quarters of Americans now say it’s somewhat or very important that other leaders respect Trump, with only 12 percent viewing it as mostly unimportant.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 24-26 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

But the event ruffled feathers, with far-right and anti-racism organizations calling foul after it came out that most of the event’s activities would occur in racially exclusive spaces. According to the event’s website, 80 percent of the activities at the festival will be reserved for black women; another will be dedicated to all black people, while a third component will be for all women of color. The last segment will be “open to all” races and genders. TeleSur reports the outcry began when organizations such as the far-right National Front Party and anti-racism groups like The International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) discovered the festival’s intention to only reserve one of its activities for all races. On Friday, LICRA tweeted that “Rosa Parks would be turning in her grave,” if she knew of the Nyansapo organizers’ decision to give black women a safe space to share in their experiences with marginalization. Needless to say, when Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo learned that white people would only be encouraged to attend a small percentage of the event’s activities, she attempted to halt the festival by calling police officials. A translated tweet from the mayor on Sunday revealed she took issue with the festival being “forbidden to whites” and that she would even consider prosecuting the event organizers for discrimination. But, after what she claimed to be a “firm” discussion with the Mwasi Collective, on Monday, the mayor said a “clear solution” was reached. Yet, TIME cites social media backlash condemning the mayor’s earlier tweets about the festival, as one of the reasons she retracted her stance. “The festival organized in a public place will be open to all. Non-mixed workshops will be held elsewhere, in a strictly private setting,” reads a translated version of one of Hidalgo’s tweets on Monday. Bu according to the Mwasi Collective, the set-up didn’t change as a result of a conversation with Hidalgo; they’d already intended for the “non-mixed” workshops to take place on private property. “After lying about the Afro-feminist festival ‘banning whites,’ [the] Mayor of Paris lied again, claiming she forced us to change the event,” a representative for the Mwasi Collective said in a statement sent to HuffPost. “We already planned to hold workshops for black women in a private space ― [the] mayor falsely [took] credit for our plan.” So, as of now, the Nyansapo Festival will go on as initially planned, and white fragility seemingly remains alive and well in the City of Lights.

56,HEALTHY LIVING,An Imperiled Indonesian Lizard May Hold The Key To Fighting Superbugs,"Rosalie Chan, HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/superbug-treatment-kimodo-dragon_us_592d8e54e4b053f2d2ae52f6,The animal has an unusual protein that could protect against complex infections.,2017-05-30,The military’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency is looking to “extreme animals” such as komodo dragons to find new ways to defend against infections.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592d97f42100002b006fe6c4.jpeg?ops=crop_6_187_3066_1861%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Komodo dragons, the 10-foot, 300-pound lizards found in Indonesia, do not bite humans unless attacked, but when they do, it can prove deadly. Not only is the venom in their teeth potentially fatal, they may also harbor bacteria in their mouths that is dangerous to their prey (typically, deer and pigs).The question of whether Komodo dragons deliver fatal bacterial infections to their prey when they bite has been somewhat controversial: A 2013 study, refuting previously accepted common wisdom, swabbed the mouths of 16 captive Komodo dragons and found they had less bacteria than other predators, such as lions. Nonetheless, Komodo dragons in the wild eat carrion and live in environments rich in bacteria yet rarely become infected, though local prey such as water buffalo do. And one reason may be because of a special resistance to dangerous bacteria in the form of cationic antimicrobial peptides, a type of protein that fights off harmful bacteria and that researchers have found in the animals’ blood.“Komodo dragons are known to harbor high levels of bacteria in their mouths. They don’t suffer from negative effects of bacteria in their own mouths,” said Barney Bishop, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor at George Mason University’s chemistry and biochemistry department. Using the peptide in the dragon’s blood as inspiration, the researchers designed a synthetic chemical called DRGN-1, which imitates Komodo dragon blood.As superbugs become more resistant to antibiotics, scientists are turning toward bioprospecting ― or looking to nature for potential medicines. In a recent study published in Biofilms and Microbiomes, researchers from George Mason University found an answer in Komodo dragons, which are native to Indonesian islands.“We thought the best place to look was animals that are known to thrive under adverse conditions,” Bishop said. Since the 1940s, antibiotics have reduced deaths from infectious diseases, but they’ve become so widespread that the bacteria the antibiotics are supposed to kill have adapted. Now, every year, at least 2 million people become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and at least 23,000 people die from their infection.The military’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency funded this research, hoping the team could look to “extreme animals” to find new ways to defend against infections. This could possibly lead to new drugs to fight superbugs and protect people from bacterial bioweapons.“We’re in an age of emerging antibiotic resistance,” said Monique van Hoek, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor at George Mason University’s National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases. “We think it’s very important to take these new approaches to discover new ways to kill bacteria. By going into nature, we’re finding a new starting point for this.”The team found that when DRGN-1 was used to treat infected wounds, these wounds healed significantly faster than untreated wounds or wounds treated with other peptides. That’s in part because DRGN-1 breaks down biofilms, a film of bacteria that sticks to a wound’s surface, which is not addressed by conventional antibiotics.“It both clears the bacteria out of the wounds and it helps the wounds to heal,” van Hoek said.The Komodo dragon is currently a vulnerable species with about 6,000 animals remaining, but the researchers collected less than four tablespoons of blood for testing from Tujah, a captive Komodo dragon that lives in the St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park in Florida. Tujah was not harmed in this process.“This allows us to test endangered animals or very small animals because we don’t need a very large sample,” van Hoek said.Bishop and van Hoek, who have been collaborating on antimicrobial discovery research since 2009, have also studied American alligators, Chinese alligators, Siamese crocodiles and saltwater crocodiles for possible treatment.Right now, the DRGN-1 research is still in the preclinical phase, and the team is at the early stages of trying to commercialize the peptide. But down the road, DRGN-1 may help fight the superbugs of the future.“When we started this project, it was a high-risk project. The DTRA took a gamble on us,” Bishop said. “The fact that we saw a complexity of peptides from the animals we’re testing on, there’s still a lot to learn. It’s very enriching.”"
57,POLITICS,What's To Be Done With The People Who Plan To Spam Us With ‘Ringless Voicemails’?,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ringless-voicemail-robocalls_us_592dd664e4b055a197cdde68,A modest proposal.,2017-05-30,A collective message for the messenger. Can you hear us now?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592dd94c1400001f0047fdef.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you are like many of the Americans who, in recent years, chose to cut the cord on your landline phone, you probably remember one of the things that finally drove you to that decision: the endless, horrible robocalls that rang you at all hours of the day. You probably knew, every time you checked your voicemail, that the chances that someone you actually cared about had left you a message were frustratingly remote. Instead, it was a litany of people trying to sell you stuff, politicians begging for your money or your vote, or CVS reminding you for the ninth time that your Klonopin refill was waiting for you to pick it up.“Come on, CVS robot,” you thought, “you sound like you need that Klonopin more than I do.”Those who shifted to an all-mobile phone existence experienced a relief from this daily barrage of robocalls, thanks to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). That law included a strict mandate that your mobile number could not be targeted by robocall campaigns unless you were foolish enough to provide your written consent. But now that hard-won peace is under threat. As Consumerist’s Chris Morran reports:A company called All About The Message (AATM) has developed technology that lets it deliver messages straight to a recipient’s voicemail without actually calling the phone. It recently petitioned [PDF] the Federal Communications Commission, asking it to declare that such direct-to-voicemail messages fall outside the umbrella of the TCPA, or to grant the company a waiver to deliver these messages without fear of the penalties that could result from violating the TCPA.Yes, inspired by that time that Apple forced all of its iPhone users to own a U2 album, this new technology would just quietly dump message after message into our voicemail, leaving it up to every mobile phone user to be the middleman between their outreach and your deleted voicemail folder. As Recode’s Tomy Romm reports, the argument that these awful, awful people are making to justify this hellish innovation is that, because your phone never rings, it does not technically count as a phone call, so it’s not governed by the TCPA.Naturally, this completely ignores the fact that nobody in the world wants this, but the FCC is being challenged to do something about it. One would hope that the FCC would recognize the obvious devilry here, but you never know. The flesh is weak. And I’m willing to bet that advocates for this new robocall technology are smart enough to not robocall the FCC asking for its support ― an irony that may be lost on everyone involved in making the decision.It could be that we may have to face a future in which “ringless voicemails” become permissible in the eyes of the law. So this is a good time to decide what we are going to do to the first varlet who dares to try this, just as a form of pre-emptive action.Bring back the pillory. It’s been a long while since we’ve locked scofflaws in the stocks for their crimes against the community, but it’s a very low-tech solution to your public humiliation needs and just about anyone involved in a ringless voicemail scheme can be placed in them snugly and securely. From there, the public could gather around the pilloried delinquent, jeering mercilessly as the miscreant grows sweaty in the heat and caked in the grime of the town square. The use of the stocks would be a return to America’s Puritan roots, and so it would be a “teachable moment” for both the offenders and for young children eager to learn about our rich history.The parade of shame. In this old form of ritual public humiliation made popular again by HBO’s hit show “Game of Thrones,” the hoodlum involved in sending out the first ringless voicemail campaign would be made to traverse a great distance as concerned members of the public spit insults and throw garbage at the wrongdoer. This manner of punishment really brings people together by drawing on their creativity and ingenuity. Perhaps instead of forcing the offender to walk, they could be forced to ride on a cucking stool? Or they could be treated to a mock parade known as a “Skimmington ride.” It ends up being a net benefit to the participants in the community, who get to bond over a common cause, enjoy a nice day out together and get in a little cardio as well.The reverse robocall. Or, maybe the best way to send a message about how annoying it is to be left an unwanted voicemail is to send the message back to the offender. Once the transgressor is properly identified, crowds could gather at their home and/or place of business and ― using bells, klaxons and good old-fashioned screaming ― buffet the malefactor with useless messages about an exciting new offer or about how they need to give, give, give if they want to flip the Senate. This could continue until the targeted perpetrator breaks down, wracked by guilt, sobbing like a soul condemned, the memory of their crime permanently seared on their psyche.Hopefully, it won’t come to this, but these are just some of the ideas we, as a society, could deploy to create strong incentives against launching a “ringless voicemail” campaign. I’m sure we could, if pressed, come up with more ideas that might drive home the point that this proposal is evil and bad.So, if you’re contemplating using “ringless voicemail” robocalls to “get your message out,” how about you take my advice and let someone else try it first?~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat the Press” for HuffPost and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.

Bush brought an end to his career of money-laundering and cocaine smuggling, in which he worked with traffickers like Colombian Pablo Escobar. He was initially sentenced in the United States in 1992, but was serving a sentence for murder in Panama when he died.Noriega was let out of prison under house arrest in January to have an operation to remove a brain tumor. The surgery went ahead in early March, but he suffered a hemorrhage, underwent a second operation, and had been in a coma ever since.A Panamanian government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Noriega died at around 11 p.m. local time in a Panama City hospital after his condition suddenly worsened.President Varela said Noriega’s family should have the right to bury the former leader in peace.Most Panamanians had gone to bed by the time the announcement was made close to midnight in the isthmus nation, so local reaction was initially muted.“We Panamanians must remember the (Noriega) era as something that cannot be repeated in Panama, it was a really painful time for the country because it ended with an invasion,” said Aurelio Barria, a former leader of the Cruzada Civilista, a civil society campaign against the dictatorship.Born less than a mile from the U.S.-controlled Panama Canal Zone in a tough Panama City neighborhood, Noriega was raised by a family friend. A poor but intelligent youth, his options were limited until a half-brother helped him join the military.Noriega became head of military intelligence under Omar Torrijos - who had seized power in a 1968 coup - and oversaw the army’s corrupt off-book deals, and ran the secret police force.Torrijos died in 1981, and as ruler in his own right Noriega hit the headlines as his relations with Washington turned sour, culminating in Washington sending nearly 28,000 troops to seize Panama City and capture him in a house-to-house hunt.Noriega spent the remainder of his life in custody between the United States, France and Panama for a host of crimes ranging from murder to racketeering and drug-running.With U.S. officials in the know, Noriega formed “the hemisphere’s first narcokleptocracy,” a U.S. Senate subcommittee report said, calling him “the best example in recent U.S. foreign policy of how a foreign leader is able to manipulate the United States to the detriment of our own interests.”After his capture, Noriega tried to turn the tables on the United States, saying it had worked hand in glove with him."

Strickland has been suspended for six games and fined an undisclosed amount, according to MLB.com. Harper, an outfielder, received a four-game suspension and an undisclosed fine. In the top of the 8th inning in Monday’s game at AT&T Park in San Francisco, Strickland hit Harper with a 98 mph fastball on the hip. Harper pointed his bat at the Giants pitcher, charged the mound and hurled his batting helmet at Strickland, which sailed way wide.Strickland and Harper each landed solid punches before the two teams met at the mound and players jostled with one another. Appearing to get the worst of the melee were Giant teammates Michael Morse and Jeff Samardzija, who collided head-to-head.Harper and Strickland were both ejected from the game. The Nationals went on to win the opener of a three-game series between the two teams, 3-0. It was unclear whether Strickland intended to hit Harper. But the last time the two met, during the 2014 division playoff series, Harper belted home runs off Strickland in two separate games.“History,” said F.P. Santangelo, an analyst for the National’s broadcast team, just as Harper was hit. “And that was intentional to my mind,” Santangelo added as the brawl ensued. Before the Nationals departed for a West Coast swing, Harper ― a four-time All-Star and winner of the National League MVP ― told a group of Washington-area youth baseball players over the weekend that there are “no participation trophies, OK? First place only.” This article has been updated to reflect the suspensions of the two players. "

Photos show the message “Danmark defend the whales of the Faroe Islands” painted in red in front of the statue. The Faroe Islands, a self-governing archipelago in the North Atlantic, are technically part of Denmark. Whale hunting is a Faroese tradition dating back over 1,000 years, but it’s come under intense scrutiny in recent decades. “The slaughter occurs mainly during the summer months in so-called ‘traditional’ communal drive hunts that locals refer to as ‘grindadráp’ or simply, ‘the grind,’ but more accurately this practice should be called what it truly is - mass slaughter,” writes the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a marine conservation organization that has campaigned against whale hunting in the Faroes since 1985, according to its website.The Faroese have brought in an average of 838 pilot whales and 75 dolphins annually over the past of 300 years, National Geographic reported in 2014. Hunting is a communal activity meant to gather food for island residents, and is not a part of a larger industry, experts say.“They do feel a real cultural attachment to [the grinds],” Russel Fielding, a geographer who has studied the Faroese tradition since 2005, told National Geographic. “However, the Faroese are quick to point out that it is for food primarily.”Authorities have yet to identify who is responsible for vandalising Copenhagen’s famous statue, but it’s hardly the first time it’s been the target of some kind of attack. The statue has been decapitated twice, once in 1964 and again in 1998. Danish brewer Carl Jacobsen gifted the statue, by sculptor Edvard Eriksen, to Copenhagen in 1913 in honor of writer Hans Christian Andersen’s famous fairytale."

These last rebel pockets on the eastern cusp of the capital were excluded from the May 6 cease-fire deal brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran.For three years, the neighborhoods of Qaboun, Barzeh and Tishreen had truces with government forces, and Syrian officials even touted them as examples of successful local reconciliation deals. Despite the truces, in early February they became the unexpected target of a government campaign to pressure rebels in the adjacent Eastern Ghouta – the last major opposition enclave in the Damascus suburbs, and now one of the four proposed “de-escalation zones” in the cease-fire deal.Qaboun, Barzeh and Tishreen each reached official or semi-official truces with government forces in 2014, and life returned to relative normalcy. Clashes were rare, and despite government forces scrutinizing supplies and people entering and exiting the area, the end of blockades and daily violence meant children could return to schools, and employees and university students could commute to the capital. The government returned electricity and water services, and rebel forces gave the government access to a strategic road that passes through Barzeh and connects with other government-held areas, including the Tishreen Military Hospital.However, the government’s victory in Aleppo in December 2016 renewed its determination to regain control of remaining rebel-held areas and shifted its strategy from siege to surrender. Since then, it has taken control of the water-rich Wadi Barada northwest of the capital, and began evacuating rebels from their last enclave in Homs.“The technique followed in most battles in Syria … is consolidating areas by besieging the area, and consistently attacking it, even if slowly, because in the end the only option they have is to either surrender or die because of siege,” a Syria-based Hezbollah fighter told Syria Deeply in September.Despite their truce status, Qaboun, Barzeh and Tishreen became targets of this strategy as the government set its sights on the Eastern Ghouta, which has been under a stifling government-imposed siege since 2013.Rebel infighting in the Ghouta last year allowed the government to advance and take control of the suburbs’ agricultural Marj region in May 2016, costing rebels their food autonomy. Only one crossing, al-Wafideen,was allowed to bring in supplies to the Ghouta, and even then only with government approval and at exorbitant prices. Smuggling tunnelsconnecting the Ghouta with opposition-controlled districts in the capital gained prominence as a way to bring in supplies to rebels and residents under siege. Further paralyzing the district is a fresh round of rebel infighting that started in April, killing scores of fighters and civilians.Russia, a key government ally, pointed to the presence of Tahrir al-Sham, the most recent incarnation of al-Qaida’s affiliate in Syria, in the Damascus neighborhoods, to defend the district’s exclusion from the May 4 “de-escalation” agreement, but the group also has a presence in the Eastern Ghouta and is one of the most powerful groups in rebel-held Idlib province, both of which were included in the deal.“Taking Qaboun and Barzeh and cutting the tunnel trade means that the government will feel more comfortable about freezing the front lines in the Eastern Ghouta, since it will have maximized its economic leverage and can thus continue its campaign to retake the area by other means,” said Aron Lund, a fellow at the Century Foundation.Faten, an aid volunteer in the Eastern Ghouta with the local organization One Hand, agrees. “The government wants to get rid of us by completely isolating us through bombardment and siege, because the tunnels stretched from here to the previous cease-fire areas,” she told Syria Deeply.But the districts Faten called “previous cease-fire areas” can no longer be described as such. Thousands of families were displaced from the Damascus districts during the recent government offensive, including the more than 3,000 people who were evacuated from Qaboun over the weekend, a situation that Dr. Nizar, a local surgeon from the district, described as “despair beyond imagination.”“This is not negotiations,” he told Syria Deeply. “This is implementing a pre-planned process of displacement.”Some residents of Qaboun were transferred to the northwestern opposition-controlled province of Idlib, but others chose to move deeper into rebel-held territory in the Damascus suburbs, where the humanitarian situation is so dire it needs a “budget of nations, not grassroots organizations,” Faten said.Nizar is among those who moved into the Eastern Ghouta, where the U.N. has recently said that nearly 400,000 people remain trapped in deteriorating conditions. Despite the tightening siege, frequent government bombardment and the fighting between rebel and extremist groups, he hopes to continue providing medical care in these hard-to-reach areas.Fighting in the Eastern Ghouta continued after the rebel-held towns in eastern Damascus were evacuated. Residents in districts with standing truces worry the operation in Qaboun, Barzeh and Tishreen is a sign that long-term local reconciliation agreements have become nonexistent, said Ammar Essah, a field doctor and member of the political negotiation committee in Babila, a rebel-controlled town in the southern Damascus suburbs.The town has witnessed virtually no clashes with government forces since it agreed to a truce with the government three years ago, but Essah said many residents “have no trust at all in the government … after the experiences of those around us.”“We are like sheep watching each other be slaughtered, one after the other, waiting our turn,” Essah said.This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

67,ENTERTAINMENT,"From 'Scandal' To 'House Of Cards,' Political Dramas Are Suffering In The Trump Era",Stephanie Marcus,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-political-dramas_us_592cff26e4b0df57cbfcf211,Daily White House antics are turning viewers away from fictional government scandals.,2017-05-30,"Robin Wright and Kevin Spacey on ""House of Cards.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592d010f1600002200ddd642.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Television is like a time capsule. Inevitably an era’s anxieties and priorities are reflected through entertainment. If we want to pinpoint what was going on socially, culturally and politically at any given moment looking to the kinds of shows that appear on television isn’t the worst way to do it. That’s why the new series that networks announced earlier this month as part of their 2017–2018 schedules can offer some insight into how Donald Trump’s presidency is affecting both what viewers are watching and the kinds of shows networks are programming.Back in December, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey told audiences at the Content London media summit that the network was questioning its programming philosophy in the aftermath of Trump’s victory.“With our dramas, we have a lot of shows that feature very well-to-do, well-educated people, who are driving very nice cars and living in extremely nice places,” she said. “There is definitely still room for that, and we absolutely want to continue to tell those stories because wish-fulfillment is a critical part of what we do as entertainers. But in recent history we haven’t paid enough attention to some of the true realities of what life is like for everyday Americans in our dramas.”Ratings might have prompted that kind of self-reflection as much as Trump’s win. Nearly every politically driven show on both network and cable TV ― “Scandal,” “The Americans,” “Homeland,” “Madam Secretary,” “Designated Survivor” and “Quantico” ― saw a decline in viewership numbers through the election season and dropped further after Trump won. Cable news networks enjoyed huge ratings increases ahead of the election and continue to see impressive numbers as news of White House scandals break nearly every week. But a network like ABC, which airs “Scandal,” “Quantico,” and “Designated Survivor,” is definitely feeling the effects of political fatigue.“Scandal,” in particular, feels like victim of the Trump era. Though the show’s ratings had been declining since 2015, it wasn’t in danger of being canceled. After the election, creator Shonda Rhimes would often say in interviews that she no longer knew what to do with the series now that Trump was president — the on-screen scandals handled by Olivia Pope and her Gladiators were still far more dramatic than anything on the nightly news, but the latest season’s first few episodes, which aired right after Trump’s inauguration, forced viewers to endure yet another election narrative and relive the loss felt on election night all over again. Even after the runaway success of the show’s early seasons, the announcement that “Scandal” would end after its seventh season didn’t come as a surprise. “I used to know how it ended, and then Donald Trump was elected. We had a destination, and I don’t know if that’s our destination anymore,” Rhimes told The Hollywood Reporter in April.Similarly, she told The New York Times, “Our show is basically a horror story. Really. We say the people in Washington are monsters and if anybody ever knew what was really going on under the covers they would freak out. So they can do anything, they can murder people, they kill people and they get away with everything all the time.”She added, “But that was based on a world in which Obama was president and our audience was happy about what was going on in Washington and they felt optimistic. You can always tell any horror story you want to when the light is on. But now the lights are off, and now I think people don’t want to watch horror stories, they want you to light a candle somewhere.” As for “Designated Survivor,” ABC’s freshman drama starring Kiefer Sutherland, the series premiered to strong ratings in September and then began hemorrhaging millions of viewers each week as the election drew closer and Trump won. Though the network wouldn’t flat-out blame ratings on Trump, Dungey came as close as she could. “I think some of that has to do with White House politics fatigue ... It’s challenging right now in terms of making political shows just in general because there are big changes afoot in the world we live in, ” she told Entertainment Weekly in January, adding that the network planned on delving into the characters and their relationships. Which is another way of saying, they’re going to focus less on hard political storylines and rev up the romantic ones. After all of this, it seems that ABC didn’t rethink its programing philosophy after all. Rather than focus on series that show the reality of life for “everyday Americans” ― code for Trump voters ― when the new crop of shows were announced, Vanity Fair wondered if the network, which canceled its conservative-leaning hit “Last Man Standing,” was actually “quietly trolling” Trump? Counted among ABC’s new shows is “The Crossing,” in which “refugees from a war-torn country seek asylum in a small American fishing town, only the country these people are from is America ― and the way they are fleeing hasn’t happened yet.” There’s also “The Mayor,” which follows a rapper who runs for mayor as a publicity stunt and ends up winning. Both shows feel pretty pointed ― Dungey even called “The Mayor” “a timely riff on current events” ― but what might be even more telling are the pilots that ABC passed on.The network declined to pick up the comedy “Libby & Malcolm” from “Blackish” creator Kenya Barris. Felicity Huffman and Courtney B. Vance were set to star as “two polar opposite political pundits, who fall in love despite all odds and form an insta-family as well as a work partnership.” ABC also passed on “Red Blooded,” a new drama from showrunner Marc Cherry, which was set to star Reba McEntire as the sheriff of a small town in Kentucky, “who finds her red state outlook challenged when a young FBI agent of Middle Eastern descent is sent to help her solve a horrific crime.”Not having seen either show, it’s hard to say anything about either one, but both shows sound a little too on the nose when it comes to the let’s-put-our-differences-behind-us rhetoric. Given that political dramas (and even political comedies, in the case of “Veep”) are faltering in the Trump era, it’s not shocking that ABC would pass on these series.That’s not to say audiences aren’t still thrilled by politics ― they just made MSNBC No. 1 in weekly primtime viewers for the first time in history ― but viewers are understandably exhausted and want to keep politics out of their entertainment. Plus, if anyone wanted to watch “two polar opposite political pundits” fall in love, they could just watch recently engaged co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski  bicker on “Morning Joe.”Dungey previously told reporters that the current political climate was something ABC took into consideration when they crafted the fall schedule. “There’s a lot of news, and I think people are definitely looking to television as a place where they want to feel — they want to laugh, they want to cry, they want to enjoy,” Dungey said during the network’s conference call before their presentation to advertisers earlier this month. “What the mood of the country has told us is that television is a little bit of an escape … That did frame a lot of our development thinking this season.” If people are looking for an escape, that helps to explain why there are no less than eight superhero shows scheduled to premiere in the 2017–2018 season. “The Big Bang Theory” currently reigns supreme as TV’s No. 1 show, suggesting audiences want to laugh more than they want to see political intrigue. “This Is Us” topped the charts among dramas, suggesting a yearning for stories focused on interpersonal relationships. Networks are doing their best in this new TV season to literally recreate the kind of programing that seems to be working ― see “Young Sheldon.”The desire for some TV catharsis in the current political climate also explains why “Saturday Night Live” just wrapped its highest-rated season in years and why Stephen Colbert was just officially crowned the king of late-night for the 2016–2017 season. Audiences might be tired of watching what they perceive as a heavy-handed lecture on current events disguised as a soapy drama, but they are hungry for satire.“It’s been harder in the past couple of years at ‘SNL’ because the culture is so fragmented. If you do a parody even of a huge show like ‘Game of Thrones,’ it doesn’t have the full cultural resonance of a ‘Cheers’ or ‘Friends,’” “SNL” writer and “Weekend Update” co-anchor Colin Jost told The Hollywood Reporter of the show’s increased popularity. “Whereas politics right now is probably the closest we’ve come to a full-blown national phenomenon as anything in a long time, and anytime people are paying more attention to politics, it’s good for our show. But you almost feel like a war profiteer at times because we’ve benefited from a situation that’s so tough.”If politics feels all-consuming, then what becomes of the political drama? Shows like “House of Cards,” whose fifth season premieres on Netflix on May 30, are routinely being written off as “irrelevant,” with critics claiming writers couldn’t possibly come up with anything more outlandish than what’s actually happening in the IRL White House. Even Robin Wright, who plays Claire Underwood, recently joked that Trump stole all the show’s ideas for Season 6. Trump has yet to actually match “House of Cards” in its full absurdity, but there’s still time. With themes of nepotism, populism, voter suppression, constitutional crises, the possibility of impeachment and a growing body count, the fifth season of “House of Cards” is by no means boring, but it’s just not as binge-able in this current administration.Netflix doesn’t release viewership data, so it’s impossible to know how many people have ever watched “House of Cards,” but its subscribers are probably feeling the same political fatigue that network and cable the viewers are experiencing ― something showrunners Melissa Gibson and Frank Pugliese acknowledge.“Politics surrounding the presidency, in particular, has become more like a TV show than our TV show has become like politics, in a way,” Pugliese told HuffPost in a recent phone interview. “So yeah, sometimes I feel like we are competing with a show that is on every day ― it’s the Trump Show. It’s 24 hours a day. But there is nothing we can do about that.”The plot of “House of Cards” Season 5 isn’t ripped from the headlines — the show was already filming some of its last episodes on election day. But many of the show’s themes and plot points again parallel what’s actually happening in our government today and it blurs the line between fantasy and reality. If anything, viewing the show in the wake of Trump’s seemingly numerous scandals adds a layer of realism. It’s increasingly difficult to convince yourself the entire show isn’t a commentary on the current president.Of course, Francis Underwood wormed his way into the White House long before Trump did.“I think we are uniquely positioned to be in dialogue with the real world,” Gibson told HuffPost when asked if she thought it was inevitable that viewers would try to connect the show to Trump. “But of course, our world is distinct and a really fundamental difference is that Francis Underwood came up through the system. He’s a through and through politician, who is of the system. He’s trying to explode it, but he’s trying to explode it from within. Whereas Donald Trump is a proud outsider trying to blow things up from the outside.”There are many more differences between Francis Underwood and Trump ― one is one of the most articulate characters on TV, while the other has a vocabulary of about 67 words ― but this is part of Trump’s effect on TV. Suddenly everything is about him, even when it’s not.“We’re just reacting to a moment in time both culturally and politically. The same moment in time that sort of created Trump and in a sense has created Francis,” Pugliese added. “So the similarities are there just because they came out of something that’s been going on for the last few years. In a way, Francis is talking about nationalism and populism seasons ago. So there has just been stuff in the air that we tapped into.”"

Mark Walker (R-N.C.) doesn’t deny the climate is changing, but he does deny the basic facts underpinning that conclusion.On Tuesday, at a town hall in Graham, North Carolina, the GOP representative responded to a constituent’s question about climate change by simultaneously acknowledging it exists ― and denying humans are responsible for it:Walker told the crowd of around 75 people he doesn’t doubt the climate is shifting, but that he is unsure “how much of it is man-made,” and that acting to curb the causes might be too burdensome.A broad scientific consensus, based on large amounts of data, points to human activity as the primary culprit for climate change. Put simply, as human emissions of heat-trapping gasses like carbon dioxide have spiked, so have global temperatures. Walker’s logic may be baffling, but it’s a common Republican refrain that appears designed to acknowledge climate change’s threats while simultaneously denying any responsibility for addressing them.That basic premise is clearer on Walker’s 2015 campaign website, where he accused the “secular left” of using climate change as “a political football.”“Much of the ‘so-called’ science of climate change is contested though it’s made a few politicians quite wealthy,” his position reads. “I believe that God provided the earth to us and we have a responsibility to conserve and respect the environment. When companies damage or abuse our environment, they should be held accountable.”Tellingly, that last sentence ― the one about holding companies accountable for damaging the environment ― no longer appears on Walker’s website.In April, Motherboard examined Walker’s voting record and labeled the representative an outright “climate change denier,” as opposed to merely having a “poor climate change voting record.” "

It includes Underwood’s supposed hometown of Gaffney.So with the fifth season of “House of Cards” debuting on Tuesday, Parnell is using the occasion to mock just how unlike he is from Underwood ― who has ascended through foul means to the presidency. Parnell also uses the video to tout his tax expertise and throw a few zingers at President Donald Trump.In “A Matador for You,” which Parnell’s campaign is promoting with a small internet ad buy, he offers Underwood-like aphorisms to the soundtrack of “House of Cards.” But he also makes clear that he’s not exactly a political bruiser in the Underwood mold, with help from his wife in one scene.As Parnell wraps up his performance, he says, “There are two types of congressmen: doormats and matadors. I will be a matador for you.” He then bangs his fist on the table twice ― an Underwood trademark. Turning away from the camera, he immediately and somewhat sheepishly asks: “How’d I do?”The video ends with text saying that “Archie Parnell is no Frank Underwood. And Washington shouldn’t actually be like House of Cards.”Parnell is vying to fill the seat vacated by Republican Mick Mulvaney, who left Congress to head the Office of Management and Budget in the Trump administration. He faces off against former state Rep. Ralph Norman, a Republican, on June 20 in the GOP-tilting district. Mulvaney won re-election last November with about 59 percent of the vote."

Bernie Sanders told how his challenging childhood just a few miles away shaped his world view.The former Democratic presidential candidate said his upbringing in the polyglot New York borough influenced him in two key ways.The economic struggles of his parents, who raised him and his brother in a small rent-controlled apartment in the Flatbush neighborhood, inspired him to seek economic justice, he said. “As with many of your families who don’t have a lot of money, financial pressure caused friction and tension within our household,” the 75-year-old Sanders recalled. “From those experiences of growing up without a lot of money, I have never forgotten that there are millions of people throughout this country who struggle to put food on the table, pay the electric bill, try to save for their kids’ education, or for retirement ― people who, against great odds, are fighting today to live in dignity.”In addition, his father’s background as a Jewish immigrant from Poland who escaped the anti-Semitism and violence of Eastern Europe served as a flesh-and-blood reminder of the dangers of nationalism and racial demagoguery, he said.“While my father emigrated to the United States and escaped [Adolf] Hitler and the Holocaust, many in his family did not,” Sanders said. “For them, racism and extremism and ultra-nationalism were not ‘political issues.’ They were issues of life and death and some of them died horrific deaths.”“From that experience, what was indelibly stamped on my mind, was the understanding that we must never allow demagogues to divide us up by race by religion, by national origin, by gender or sexual orientation,” he declared, drawing loud applause.Sanders went on to deliver a familiar denunciation of President Donald Trump and the policies of congressional Republicans. He made an equally passionate appeal for policies that bridge the wealth gap, ensure affordable health care for all, fight climate change, protect women’s reproductive rights and reverse mass incarceration.He concluded on an optimistic note, arguing that notwithstanding the country’s enormous challenges, the American people’s collective wealth, ingenuity and access to technological advances provide the makings of greatness if properly harnessed.“My message to you is very simple: Think big, not small, and help us create the nation that we all know we can become,” he said.Sanders, who completed a year of studies at Brooklyn College before transferring to the University of Chicago, was received warmly from the moment he walked to the speaker’s lectern.

No one was hurt in the incident, and authorities are investigating it as criminal mischief, the Herald-Leader reported.“We need to keep doing what we do because it’s that important,” Baniak told HuffPost, adding that the paper’s staff “can’t be deterred from doing the work that we do because of an act of vandalism.”The motive of the perpetrator, or perpetrators, is still unknown. But Sunday’s crime occurred amid increasing anti-press rhetoric and even some violence against members of the media.Montana Republican Greg Gianforte attacked journalist Ben Jacobs Wednesday before going on to win a congressional election Thursday. Jacobs was the fourth reporter to either be manhandled or arrested in May for questioning candidates and public officials.Baniak urged caution Monday against assuming the motive for Sunday’s crime. “We at the Herald-Leader want to be cautious about speculating and we don’t want to connect the dots until there are dots to be connected,” he said. Still, Baniak told HuffPost that “it is difficult not to be concerned given some of the rhetoric, both nationally and here in Kentucky.”President Donald Trump, who ran the most anti-press presidential campaign in recent memory, has continued trying to delegitimize the press while in office. On Sunday he again took a page from Stalin in labeling the “fake news” media as the “enemy.”In Kentucky, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin last week called journalists “cicadas” as part of his ongoing feud with the press. Bevin’s office issued a statement Monday condemning the vandalism, but warned against a rush to judgement on the motive. “Gov. Bevin condemns all acts of vandalism against any individual or institution,” the statement read. “However, it is highly irresponsible to suggest a motive when we don’t even know the facts. This practice of journalism by innuendo is sloppy and reckless and was at the heart of the Governor’s comments last week.”This article was updated with Bevin’s statement Monday."

Not hands, apparently.Watch Laurent Lokoli of France refuse to press flesh with the victorious Martin Klizan of Slovakia after their first-round match on Tuesday. Lokoli threw in a finger-wag and dismissive wave for theatrical effect.Some fans booed, but we can’t totally blame Lokoli. According to Deadspin, Klizan had reacted earlier to a game-ending Lokoli double fault by yelling in triumph and then pointing at his brain, perhaps to signify the pressure had gone to Lokoli’s head to make such a mental mistake.Not cool either.The two also argued on the sideline, with Lokoli accusing Klizan of faking a leg injury, the Telegraph reported. He also said Klizan disrespected him.Bad blood all around, it seems.So while Klizan got the five-set victory, maybe we can call the bad sportsmanship competition a draw."

And keeping to his promise, Sherman surprised the high school senior during last weekend’s annual Celebrity Waiter Dinner in Richmond, Virginia.“At the dinner when Richard Sherman came to me about the scholarship, I was in shock,” James told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. “I believe I said ‘Really?’ for reassurance,” James said. “I just felt so blessed to have been given the wonderful opportunity.”James went on to add that she has decided to attend Norfolk State University with plans to study business.The charity event was a part of the Excel to Excellence Foundation, founded by Sherman’s former teammate, Michael Robinson. Founded in 2010, the organization’s mission is to improve the lives of children through various programming efforts including a youth football camp and academic programs, according to the organization’s website.“It goes back to knowledge is power and if you have the knowledge you’re going to be as powerful as you ever want to be,” said Sherman told Richmond Times-Dispatch. “Nobody stops anybody from reading and educating themselves. Mike is only trying to empower these kids to be everything that they can be and if we can help with that with our presence, with our (autographed) jerseys (for an auction), with our words, we’ll do everything we can.”In 2015 Sherman’s contributions, which include mentoring high school students, donating to families in need, and helping students in low-income communities, earned the NFL star the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award for his “significant positive impact” on his community."

I knew something was trapped inside.”Barrett said he called police for help after an unsuccessful attempt to open the suitcase by himself.By the time authorities were able to break the case open, they estimated the dog, who was found lying in his own urine and feces, had been trapped inside for a total of three to six hours.RAPS President and CEO Eyal Lichtmann couldn’t hide his disgust over the animal’s mistreatment. “It’s just horrendous,” he told HuffPost. “Who puts a dog into a suitcase and throws it into the woods?”Anyone who decides they can no longer take care of an animal is urged by RAPS to bring the pet to its shelter. “RAPS will gladly take the animal, provide it care and re-home the animal,” the group’s website states.Amazingly, Donut is said to be doing extremely well, as seen in the video below released by RAPS. He’s described by the group as “active, happy and friendly,” and “in good health despite the traumatizing incident.”The dog, estimated to be about 6 years old, was found without a microchip or any other identifier. He had been recently groomed, RAPS said.An investigation is underway by the Richmond Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a team with the British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to try to find whoever placed the poodle inside the suitcase, The Vancouver Sun reported.The culprit could face up to five years in prison, a $75,000 fine and a lifetime ban on owning animals, CTV reported.Barrett, who has two dogs of his own, hopes his adult daughter will be able to adopt the pooch, who he’d like to name Lucky because of his incredible survival.“I think this would be a good fit for their family, and also for us, to know that he’s in a safe place,” he said."

They describe the city’s efforts to reduce emissions from heating, cooling, and transportation, along with how the city recaptures energy from wastes and wastewater. The articles also explain how Stockholm will compensate for stubborn emissions, and how the city keeps its complex climate efforts on track through vigilant management and a “take-no-prisoners” approach to emissions reduction. The fourth article describes the city’s renewable energy production, its building energy efficiency programs, and its transportation programs. The fifth article describes the Stockholm Royal Seaport, where the city is striving to surpass the breakthroughs made in its first eco-district, Hammarby Sjöstad.It’s been 20 years since Stockholm became the world’s first city to create a formal climate action plan. Back then, the city was producing 5.4 tons of greenhouse gases (CO2eq) per person a year.Today, emissions have been driven down to only 2.5 tons per person and are still falling. The city’s latest target is only 2.3 tons per person for 2020, just three years from now.By comparison, annual CO2 emissions in the U.S. are over 16 tons per person, and in China, they are close to 8 tons. Even in environmentally conscious Sweden—the first nation to have an Environmental Protection Agency in 1967—CO2 emissions are almost double Stockholm’s.If metropolitan Stockholm, a fast-growing area of over two million people, can constrain its greenhouse gases to net-zero annual emissions, no one will ever be able to accuse it of not doing its part to protect the climate.But what exactly do city officials mean when they hold out the prospect of a fossil-fuel-free future, and is it really attainable by the city’s self-imposed 2040 deadline?More importantly, what can other nations and cities learn from Stockholm’s progress on the path toward a fossil-fuel-free future? The answer requires a deeper understanding of what Stockholm is doing today, and how the city came to be so committed to a sustainable future.Virtually FreeStockholm’s climate strategy begins from the premise that climate change is accelerating and jeopardizing the future of Stockholmers and their children. City officials are adamant that the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere “must be stopped.”Whereas Stockholm officials believe the city can be virtually fossil-fuel-free by 2040, success will depend on the adoption of energy-efficient infrastructure, smart urban design, and modern energy equipment.It will also require broad collaboration by major sectors of the economy, support for new innovation and technology, and perhaps most of all, steadfast adherence to the Strategy for fossil-fuel-free Stockholm 2040[i], the city’s latest climate action plan.This complex new plan assesses the technological opportunities for cutting energy-related emissions and lays out a roadmap for managing the city’s energy, land, and resource use over the long term, through energy policy design and implementation.The plan radiates confidence that the many technological challenges and risks the city faces in fulfilling its long-term climate targets can be overcome on time and under budget.Undergirding that confidence is the unspoken presumption that the municipality and its leaders will remain unwavering in their determination to forge on for at least the next generation to fully implement the plan in all its details until victory is won.An InspirationStockholm’s leadership does indeed seem imbued with the conviction and determination to “stay the course” by fully implementing the city’s climate and energy plans.In 2014, for example, Stockholm’s then-mayor, Per Ankersjö, expressed his hope that the city’s long-term goal of being fossil-fuel-free, would serve as “a source of inspiration for other cities that will follow our lead in our endeavors to build a greener and more beautiful world.”Stockholm officials see the climate action plan as an opportunity to lead the world in phasing-out greenhouse gases while continuing the city’s economic growth and accommodating its swelling population.With many nations failing to reduce their emissions despite the growing global climate emergency, the actions of cities to reduce greenhouse gases is all the more critical. Stockholm’s leaders are thus working in concert with other cities to amplify their impacts.Stockholm, for example, is an active participant in the C40 Climate Cities Leadership Network of 90 cities representing 650 million people, the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy to which 7,445 cities are committed.Stockholm’s Secret SaucePeople concerned about climate change have been wondering what the city’s secret recipe is for making carbon emissions disappear, and what the city’s next steps will be.They got a partial answer in 2016 when the Stockholm City Council concurred in a resolution by the board of its independent corporate energy provider, Fortum Värme, to end all reliance on coal in Stockholm by 2022.(Fortum, the Finnish energy company, co-owns Fortum Värme, which operates the district heating system with Stockholm.) The district heating system currently uses very little coal.The company has just recently opened a large, new, biofueled, combined heat and power plant in Stockholm’s Värtan district. The Värtaverket plant—the company’s largest investment ever at $630 million—is among Sweden’s largest power plants and is one of the world’s largest biofueled plants.Värtaverket produce 750 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity along with 1,700 GWh of heat annually—enough heat for 190,000 apartments. The plant is fueled by wood chips and other woody material, and it is reducing Stockholm’s CO2 emissions by 126,000 tonnes a year.Committed to leading the public-private climate plan effort by example, the city administration has declared its intention of modeling the transition to the post fossil-fuel economy by making the municipality’s own operations and facilities fossil-fuel-free by 2030, ten years ahead of the city as a whole. (Municipal operations account for about 10 percent of the city’s total emissions.)Stockholm has divided the responsibility for assuring the achievement of this 2030 goal among various committees and municipal boards. Each is tasked with identifying the most cost-effective measures for reducing emissions in a different priority area. The city has set aside special funds to pay for the climate investments required.A major factor in the city’s success in reducing emissions to date is its adherence to the maxim, “Trust, but verify.” Hence the city annually audits its progress in all domains of its emissions-reduction work. The city also monitors progress every four months using an integrated management system to compare work done, and its economic impacts, with program objectives and milestones.If results lag, the problem is flagged and efforts are intensified. Every four years, the city also overhauls and updates its Environmental Programme.City planners thus continuously analyze and calculate the city’s greenhouse gas emissions and emission reduction potential in all major spheres of urban activity. Their mandate is to assure that all milestones are met on the city’s journey to fossil-fuel independence by 2040.In the next installment in this five-part series on Stockholm’s energy transition, we will look at the economic impacts of Stockholm’s decision to trim its emissions and how the city is coping with the emissions it can’t readily control.First of a five-part series on Stockholm’s energy transition. __________________John J.

They describe the city’s efforts to reduce emissions from heating, cooling, and transportation, along with how the city recaptures energy from wastes and wastewater. The articles also explain how Stockholm will compensate for stubborn emissions, and how the city keeps its complex climate efforts on track through vigilant management and a “take-no-prisoners” approach to emissions reduction. The fourth article describes the city’s renewable energy production, its building energy efficiency programs, and its transportation programs. The fifth article describes the Stockholm Royal Seaport, where the city is striving to surpass the breakthroughs made in its first eco-district, Hammarby Sjöstad.It’s been 20 years since Stockholm became the world’s first city to create a formal climate action plan. Back then, the city was producing 5.4 tons of greenhouse gases (CO2eq) per person a year.Today, emissions have been driven down to only 2.5 tons per person and are still falling. The city’s latest target is only 2.3 tons per person for 2020, just three years from now.By comparison, annual CO2 emissions in the U.S. are over 16 tons per person, and in China, they are close to 8 tons. Even in environmentally conscious Sweden—the first nation to have an Environmental Protection Agency in 1967—CO2 emissions are almost double Stockholm’s.If metropolitan Stockholm, a fast-growing area of over two million people, can constrain its greenhouse gases to net-zero annual emissions, no one will ever be able to accuse it of not doing its part to protect the climate.But what exactly do city officials mean when they hold out the prospect of a fossil-fuel-free future, and is it really attainable by the city’s self-imposed 2040 deadline?More importantly, what can other nations and cities learn from Stockholm’s progress on the path toward a fossil-fuel-free future? The answer requires a deeper understanding of what Stockholm is doing today, and how the city came to be so committed to a sustainable future.Virtually FreeStockholm’s climate strategy begins from the premise that climate change is accelerating and jeopardizing the future of Stockholmers and their children. City officials are adamant that the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere “must be stopped.”Whereas Stockholm officials believe the city can be virtually fossil-fuel-free by 2040, success will depend on the adoption of energy-efficient infrastructure, smart urban design, and modern energy equipment.It will also require broad collaboration by major sectors of the economy, support for new innovation and technology, and perhaps most of all, steadfast adherence to the Strategy for fossil-fuel-free Stockholm 2040[i], the city’s latest climate action plan.This complex new plan assesses the technological opportunities for cutting energy-related emissions and lays out a roadmap for managing the city’s energy, land, and resource use over the long term, through energy policy design and implementation.The plan radiates confidence that the many technological challenges and risks the city faces in fulfilling its long-term climate targets can be overcome on time and under budget.Undergirding that confidence is the unspoken presumption that the municipality and its leaders will remain unwavering in their determination to forge on for at least the next generation to fully implement the plan in all its details until victory is won.An InspirationStockholm’s leadership does indeed seem imbued with the conviction and determination to “stay the course” by fully implementing the city’s climate and energy plans.In 2014, for example, Stockholm’s then-mayor, Per Ankersjö, expressed his hope that the city’s long-term goal of being fossil-fuel-free, would serve as “a source of inspiration for other cities that will follow our lead in our endeavors to build a greener and more beautiful world.”Stockholm officials see the climate action plan as an opportunity to lead the world in phasing-out greenhouse gases while continuing the city’s economic growth and accommodating its swelling population.With many nations failing to reduce their emissions despite the growing global climate emergency, the actions of cities to reduce greenhouse gases is all the more critical. Stockholm’s leaders are thus working in concert with other cities to amplify their impacts.Stockholm, for example, is an active participant in the C40 Climate Cities Leadership Network of 90 cities representing 650 million people, the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy to which 7,445 cities are committed.Stockholm’s Secret SaucePeople concerned about climate change have been wondering what the city’s secret recipe is for making carbon emissions disappear, and what the city’s next steps will be.They got a partial answer in 2016 when the Stockholm City Council concurred in a resolution by the board of its independent corporate energy provider, Fortum Värme, to end all reliance on coal in Stockholm by 2022.(Fortum, the Finnish energy company, co-owns Fortum Värme, which operates the district heating system with Stockholm.)

81,WORLD NEWS,"In Suriname, An Endless Refrain: Boom, Bust And Bouterse","The Conversation Global, ContributorThe Conversation is a collaboration between editors and academ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-suriname-an-endless-refrain-boom-bust-and-bouterse_us_592dd7b0e4b047e77e4c3f2b,"Rosemarijn Hofte, Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies Recent street protests in Suriname",2017-05-30,"<p>Surinamese’s President Desi Bouterse in 1996, speaking in front of a portrait of himself from back in his military strongman days. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592df00f21000015006fe85f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rosemarijn Hofte, Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean StudiesRecent street protests in Suriname haven’t made many international headlines. Only newspapers in neighbouring Guyana and in the Netherlands, the colonial metropole, have covered the marches in which thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest spiraling economic chaos.Suriname, a small nation on South America’s northern coast with a population of half a million, doesn’t often garner global attention. But maybe right now it should.The next Venezuela?Suriname’s current upheaval pales in comparison to the massive protests in nearby Venezuela, with (fortunately) no major casualties reported so far.Yet events in Venezuelan are on many minds in Suriname, for both political and economic reasons.Surinamese President Desiré (Desi) Delano Bouterse is a great admirer of the late Hugo Chávez. Bouterse not only “adored” the man, as I have argued before, he also copied the Chavista hybrid political system, in which elections are held and opposition is allowed but weak institutions, clientelism, discretionary spending, and lack of transparency all advance the power of the executive – in this case, Bouterse’s.Like Chávez, the opportunistic, charismatic, and controversial Bouterse also has a loyal following. He is especially popular among younger, lower-class Afro-Surinamese. Even a 1999 sentence in absentia to 11 years imprisonment for drug trafficking in a Dutch court did not hurt his popularity. In fact, it increased his street cred.Sergeant Bouterse emerged on the national stage in February 1980, when he and 15 other non-commisioned military officers staged a coup against the democratically elected government. Their revolution – or “revo”, as it was locally called – soon became a nightmare as the dictatorship staged gross human rights violations, including the December 1982 massacre of 15 opposition leaders, economic collapse and social dislocation.Bouterse did not disappear into the shadows with the return of democracy in 1987. He immediately founded a political party, the National Democratic Party (NDP), and in 2010 was elected president. In the last elections in 2015, his NDP gained an absolute majority in parliament, a first in Suriname’s history, and Bouterse was again re-elected.So has this dictator really turned into a democrat? People who lived through the 1980s remember what Bouterse is capable of, and they fear a repeat of that period’s threats, violence and murders.As days of protests turned into weeks, signs of the bad old days are beginning to show. Radio shows aired by NDP-run stations are threatening a Dutch-born young leader of the current protests, Maisha Neus, with deportation. Freedom of the press has been curtailed for several years, with critical media barred from official press conferences.Boom and bustThe second Venezuelan link is that Suriname also suffers from the continuing decline in oil prices paired with populist spending policies. Natural resource exploitation has long been the basis of Suriname’s economy, forcing the country to undergo regular boom-and-bust cycles.In the 20th century, bauxite mining generated foreign exchange revenues and financed a rapid increase in state expenditure. In the post-second world war period, respective governments have expanded the large state bureaucracy, employing tens of thousands of party supporters.But Bouterse’s dictatorship (1980-1987) saw a sharp economic decline, with shortages and long shopping lines that many elderly Surinamese still remember vividly.By the late 1990s, a downturn in international aluminium prices combined with the expansionary economic policies of the NDP administration of Jules Wijdenbosch had completely wiped out the recovery that had taken place earlier that decade. Inflation accelerated, undermining the value of Suriname’s currency.In 1999, in the largest demonstration in the country’s history, 50,000 to 75,000 people (10% of the country’s population) protested the rising cost of living in the capital, Paramaribo.Today’s protests are triggered by the same issues. Excessive spending and tumbling oil and gold prices have led to inflation at some 60% and halved the value of the Surinamese dollar. A spike in fuel prices has caused the initially small demonstrations to grow, and they are now attracting thousands of people, many of them in their 20s and 30s, including former Bouterse supporters.The government is currently borrowing heavily to pay for hospitals, construction of infrastructure, food for the poor, and to repay outstanding debts. According to the Surinamese news magazine Parbode, since December 2015 Bouterse has taken out at least 17 loans from the International Monetary Fund, Eximbank China and other lenders.Borrowing will only add to Suriname’s debt burden. According to the IMF, the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach 68%. In February 2017, ratings agency Fitch lowered Suriname’s rating to B-minus.Meanwhile, a coherent policy addressing the recession, depreciation, rise in inflation and government deficit is lacking.Still, the ongoing protests are unlikely to lead to the resignation of their president. He claims to have a popular mandate, but that’s not the only reason why Bouterse won’t budge: human rights violations from the 1980s still haunt him.Bouterse and his comrades are still being prosecuted for the 1982 execution of 15 opposition members. He has tried to put an end to this seemingly endless court case, several times in fact. But on May 11, despite the demands of the public prosecutor to stop the process because it allegedly endangered national security, the court decided to forge on.The reaction of the Minister of Justice, Eugene van der San, was swift – “The government respects the judge’s decision” – then cryptic – “But there will be a moment when the executive power will be in charge again.”Right now, Suriname’s economic and political future are uncertain, but one thing is clear: too few international eyes are watching the unfolding events.Rosemarijn Hofte, Professor, Suriname History , Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean StudiesThis article was originally published on The Conversation.
