This weekend, while speaking to journalists at the Toronto International Film Festival, the actor let loose with his true feelings again.Speaking to Vanity Fair’s Krista Smith, Clooney called Bannon “a schmuck who literally tried everything he could to sell scripts in Hollywood.” Bannon famously wrote a screenplay for a rap musical update of Shakespeare’s “Coriolanus,” titled “The Thing I Am.”“It’s like a rap Shakespearean thing about the LA riots. It’s the worst script you’ve ever read,” Clooney said of Bannon’s creation. “But he was trying to get it made in Hollywood. And had he, he would still be in Hollywood making movies and kissing my ass to make one of his films. That’s who he is.”Those remarks echo Clooney’s comments to a separate group of journalists the previous day, according to Entertainment Weekly. “I like picking fights. I like that Breitbart News wants to have my head. I’d be ashamed 10 years from now if those weaselly little putzes, whose voices are getting a lot higher every week as this presidency starts to look worse and worse, weren’t still [after me],” Clooney said. “Steve Bannon is a failed fucking screenwriter, and if you’ve ever read [his] screenplay, it’s unbelievable.”The Oscar winner similarly noted that if Bannon, who is now back as executive chairman of Breitbart, were still in Hollywood, he’d be “licking my ass to get me to do one of his stupid-ass screenplays.”Clooney has highlighted Bannon’s time in Hollywood before. When criticizing Trump’s response to Meryl Streep’s powerful Golden Globes speech in February, Clooney brought Bannon into the mix. “Steve Bannon is a failed film writer and director. That’s the truth. That’s what he’s done,” Clooney said, adding, “He made a lot of money off of ‘Seinfeld.’ …He’s elitist Hollywood, I mean, that’s the reality.”Clooney has also spoken out against Trump on multiple occasions, describing the president as “in over his head and incapable.”Still, the “Suburbicon” director remains somewhat optimistic about America’s future. “Particularly with our country, we work things out,” Clooney told Vanity Fair. “Winston Churchill’s statement on America was, ‘You can always count on America to do the right thing after they’ve exhausted every other possibility.’ And I feel like that’s us a lot.”"

Over the weekend, the actress and former Scientologist received the Creative Arts Emmy award for best informational series or special for her A&E series, “Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.” The actress thanked mom Vicki, who had brought her daughter into the Church of Scientology when Remini was a child.“Mom, thank you. You are officially forgiven for getting us into a cult,” the former “King of Queens” star quipped in accepting the Emmy, according to Deadline. Her mother was in the audience to celebrate her daughter’s win, the media outlet reported.Remini dedicated her Emmy to the “brave ones,” the former Scientologists who told their stories throughout the series. “I’m so happy to share this,” Remini said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s not an easy job, but they were the ones putting their stories out there for everyone to hear. And we are honored to be the vessel to tell [those] stories. ... This belongs to our contributors, the brave ones, who are telling their stories.”Remini, who left Scientology about four years ago, hopes to use the series as a tool to continue exposing the organization’s dark side. “The way the organization has responded without taking responsibility for what they do to people, I need to continue,” Remini told The Hollywood Reporter earlier this year. “It would be another [scenario] if they stopped trying to discredit everyone’s stories and said, ‘If you don’t like it, don’t be part of Scientology.’”Meanwhile, the Church of Scientology organization continues to dispute Remini’s claims about harmful practices within the organization. It even created a website dedicated to discrediting her. But Remini won’t back down. She told The Hollywood Reporter, “Until the day I no longer have this platform, I won’t be silent.”"

Vaccination remains the most important tool to prevent outbreaks in the future.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b4008d1700002500f521a8.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Brazil’s Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed that the country’s yellow fever outbreak, which began in December 2016, has ended. A total of 777 cases of yellow fever were confirmed during the outbreak, including 261 deaths. No new cases have been detected since June 2017.According to Health Minister Ricardo Barros:The situation is now under control, but it is imperative that states and municipalities strive to increase vaccination coverage in areas of recommendation, whether through an active search of unvaccinated people or targeted campaigns, also involving schools. Additionally, it is necessary to maintain preventive actions, such as vector control, training of health professionals and intensification of surveillance of epizootics.Yellow fever virus is transmitted by Aedes aegypti ― the same mosquito that spreads the Zika virus. Symptoms include fever, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. The “yellow” in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients. At least half of untreated patients with severe cases of yellow fever die within 10–14 days. Unlike Zika, yellow fever can be controlled with an effective vaccine that grants lifelong immunity within a month of administration. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to grant sustained immunity and lifelong protection. The yellow fever vaccine is mandatory in northern and Amazonian states where the disease is endemic, and some are proposing to extend mandatory vaccination nationwide.In Brazil, yellow fever outbreaks usually take place in six- or seven-year cycles with the last one in 2009. The recent outbreak was highly unusual in a country that typically sees a handful of cases each year. The disease occurred in areas previously not considered at risk and where vaccination rates were low.The MOH is still investigating 213 cases. A total of 2,270 potential cases were ruled out, and 307 cases were declared inconclusive. The case-fatality rate (proportion of deaths among confirmed cases) was approximately 34 percent. More than 98 percent of confirmed cases (764 of 777) were found in the country’s southeastern states, including Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Espirito Santo and Bahia. The disease never took hold in the country’s large cities, but sporadic zoonotic cases were reported outside of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. However, in the transmission cycle of this particular outbreak, the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were not implicated.Throughout the outbreak, health officials conducted a massive vaccination campaign, sending out more than 36.7 million doses of the vaccine. Vaccination efforts are continuing because the ministry says the average coverage rate in areas that bore the brunt of the outbreak is around 60 percent, below the target of 95 percent.While an outbreak is not expected next year, the MOH will produce 10 million more doses of the vaccine each month as a precaution. Fiocruz (Fundação Oswaldo Cruz) is building a new $1 billion plant that could potentially produce up to 100 million doses of the yellow fever vaccine annually. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently facilitated agreements in several South American and African countries to vaccinate 584 million people for yellow fever over the next decade with a goal of eliminating outbreaks worldwide by 2026."

As global inequality skyrockets, the most marginalized among us in every country across the world, including the U.S., are being hit by a combined torrent of incessant crises including poverty, unemployment, economic collapse, drugs, violent crime, climate change and natural disasters. More often than not, these take place in the absence of any real political support for these communities, and the lack of adequate (or in some cases any) infrastructure to help them.But I have a dream that our country and our world are big enough, strong enough, to put aside divisiveness and get to work solving all of the crises facing us the way I have seen people working together selflessly in Texas. The question is, why don’t we?I have been at the front lines of #HurricaneHarvey this week, with amazing people of every color, political stripe and age uniting to achieve the impossible. I know there is nothing we can’t accomplish when we get beyond politics and just do the work we know needs doing. The courageous people I’ve worked with this week are proof that we could easily educate everyone, give health care and jobs to all, solve the opioid and drug epidemics, create social and economic equality, stop global warming and create a sustainable society, and grow our economies, all while embodying an image of justice that is the best foreign policy, bringing our countries and world together. If you don’t believe me, you’re not on the front lines working. It makes me wonder and have to ask: Why aren’t we doing this every day, not just in response to disasters? That’s what it’s going to take to turn our world around.In an open air parking lot in downtown Houston I worked for three days with Operation BBQ Relief, a self-organized group of barbecue makers that started in response to the tornado that flattened Joplin, Missouri, in 2010. Spreading like wildfire through the salt-of-the-earth community that is the BBQ competition circuit, now dozens of these civil-minded pit masters come together from across the United States to cook meals in disaster zones. In Houston, people came from every walk. The scene was incredible ― somewhere near 20 giant privately owned smokers rolled in on trailers from across the country. Five semis filled with meats, vegetables and canned goods were lined up, with one or two more arriving and unloading each day. The sprawling makeshift canteen was supported by a constant flow of donations from across the nation, and 100 or more volunteers of every color and age arriving each morning who’d gotten word via social networks to jump in, get in an assembly line, package up trays of barbecue, beans, vegetables, bread, drinks and more, and get the job done. Over the three days I was there, this impromptu kitchen churned out 90,000 meals ― and 43,000 meals on ONE day alone. Over 11 days since the start of the deployment, 330,000 meals had been served by everyday people stepping up and not waiting for permission to do so.Across the Houston area, I saw people helping others carry out water-logged sheetrock and furniture from their homes. I watched trucks, cars and vans driven by compelled mothers, sisters, fathers, brothers from every relief center and rescue group in the area including police and emergency teams, from Houston to Rockport, Beaumont and Victoria. I saw inspiring individuals drop everything, travel for hours at risk of running out of gas amidst closed filling stations, coming in, picking up supplies and food to take them to inaccessible and hard hit areas. I saw Coast Guard Chinooks and Airlifts working together with people-powered movements to bring relief to those in need. To say this spontaneous collaboration, powered by smart phones and internet, was impressive would be an understatement. I saw the same greatness deep in Houston’s hardest hit neighborhood, the Northeast. Here, in this flood plane bayou covered with single story wood frame homes, floodwaters raged to 12 feet in some places. Families waited on rooftops overnight for hours with their small children as dead bodies floated by until they could be rescued the next morning. I spoke with pastor Joshua Dillard at the Free Indeed Church on Homestead Road, which set up one of only two relief centers in the entire area, where I met dozens of courageous individuals giving everything they have to help those in need. You can see my conversation with Josh and get an idea of the harsh reality, as well as of these people’s resilience, in this video. Here, poverty, unemployment, repeated disasters and violent crime combine in a storm far worse than #Irma or #Harvey. Police warned me not to come here for relief work saying it was too dangerous, informing me that residents had shot at police and Coast Guard rescue teams there just days before. But on my arrival at the church, I found the brightest, warmest people working feverishly ― I mean it felt like a swarm of love, laying out 100 or more beds, tending to displaced children and families, packaging up and delivering meals, offering counseling, helping with FEMA relief claims and more. One cannot be but humbled when faced with such sheer power of human determination and selflessness as I witnessed.This is greatness. And this greatness could and should be applied every day, not only in response to disasters like #Harvey or #Irma, or the typhoons of the Indian Ocean or earthquakes and landslides in poverty stricken Central America. This attitude, this willingness and selflessness must be summoned to eradicate economic inequality, incarceration rates, to provide environmental sustainability, universal health care and employment not only in our countries but the whole world. We don’t have time anymore to be fooled by false narratives that suggest we must choose between sustainability or economic growth, between immigration or jobs for citizens, between equal distribution of wealth and higher taxes. There is no scarcity to the American people’s ability to achieve anything, and the same is true of the people of Iraq, Brazil, Bangladesh, South Africa. It is within our capacity to welcome refugees, children from foreign countries who grew up in our countries such as those threatened by the termination of #DACA, and far more. We can provide equal opportunity to all, update our infrastructure, distribute our wealth, provide universal education and health care, and grow our economy at the same time. This isn’t a republican or democrat, conservative or progressive, Christian, Christian or Bhuddist agenda – this is a human agenda we all share and it’s time to pull up our sleeves. The truth is, we can have and be the best of both worlds at the same time. There is no either or, there’s no left or right here, there’s simply a question of whether or not we’re willing to get the job done we know needs doing.Everywhere I have been, there is one thing I have heard repeated ― one positive attitude and unspoken rule that united those at the front lines, whether at #OperationBBQRelief or deep in the hardest-hit areas of southeast Texas, Baghdad, Karachi or refugee camps. It is that politics, racism and divisiveness have no place here. It is a universal understanding that when we come together to help each other, there’s no time for needless divisiveness. We’re too busy getting the job done.I already know where my politics stand. I have none. It’s you and me, and this is our world, and we’re either gonna get wet and do the work, or we’re gonna stand on the sidelines senselessly arguing and wasting energy with fictitious sides and party agendas. For my part, I’m going to live at the front lines, and go across the world with my hands to help, my guitar and fiddle to lift spirits, and a new docu series I’m making as I go called “borderless,” to tell the story of a world of heroes who are ready to make change like no generation before."

There is no either or, there’s no left or right here, there’s simply a question of whether or not we’re willing to get the job done we know needs doing.Everywhere I have been, there is one thing I have heard repeated ― one positive attitude and unspoken rule that united those at the front lines, whether at #OperationBBQRelief or deep in the hardest-hit areas of southeast Texas, Baghdad, Karachi or refugee camps. It is that politics, racism and divisiveness have no place here. It is a universal understanding that when we come together to help each other, there’s no time for needless divisiveness. We’re too busy getting the job done.I already know where my politics stand. I have none. It’s you and me, and this is our world, and we’re either gonna get wet and do the work, or we’re gonna stand on the sidelines senselessly arguing and wasting energy with fictitious sides and party agendas. For my part, I’m going to live at the front lines, and go across the world with my hands to help, my guitar and fiddle to lift spirits, and a new docu series I’m making as I go called “borderless,” to tell the story of a world of heroes who are ready to make change like no generation before."

Trump, who did not have the courage to make the announcement on DACA himself and instead had his anti-immigrant Attorney General Jeff Sessions do it, is attempting to shift responsibility from his cruel and irresponsible decision.Lawmakers from both parties urged Trump not to rescind the program, with Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan saying that “I actually don’t think he should do that,” when asked if he supported Trump in his efforts to end DACA.In the past, lawmakers have struggled to pass even limited forms of immigration reform. Republican opposition and the defection of six Democratic senators defeated the Dream Act, a bill that would have provided legal status to young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children . A broader comprehensive immigration reform bill that included immigration enforcement measures was defeated in 2013.Due to a legislative process that has stalled and the reality of a broken immigration system, the Obama administration implemented the DACA program as a way of providing relief to the immigrant community.Since then research has shown that DACA has increased the wages and labor force participation of recipients, reduced the number of undocumented immigrant households living in poverty, and increased the mental health of recipients. There are no known major negative impacts from DACA on native-born workers, with most statistics saying that DACA has benefitted the economy.DACA recipients have become productive members of society while following rigorous standards and fees set for them to qualify for the program. They trusted the federal government with their information and now they have been betrayed by the country they call home.A memo by the Department of Homeland Security states that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will have access to this information if needed for a deportation procedure. “Information provided to USCIS in DACA requests will not be proactively provided to ICE and CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings, unless the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice to Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS’ Notice to Appear guidance,” said the statement.This means that immigration agencies won’t actively be going after DACA recipients but if ICE requests their information, it will be provided for deportation procedures.There are several bills right now in Congress that would provide much needed relief for young undocumented immigrants whose lives are now in turmoil. These include the Dream Act, which would benefit those who came to the U.S before the age of 18 and lived in the country for four years prior to the bill taking effect, and the harsher Recognizing America’s Children Act (RAC Act), which would apply for those who came to the U.S. at age 15 or younger before 2012.While lawmakers from both parties seem to agree that something must be done to protect young undocumented immigrants, Republicans who have assured Dreamers repeatedly that a legislative solution to their predicament will be reached are already looking to place conditions for their support.These conditions vary from cutting legal immigration by attaching provisions from an anti-immigrant bill called the RAISE Act, to securing funding for Trump’s southern border wall, to strengthening Trump’s deportation force by hiring more border patrol and ICE agents.It seems the Trump administration is playing politics with the lives of 800,000 of some of the most productive members of our society. He is threatening to break up families and uproot the lives of youths who call this country home. It’s time for legislators to do their job and fix our broken immigration system in a humane and compassionate manner.Thomas Kennedy is a communication fellow for the Center for Community Change."

We’re not only concerned for our safety, but we worry about our family, friends and pets too.We sincerely appreciate the prayers and thoughts that people send through social ― it’s truly the positive side of the internet. What’s not needed is those who judge and nag us as if they believe we would put our family at risk or danger.The entire state of Florida is under a state of emergency. The fact is, making a rash decision ― as some did from our area ― only caused them to have to turn around and go elsewhere. Storms change. Some people in North Florida quickly ran to St. Petersburg or Tampa only to be evacuated to yet another direction. With gas being very hard to come by, this can be more pressure.So when outsiders email, call, text and nag us about “When are you leaving?” or “Why haven’t you left?” or “You need to do this or that,” you may mean well, but it can be frustrating and only adds to an already difficult time. When you’re across the country and have never been in a storm like this, please try to trust that we are well aware of our time frame to leave and are listening to our local news on where the safest areas are at this point.If you want to help your friends and family during this time, support them emotionally. In speaking with many of my South Florida friends, they are hunkering down and riding it out. Let’s remember not everyone can jump up and just leave. It’s also a fact that some people have homes that are now built to sustain these winds and hurricane forces. We don’t know everyone’s situation, and maybe they don’t want to share it on social.Let’s not shame or insult them ― let’s give them tips to survive this.Someone shared this on Facebook:We also have to be concerned about our friends and family on the West Coast of Florida (Naples and Tampa) area that weren’t expecting this to be so harsh for them. Reach out with some cyber love, not digital judgement. Remind them to stay in their interior rooms and have their phones charged. Be sure all objects outside their home are brought inside. Don’t forget to take pictures of your home (inside and out) and your car.It’s time to stop telling people to just leave if they’re not able to.Also, let them know that it’s okay to eat as much junk food as they want! It’s the best stress reliever.Keep your bathtubs full (for flushing toilets), fill all of your pitchers, have your important papers in Ziploc bags, put them in the washer/dryer or dishwasher, A/C experts advise to turn your air conditioner off during the hurricane, be careful after the storm ― for wires that may be down ― and we will get through this. We are #FloridaStrong.Do you have a tip? Please leave it in comments.Be safe.Follow me on Twitter and join me on Facebook."
10,POLITICS,Liberal Groups Push Democrats To Slow Down Judge Confirmation Process,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/liberal-groups-credo-democrats-slow-trump-judges_us_59b41c38e4b0dfaafcf83833,Activists insist the party can drag out the process.,2017-09-09,Progressive activists want Sen. Dianne Feinstein to lead a more aggressive fight against President Donald Trump's nominees to the federal judiciary.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b41db318000021001a23da.jpeg?cache=idqQ3sYWqJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A coalition of major progressive organizations has launched a campaign aimed at pressuring members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to slow down the confirmation process for federal judges, thereby limiting how many President Donald Trump can seat.“Tell the Senate Judiciary Committee: No lifetime judicial appointments for a white supremacist in chief with no respect for the Constitution or the rule of law,” Credo, one of the groups leading the charge, told activists. The coalition ― which also includes Democracy for America, Color of Change and UltraViolet ― plans to deliver petition signatures to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) sometime next week. The groups started their campaign on Wednesday, and expect to collect hundreds of thousands of signatures.The groups are mainly targeting Democrats, but they also hope some Republicans who have been critical of the president, such as Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), will consider the appeal as well. They acknowledge that Democrats are limited in their ability to actually prevent the Senate from confirming conservative judges if Republican committee members remain united behind Trump’s nominees. Senate rules have forbidden the minority party from filibustering presidential nominees to the federal bench since 2013, when then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) ended the practice. Reid and other Democrats had grown frustrated with Republican efforts to obstruct then-President Barack Obama’s judicial nominees. Instead, the progressive organizations plan to convince Democrats to throw up more procedural hurdles to judges’ confirmation, according to Heidi Hess, Credo’s senior campaign manager. This would limit the total number of judges that can be seated in a given year. “We want them to slow it down as much as they can,” Hess told HuffPost. “They should at least be speaking out about this, making it clear what’s happening so it’s not just the case that this is happening under the radar.”For example, Credo and its allies are asking Democrats to more consistently withhold so-called “blue slips.” The Judiciary Committee does not usually begin confirmation hearings until the senators from the home state of a federal judiciary nominee turn over blue slips of paper signaling their consent that the process proceed.Some Senate Democrats are already showing greater willingness to challenge Trump’s judicial nominees by withholding these pieces of paper.Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley of Oregon announced Thursday in a letter to the White House that they would not return blue slips for Ryan Bounds, an assistant U.S. attorney in their state whom Trump has nominated to a vacant seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.Wyden and Merkley objected to the Trump White House allegedly not consulting with them before selecting the nominee. That represents a departure from “Oregon’s long bipartisan tradition of working together to identify the most qualified candidates for judicial vacancies,” they said.  Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), himself a member of the Judiciary Committee, also announced Tuesday that he would not return a blue slip for David Stras, a Trump nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit.Other Democrats have been more cooperative with the nomination process, however. Sens. Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan returned blue slips for Joan Larsen, a state Supreme Court justice whom Trump has nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) returned a blue slip for Allison Eid, a Colorado Supreme Court justice nominated to the 10th Circuit. And Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) cleared the way for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame University law professor picked to sit on the 7th Circuit.Credo and company blame that kind of permissive conduct for the historically fast clip at which Trump has managed to seat federal judges.Trump had seated 27 federal judges as of mid-July ― three times the number that Obama had confirmed by the same point in time, The Washington Post reports, citing former Obama aide Ron Klain. Returning blue slips pertains to all members of the Senate Democratic Caucus. But Credo says Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, beginning with Feinstein, must lead by making their views known.Hess said the group plans to pressure Senate Democratic leadership to strip Feinstein of her privileges as ranking member if Democrats do not fight these nominations more aggressively. Credo has already started a petition calling on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to replace her, but it is not being circulated very widely. Activists have been so focused on stopping legislative initiatives like Obamacare repeal that the courts have not gotten the scrutiny they merit, according to Hess. “As we can see from the courts’ block on the Muslim ban, the courts are super important for standing up for progressive values, civil rights, women’s rights, defending the environment,” Hess said.“The stakes are really high, as we see it,” she added. “But there’s so much going on that the courts haven’t gotten much attention.”"

There, water nearly flooded over fences surrounding their reptiles, threatening their enclosure.At Gatorland, where the largest gators are 14-feet long, Hileman insisted that even if one of their eight-feet-tall fences gets destroyed or blown away, “they are still not getting off of this property.”That’s even with most of the gators preparing to ride out the storm in their outside pools. Many of the park’s other residents ― including panthers, bobcats, goats, birds, raccoons and snakes ― had to be moved inside, he said.Videos taken inside the park on Saturday showed Gatorland employees carrying pythons around their shoulders and legs as they moved the reptiles to secure facilities. Another video showed what appeared to be dozens of baby gators being moved into a fresh pool of water.Then there was Bullet, one of the park’s smaller gators that was born with just three legs. That little guy was filmed relocating alongside employee Savannah Boan.“Come on, let’s go for a walk!” she cheerfully called to him as he shuffled at her feet.The moves came as South Florida braces for maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. As of Saturday evening, Central Florida is expected to see major flooding from rain as well as structural damage to buildings due to high winds, according to the National Weather Service.Hileman, however, assured that they’re ready for anything.In addition to the fences surrounding the property, the grounds are equipped with a water pumping system, which would allow employees to lower the water levels if it gets too high. A five-person team will also stay on the property throughout the storm, allowing them to monitor its fences should they fall or get destroyed, he said.“Once the winds are around 30-35 mph, they’ll go out to check perimeter fences,” Hileman said.In a video posted to Facebook Friday evening, the park’s president and CEO Mark McHugh posed with several gators along a packed shoreline where he repeated the assurance: “None of our animals are getting out.”“We’ve been fighting big hurricanes and nasty storms since 1949,” he said, referencing the date the park first opened. “If you see an alligator floating down the street right by your house, it ain’t ours. Don’t call us. Call the Florida Fish and Wildlife Department.”"

The property has a flood insurance policy through the National Flood Insurance Program, a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson told HuffPost. The program provides affordable insurance in flood-prone zones where private insurers have traditionally refused to insure properties because they’re so vulnerable.The Mar-a-Lago club’s policy, which is insured to the Trump Organization and Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, is not subsidized and is classified at a full-risk rate for the applicable flood zone, the FEMA spokesperson said. A property covered at the “full-risk” rate means that its owner is paying a rate that reflects the full risk of flooding up to a certain coverage amount. Older properties can be “subsidized,” meaning their rates do not necessarily reflect the full risk for those properties. The 1968-era National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, offers a mix of rates. The insurance program’s authorization was set to expire at the end of this month, but Trump signed legislation on Friday that temporarily extends it. NFIP as a whole has been criticized for not charging enough to cover the expected costs of liabilities. It also consistently does not bring in enough money to pay out the properties it insures, and owes around $25 billion to the U.S. Treasury. Based on policies that went into effect on Aug. 31, 2016, the program is projected to have a one-year shortfall of $1.4 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report published this month. Some critics say the program benefits affluent people who live on beachfront property, essentially allowing them to live in places that are at a high risk of being damaged. “If [NFIP] was a regular insurance company, they would have been in receivership,” Burl Daniel, an insurance expert witness from Texas, told HuffPost. “But it’s a political football because of the people who live on the coast.” “The program was already in trouble” before Hurricanes Harvey and Irma began approaching the U.S., said Karen O’Neill, an associate professor at Rutgers University who studies how policies about land and water affect government power. “It became super in trouble after Katrina, and Sandy was another blow,” O’Neill said. Mar-a-Lago, Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach and Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter are all closed in advance of Irma, a Trump Organization spokesperson said. (She did not respond to the question about insurance.) Irma, one of the largest storms ever recorded, is expected to hit Florida this weekend.Mar-a-Lago has weathered hurricanes before. According to an Associated Press investigation, Trump claimed that he received a $17 million insurance payout for the estate in 2005 due to damage from a series of storms, but said he pocketed some of the money instead of using it to rebuild. Trump once boasted in a deposition that he had a “very good insurance policy,” apparently in reference to private insurance. (The FEMA spokesperson declined to comment on whether Mar-a-Lago was also insured by NFIP at the time, as that is “not publicly available information.”) Mar-a-Lago, which Trump bought for $10 million in 1985, could see its main buildings damaged by an 8-foot storm surge, according to the AP. Thirty years from now, the property could be under at least a foot of water for most of the year, according to a risk analysis prepared for the Guardian.A group of Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill in June that specifically aimed to block Trump properties from receiving any federal subsidy for flood insurance coverage. The name of the bill ― the Prohibiting Aid for Recipients Ignoring Science, or Paris, Act ― riffs off the Paris climate accord, an agreement from which Trump withdrew that same month.As FEMA noted, the NFIP policy for Mar-a-Lago isn’t explicitly subsidized. (HuffPost did not ask the agency about policy details for other Trump-owned properties in Florida.) But Democrats say the Paris Act, which is not expected to pass anytime soon, is about the larger principle. “It would be outrageous for somebody who is denying the reality of climate, who is undercutting our ability to minimize the effects, to then turn around and be a recipient of federal largess,” said Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who introduced the House bill.“We need to stop building in places where nature shows repeatedly that they’re not wanted,” he added. “We need to stop making it worse, and we need to put in place programs to try and minimize damage.” "

19,QUEER VOICES,Out Pentatonix Duo Superfruit Defends Friend Todrick Hall Amidst Taylor Swift Backlash,"Pollo Del Mar , ContributorDrag queen on the SF social, political, editorial and fundrais...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/superfruit-defends-todrick-hall_us_59b44cabe4b0bef3378ce0d7,“People are always going to disagree with you.”,2017-09-09,"<p>Scott Hoying and Mitch Grassi of Superfruit prep for the Sept. 15 release of EP <em>Future Friends, Part Two.</em></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b4500618000027001a2411.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Social media has not been kind to Todrick Hall. A role in Taylor Swift’s record-smashing video “Look What You Made Me Do” has seen the star dubbed a “sellout” — or worse — by critics. Fortunately, some of Hall’s high-profile friends are coming to his defense. Scott Hoying and Mitch Grassi, who have collaborated with Hall both as part of platinum-selling Pentatonix and pop duo Superfruit, addressed the controversy during the latest episode of Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. “If my best friend, who was a huge pop star, asked me to shoot a music video with her, I would say ‘yes,’” Hoying said emphatically on Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBT Podcast.Hoying and Grassi first connected with Hall professionally in 2013, when Pentatonix was featured on the singer’s “The Wizard of Ahhhs.” The three, all of whom are gay, have remained friends since. Superfruit expressed empathy for his predicament.“It’s bound to happen with anyone and everyone,” said Grassi of those in the entertainment industry coming under public scrutiny. “People are always going to disagree with you.”Earlier this year as Superfruit, Hoying and Grassi (with BFF and fellow Pentatonix member Kirstin Maldanado) were featured on “Black & White,” a release from Hall’s lauded visual album Straight Outta Oz. Now promoting the release of the duo’s second EP of 2017 — Future Friends, Part Two, due Sept. 15 — the men admit it’s difficult to watch their colleague torn down openly.“I don’t know what he did wrong,” said Hoying. “But I’ve been seeing it all over Twitter, people dragging him for it.”WATCH: Superfruit “Future Friends” Music VideoSince its debut, Hall’s extended appearance in LWYMMD — which broke viewing and streaming records upon its debut and promotes Taylor’s forthcoming album Reputation — has more than 285 million YouTube clicks. Unfortunately for the multi-talented performer, blowback for his involvement was, well, swift. What would seemingly be an exuberant time for most turned into a social media nightmare for the recording artist, RuPaul’s Drag Race and Broadway star. Online critics, Beyonce fans in particular, decried LWYMMD for visual similarities to The Queen’s “Formation.” Others attacked Hall directly for a perceived desire to Bey, mhm, be “white adjacent.” “It boggles my mind that people are deciding whether or not I’m down enough, black enough, or woke enough,” Hall clapped back at detractors during a recent interview with Yahoo. “If I have to hate people and judge people based on their race, sexual orientation or religion,” continued Hall, who claims Beyonce as his “favorite artist of all-time” and, ironically, choreographed her 2013 “Blow” music video, “Then sorry.”WATCH: “Black & White” By Todrick Hall Feat. Superfruit + Kirstin Maladano After meeting Swift in 2015, when the superstar publicly praised his work, the two became fast friends. After spending Thanksgiving 2016 together, Hall started this year with critical praise for Straight Outta Oz, starred as “Lola” in the Broadway production of Kinky Boots and sat on the RuPaul’s Drag Race judging panel. A key role in the biggest event video of the year would seem the pinnacle of achievement for the rising star, who also boasts a popular YouTube channel and American Idol credits. Negativity toward his involvement might have dampened Hall’s excitement, but Hoying does not fully understand the audience response. “We’ve met Taylor Swift, and she’s like the sweetest girl ever,” he told me during our interview. “I can see how they’re really close friends, so we’ve always supported it.” While the general populace have questioned Hall’s decision-making, Superfruit sees things through a performer’s eyes. It comes with the territory, Grassi suggested. “You have to make bold choices sometimes in your career,” he stated. “What would he have differently?” Hoying asks, calling for those lobbing accusations to see the matter from Hall’s perspective. “If someone was in his position, would they have said no?” he concluded. “Who would have said no? How do you fault him for that?” Superfruit’s Future Friends, Part Two is available Sept. 15. Future Friends, Part One is available now.  Hoying and Grassi rejoin Pentatonix for a series of Holiday concerts and an NBC TV special later this year. *WRITER’S NOTE: As my last celebrity interview with bisexual wrestler Anthony Bowens was so popular, many other sites & “journalists” posted it almost verbatim, please carefully reword and/or restructure this piece should you “borrow” from it.

20,WORLD NEWS,"In Syria’s War, ‘Mental Health Is The Last Priority’","Alexandra Bradford, Syria Deeply",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-syrias-war-mental-health-is-the-last-priority_us_59b316f9e4b0dfaafcf810f7,"Zaher Sahloul, a physician with the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), discusses the state of mental healthcare in Syria",2017-09-08,A drawing by a Syrian child depicting what life was life before the crisis and what life is like now in Syria.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b317eb18000021001a2306.jpeg?cache=MoIVI9Ieja&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Zaher Sahloul, a physician with the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), discusses the state of mental healthcare in Syria, the psychological impact of the conflict and what initiatives must be taken to address the country’s mental health crisis.AFTER SIX YEARS of conflict and extended exposure to trauma, Syria is in the throes of a mental health crisis, according to Chicago-based physician Dr. Zaher Sahloul, a Syrian-American trauma specialist and former president of the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS).Thousands of civilians live in besieged areas, like the Eastern Ghouta suburb of Damascus, without access to sufficient food, medicine or other basic supplies. In other areas, bombs and airstrikes not only compromise infrastructure by reducing homes to rubble, they also kill loved ones. In some Syrian towns, civilians endure both these hardships and many others.Sahloul, who has traveled to Syria 14 times since the conflict began to provide medical care, has been a firsthand witness to the war’s impact on mental health.“There has been a huge increase in psychological trauma since the start of the crisis, including depression and anxiety. Especially among the vulnerable populations, which include children, women, the elderly and the disabled,” Sahloul said.Untreated mental health issues can lead to addiction, domestic violence, the disintegration of families and may even make adolescents susceptible to recruitment from gangs and terror groups, he added.Syria Deeply spoke with Sahloul about the stigma associated with psychological illnesses in Syria, the impact of trauma on children and how to address the country’s mental health crisis.Syria Deeply: What was the mental health situation like in Syria before the crisis?Zaher Sahloul: Mental healthcare is not very developed in Syria. Before the crisis there were around 100 psychiatrists in Syria for 22 million people. Only five of those were child psychiatrists, and there were very few psychologists and community mental health specialists. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 50 percent of physicians have fled Syria because of the war, so when you extrapolate that, there are now maybe 50 psychiatrists still in Syria.In Syria, people are stigmatized if they have mental health issues. People who suffer from even common mental health conditions like anxiety or depression refuse to seek help or take medication because of the stigma that they will receive from their family members and society. People with mental health conditions are called “majnun,” which means crazy in Arabic.Culturally, mental health is viewed as being related to the satanic. People who have mental health issues are believed to be possessed by a demon, and therefore people seek treatment by going to the local imam or priest, where religious rituals are performed or herbal medication is given.Mental health issues are often presented as a physical illness, so instead of saying that they are suffering from anxiety or depression, patients will complain to a healthcare provider that they have back, neck or abdomen pain. The physician will treat these symptoms instead of the underlying issue of anxiety or depression. This does not treat mental health problems.These cultural issues [in addition to] a lack of education among many Syrian groups means that the idea that mental health needs to be addressed like other medical issues, with treatment and medication, is not common knowledge. This is why people do not seek early treatment and why they refuse to take medications. This stigma also led to a lack of funding for mental health programs or training for people to become counselors or psychologists, so there were no local heroes for mental health [treatment] in Syria.Syria Deeply: Have mental health problems increased with the Syrian crisis and if so, how has this impacted healthcare?Sahloul: There has been a huge increase in psychological trauma since the start of the crisis, including depression and anxiety. Especially among the vulnerable populations, which include children, women, the elderly and the disabled. This increase stems from the violence they have witnessed, the loss of family members, the loss of their homes, the lack of food and displacement.Syria Deeply: Why are the most vulnerable populations most impacted by mental health issues?Sahloul: I think that because of societal expectations, non-vulnerable populations, like men who are expected to be tough, are less likely to [display] symptoms of depression and anxiety. They are expected to behave in a certain way and therefore they adapt differently. But children cannot adapt to PTSD or anxiety, so they show clear symptoms like bed-wetting, nightmares and social withdrawal. We are seeing the same thing with women and elderly people.Syria Deeply: What impact has six years of war had on the mental health and brain development of children?Sahloul: There are multiple factors that affect the development of brain function and mental health in children in Syria. There is extreme stress related to violence, the loss of family members and witnessing multiple episodes of destruction of your home and neighborhood. During my last trip to Aleppo, I saw a little boy who told me that he was depressed because he couldn’t go to school. For children, school is a mechanism for normality, because it is a place to meet with friends and focus on studying instead of focusing on the bombings going on around them. The lack of schooling adds to the stress for children.Children who live under siege not only lack access to schooling, but also lack access to proper food. In Ghouta, there are 400,000 people living under siege, and children account for half of that population. They don’t have access to proper food, so children are eating grass, leaves and they have also been forced to eat cats and dogs. This is traumatic because eating cat or dog isn’t allowed in Islam, but they have no choice. When I was last in Aleppo I went to an orphanage, and one of the children was worried that they would be forced to eat grass and leaves like the children in Ghouta.All of these things add up and cause issues with mental development and mental health. My suspicion is that we will see widespread incidents of mental health problems developing in the areas where children witness bombings and violence. For children, this can have a lasting impact on their lives because, left untreated, mental health issues can affect how they interact with people: They can increase domestic violence, addiction, and job loss, and make these children fertile ground for recruitment to gangs and terrorist groups who exploit mental health conditions.Syria Deeply: How do terrorist groups exploit mental health problems among adolescents?Sahloul: Children who are withdrawn because they have lost family members and no longer have family support, and because of psychological trauma, can fall prey to terror groups who promise them the support systems that they are lacking. These terror groups indoctrinate them [in a way] that makes it easier to deal with mental health issues, such as the belief in ultimate victory or promises of an afterlife. This is a strong coping mechanism for societies where religion plays a major factor, and terrorists use this indoctrination to deal with mental health issues within their group. Sometimes people with mental health problems who display aggression will gravitate towards groups that promote violence because these groups allow them to vent their aggression through violence.Syria Deeply: How can the mental health crisis be addressed in both adults and children in Syria?Sahloul: It is a matter of resources and priorities. If we don’t address the mental health crisis early, the scars will stay for a long time and it will be [more] difficult to treat, especially in children. It is very important that when there are bombings, violence, grief over the loss of immediate family members, that psychiatric aid and counseling are provided right away.The WHO and U.N. agencies have to prioritize mental health among Syrians, and the same goes for the Syrian government and the opposition, who control some parts of Syria. Right now, mental health is not a priority for the U.N. agencies and WHO because the crisis in Syria is relentless, and there is a lack of resources. When you are in a country at war, mental health is the last priority.Right now, we need to study this crisis to understand what is going on in the camps and within Syria, and then try to figure out the most effective tools to address this. We need a Marshall Plan for how to address mental health in Syria and then we need to tackle it by starting with the most vulnerable populations.We can start by addressing the lack of mental health professionals by having more scholarships and directing more efforts at encouraging people to have careers in this profession. My organization, SAMS, started a teaching-recovery techniques program in the Syrian refugee camps in Greece, where we trained community leaders, such as teachers, to recognize and address mental health issues. Programs like this can be very helpful.This interview has been edited for length and clarity. It originally appeared on Syria Deeply, and you can find the original here.

It set her on a path of scientific study",2017-09-08,"Displaced women carry firewood in a camp on the outskirts of Baidoa, Somalia, March 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b319771700001f00f520fe.jpeg?cache=KhKnlf8hyi&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Growing up in a refugee camp, Sayah Bogor saw that disease can be as deadly as war. It set her on a path of scientific study, medical research and of one day, she hopes, becoming a doctor. Now a 24-year-old refugee in the U.S., she describes her journey into medicine.I KNEW FROM a very young age that I wanted to understand what made people sick and use that understanding to save them. Growing up in a refugee camp in Kenya, I noticed how more people passed away from sickness than any of the violence I had witnessed fleeing war.I was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, where my earliest memories are filled with sunshine, family and lots of love.Then, when I was five years old, my family was split apart. Violence was growing in Somalia, so my father and two older brothers went to America, while the rest of us planned to follow shortly after. But fighting broke out before we could leave, and my mother, younger brother and I had to flee for Kenya. I spent many nights walking and many days hiding until we reached a refugee camp in Nairobi.When I look back at my childhood I categorize all of my memories into two parts: before America and after. I have done this in order to put all of my most painful memories into a box that is only opened when I need to reach back and remember.Even though I was only five when I arrived in Kenya, I no longer considered myself a child. I was forced to grow up too soon by the atrocities I had seen and the trauma of running away from the only home I had ever known.Like many others in the camp, my mother fell ill. She continued to be ill with various sicknesses for the majority of the time we were in Nairobi. I became the caregiver for both her and my younger brother.My daily schedule over the next two years went like clockwork. I would wake up as early as I could and stand guard for my mother and younger brother. Refugee camps can be dangerous places for women alone with young children, so in order to protect us I kept close watch and if anyone came near I screamed and made as much noise as possible to keep them away from my family.Those were the worst moments of my life, standing in the heat all day praying that this day would not be my last on Earth. The happiest moment in the camp was the day I heard from a worker that my father had been in contact with them, and we would all get to leave very soon.My father had spent two years searching for us. He called all the camps in the area trying to find out where we had ended up, or if we had made it out of Somalia at all. By this time, Somalia was in chaos, and many people were fleeing to nearby countries, making it incredibly difficult to locate three people among the masses.Once we received our visas and plane tickets my mother, younger brother and I flew for the first time and landed in New York City. We then moved to Arizona because I had developed asthma in the camp, and doctors said I should relocate to a warmer climate. I spent my first few years growing accustomed to American culture and trying to move on from my old life and begin a new one.I was always a curious child. Anything that was put together I tried to take apart so I could learn how it worked. When I took my first in-depth biology class in high school, everything clicked. In order to understand what makes people sick I needed to understand how our bodies work. I poured myself into the sciences, completing a bachelor’s in science from Arizona State University and a master’s in public health in infectious diseases and vaccinology from University of California, Berkeley.I wanted to understand how, in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene like refugee camps, infectious agents spread much more quickly, giving rise to rampant sickness and death. I was lucky enough to receive the Subir Choudhury Fellowship, which allowed me to study diarrheal diseases and multidrug resistant urinary tract infections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Having seen firsthand as a child how these diseases kill, I want to understand how to better prevent these deaths. In this way, becoming a refugee has shaped the rest of my life.My dream is to go to medical school. I know that many people say they want to be a surgeon or a pediatrician, but I know better than most that nothing in life is guaranteed. While I have asylum in the U.S. I do not yet have full citizenship, which makes applying to medical school difficult and financially risky.If I do make it, the best day of my life will be the day I present my parents with my medical diploma and show them that all of their struggle wasn’t for nothing and that it is because of them I am alive and happy today.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply, and you can find the original here.

Violence in the region has hindered aid convoys from delivering desperately needed medical supplies. The next closest hospitals are in the town of Tal Abyad, more than 50 miles away.“Conditions in Raqqa are truly unthinkable ... it’s hell on earth,” Dr. Homer Venters, director of programs at PHR, said Friday. The small staff at Raqqa’s National Hospital have so few resources that they’ve resorted to sanitizing wounds with water and salt, he added. “The stories coming out of Raqqa right now are truly nightmarish,” said Racha Mouawieh, PHR’s lead Syria researcher. “The city has been under nearly continuous bombardment since June, demolishing hospitals and clinics. Raqqa is a deathtrap where civilians who have already suffered for years under ISIS rule now also suffer the deadly consequences of the fight against ISIS.”Last year, Syrian medical facilities were attacked more than 250 times. The seemingly targeted strikes have left many citizens who are in need of medical treatment too fearful to go to a hospital, a Raqqa-based clinician told PHR.The medical specialist, whose name has been withheld to protect his identity, says he attempted to flee the city with his daughter after his house was destroyed by a coalition strike. A land mine exploded, injuring him and killing his daughter.“You can hear about it, but you will never imagine it. Living it is not like hearing about it. This is beyond imagination,” he told PHR. “We had nothing to do with anything in Raqqa, and we are paying the highest price. This is indescribable. There is misery at every level.”"
23,WORLD NEWS,"As I Prepare To Hunker Down For Hurricane Irma, Here's My Letter From Her Target","Madeleine Burnside, ContributorEditor, The Sanity Papers",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/letter-from-irma-day-0_us_59b3104ae4b0c50640cd6742,Here's what I'm seeing on the ground.,2017-09-08,"<p>Dawn on Day Zero from the seawall at Bryant Park, Lake Worth, FL.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b310991700003c00f520db.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Irma has not yet touched Florida but we can feel it coming. It’s been a sunny day with a breeze that’s just a bit too strong. I live about half a mile west of the Intracoastal. To the east is Palm Beach proper (known locally as “the island” in the snobbish way New Yorkers talk about Manhattan as “the city” as though no other such place exists).Mar-a-Lago is six miles north of my house by car, closer as the egret flies. I assume all the King’s men have it buttoned up pretty tight. Locals joke about storming the palace after Irma comes through to demand shelter and fine dining if things go bad here. Anyway, Palm Beach is a barrier island ― I just want it to do its job. A day ago, the eye was scheduled to come right over our heads, but now the track has drifted west of Lake Okeechobee. Good for us; bad for Key West, Orlando, and Tampa. The only rule hurricanes observe is that wherever they seem to be headed a few days out is not where they plan to end up. If you know this, it feels safer to be the target for a while, knowing it will shift. Now I’m just worried it will shift back.I’m staying home for the hurricane. Do I think it’s dangerous? Sure. Yes. Somewhat. But, when I lived in Key West, my job was such that I had to stay, so I got really used to these storms. My worst fear? Running out of gas in bumper-to-bumper traffic going north for no very good reason. The sage advice is, if you’re not in an evacuation zone, don’t clog up the roads. You are better off in your home, as long as you’re satisfied that it’s sturdy and you’ve had time to gather resources. My house was built in 1925 out of Dade County pine ― wood so strong that it was logged to extinction. The house is elevated several feet from ground level and I trust those old guys to have known what they were doing.Still, for Irma, I might have evacuated if it was just me, but my friend who lives in the other part of my duplex used to be a sailor. She went through Hurricane Hugo on a boat in the Caribbean―she feels she knows from hurricanes and prefers to take care of any problems as they arise. Between us we have two dogs and two parrots―there are many reasons we are staying.This is not Houston. I feel terrible for those people. What a hideous mess. Lives ruined, the whole city will remain a disaster zone for quite a while. When Key West experienced a storm surge my house was on one of the higher parts of the island, and the seven or so inches of water we had flowed right under it and was gone in minutes. In lower parts of the island people got twenty-six inches and had to tear out their sheetrock and redo their electrical wiring―and that water came and went quickly. Still nothing like Houston. Having your house, streets, and everything else flooded as the rain continues to fall is a whole different kettle of stinking fish and sewage. Houston is a bowl. You stand in the middle of it and admire the surrounding hills. A flood there is a serious, devastating, and lingering event.I took the dogs to the park for a run at 6:45 this morning, just as the dawn came up. They’ve been bored and antsy because we’ve not had time to take them for proper walks in the past two days.There’s a lot more to storm prep than putting up shutters. If you have a yard (my friend and I share a big one) every useful and/or decorative thing you have needs to come indoors. Two glass-topped tables and all the chairs. Flower pots. The Buddha statue. Tools that usually live outside have to be squeezed into the shed.Preparing for a hurricane is like preparing for a visit from meticulous in-laws. I’ve reorganized the freezer, thrown the science projects out of the fridge, and developed a meal plan. I’ve vacuumed and cleaned―who knows when any appliances will work again? I’ll do it again Saturday night, more anxiously. I’ve got water, eggs, and avocados. And I’m a nervous knosher. To hold anxiety at bay I’ve got chocolate, nuts, and candied ginger. I’ve made ice, ice, ice, and cleaned the giant cooler that I’ve had since Key West days. I’ve got a case of excellent Spanish red―the neighbors are staying and we plan a barbecue after Irma passes.I’ve got extra propane for the grill, army-grade flashlights, new lanterns, lots of batteries (thank you, Amazon), work gloves, a chain saw, and the usual garden snippers and loppers as well as hammers, cordless screw-guns, wrenches, and fasteners.I have crocs to wade through puddles ― wellies get swamped; crocs drain with every step. I’ve got a yellow sou’wester jacket ― a long coat catches the wind and flaps soggily against your legs. I’ve got oversized silk shirts that dry quickly, comfy shorts, and I know when it’s better to go into my yard naked and when I need to cover every inch because there are shattered poisonwood leaves everywhere—mango trees shed some of the worst.I’ve gassed up the car and I’m charging all the electronics. Did I forget something? If so, Momma Irma will notice it and make me pay for my weakness.The unsuspected news on hurricanes is that when you are not scared, you are tired and bored. That eight to twelve hours of howling passes slowly, minute by minute unless you’re rushing towels to a window or mopping the floor. It grinds at you, bullying the trees, fingering the doors, leering through any uncovered glass, and the wind calls like a siren while spreading garbage.Rain, endless rain blows sideways―hard.This blog was previously published on www.SanityPapers.com, September 8. 2017"

Officials blame Rohingya militants for killing non-Muslims and burning their homes.“The two refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar in southeast Bangladesh – home to nearly 34,000 Rohingya refugees before this influx – are now bursting at the seams. The population has more than doubled in two weeks, totaling more than 70,000. There is an urgent need for more land and shelters,” UNHCR said in a briefing note for reporters in Geneva.“The vast majority are women, including mothers with newborn babies, families with children. They arrive in poor condition, exhausted, hungry and desperate for shelter.”The United Nations was expecting a total refugee influx of 300,000, up from a previous estimate of 120,000, an official told Reuters on Wednesday.The International Organization for Migration said the estimate of new arrivals had increased considerably partly because of an assessment on Sept. 6, when humanitarian workers visited more locations and found 75,000 newly arrived people in nine locations.There were 130,000 people in the registered refugee camps and three makeshift settlements, 90,000 in host communities, and “nearly 50,000 in new spontaneous settlements which are expanding quickly with people still searching for space to make temporary shelters”, an IOM statement said.“While most of Rohingya refugees arrive on foot, mostly walking through the jungle and mountains for several days, thousands are braving long and risky voyages across the rough seas of the Bay of Bengal,” UNHCR said.At least 300 boats arrived in Cox’s Bazar on Wednesday, IOM said."

Her tumor had returned and had spread despite 14 rounds of intensive chemotherapy and high doses of radiation therapy.As longtime researchers of pediatric solid tumors, Alberto and I both knew what this meant. This child’s chances of survival are now very slim.Despite better outcomes for adult solid tumor patients, we are often reminded that science and medicine have made little progress on these cancers in pediatric patients for the last 20 years. But at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, we’re doing something to change that.As a scientist at St. Jude, I’ve dedicated my career to helping understand rare childhood cancers—especially those with low survival rates. But finding cures for these tumors is not a solitary activity. True progress requires the collaboration of the best and brightest researchers worldwide.To accelerate movement toward cures, my colleagues and I have constructed the world’s most extensive collection of pediatric solid tumor samples and drug screening data. Now, through the Childhood Solid Tumor Network at St. Jude, we’re freely sharing those resources with scientists around the globe.Solid tumors of the bone, muscle, kidney, eye and other organs make up about 30 percent of all childhood cancers. Long-term survival rates for these tumors are lower than for many other pediatric cancers. Scientific resources such as patient tumor samples are also scarce.The Childhood Solid Tumor Network is changing that scenario. Our network gives researchers access to the world’s largest and most comprehensive collection of scientific resources for studying pediatric solid tumors and their related biology.The tumor samples, plus information about tumor drug sensitivity and related data, have all been generated at St. Jude with the help of our patients and families. The resources are available at no cost and carry no obligation to collaborate with St. Jude scientists.Since creating the network in 2013, we’ve distributed more than 800 tumor samples, along with detailed related information, to more than 130 investigators at 66 research centers. Those scientists are in the U.S. and 10 countries in Asia, Australia and Europe. Investigators are responsible only for shipping costs.While overall survival rates for young solid tumor patients are 75 percent, survival rates for patients whose tumors return have been stalled at less than 30 percent for more than 20 years. That’s unacceptable. We have to do better for these children.Since 2010, our researchers have produced almost 100 different solid tumors representing a dozen pediatric cancers. The list includes 18 new samples of the eye tumor retinoblastoma and another 20 new samples of the bone tumor osteosarcoma. That is an increase from the two cell lines widely used to study retinoblastoma and the five cell lines widely used to study osteosarcoma.The samples are from St. Jude patients. These samples were grown in laboratory models to help speed advances in understanding and treating the disease. An advisory panel oversees and responds to requests for access to the tumor samples and related information.Along with creating the network, we have developed a new method to use the tumors to identify drugs or drug combinations that show the most treatment potential. The resulting database includes more than 500,000 pieces of information about drug sensitivity alone. We believe it is the only searchable drug-sensitivity database for pediatric tumors that is free to the global biomedical research community.Research to advance our understanding and treatment of childhood solid tumors continues. The pediatric solid tumor repository is adding samples as new patients arrive at St. Jude and agree to participate.The Childhood Solid Tumor Network is a unique resource for the international biomedical research community. The work is a reflection of our mission at St. Jude, to find cures and save children ― which means sharing data, resources and expertise to advance biomedical research around the world.The network unites scientists and clinicians in a common goal: saving the lives of children around the globe. Our hope is that none of us has to deliver such heartbreaking news ever again.Authored by Michael A. Dyer, Ph.D.Michael A.

27,POLITICS,Democrats Target One Of Their Own For Remaining On Trump Voter Fraud Panel,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-gardner-new-hampshire-voter-fraud-commission_us_59b2fea1e4b0354e4411f55d,"They said he risks ""tarnishing"" his legacy.",2017-09-08,The state's entire congressional delegation has urged New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner to step down from the electoral commission.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b2ff282900003300485a18.jpeg?cache=mnnOrIeFWq&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner (D) faced calls from fellow Democrats this week to step down from the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity after Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) wrote an extremely misleading op-ed on Thursday claiming to have evidence of widespread voter fraud in New Hampshire.Both of the state’s Democratic senators, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen, urged Gardner to resign from the commission.“Secretary Gardner’s association with this partisan commission risks tarnishing his long legacy of fighting for the New Hampshire Primary and promoting voter participation, and it would be in keeping with his distinguished record to immediately relinquish any role with this commission,” the senators wrote in a statement on Thursday.New Hampshire’s two House members, Democratic Reps. Carol Shea-Porter and Annie Kuster, advised Gardner to step down on Friday.The Breitbart commentary by Kobach, who serves as vice chair of the electoral commission, has put Gardner in an awkward position. Kobach wrote to claim there was proof of voter fraud in New Hampshire. He cited data showing that some 5,000 people who had registered to vote on Election Day and identified themselves with out-of-state licenses had still failed to obtain New Hampshire driver’s licenses by the end of August of this year.The problem with that argument is that New Hampshire allows people to vote in the state who plan to live there only for a relatively brief period ― like college students, doctors completing their residencies, members of the military temporarily stationed there. Those same short-termers do not meet the requirements to get a New Hampshire driver’s license, which is available to people who intend to live in the state indefinitely.Gardner, who has been New Hampshire’s secretary of state since 1976 and is elected by state lawmakers, has refused to support Kobach’s claims about fraud. But he also declines to resign from the commission.“No, I’m not going to step down, and it’s hypocritical to ask me to step down as a member of a federal commission,” Gardner told WMUR. “Have they ever stepped down from a Senate committee or a committee that they serve on because they disagreed with someone on the committee?”Gardner is set to host the commission’s second public meeting in Manchester, New Hampshire, this coming Tuesday.All five Democrats serving on the commission have faced criticism. Voting rights advocates argue their presence legitimizes an effort to stir up false fears about voter fraud, which multiple studies and investigations have shown it is not a widespread problem in the U.S.Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who once served as chair of the Democratic National Committee, tweeted that New Hampshire should be stripped of its first-in-the-nation primary unless Gardner steps down.A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee did not immediately return a request for comment.Aside from his work on the commission, Gardner has also faced criticism for supporting a Republican-backed state bill to tighten the proof of identity that voters have to present when they register in New Hampshire. The bill was passed after President Donald Trump claimed without evidence that thousands were bused into New Hampshire to vote illegally in November. Gardner has said he has no evidence that was true or that widespread voter fraud occurred, but the legislation was necessary to shore up confidence in New Hampshire’s elections."
28,POLITICS,Candidate For Illinois Governor Divests Himself Of Running Mate Over Israel Criticism,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/illinois-carlos-ramirez-rosa-democrats-bds_us_59b1d9a0e4b0dfaafcf6cd16,"The growing Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement is still taboo for Democrats.",2017-09-08,"Daniel Biss, right, a Democrat running for governor of Illinois, named Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa as his running mate on Aug. 31.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has moved Democrats to the left on many economic issues, the spectrum of acceptable debate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains relatively narrow.“I was hopeful that this campaign could have recognized our differences and come together to focus on those key progressive issues that are important to Illinois’s working families. And unfortunately, that did not occur,” Ramirez-Rosa told HuffPost. “My hope is that five years from now, as a Democratic Party, we are more committed to having these constructive dialogues and allowing for these differences to exist.”Biss’s selection of Ramirez-Rosa as his candidate for lieutenant governor last Thursday sparked an outpouring of excitement from progressive activists and organizations. At 28, Ramirez-Rosa is Chicago’s first openly gay Latino alderman and one of the country’s most prominent members of the Democratic Socialists of America. Thanks in no small part to Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, DSA has seen its dues-paying membership nearly quadruple, to more than 28,000, since the November election. Ramirez-Rosa, who joined in February, has become the organization’s closest thing to a political celebrity.But Ramirez-Rosa’s affiliation with DSA, which has endorsed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, immediately created a political headache for Biss.Ramirez-Rosa, who served as a Democratic National Convention delegate for Sanders in July 2016, has also spoken out against what he considers the United States’ sponsorship of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories Israel conquered in 1967.“You know, for too long the U.S. government has subsidized the oppression of the Palestinian people, and it’s time that that’s stopped,” Ramirez-Rosa told the left-wing Real News Network in June 2016. “And we have seen a shift internationally in favor of justice for the Palestinian people. You know, people stand with Israel, but they also want to make sure the Palestinian people have [justice].”Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.), a moderate who represents affluent Chicago suburbs, withdrew his endorsement of Biss in a note on Facebook on Sunday, citing Ramirez-Rosa’s tough criticism of Israel and membership in DSA. Schneider is an active member of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a hawkish and influential pro-Israel lobby, and pro-Israel groups were his third-largest category of donors in 2016.Biss responded by demanding that Ramirez-Rosa unequivocally denounce BDS or leave the ticket, according to a source with knowledge of their conversations.After several days of discussions, Ramirez-Rosa announced his departure from the ticket, claiming in a Facebook message that his difference of opinion with Biss on BDS at the federal rather than state level had proved insurmountable. (In an interview with HuffPost, Ramirez-Rosa would not confirm the details of their talks, citing his commitment to their shared privacy.)Ramirez-Rosa said he refuses to condemn BDS in all its forms because he believes that it is “part of a constructive dialogue” about how the United States should leverage its power on the global stage to end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.“I’m not going to throw a nonviolent movement under the bus or impugn their aims or impugn their tactics,” he told HuffPost. “Amongst the international community and within the United States, there is a broad agreement that we need to end the occupation of Palestine, that we need a solution that recognizes the humanity of both the Israeli and the Palestinian people.”Such a solution must also recognize “4,000 years of anti-Semitism,” he added.At the same time, Ramirez-Rosa does not support state governments boycotting Israel, since foreign policy is a federal matter.When asked by HuffPost if, in his capacity as lieutenant governor, he would have visited Israel as part of a state government delegation, Ramirez-Rosa affirmed that he “absolutely” would have.Ramirez-Rosa said he remained supportive of a two-state solution in which a Palestinian state would exist alongside Israel. He has not adopted the far left’s preference for the creation of one binational state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.Biss, who is Jewish and whose mother is Israeli, said in a statement about Ramirez-Rosa’s departure that he believes BDS “moves us further away from a peaceful solution.”He also accused Ramirez-Rosa of failing to be upfront about his views on the matter.“When I asked him in the interview process prior to his selection, Carlos said he too supported a two-state solution and opposed BDS,” Biss wrote. “After much discussion, it’s become clear that Carlos’ position has changed. While I respect his right to come to his own conclusions on the issue, it simply wasn’t the understanding we shared when I asked him to join the ticket.”Ramirez-Rosa insisted to HuffPost that he spoke candidly about it, explaining his opposition to boycotts by state governments and openness to federally led boycotts. When pressed, he acknowledged that the distinction between state-government and federal-government boycotts may have led Biss to misunderstand.“It’s not difficult to find ​Rosa’s positions on this issue,” said Micah Uetricht, a friend of Ramirez-Rosa’s and associate editor of Jacobin, a popular socialist magazine. “If you Googled ‘Carlos Rosa Israel Palestine’ you could find his position on it. Did no one in the Biss campaign do this?​”BDS began in 2005 when Palestinian civil society groups asked the international community to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel until Israel ends its occupation of the Palestinian territories captured in 1967, allows Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war to return to their homes and grants equal rights to Israel’s Palestinian citizens.The movement has steadily picked up adherents, particularly in Europe, with many European musicians, including Roger Waters and Brian Eno, refusing to tour in Israel. BDS remains relatively obscure and controversial in the United States, however, where public opinion is more supportive of the Israeli government.  Opponents of BDS argue that it unfairly singles out Israel among all of the world’s many imperfect nations. Critics also object to its leaders’ insistence on a right of return for all Palestinian refugees, which would dissolve the demographic Jewish majority that is the basis for Israel’s “Jewish character.”Ramirez-Rosa admitted that he is not familiar with the finer details of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, including the best way to address the issue of Palestinian refugees.In the near term, the biggest casualty of Biss’s rupture with Ramirez-Rosa appears to have been his own campaign.Democrats are clamoring to unseat Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, a billionaire Republican viewed as one of 2018’s more vulnerable incumbents. In a crowded and contentious field dominated by billionaire investor J.B. Pritzker and philanthropist Chris Kennedy, son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, Biss is seeking to upset his well-heeled competitors by cornering the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. He boasts an ambitious platform that calls for a $15 minimum wage, state-level single-payer health care, paid family leave and free public college tuition. But Biss’s lack of a running mate limits his ability to collect the petition signatures he needs to land a spot on the ballot, according to The Washington Post’s Dave Weigel. And his rejection of Ramirez-Rosa has prompted criticism from previously supportive individuals and groups, souring much of the credibility he’d earned with progressive activists. Biss “just seems like an empty suit,” Uetricht said. “He saw a political opportunity in the Bernie Sanders campaign, a political moment where if you embraced Bernie-style politics you could get somewhere, but that was a purely opportunistic move.”Even Ramirez-Rosa would no longer commit to voting for Biss.“I will be playing close attention to how this race unfolds,” he said.Biss’s fall from grace may open up room for Chicago Alderman Ameya Pawar, another long-shot contender who has also sought to court left-leaning voters.Ramirez-Rosa’s progressive allies see his decision not to renounce BDS as a foreshadowing of the growing acceptance of BDS and a long-term win for the democratic socialists who embrace it.“This country is dramatically changing and things that used to seem impossible are very much probable,” said David Duhalde, the deputy director of the Democratic Socialists of America.  Carlos’ decision “shows people how incredibly committed and principled politicians like Carlos are and Democratic Socialists of America members are, too,” Duhalde added. “People like Carlos sticking by their values is a very good thing for the socialist movement.”"
29,POLITICS,"House Passes Trump Deal On Harvey, Debt Limit And Government Funding",Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-passes-harvey-debt-limit-trump-deal_us_59b2b94ce4b0b5e5310603c2,It was a bad deal for Republicans. Most of them voted for it anyway.,2017-09-08,A deal brokered by President Donald Trump and congressional Democratic leaders passed the House on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b2ba352900003600485920.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The House overwhelmingly passed legislation on Friday to raise the debt ceiling, extend government funding for three months, and approve roughly $15 billion in disaster relief to victims of Hurricane Harvey, even as Republicans acknowledged that the deal brokered between President Donald Trump and Democratic congressional leaders was a poor one for them.The bill passed the House 316-90, with all 90 votes in opposition coming from Republicans.The Republicans who voted “no” tended to be more conservative, a rebuke of Trump’s leadership and dealmaking ability. But what makes this vote significant is that only 90 Republicans can now say they don’t support clean raises of the debt ceiling. That a bill this bad for the GOP got this many votes is a testament to Republicans still not wanting to cross Trump ― and the vote total probably would have looked even more overwhelming had more members been present.Due in large part to Florida lawmakers wanting to be in their districts before Hurricane Irma hits, there were more absences in the House than usual.The message from this vote, however, was clear: Republicans, by and large, will vote with Trump even when it goes against years of GOP rhetoric on fiscal responsibility.The deal, at first glance, isn’t a big one. Government funding is extended for three months, and the debt ceiling is raised until December, at which point Treasury could once again use “extraordinary measures” to keep making payments without raising the debt limit.But the agreement sets up a spending showdown in early December, when lawmakers will once again have to act to avert a shutdown. Bigger than what the agreement worked out between Trump, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) actually does, however, is the precedent it sets. Trump and Republicans are willing to fund the government without a border wall, and they will raise the debt ceiling without any sort of spending reforms. That is a big victory for Democrats in Washington, and that is why Republican opposition to this Harvey aid bill ballooned after the Senate amended the legislation to include a continuing resolution and a debt ceiling increase. (Earlier this week, the House approved a roughly $8 billion package for Harvey victims by a vote of 419-3, with the three “no” votes coming from Republicans who wanted to see spending offsets for the aid, and then the Senate passed the amended bill 80-17 on Thursday, attaching the CR and debt ceiling provisions at the behest of Trump and adding another $7 billion in community redevelopment funds.)Ultimately, even with the new provisions, 133 Republicans joined 183 Democrats to approve the bill.Even as raw of a deal as it was for Republicans who wanted to see some reforms on spending, there was some political peril in opposing the revised legislation. The Harvey aid provisions are popular with voters, and Democratic strategists believe a number of Republicans who could have tough races in 2018 ― like Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.), Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) and Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) ― made a mistake by opposing the bill.“Vulnerable House Republicans voting against relief for American families still reeling from Hurricane Harvey would be reckless and cruel on its own, but the fact that it was also a vote for a government shutdown and defaulting on America’s debt gives new meaning to the word irresponsible,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Tyler Law told HuffPost. “If you want to understand why Americans are disgusted by Republicans in Congress, look no further than this vote.”One constituency that did get behind the bill was Texas Republicans.After 23 out of 24 Texas Republicans voted against aid for Hurricane Sandy, citing unrelated spending provisions they didn’t like, only four Texas Republicans voted against aid for Harvey: Joe Barton, Jeb Hensarling, Sam Johnson and Mac Thornberry.You can take a look at every member who voted for and against the bill here.The bill now goes to the president’s desk for his signature."

The violent removal of a doctor from a United flight in Chicago in April was investigated by federal officials.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590246982600003596c481ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Federal officials have decided not to punish United Airlines over a violent incident in April when passenger David Dao was dragged off of a plane in Chicago to make room for airline employees.The incident left Dao with a concussion, broken nose and two missing teeth, according to his attorney.A letter dated May 12 and addressed to United said that the Department of Transportation found no evidence that the airline discriminated against any of the passengers ― including Dao, an Asian-American physician from Kentucky ― based on race or nationality. The letter also said that the conduct of the Chicago airport police was not part of the investigation.According to the letter, a federal investigation did find that United had violated some rules on bumping passengers. The investigation also found that United violated federal rules by not providing Dao and his wife a copy of overbooking procedures, though it noted that United was unable to because Dao sought medical attention after being removed from the flight. Those violations didn’t warrant a fine, the letter concluded. The letter, written by a Department of Transportation lawyer, was obtained by the nonprofit Flyers Rights via a Freedom of Information Act request.Dao had already boarded United Express Flight 3411 from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, on April 9 when staff asked for volunteers to give up their seats to United employees who needed to be in Louisville the following day. United offered in exchange money and a hotel voucher. When no one volunteered, even after more money was offered, staff randomly selected four people to remove, including Dao.When Dao refused to leave the plane, saying he was a physician who needed to see patients in the morning, staff enlisted the help of law enforcement officers who forcibly yanked Dao out of his seat and dragged the doctor down the aisle, as seen in a widely viewed video of the confrontation. Dao suffered a broken nose and required reconstructive surgery, according to his attorney Thomas Demetrio. Nearly three weeks after the confrontation, United reached a settlement with Dao for an undisclosed amount of money and took full responsibility for the incident.The deal included Dao agreeing to not sue the city of Chicago, whose Department of Aviation police officers physically removed him, Demetrio told Crain’s Chicago Business.

Our home in Miami is in the path for a direct hit from Hurricane Irma; the storm may follow us to where we are, causing us to consider running again. We are luckier than most in that we are able to leave town and not head to a shelter. Hurricane shelters, contrary to how one sheriff in particular portrays them, are not centers of crime and assault. They are literally buildings (often schools) in safer areas that allow you to lay a blanket on the floor until the danger is over. A shelter is safe but not at all comfortable.Many of my friends have chosen to stay put in their homes. There are many reasons why folks do not leave. Some can’t afford the crazy airline prices out of town; others worry that it is too late to leave, and don’t want to get caught in the storm due to traffic jams on the major highways.Recently, it has come to light that some in the media show great disparities in how they report the aftermath of hurricane, based on race. Many of us reflect back to Hurricane Katrina, where there were pictures of residents doing whatever they needed to do to survive. Unfortunately, when white folks were depicted taking food or items from stores, they were portrayed as survivors. When people of color did the same, they were portrayed as looters.Here is some perspective. I survived Hurricane Wilma in Miami. I will be clear: it was nowhere near as bad as Hurricane Andrew or the devastation that Katrina brought to Louisiana. But nonetheless, I hunkered down during the storm. For close to a month afterwards, I had no power. The day after the storm passes is the closest thing to an apocalypse on earth. Roads are impassable, power lines are down and all sense of normalcy is lost. The streets are silent. It is the most eerie experience that one can have.Let’s look at what this means. There’s no power, so your refrigerator does not work. If you have an electric stove, that’s no longer an option. The only thing that works is a barbecue fueled by propane or charcoal. Anything that was in your refrigerator is now spoiled. Hopefully you were able to stock up on canned goods. You will be living off of a diet of anything in a can.By the way, if the stores reopen, your ATM card won’t work because there’s no power. In the aftermath of Wilma I learned this the hard way. I ran out of cash; luckily the bar down the street had a backup generator which allowed them to have ice as well as the ability to swipe cards. I worked out a deal with some friends: they bought me food and I bought them drinks. Another set of friends had a barbecue. We walked a bit of a distance with whatever food we had and made the most of it.This leads to the next reality ― transportation. Do you want to get gas to go somewhere? Even if you can get through the debris-littered road, the gas stations have not had deliveries, so that’s not an option.All of this is assuming the best case scenario where you did not have to evacuate. Evacuation does not mean you grab your fancy set of luggage and walk out the door. When you evacuate, you literally grab whatever you can carry and run with easily. The things that come to mind are your birth certificate, your Social Security card, photos of deceased relatives that you cannot part with and maybe a change of clothes. Packing up food is not practical.Once you get to the shelter, you are now in a position of waiting for the goodwill of others. Keeping in mind that the roads are impassable, you can’t just roll up to the grocery and get more food. Even if you could get there, the stores are closed because all of the staff members are also battling the hurricane. You’re waiting for FEMA or someone to airlift food to you. Literally. So under those circumstances, what is one to do? Your children are hungry, you’re at the verge of starvation, What do you do?You do what you need to do to survive.There is a bright line distinction between taking food/clothing in an emergency and just stealing because you want a new purse or car parts. I don’t condone criminal activity as a general premise, but survival after a natural disaster is a mitigating circumstance.So a note to not only the media, but to those who do not know what the hurricane aftermath brings – don’t judge. Do not judge unless you’ve walked a mile in a hurricane survivor’s shoes. And be fair in your portrayal ― all races face the same challenge in the aftermath of a disaster. Mother Nature does not discriminate. Self-preservation is, and will always be, the law of nature."

Chris Christie (R) for not standing by Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b2a44a29000036004858c4.jpeg?cache=egcCf3637D&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist and campaign chairman, ensured that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) would never obtain a cabinet position in the White House after the governor allegedly showed insufficient loyalty to Trump in the wake of Access Hollywood 2016 tape leak.In Bannon’s new interview with CBS News’ Charlie Rose, he described the damaging leak, released a few weeks before the election, as a “litmus test” of the judgment and loyalty of Trump’s advisers. The 2005 video of Trump, then a reality TV star, famously showed him bragging on a hot mike to Access Hollywood host Billy Bush that his stardom allowed him to “grab [women] by the pussy.”Christie failed that test, according to Bannon, when he didn’t show up for a flight on the campaign jet the weekend after the scandal broke.“I’m Irish. I gotta get my black book and I got ’em,” Bannon told Rose in an excerpt of the interview that aired on “CBS This Morning” on Friday. “Christie, because of Billy Bush weekend ... was not looked at for a cabinet position.”Bannon also lost confidence in Reince Priebus, the then-chairman of the Republican National Committee who went on to become Trump’s chief of staff, over his reaction to the tape.In a room full of advisers consulting Trump on how to respond to the controversial leak, Priebus told Trump he faced a choice between dropping out and losing by “the biggest landslide in American history,” according to Bannon.Bannon, however, insisted that Trump still had a “100 percent probability of winning.”He bet that Trump’s working-class base would not care about the tape, because it was “locker room talk.”“It was a winner. That’s why I told him ‘double down’ every time,” Bannon recalled. “And on that day, that’s the first time and only time he ever got upset with me. He goes, ‘Come on, it’s not 100 percent.’ I go, ‘It’s absolutely 100 percent.’ And I told him why: ‘They don’t care.’” Bannon resigned from the White House under pressure in August, amid public uproar over President Trump’s equivocal response to the deadly white supremacist violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. Bannon praised Trump for drawing an equivalency between the actions of white supremacist demonstrators and left-leaning counterprotesters, though it is not clear if he played a role in convincing Trump to take that approach.Bannon, a self-described “economic nationalist” who fashioned himself the guardian of right-wing populism in the White House, long clashed with the so-called “Wall Street”-wing of Trump’s inner circle. His advocacy for trade and immigration restrictions, among other topics, diverged from the views of top advisers like Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council.Since leaving the White House, Bannon has resumed his role at the helm of Breitbart, a right-wing news site that Bannon infamously built into an outpost of pro-Trump nationalism and white racial resentment.Bannon’s account of Christie’s estrangement from Trump is both consistent with his reputation as a validator of Trump’s unapologetic instincts, and the public information available about Christie’s sudden departure from Trump’s orbit.In the days after the Access Hollywood leak, Christie did not join other Trump campaign surrogates in defending Trump on television.Instead, Christie made his first remarks on the matter while guest-hosting “Boomer and Carton,” a CBS New York sports talk radio show, the Tuesday after the incident. In the appearance, Christie shared his displeasure not only with Trump’s conduct in the video, which he called “indefensible,” but also the campaign’s defense of the behavior and decision to deflect with attacks on former President Bill Clinton’s sexual scandals.“I think he should have been much more direct and much more focused on just saying ‘I’m sorry’ and only ‘I’m sorry,’” Christie said, even as he claimed he would still supported the president’s bid.Christie was one of the first nationally prominent Republican officials to get behind Trump’s candidacy. He endorsed the real estate mogul shortly after his own presidential campaign ended in February 2016. Trump rewarded Christie by naming him chief of the presidential transition team. The blunt New Jersey governor was rumored to be on the short list for attorney general or another cabinet-level position in a Trump administration .But shortly after Trump’s successful election, he canned Christie as transition chief and purged the transition team of the governor’s loyalists."

A new season of “Twin Peaks,” the first in over 25 years, ended Sunday. Over at Netflix, where “Gilmore Girls” has already been raised from the dead, another “Arrested Development” season is forthcoming. This fall, MTV is bringing back “TRL,” which bowed at a time that hadn’t known Vevo, and “Will & Grace” will return to NBC, where an executive has also voiced his desire to revamp departed hits such as “30 Rock,” “West Wing,” “ER” and “The Office.” HBO is producing more “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” On various networks, and in various stages of development, viewers will likely get to revisit “Bug Juice,” “Rocko’s Modern Life,” “Hey Arnold!” and “King of the Hill.” These are the most buzzed-about television revivals coming up in 2017 and 2018.Movie critics have worried over reboot fatigue for years, and theatergoers often like explaining them as products of the slow-and-steady drying-up of Hollywood’s well of creativity. (Can you believe they’re making another “Spider-Man”?) But this season, with TV seemingly more popular than ever, an impressive number of old titles are cropping up on the small screen in new ways. Reboots, or shows that feature familiar characters in new storylines, are also hitting fall lineups: “Heathers” is coming to TV Land, and The CW is bringing back the ’80s soap “Dynasty.” Elsewhere, Seth Meyers would like to reboot “The Munsters,” and “Miami Vice” may soon reappear, too. The same force ― risk aversion ― that compels film studios to keep spinning new yarns out of preexisting narratives has made a very noticeable shift to TV networks.“The whole idea with that ― just like with anything that’s sequel-ized, franchised, rebooted or remade ― is that there is a built-in familiarity with the source material, and that theoretically gives you a leg up,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, told HuffPost. Success isn’t always so simple: Attempts to adapt “Minority Report” and “Rush Hour” for TV in 2015 both failed. The resurgence of many titles can be summed up by simple nostalgia. Not that puzzlingly vague “Make America Great Again” nostalgia, just a time in the not-so-distant past made nicer by the fact that we no longer have to live in it. Networks will indulge us viewers if there are good ratings in it for them ― don’t think they don’t notice the thousands of likes and shares cast reunion photos are capable of shoring up on social media. “When these reboots or remakes are done in the right way, it’s like a time machine,” Dergarabedian said, adding that botched reboots or revivals can taint the legacy of the show it intends to appreciate. “You can literally take all that goodwill and flush it if you can’t deliver on the promise of the original.” Advocates for originality may see the smash-hit popularity of “Stranger Things” as an argument that it’s possible to evoke nostalgia through a completely new story. At least for now, though, shows like that are a rarity.In 2017, it’s tempting to add the tumultuous state of current events to the equation ― particularly when considering certain titles returning to TV. President Donald Trump extolled the virtues of coal miners throughout the 2016 election, but weekly sitcoms that address working-class life in America in friendly 22-minute bursts don’t grow on trees. The longevity and ratings earned by “Roseanne” might be hard to replicate when the show isn’t that far from the present moment ― at least to the older half of the 18-to-49 set. The same may go for “Will & Grace,” where the successful cast of characters that brought LGBTQ culture into the mainstream in the aughts will now address Trump (supposedly a friend of Megan Mullally’s socialite character, Karen). Perhaps viewers are most comfortable when sensitive cultural topics are broached through vehicles of familiarity.Whether viewers find it welcome or worrying, in the abstract, borrowing ideas from the past isn’t anything new. Even in television.“If you think about it, a lot of concepts ― ‘I Love Lucy’ and ‘The Honeymooners,’ basically every sitcom ― has somehow, in some way, riffed off another original concept,” Dergarabedian said. “Everything, in a sense, is a reboot of everything else. It’s just like in music: Every artist is influenced by somebody else.”You can be highbrow. You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow? Welcome to Middlebrow, a weekly examination of pop culture. Read more here."
37,POLITICS,Key Obamacare Architect Who Shunned Single-Payer Now Backs It,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/max-baucus-single-payer_us_59b2f8f7e4b0354e4411f129,Max Baucus' comments show how far the debate has shifted.,2017-09-08,Former Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) now says he supports the creation of a fully public federal insurance program.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b2f94b1700001f00f520b9.jpeg?cache=LEGd5SzZcY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), a fiscal moderate who, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presided over the passage of the Affordable Care Act, expressed his support on Thursday for the creation of a single-payer health care system.“My personal view is we’ve got to start looking at single-payer,” Baucus said in remarks at Montana State University, according to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. “I think we should have hearings... We’re getting there. It’s going to happen.”Single-payer health care, in which the federal government insures all citizens through one large program, is a model for universal coverage in many developed countries, including Canada, France and Australia. But it has long been viewed as a pipe dream in the United States, where a plurality of people receive coverage from their employers.Baucus’ endorsement of the idea speaks to just how dramatically the health policy debate has shifted within the Democratic Party in recent years ― particularly since the 2016 presidential run of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who made what he called “Medicare for all” a central issue of his campaign.Baucus was the subject of progressive frustration for his stewardship of the ACA, also known as Obamacare. Critics argued that he held the bill in committee far too long in hopes of winning the support of moderate Republicans who did not end up voting for the final bill. The lengthy negotiation period he initiated gave Republicans much-needed time to mobilize opposition to reform, according to Baucus’ detractors.Obamacare itself relies on a hybrid model, once favored by conservative policy experts, that combines the creation of a new private, individual insurance marketplace and an expansion of Medicaid.Given Baucus’ history as a fiscal moderate active in the ACA’s passage, his positive remarks about single-payer could provide a boost to progressive activists agitating for its implementation.As Senate Finance Committee chairman, Baucus ruled out consideration of single-payer from the beginning, and declined to invite the testimony of single-payer advocates at hearings. The latter decision prompted disruptive protests from activists, and Baucus later said that he regretted not engaging more with the policy’s proponents.In September 2009, Baucus also voted against two amendments that would have created a public health insurance option on the Obamacare individual insurance exchanges.Baucus kept single-payer off the table during the development of Obamacare because he believed the country was not ready for it at the time, he told NBC News on Friday. “I just think the time has come,” Baucus said. “Back in ’09, we were not ready to address it. It would never have passed. Here we are nine years later, I think it’s time to hopefully have a very serious good faith look at it.”Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a moderate who represented Montana alongside Baucus from 2007 to 2014, also expressed openness to single-payer this week.“Maybe it’s something we should, quite frankly, take a solid look at,” Tester said Wednesday.Tester does not support single-payer legislation, however. When Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), aiming to put Democrats in an awkward political position, introduced a trick amendment creating a single-payer system to the Obamacare repeal bill, most Democratic senators voted “present” on the motion, but Tester was one of four Democratic senators to vote “no” on it.Former Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) ― a moderate who vehemently opposed creating a public health insurance option during the passage of Obamacare ― told HuffPost that unlike Baucus, he believes it is “unlikely we will get a single-payer system in the foreseeable future.”Single-payer is improbable, Conrad argued, because funding a federal health insurance program would cost taxpayers so much and because medical providers are so opposed to radically transforming the system. Instead, he said, the “best system combines universal coverage with private not-for-profit insurance with the government assisting those who cannot afford insurance.”He also favors empowering Medicare to negotiate bulk discounts on prescription drugs, just as the Veterans Affairs health care system does.In addition to Sanders’ presidential run, the collapse of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare has increased grassroots energy behind single-payer as activists seek to go on the offensive. Progressive pressure groups like Credo have launched efforts to make support for the policy a litmus test for 2020′s Democratic presidential candidates.Single-payer now has more support in Congress than at any other time in recent history. Single-payer legislation introduced by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has more co-sponsors than ever, with the support of a majority of the House Democratic Caucus.Sanders plans to unveil a much-anticipated version of single-payer legislation next Wednesday. Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), a rumored 2020 presidential contender, and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have already announced plans to co-sponsor the bill.Polling suggests that the idea of single-payer is popular with the public, especially among Democrats. In a May 2016 Gallup poll, 58 percent of Americans and 73 percent of Democrats said they supported replacing “the ACA with a federally funded healthcare program providing insurance for all Americans.” Even elected Democrats who remain wary of single-payer have begun trying to capitalize on the ambitious proposal’s popularity. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ political action committee, Bold PAC, has repeatedly alluded to the “Medicare for all” fight in fundraising e-mails ― even though half of the 30 CHC members have yet to actually endorse single-payer, and the PAC does not make support for the policy a condition for its financial support.Of course, it is much easier to talk about single-payer than to actually implement it. Replacing the current system with one large federal program would require a massive tax increase in exchange for what advocates believe would result in net cost reductions thanks to the government’s considerable bargaining power.It would also force the nearly half of Americans who get insurance from their jobs to enroll in a new government program. Given the outcry that Obamacare elicited for canceling the plans of a fraction of that number of people, enacting single-payer would likely prove an extraordinary political challenge.In the meantime, though, the excitement around single-payer has already widened the spectrum of acceptable debate about health care. Expansions of coverage that once seemed radical now seem downright moderate by comparison. In August, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) announced plans to introduce legislation allowing Americans of all ages and incomes to buy into Medicaid. And earlier this week, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) revealed his intention to introduce a bill creating a comparable universal buy-in option for Medicare, which he said “may be the fastest way to a single-payer system.”This article has been updated with comments from Tester and Conrad, as well as additional comments from Baucus."
38,POLITICS,Congress Eyes Brief Extension For Flood Insurance Program,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flood-insurance-program-extension_us_59b19c2de4b0b5e53104c137,"With the National Flood Insurance Program — now almost $25 billion in debt — set to expire on Sept. 30, lawmakers look to buy more time.",2017-09-08,"People walk with their possessions out of a flooded area of Port Arthur, Texas on Aug. 31, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b1e9b31700001f00288d18.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Lawmakers in Washington largely agree that the National Flood Insurance Program — now nearing $25 billion in debt — is in need of a fix. Where they differ, of course, is on how to reform it.But with Hurricane Harvey having just pummeled the Gulf Coast, Hurricane Irma now barreling toward the Florida peninsula, a jam-packed September to-do list in Congress and the insurance program set to expire Sept. 30, there is little time for constructive negotiations. And it appears lawmakers will opt to buy themselves more time.A short-term extension of the program was tucked into an agreement struck Wednesday by President Donald Trump and senate Democrats to provide billions in disaster aid for Hurricane Harvey, raise the debt ceiling and keep the government from shutting down. The Senate passed the package Thursday by an 80-17 vote, doubling the amount of disaster aid to $15.3 billion, the Washington Post reported. The House is expected to vote as soon as Friday.If passed, the package would extend the reauthorization deadline to Dec. 8.The NFIP was established by Congress in 1968 to provide low-cost insurance to people living in flood-prone areas. In exchange, communities are required to adopt flood management plans and work to reduce the risk of infrastructure being damaged in a flood. But many properties are being destroyed and rebuilt several times in the same high-risk location, with construction being subsidized each time by taxpayer dollars. Today, the program covers roughly 5 million policyholders. But what was once a self-sustaining program has been walloped in recent years by an increasing number of claims following costly natural disasters, including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy. In fact, 1 percent of policyholders account for 25 to 30 percent of all claims, according to Scientific American. Harvey — and now Irma, a Category 5 storm taking aim at Florida — has added a sense of urgency to addressing the problems facing the NFIP, and is expected to put the program even further in debt. “The NFIP must be reauthorized in a meaningful way that addresses the fundamental business model of the program,” Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Brock Long, who oversees NFIP, told Politico last week. “A lapse ... would have a major impact on Americans across the country.”The Government Accountability Office has labeled NFIP as a “high risk,” citing “structural weaknesses in how the program is funded.” And in a report published Sept. 1, the Congressional Budget Office found that the program is operating at a $1.4 billion annual shortfall. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is among those who has called on Congress to extend the Sept. 30 deadline. He said in a statement last week that “while the NFIP was not perfect and certainly in need of improvements,” letting the program lapse “would be irresponsible and could wind up costing NYC homeowners and businesses dearly.” Among those pushing for reform in the House is Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), chair of the Financial Services Committee, which has introduced a bill that would, among other things, work to phase out taxpayer-provided subsidies for properties that flood repeatedly and open the program to private companies. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who has been working on the flood insurance issue for years, told HuffPost he thinks the current set of circumstances — in particular, catastrophic flooding in Texas, a state where in 2012 all but one of its congressional Republicans voted against a $50.5 billion package to help victims of Superstorm Sandy — presents an opportunity for change.“These pieces could fall into place,” he said of reforming the program, which he cautioned must be done gradually so as not to cause unintended harm. “We’ve got the inspiration. We’ve got Hurricane Harvey. We’ve got a realization that actually our failed policies regarding flood mitigation and recovery actually contribute to future problems. I think it’s possible to put these pieces together.” Blumenauer is among those who wants to see NFIP reauthorized so that it relies on accurate flood maps, charges policyholders actuarial rates and moves away from, as he put it, subsidizing people to live in harms way. “That is not healthy for them, and it creates great risk for the broader community,” he said.

In the midst of natural and political crises facing our nation, I was shocked and a bit unsettled to discover that the post was specifically condemning my personal involvement in the ongoing movement for human rights. The idea that an elected official would publicly target and monitor any citizen is disturbing ― but it is becoming an all too normalized reality in our current political climate. From the White House to the state house, we are seeing those who hold offices of power threatening, isolating, and bullying those who dare dissent against the wave of extreme policies hurting our communities.It is no coincidence that Senator Beavers is the same person who earlier this year responded to peaceful protests in the Capitol by telling the press, “To try and scare our staff, for us to be escorted out of the building; read the Tennessee Constitution. It says anybody that disrespects a legislator when we’re in session is to be imprisoned.” This is unfortunately the situation we must now face together, but it is not limited to one politician or moment. From a presidential campaign marked by threatening protestors with bodily harm to the wave of anti-protest legislation introduced in this year alone, we face a time of harsh push-back. While we strive to move forward together, we are coming face-to-face with the forces of regression seeking to maintain the racial and economic status quo. They have made clear their intention “to take this country back” and it is time we believed them as we go back to a time reminiscent of America’s darker days. In the midst of this reemergence of extremism and meanness, we must also go back to our own roots and take heart from the long line of justice-seekers who acted regardless of any personal consequences. “If I fall, I will fall five-feet four-inches forward in the fight for freedom,” Fannie Lou Hamer declared, having faced the beatings and bomb threats of white supremacists for trying to register to vote. The politically powerful most fear the people who themselves are no longer afraid, and the people who are unrelenting in their challenge to the legitimacy of business-as-usual. This moral resistance transcends partisan politics and is active regardless of who is in office. The gravest mistake of Senator Beavers’ post condemning these protest activities, was a refusal to acknowledge the interconnectedness of the struggles from indigenous rights at Standing Rock, to health care access, equal protection under law, and the tearing down of white supremacist idols. What neither she nor those who espouse her ideology understand is that we no longer have the luxury of focusing on a single issue. We do not have the convenience of just showing up when our communities are being harmed on numerous fronts simultaneously. Our vision must be expanded far beyond that which effects us personally. Moral dissent and witness must be a way of life in such a time as this, when power-holders are so intoxicated by their own authority. During my time as a student at Fisk University, I was moved by a rich legacy of alumni like civil rights leaders Diane Nash, Bernard Lafayette, and John Lewis who talked to us about the power of nonviolent struggle and the call to be active against injustice ― not necessarily for ourselves, but for generations yet unborn. I was convicted by the experiences of my own grandparents and elders who rose up in the face of Jim Crow inequality, were beaten down, and still chose to get back up again. No longer can these just be fables we lean on to celebrate where we’ve come from. We ourselves are in a breakthrough moment where our generation must respond to actively shape where we are going. When Senator Beavers uses the racially-coded and fear-mongering rhetoric claiming, “...they are there to destroy our history, our way of life, our freedoms, liberties, our values, and everything good about our country,” we must recognize the spirit of those who have always thought that this country belongs only to a few. For them, maintaining this very limited and narrow vision is what “Make America Great America” really means.We now have to decide how we will respond with our own narrative, speaking our own vision for the soul of our nation. In his last speech, standing right here in Tennessee, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to similar repression, saying, “Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for right.” This is the challenge and legacy we are a part of today. As we constantly hear the false-truths of “Great Again” we must take heed of what Dr. King reminded us about in that same final speech, on the “challenge to make America what it ought to be.” Despite the fears raised by Senator Beavers and others, the foundations of old are not being destroyed, they are crumbling because no structure built on the degradation of human dignity can stand forever. The act of protest is a response to that brokenness. The act of protest is about our collective redemption. The act of protest is saying the politics of hurt can no longer operate in the comfort of silence. In the streets and halls of power, we are coming together to fortify a more just and sustainable future. With each protest, we lift up another building block and we lay out a blue-print for an America yet in the making."

They informed the public on Sept. 1.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b2af2a1700003b00f51f84.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last night, many of us (143 million of us, precisely) had our dinners ruined by the revelation of Equifax’s huge data breach.Equifax is one of the “big three” credit reporting agencies (CRAs). Lenders, insurers, and utility companies rely on its data to make decisions to give people money for loans, insurance coverage, and services, respectively.According to the Wall Street Journal, “The size of the hack is second only to the pair of attacks on Yahoo disclosed last year that affected the information of as many as 1.5 billion customers.”And, yesterday’s breach also involves nearly twice the number affected by a financial firm, the last being the cyberattack at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. about three years ago.3 Reasons to Be Angry About the Equifax Data BreachThere are 3 reasons to be really pissed off about the way Equifax handled this situation.First, they waited 41 days after the fact to tell us:Second, three high-ranking managers, including the company’s CFO, were found to have sold around $1.8 million in Equifax shares after the data breach on July 29, but before the public was informed.These guys will chalk up their actions to being one big coincidence, but there’s no “wink” in “co-inky-dink.” (Or maybe there is, phonetically.)Third, Equifax has kindly requested that you enroll in its proprietary credit monitoring service, free for up to one year, for the damage control to your credit profile in the months ahead.The irony here is that in order to enroll, consumers must first provide personal info, including their own social security numbers. Uhm, thanks but no thanks?Equifax, you’re supposed to have protected our information, but you’re going to have to understand if people don’t want to be involved with any security or monitoring products that you’re peddling.To bury the knife deeper in the wound, there in the fine print lies the condition that if you enroll in Equifax’s monitoring service, you will opt-out of any future legal action against them:Look’s like the Attorney General is on it:For those who did take them up on their offer, it only seems to imply whether your data was compromised, and I say “seems to” because the answer is still unclear. You get one answer if it was, and another if it wasn’t:Key Pieces of Data StolenWhat’s so unsettling about this breach is that Equifax holds the very data needed to apply for new credit applications and loans.It was reported that in one swoop attackers gained access to the following: an applicant’s name, address, social security number, and driver’s license information.How to Protect Your Credit and Identity Following Equifax’s Data BreachThe best way to protect yourself in the months ahead is to vigilantly monitor your credit activity.You can do this with dedicated identity-theft monitoring services like Lifelock, or with services such as Clarity Money, Credit Karma, or Credit Sesame, which disclose credit scores and offer ancillary credit alert features any time your scores change.It’s also a good idea to get your free annual credit reports after the dust has settled, to ensure that your credit lines are accurate, and to look for any odd inquiries for new credit applications.Remember that credit inquiries factor approximately 10% of your overall credit score. Recent, frequent inquiries can not only negatively impact your score, but may also signal that someone attempted to apply for new credit using your personal information.Corrections: The title of one executive selling shares was corrected from COO to CFO.

Becker, ContributorEnergy & Climate Policy Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/let-irmas-first-casualty-be-denial_us_59b30110e4b0d0c16bb52c99,"If climate scientists around the world had less class, they would be bombarding the White House switchboard with “We told",2017-09-08,"<p>While global climate change is not expected to increase the number of hurricanes, it is expected to increase their severity. This chart shows the number of hurricanes in the Atlantic basin since 1967. The dark red bars indicate hurricane strengths.

Presidents and members of Congress who could do something meaningful about climate change have been warned for decades that inaction would condemn us to a future of brutal weather. That future is upon us. The same scientists who warned us it was coming say it will get much worse.Tragically, our current federal government is in the control not only of climate deniers, but also public officials who have sold their souls to America’s carbon cartel. Climate change is not the only environmental issue being neglected. There are nearly 180 environmental protection bills pending in Congress. Oddsmakers figure the bill most likely to succeed has only a 36 percent chance of passage. The prognosis for passage of most of the other bills is less than 10 percent.In the Trump Administration, the problem isn’t merely the denial of reality. It is a Chief Executive and Cabinet that are hell-bent on eviscerating the federal government’s capacity to understand global warming, to anticipate its consequences and to help citizens deal with it.So, who are the victims of federal government inaction? They are the people killed, displaced or dispossessed by these disasters, of course. But we are already seeing another casualty: Congress’s ability to keep federal spending and taxpayer burdens under control. Unless Congress decides it has no obligation to help disaster victims or unless it figures out how to outlaw storms, fires and droughts, the fiscal demands of these disasters will bleed resources from other very important federal obligations.If this seems like leftist balderdash, let’s review what’s happening with the weather in the United States right now.When 2017 began, it took only three months for the United States to be hit by five separate billion-dollar disasters – the most of that magnitude for the first quarter of any year on record. Extreme rains caused flooding in Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Illinois. In addition to property losses, farmers lost crops and infrastructure was damaged. Our most recent disaster for the moment, Hurricane Harvey, is the 10th billion-dollar calamity this year and the most expensive weather event in the nation’s history.Northeastern states began experiencing record heat waves even before summer officially began. In Western states, temperatures have been reaching extremes never seen since recordkeeping started. In downtown San Francisco, for example, the heat reached 106 degrees last Friday in the midst of the most severe statewide heat wave ever observed. Reno suffered its 14th hundred-degree day over last weekend, breaking a record set in 1937. This has been the hottest summer on record in 15 Western cities, according to weather historian Christopher Burt.While Harvey was drowning Houston and other Gulf Coast cities, more than 25,000 firefighters and support personnel were combatting nearly 70 uncontained wildfires in the West. Winds blew a thick haze of smoke into several other states, triggering air quality alerts.When it left the Gulf Coast, Harvey went on to cause flash flooding in Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky. As I write this, Florida is preparing for Hurricane Irma, this year’s eleventh billion-dollar calamity and one of strongest storms ever recorded.How has Trump responded? In the 2018 budget proposal he released in May, he called for a $1 billion reduction in FEMA’s budget to help finance his border wall. It was nearly half of the money available in federal disaster funds. Meantime, the Federal Flood Insurance Program remains $25 billion in the red.In 2016, Columbia University published findings that human-induced climate change over the last 30 years has doubled the area vulnerable to forest fires in the West. Nevertheless, Trump proposed cutting $300 million from the U.S. Forest Service’s already strapped firefighting budget and $50 million from its wildfire prevention program.The opponents of climate action argue that mitigating climate change would ruin the economy. Yet for at least a decade, probably more, climate scientists and economists have emphasized that if climate change is ignored, the costs to lives, property and government budgets would be much higher than the cost of mitigation.In 2006, British economist Lord Nicholas Stern issued one of the first definitive estimates. He calculated that unless the world invested about 1% of GDP on climate action, climate impacts could cost nations 20% of global GDP or more. Ten years later after observing some of the impacts of climate change, Stern said “With hindsight, I now realize that I underestimated the risks. I should have been much stronger in what I said in the report about the costs of inaction. I underplayed the dangers.”In 2014, the Obama White House warned that delaying action on global warming would result in a 40% increase in economic losses over 10 years. Two years ago, after five years of study and extensive peer review, Obama’s EPA concluded that every region of the U.S. is vulnerable to economic losses from climate impacts. EPA estimated that without action, nationwide losses would climb to hundreds of billions of dollars.On the plus side, Obama’s EPA projected that the international effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would save a lot of lives and money in the United States. An overwhelming majority of economists with climate expertise agreed. Surveyed last year by New York University (NYU), 95% of experts on the economics of climate change said the United States should follow through on the pledges the Obama Administration made in the Paris climate agreement. NYU economists have calculated that the climate policies of other nations have already benefited the U.S. economy by more than $200 billion, and the pledges other nations have made in the Paris climate accord could save the United States more than $2 trillion by 2030 and more than $10 trillion by 2050.Trump’s response was to pull the United States out of the Paris agreement.While many states and cities have stepped up and pledged to keep America’s promise in the Paris pact, there is no timely or ubiquitous substitute for federal action like a national price on carbon, an end to taxpayer subsidies for fossil fuels, or a space program designed to learn more about global warming and its impacts.The tragic reality is that we may already be too late to prevent catastrophic weather patterns from becoming the norm in America and around the world. The political disaster behind these weather disasters is the total disregard many of our leaders have displayed about one of the most serious threats to world stability and personal safety.If there must be more wildfires, floods and droughts in the United States and elsewhere, let’s hope the next victim is climate change denial."

Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stanford-study-sexuality_us_59b2b8e1e4b0dfaafcf7b4a5,"They're not here for the ""dangerously bad"" research.",2017-09-08,"A new study used “deep neural networks to extract features” from more than 35,000 facial images that appeared to determine a person's sexuality with remarkable accuracy. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b2bb0418000045001a21de.jpeg?cache=OrW8d138SO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LGBTQ advocacy groups have denounced a “dangerous and flawed” Stanford University study that claims to have used artificial intelligence to help determine a person’s sexuality by looking at their face with remarkable accuracy. The study, which is in draft form but has been accepted by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, reportedly used “deep neural networks to extract features” from more than 35,000 facial images that men and women had posted on an unidentified dating website.Researchers Michal Kosinski and Yilun Wang said they used an algorithm that could correctly identify gay men 81 percent of the time, The Economist reported Friday. Similarly, they claimed the tool was accurate for 74 percent of the women it tested.It’s unclear what benefits, if any, the research would provide. Instead, Kosinski and Wang said their work was a “preventative measure” that highlights the safety risks many LGBTQ people could face if such technology becomes widely available. In keeping with that mindset, they chose not to disclose the dating website used in their research in an effort to discourage copycats. “Tech companies and government agencies are well aware of the potential of computer vision algorithm tools,” the men wrote. “In some cases, losing the privacy of one’s sexual orientation can be life-threatening. The members of the LGBTQ community still suffer physical and psychological abuse at the hands of governments, neighbors, and even their own families.” The research, which was first revealed by The Economist on Friday, made global headlines, with Newsweek, The Guardian, MIT Technology Review and other publications each running their own takes. Officials at GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) quickly condemned the research, noting that the study relied on “myriad flaws” and “had not been peer reviewed.” The report, these officials noted, took online information at face value, and also hinged on the assumption that one’s sexuality did not differ at all from the sexual activity they choose to engage in. They also pointed out that the study did not look at any non-white individuals. Jim Halloran, who is GLAAD’s Chief Digital Officer, said the technology used in Kosinski and Wang’s study had simply shown that “a small subset of out white gay and lesbian people on dating sites” look similar. “This research isn’t science or news, but it’s a description of beauty standards on dating sites that ignores huge segments of the LGBTQ community, including people of color, transgender people, older individuals, and other LGBTQ people who don’t want to post photos on dating sites,” he said. “At a time where minority groups are being targeted, these reckless findings could serve as weapon to harm both heterosexuals who are inaccurately outed, as well as gay and lesbian people who are in situations where coming out is dangerous.”Equally troubled by the media’s attention to the report was Ashland Johnson, who is the HRC’s Director of Public Education and Research. The “dangerously bad” research was “likely to be taken out of context,” and could potentially “threaten the safety and privacy of LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ people alike,” he said. “Imagine for a moment the potential consequences if this flawed research were used to support a brutal regime’s efforts to identify and/or persecute people they believed to be gay,” he said. “Stanford should distance itself from such junk science rather than lending its name and credibility to research that is dangerously flawed and leaves the world ― and this case, millions of people’s lives ― worse and less safe than before.”Read more on the study here.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b2b15018000045001a21ae.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"These days, it appears Hollywood is attempting to spread its wings and divulge new stories about the world we live in and the people we are. Attempting being the key word here. Although we’ve seen incredibly diverse work on our big and small screens this year, the industry still has a long way to go when it comes to representation and inclusivity ― and, truthfully, the talent creators are hiring could inspire them to test the limits a bit more. Take Gwendoline Christie, for instance. The “Game of Thrones” star, who is typically cast in roles that touch on her 6-foot-3 stature, is set to appear in Jane Campion’s newest installment of “Top of the Lake,” out Sunday on SundanceTV. She recently spoke to HuffPost about starring on the miniseries and what it meant for her to play someone different than, say, a Brienne of Tarth or a Captain Phasma. Campion, Christie says, isn’t afraid to show human beings as they are, versus who they’d like to be, and that’s “vital” to her.“Being a film fan since I can remember, I remember thinking, probably around the age of 7 or 8, ‘This is boring. I want to be an actress but these parts are so often boring. Why is the woman just the girlfriend? Why is she just the mother? Why does she have minimal dialogue? Why is the emphasis on her body? Why does she have to have so few clothes on?’ And, I think it’s no secret, of course, that the world has been formed from a patriarchal society. Whilst that is how it’s existed, I would like to see something else,” Christie told HuffPost on Build Series Thursday. “And I think that it isn’t just about women. This is about men — this is about human beings. We want to see new stories. And it’s only, in my opinion, through seeing the differences that we can see the similarities in each other.” Christie’s “Top of the Lake: China Girl” co-star Elisabeth Moss agreed, saying that it seems executives are now keen to fund stories audiences are craving.“The people who hold the purse strings are finally waking up to the fact that these are the stories we want to see,” Moss, who had an extremely successful run with “The Handmaid’s Tale” earlier this year, said. “We want to see stories about women. We want to see stories about diversity. We want to see ourselves. And writers are finally able to tell their stories.”“It doesn’t have to be appealing,” Christie added of storytelling, “and that’s for men and women. It’s a human issue, and that, to me, is an exciting place for art to exist.”Christie and Moss are proud of the fact that they get to play out such a true dynamic between women on screen. In “China Girl,” Moss revives her role as the complicated detective Robin Griffin, who teams up with Christie’s rookie cop Miranda Hilmarsson after a suitcase carrying a woman’s decaying body washes up on the shores of Sydney. Throughout the series, Robin and Miranda’s partnership is a tricky one to dissect. “I think we both really embraced the opportunity to play a female relationship that is not shown that often on screen,” Moss told HuffPost. “They’re not best friends and they’re not enemies — it’s much more complicated than that. They have a really beautiful arc that’s very much based in reality.”The show also stars Ms. Powerhouse herself, Nicole Kidman, and Campion’s daughter Alice Englert, who give stellar performances as a mother-daughter duo whose relationship is tested amid familial struggles. “In the first [‘Top of the Lake’], I was so surrounded by men — it was all men, everywhere. And woods! And this time I had all these women to play with,” Moss said. “So for me, the opportunity ... was just really such a gift.”The three-night “Top of the Lake: China Girl” event debuts on Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on SundanceTV.

The home, roughly 75 miles north of New York City, was suspected of harboring illegal wildlife, the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) said.The animals, which were described as swimming in a 15-feet-diameter pool, were captured “with ease” before being measured, tagged and having their blood taken. They were then transported to the Long Island Aquarium in Riverhead, which shared updates on their condition Thursday.“They are young and range from one and a half feet to probably just under four feet, so they are most likely all between one and three years old,” Darlene Puntillo, a spokeswoman for the aquarium, told HuffPost by email.According to the DEC’s website, sandbar sharks, which are considered vulnerable to becoming endangered species, can grow up to 8 feet long.Though the sandbar sharks were found to be in good condition, they were “not in good health due to the conditions in which they were found and the transport they initially went through,” Puntillo said.“They are doing great under our aquarist’s care. They are all eating and swimming well and our caregivers are target training them (which means the sharks will learn to come up to the surface to be fed) so that they can more closely monitor how much each animal is eating,” she said.A video posted on the aquarium’s Twitter page on Thursday showed the sharks swimming around a quarantined pool.Though authorities don’t know all of the details behind the sharks’ placement in the home, Puntillo said that they’re believed to have been sold as exotic pets, which is illegal.Though no charges have been filed, authorities said the case remains under investigation.As unusual as the story may sound, it’s not the first time the Long Island Aquarium has taken in confiscated animals. About 15 years ago, the aquarium took in African penguins after they were smuggled into the country and apprehended at New York City’s JFK airport, Puntillo said."

PREVIOUSLY:WASHINGTON ― The credit monitoring company that let criminals steal personal information pertaining to nearly half the U.S. population is offering free credit monitoring to those affected ― but there’s a catch.Victims of the Equifax security breach who sign up for the company’s “complimentary” service will only get one free year. After that, unless they proactively cancel, they may have to pay.

Instead of trying to rip people off with new hidden charges and trick consumers to give up their rights it might be a better idea to actually remedy the harm.”A spokesperson for Equifax did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the free service.Customers also must agree to settle disputes outside of court in an extremely business-friendly format known as arbitration.Consumer advocates describe the arbitration clause as a straightforward ripoff for the 143 million Americans whose Social Security numbers and addresses are now in the hands of criminals thanks to a breach earlier this year. Though it discovered the breach in late July, Equifax publicly announced the news on Thursday. “At this point it’s very clear that Equifax is trying to use this massive data breach as an excuse to profit, which is just appalling behavior,” said Amanda Werner, the campaign manager at Americans for Financial Reform. “I can’t even put into words how awful this behavior is.”As Equifax explains in the terms of use, customers using its products are subject to mandatory, binding arbitration. “By consenting to submit Your Claims to arbitration, You will be forfeiting Your right to bring or participate in any class action (whether as a named plaintiff or a class member) or to share in any class action awards, including class claims where a class has not yet been certified, even if the facts and circumstances upon which the Claims are based already occurred or existed.”Weissman said that the arbitration clause attached to the free credit monitoring service covers only the credit monitoring service offered and not the overarching breach of data. Still, if Equifax failed to inform a customer ― a victim of the hack, say ― that their identity had been compromised and was being used without their knowledge, by signing up for their free credit monitoring offer and thus agreeing to the arbitration clause, they would have waived the right to sue over this failure outside of arbitration.However, Equifax also requires consumers who have requested their credit score directly from the company in the past to have agreed to an arbitration clause that could cover the breach.“If you’ve been an Equifax customer, they will claim that you have agreed to an arbitration provision,” Weissman said.A company spokesman said the arbitration only applied to the free credit monitoring, not the cybersecurity breach.Equifax, along with Experian and TransUnion, are the three largest companies that track credit histories of everybody who takes out a loan or signs up a credit card, creating proprietary “scores” that help lenders evaluate a potential borrower’s ability to pay.The companies are notorious for charging access for the information, which by law is available to consumers for free once a year. Experian has been fined multiple times by the Federal Trade Commission for tricking consumers with false promises of “free” credit reports that wound up costing money.Companies often require consumers to use their products or services if they waive their right to pursue class action lawsuits and enter into direct arbitration with the business if they seek a legal redress to a wrong. In the case of Equifax, everyone who signs up for the free credit monitoring the company is offering to the 143 million people whose data has been compromised is waiving their right to join in a class action suit if something goes wrong with the credit monitoring. The insertion of arbitration clauses into dense terms of service contracts that consumers rarely read has exploded in the past six years. In 2011, the Supreme Court upheld a forced arbitration provision inserted into AT&T contracts in a divided 5-4 ruling. This was one of many tightly divided decisions in recent years where the conservative majority on the court ruled in favor of corporate rights to force consumers into arbitration.In the face of the corporate tilt of the Supreme Court, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the financial watchdog agency created by the 2010 Wall Street reform legislation, recently announced a new rule against mandatory arbitration clauses disallowing class action lawsuits. But Republicans in Congress have vowed to strike the rule.The new CFPB arbitration rule is scheduled to take effect on Sept. 18. House Republicans, however, already passed a resolution in July that would block the implementation of the rule. Republicans in the Senate have introduced similar legislation, but have not yet voted on it. That legislation is not subject to a filibuster and would therefore only require 50 votes to pass in a chamber with 52 Republican senators.Additionally, congressional Republicans are pushing legislation introduced by Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) that sides with the credit reporting companies. Loudermilk’s bill would place a $500,000 cap on punitive damages for consumers who have been wronged. In an ironic twist, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on Loudermilk’s bill on Thursday ― the same day Equifax revealed the breach of consumer data."

The group hopes to raise at least $10,000 by the end of the month to donate to the Jim Collins Foundation, a trans-founded and led non-profit that offers grants for gender-affirming procedures to those in need.“I’ve found that many LGBT Christians give their tithe money back to LGBT people instead of the church since, broadly speaking, the evangelical church isn’t doing anything to help the needs of LGBT people,"" Eliel Cruz, founder of FaithfullyLGBT, told HuffPost.The initiative was announced just over a week after more than 150 evangelical leaders released the Nashville Statement, a fiercely anti-LGBTQ manifesto calling it sinful to even affirm the identities of transgender individuals. Hundreds of other Christian leaders swiftly responded with counter statements, coming forward with strong messages of inclusion.But for many LGBTQ Christians, the Nashville Statement reopened wounds church communities have inflicted over the years, from lobbying for anti-trans bathroom bills to promoting the abusive and widely condemned “reparative therapy.”#TitheTrans is a way for Christian allies to “put their tithing where their beliefs are,” Cruz said, and help make reparations for the damage caused by anti-LGBTQ theology.“It’s hard for Christians in general to make reparations when far too many Christians are still actively promoting theology that harms trans people,” he told HuffPost. “But for the growing number of Christians who have come to a better understanding of scripture around same-sex relationships and gender identity ― an understanding that is life giving and affirming ― this is a way to tangibly give back.”Transgender people constitute one of the most marginalized communities in the U.S. They disproportionately suffer from mental health issues, poverty, hate crimes and abuse.For transgender individuals seeking out procedures to affirm their gender identity, the cost can be prohibitive. Surgeries can cost upwards of $100,000, and not all insurance providers are willing to help cover gender-affirming procedures. Nearly 20 percent of transgender people lack any form of health insurance, and 15 percent live below the poverty line, according to GLAAD.“Transgender people face discrimination in health care and this contributes directly to the known 40 percent attempted suicide rate,” Dru Levasseurl, co-founder and vice president of Jim Collins Foundation, said in a statement, citing statistics from a 2015 study by the National Center for Transgender Equality. The money raised through #TitheTrans will go toward a pool of grant money awarded to several individuals every year via an application process. The foundation notes on its website that not all transgender individuals desire surgery in order to integrate their gender identities. For those who do, the organization states, “gender-affirming surgeries are an important step in their transition to being their true selves.”"

55,QUEER VOICES,Get Ready For DragCon With A Look At The History And Culture of New York City Drag,James Michael Nichols,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dragcon-nyc-drag-explosion_us_59aefeb8e4b0354e440d4e0f,Know your herstory.,2017-09-07,"Afrodite, Sweetie, Faux Pas, Linda and Flloyd at the Building in 1991.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b085971b000039005b4e25.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before DragCon, the “world’s largest drag culture convention” ― which hits New York City for the first time this weekend ― “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and the rise of RuPaul, an arts and performance community in Manhattan’s Lower East Side fostered and shaped the cultural climate that led to the eventual stardom of Mama Ru ― and the mainstreaming of drag as an art form.The ’80s and early ’90s in lower Manhattan are referred to by NYC drag historian Linda Simpson as “The Drag Explosion” ― a proliferation of drag queens and queer performers who had the spotlight turned their way following the mainstreaming of the Club Kids and RuPaul’s hit single “Supermodel Of The World.”Simpson was among those that came up through the Lower East Side drag scene, alongside legends like Lady Bunny, Ethyl Eichelberger, Sister Dimension and Taboo.“During much of this time, drag was an underground art form and not understood at all by mainstream culture,” Simpson told HuffPost. “In fact, it was risky to be a queen back then in public because there was often the threat of violence. But the nightlife was thriving, and every bar and club was clamoring for queens to be eye candy. Eventually, the media started paying a lot of attention.”Drag culture today owes a monumental debt to the drag scene of the Lower East Side at that time. In fact, Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, Executive Producers on “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” came of age in this scene too ― as film students who also performed under the stage name The Fabulous Pop Tarts.“The drag queens of New York, they inspired us! They really brought us up,” Bailey told HuffPost. “These are legendary queens who really, when Randy and I were starry-eyed film students, they really impacted us – they just blew us away. We’d never seen anything like it. And we always felt that we would be watching shows at The Pyramid on Avenue A and thinking, this should be on a bigger stage!”That bigger stage eventually became the institution that is “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” a cultural touchstone that has helped launch and solidify the careers of 113 drag artists, built a mammoth fandom and birthed the now bi-costal tradition of DragCon.But it all started with “The Drag Explosion” ― the name that Simpson gave to her collection of photos documenting the scene that she, RuPaul, Barbato and Bailey all navigated as young, queer New Yorkers.For Fenton and Bailey, bringing DragCon, which has taken place three times in Los Angeles, to the Big Apple for the first time this fall is a homecoming of sorts that brings their journey with the art form full circle.“What always struck us about drag is that is wasn’t necessarily all about gender ― it is a lens through which you see the world. A way to look at the madness, the craziness, the insanity of culture,” Bailey said. “It’s like a license – in a way that in like Shakespearian times the clown or the fool or the joker – these were protected figures who had a license to thrill. And I feel that’s what drag is – it’s a way to take everything in the world and turn it upside down.”DragCon NYC will take place Sept. 9 & 10 at the Javits Center in New York City.

56,POLITICS,Conservatives Blame Ryan And McConnell For Enabling Trump’s Deal With Democrats,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-activists-blame-ryan-mcconnell-for-trump-deal-with-democrats_us_59b18866e4b0dfaafcf6528c,"""Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do,"" said one conservative leader.",2017-09-07,"President Donald Trump meets with, from left to right, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Wednesday, Sep. 6, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b18a561b000039005b5044.jpeg?cache=zYIqedHKzP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fiscal conservatives are disappointed in President Donald Trump for cutting a deal with Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday to keep the government running and increase the debt ceiling for just three months as part of a bill to provide emergency funding for areas hit by Hurricane Harvey.The agreement, which Trump reportedly sprang on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), extended government spending and the debt limit for a far shorter period than Republican leaders wanted. It also gives Democrats leverage to demand significant policy concessions in December, since the two previously separate deadlines are now due to coincide, skeptics warned.But some of the president’s critics are even more frustrated with Ryan and McConnell for allowing the deadline to approach without an apparent strategy to extract policy wins from Democrats, losing the president’s confidence in the process.If the two congressmen had a plan for the upcoming deadlines, members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus were not aware of it, according to Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks, a conservative activism group with ties to the hardline Republican faction.“I put most of it on [Ryan and McConnell] to be honest. You had a lot of time and we were just getting closer to [the government funding deadline of] September 30,” Brandon said. “I blame McConnell and Ryan first. Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do: He said he likes debt; he said he was gong to expand spending; and he said that when the time was right, he would pivot to working with Democrats,” said Matt Kibbe, president of Free The People, a libertarian-leaning conservative advocacy group. Failing to prioritize passage of a full-year budget earlier this year, weakened Ryan and McConnell’s bargaining leverage, Kibbe said. Had they gotten further along in the budgeting process, Kibbe suggested, they would not be faced with the prospect of appearing to hold up emergency funding to deal with two historic hurricanes. “They want to play the last-minute brinksmanship game and they always lose that game ― every single time,” he said. “They have created this situation where they don’t have a card to play.”Meanwhile, the more nationalist-oriented conservatives that make up Trump’s base shared the fiscal hawks’ criticism of Ryan and McConnell, even as they defended Trump’s deal with the Democrats.Congressional Republican leaders have squandered the president’s trust by failing to shepherd an Affordable Care Act repeal and other Trump priorities, according to Trump partisans. Cutting a deal with Democrats was a necessary message to Republicans to get their act together, according to John Gilmore, who runs the Minnesota Conservatives blog. “Trump is saying: If you don’t deal with me, I’ll deal with somebody else,” Gilmore said.Ryan and McConnell had first proposed an 18-month government funding and debt ceiling extension, and then a 6-month extension.But Ryan and McConnell have not proven that they can corral the moderates in their caucus who waver at the first sign of a fight with Democrats, Yossi Gestetner, a pro-Trump commentator, argued on Twitter.Knowing that, Trump decided to avoid a prolonged process where he could be “tripped by ‘righteous’ GOPers,” according to Gestetner.John Nolte, an editor-at-large at Breitbart, drew a similar conclusion on Twitter.The president’s nationalist supporters now have to contend with new evidence that Trump is playing ball with Democrats on immigration policy, an issue closer to many of their hearts. On Thursday, Trump tweeted an assurance to the undocumented recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that they have “nothing to worry about,” after Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) asked him to do. Pelosi has also claimed that Trump promised to sign the DREAM Act if it reached his desk. Assessing whether Trump and congressional Republicans suffered a tactical defeat or not, hinges largely on which party one believes the public would hold responsible for a government shutdown, how high the political price would be for that party, and whether it would be offset by longer-term gains. Trump could have used his bully pulpit to pin the blame on Democrats for a forthcoming government shutdown by arguing that they were the ones refusing to accept spending cuts to reduce the debt, Brandon posited. “If the Democrats are going to try to support shutting the government down over their issues, then let’s tell the American people that,” Brandon said. “Then you go to the negotiating table with higher leverage.”“[Former President Barack] Obama used that rhetoric to grind down the GOP. Now you have the opportunity to flip that,” he added.If Ryan and McConnell could have insisted on the type of spending cuts that fiscal conservatives so badly crave, that would at least allow groups like FreedomWorks to show their members that a unified Republican government can lead to tangible constraints on spending and debt, according to Brandon.Even if Republicans got stuck with the blame for a shutdown, it is not clear that voters’ anger would last long enough to affect the party’s performance in the 2018 midterm elections.In 2013, Republicans forced a government shutdown when Obama refused to de-fund the Affordable Care Act. The party capitulated after a few weeks with nothing to show for it but $24 billion in lost economic output, but a year later voters handed Republicans control of the Senate. “There’s always lot of talk about the political damage from debt ceiling showdowns and government shutdowns, but the data in practice doesn’t seem to show that,” Kibbe said.“Would it be different given the devastation of these two hurricanes?” he continued. “There’s a way to solve the emergency funding problem and still insist on a path to a balanced budget, but it would have to be something that the president and the Republican leadership had invested in.” "

Barnebys describes itself as the “Google of the art world.” People can use its database to search through works for sale at over 2,000 auction houses worldwide. They can also use the site’s resources to determine or estimate the value of certain works before they hit the auction block. As you might imagine, it is particularly difficult to appraise the value of a drawing like Trump’s. “These kinds of things are hard to put a value on,” Pontus Silfverstolpe, co-founder of Barnebys, told HuffPost on the phone. “It’s not like Trump is Picasso.”Sure, Trump lacks Picasso’s artistic acumen. But more practically, he lacks a rich historical oeuvre which could help give context to the valuation of his work. When appraising a piece by an artist like Picasso, Silfverstolpe and his colleagues can base its price on the success of his other works, as well as with the prices of artworks made in a similar movement, era or set of conditions. For Trump’s artistic endeavors, however, there is hardly any frame of reference whatsoever, which leaves a looming question mark. “It’s hard to know before the auction,” Silfverstolpe said. “It can be a wild guess.” The only real comparison, he explained, is that other Trump drawing, which sold for $29,184. That’s the general ballpark Silfverstolpe imagines the sketch in question will sell for, although it could go for far more. This is not to say that Trump is on the same creative level as other emerging and established contemporary artists whose work sells in the $30,000 range. “It’s not about the quality of the painting, but the person who made it,” Silfverstolpe said. “If it was made by someone else, it would cost, best case, not even a hundred dollars. To be honest, the quality is not that good.” However aesthetically unexceptional it may be, though, the drawing was made by one of the most powerful men in the world. And its subject matter, a city that is intimately connected with Trump’s persona and narrative, bodes well for the work’s value.“If he would have painted an apple, there wouldn’t be the same interest,” Silfverstolpe said. “It wouldn’t be so him.”Trump is far from the first politician to dabble in the fine arts. Former President George W. Bush painted portraits of 98 wounded veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars for his book Portraits of Courage. According to Barnebys, a painted called “Butterflies” by former President Jimmy Carter sold for $525,000 at auction earlier this summer. In 2016, a similar Carter painting depicting crabapple blossoms sold for $750,000, a record for the 39th commander-in-chief. Similarly, a signed painting by Sir Winston Churchill, titled “A View From Marrakech,” sold at Christie’s in 2008 for $752,000. The work was estimated to sell for between $556,000 and $834,000. Another Churchill piece, titled “Villa on the Nivelle,” went for $702,000 three years later.

I started by sitting for a family with two sons, Oc and Pete, the oldest of which is now in 8th grade. I’ve since served in some capacity for around fifteen families in Chapel Hill, Wilson, and elsewhere, a male babysitter in a sea of females. I guess my role as babysitter has been a defining feature of my time in college, but it hasn’t had to be ― I choose every single day to place real value in those experiences.Most of my friends consider babysitting to be “what Hayden does” because they don’t know any other men who do it. It’s no secret that when most of us hear the word “babysitter” we immediately think of this person being a woman.Why wouldn’t you? Most of us at some point in our lives interacted with a female babysitter, but a male one? Not so much. I don’t know what made me initially enjoy babysitting ― maybe it was just a fun job on weekend nights when I had nothing else to do, an easy way to make some money while having a blast. It’s since become much more for me.My perspective is one that ― for better or worse ― comes from a vantage point far different from most college-aged men. I spend much of my time each week with children, and a major reason for this is my choice to continue babysitting throughout the entirety of college. When I walk to class each day, I pass Chapel Hill guys I’ve known for several years who have never once interacted one-on-one with a child. And who can blame them? They’re living the “normal” lives of college-aged men, and so am I, right? Or am I some sort of outlier? The truth is that sometimes I do feel as if I’m living a life so different from my other classmates as a male babysitter, and perhaps I speak for other men who live lives similar to mine?Everyday, I concern myself with how I can use my role as babysitter to better the lives of my guys and girls. Babysitting isn’t just about hanging out with the kids until their parents come home. It’s about finding ways to use your time with them to make their lives better and more full than before they met you. Listening to everything they say and making sure they know how important they are, asking them what they did for others today, giving them advice, even when their requests may seem silly. I read a few months ago one girl’s note to the kids whom she babysits in which she wrote how she’ll always care about them, even as their babysitter, and I feel the same way, though that’s a story for another day.I am a male babysitter who invests a whole lot of himself in his kids.I am a male babysitter who has watched his people grow up over the years.I am a male babysitter who loves what he does.I am a male babysitter who sometimes feels like an outcast as a result.I am a male babysitter who wouldn’t trade his job for anything else.I am a male babysitter who is still deciding his career path, and maybe, just maybe, babysitting can lend itself to his final decision.I am a male babysitter."

The 3-0 ruling takes effect in five days.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that Trump’s ban could be implemented on a limited basis, but should not be applied to people with “bona fide” relationships to people or entities in the United States.The government took a narrow view of that interpretation, which the state of Hawaii challenged in court. A lower court judge sided with Hawaii, and the 9th Circuit judges upheld that view.“It is hard to see how a grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, sibling-in-law, or cousin can be considered to have no bona fide relationship with their relative in the United States,” the court said.The court also rejected the administration’s argument that the written assurances provided by resettlement agencies obligating them to provide services for specific refugees is not a bona fide relationship.The agencies’ advance preparation and expenditure of resources for each refugee “supports the district court’s determination that a bona fide relationship with the refugee exists,” the decision said.Trump’s first version of the executive order, signed in January, sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world before it was blocked by courts. The administration replaced that version of the ban with a new order in March in response to the legal challenges.A Department of Justice spokeswoman said: “The Supreme Court has stepped in to correct these lower courts before, and we will now return to the Supreme Court to vindicate the Executive Branch’s duty to protect the Nation.”Hawaii’s Attorney General Douglas Chin said the ruling “keeps families together. It gives vetted refugees a second chance. The Trump administration keeps taking actions with no legal basis. We will keep fighting back.”Refugee organizations cheered Thursday’s decision, saying it will give relief to people fleeing violence who were caught in limbo after the ban.The broader question of whether the revised travel ban discriminates against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution will be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in October.(Reporting by Mica Rosenberg and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Andrew Chung and Lawrence Hurley in Washington; editing by Sue Horton and Grant McCool)"

Hellerstedt ― published a blog post to announce its effort. “During Hurricane Harvey, many of the clinics in Houston had to close temporarily, leaving women with very few options,” the organization wrote. “Continued political attacks on abortion access make an unwanted pregnancy particularly stressful in Texas ― add that to the stress of dealing with hurricane aftermath.” For those reasons, Whole Woman’s Health partnered with the Lilith Fund, a group that provides funding for abortions to low-income Texans, to ensure that any woman affected by Harvey will not have to pay for an abortion. Whole Woman’s Health, which has clinics located in Austin, San Antonio, McAllen and Fort Worth, will also be using funds from its own charity, the Stigma Relief Fund. “Whole Woman’s Health continues to support multiple efforts that will benefit those affected by this devastating storm. But we can do more,” the organization wrote in the announcement. “Texas women deserve it.” HuffPost has reached out to Whole Woman’s Health and Lilith Fund for comment and will update this piece accordingly.

Thomas and I have been playing together for years, but this was the first time that I recorded our hitting session. I captured video to see what I look like on the court now that I am older and a more skilled player. When I first started playing tennis in local United States Tennis Association tournaments, my dad would film some of my matches to give me the opportunity to analyze my game first-hand.After watching a couple minutes of the footage playback, Thomas said to me, ""Now, tell me we don't look like Venus and Serena [Williams] out there."" I couldn't help but laugh. Our playing styles, movements and strokes, although they pale in comparison, were inspired and molded by Venus and Serena. On my forehand side, I alternate holding my racket like Venus or Serena depending on my mood. Much like both sisters, Thomas has the power and mental resolve to blast break points away with a big serve when caught in a jam.In learning tennis, we studied them much more than we studied the game. Without Venus and Serena as references, there is no telling what our playing styles would be like. There is no telling if we would have ever picked up rackets and fallen in love with the sport. As successful Black athletes in a predominantly White sport, they gave us a vision and helped us believe in possibilities in the world of tennis for ourselves.On Thursday, three Black women: Venus Williams, Sloane Stephens and Madison Keys, played in the U.S. Open semifinals for a chance at a place in the final, and ultimately the title. This is the first all-American U.S. Open women's semifinal since 1981. And this year will be the first all-Black final at the U.S. Open since Serena defeated Venus for the title in 2002. Stephens will face Keys in the final.For years, there has been a drought in American tennis. Prior to Serena and Venus Williams, the last American woman to win a grand slam tournament was Jennifer Capriati in 2002. The last American man to win a grand slam tournament was Andy Roddick in 2003. And now, in 2017, there is a 75 percent chance that the next winner of the U.S. Open women's tournament will be not only an American, but a Black woman.For historical context, outside of Venus and Serena Williams, only three other Black players have won grand slam tournaments in singles competition: Althea Gibson, Arthur Ashe Jr. and Yannick Noah. It is important to note that for many years Black players were denied access to the sport's top championship events. Players like Gibson and Ashe broke barriers that allowed for the Williams sisters to dominate in the sport and their achievements ushered in a new generation of talent.Budding star Sloane Stephens is a 24-year-old tennis player from Florida, and the daughter of Sybil Smith who was the first Black woman to be named First-Team All American in Division I swimming history. Madison Keys is also from Florida, and at just 22-years-old has some of the fastest groundstrokes on the WTA Tour. Both have cited the Williams sisters as inspirations. And both will likely go on to inspire up-and-coming young players today.For Venus Williams, at age 37, her accomplishments this year have been nothing short of phenomenal. She has reached two finals at grand slam tournaments, at the Australian Open and at Wimbledon. Based off of her performance at the U.S. Open so far, she is guaranteed to return to the top 5 in the world rankings following the completion of the tournament.Regardless of how the semifinals turn out, history has already been written. I started playing tennis because I first saw Venus and Serena Williams play in the U.S. Open final in 2002. Fourteen years later, I know that somewhere there will be an unassuming child not fully aware of the history they are witnessing, but enchanted nonetheless by the Black girl magic on the tennis court, who will go forward and pick up a racket one day too.As a long-time fan of tennis, I have never had difficulty in deciding who to root for. Tonight will be a little different.Joseph Pate is the digital campaigns manager for the Center for Community Change."

Murphy, MD, PhD In my work at McLean Hospital, I am surrounded by psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental",2017-09-07,"<p>Pet volunteers, and their human counterparts, are improving the lives of patients with a variety of mental health diagnoses</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b180e31700002800288bcc.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Beth L. Murphy, MD, PhDIn my work at McLean Hospital, I am surrounded by psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health caregivers who are extremely talented, passionate, and caring. This dedicated staff works hard every day to provide the best possible outcomes for our patients, and now they have a volunteer staff of four-legged individuals that helps make their jobs just a bit easier.With names like Beanie, Pooh, Rufus, Tuna, and Smokey, I must humbly admit—as a psychiatrist myself—that our pet therapy animals may have become our most-favored caregivers. And I’m okay with that, as they have enhanced the ability of professionals to do their jobs and improved our patients’ experiences.It should be noted, however, that the current body of research addressing pet therapy is somewhat weak. While there are demonstrable short-term benefits, we need more quality research that addresses potential long-term benefits. However, in my estimation, the short-term benefits alone, which include breakthroughs in treatment, are reason enough to have a pet therapy program.Our group of pet therapy animals is quite diverse, with a wide range of colors, sizes, and shapes. It is mostly composed of dogs, although we have one superstar cat, Tuna (who has his own Facebook page). I would add that such diversity helps to offer something for everyone, but it turns out that each and every animal seems to be adored by everyone.Our therapy animals aren’t just a bunch of cute faces. They are responsible for significant care enhancements throughout our hospital, with the ability to help patients with virtually any mental health condition.For example, we have found that one of the things our elder patients miss the most about coming into the hospital is their pets. While they may struggle with certain aspects of their memory, they very clearly remember their animal companions, even those from long ago. By exposing these patients to a therapy animal, we evoke a lot of memories, a lot of positive feelings, and a sense of security.Staff in our depression and anxiety programs tell us that pet therapy groups are often the first groups their patients feel safe enough and comfortable enough to go to, and they are consistently the highest attended groups for those programs. This ability to simply get patients to participate in therapy is an important breakthrough.During these sessions, one or more animals are present while patients in the group talk about how it feels to be with the animals and the relationships that they have with animals. Many individuals in these sessions notice how their mood shifts dramatically when the animals are present. This change is particularly significant for people with depression or psychotic disorders, as it counters their belief that they couldn’t feel happy again. By reviving these dormant emotions, the animals help demonstrate to patients that they do have the capacity to feel happy, to feel connected to other people and other beings, and to recover.I have also seen the effect that Hunter, my own therapy animal partner, has on patients.What I have found during my work in the emergency room is that people are often very, very scared about coming into the hospital. However, when they see that Hunter—a Pomeranian who weighs about 8 pounds and is clearly not great at protecting himself—is happy and safe here, they feel confident that they probably are too.But Hunter doesn’t only help our patients. He also has an official staff support role. A lot of our staff have very stressful jobs, but they light up when they see Hunter. Just as with our patients, it makes me feel good that Hunter is helping someone else feel good, and it also provides me with opportunities to meet people whom I probably wouldn’t meet if Hunter wasn’t around.Although some would argue that every animal is special, the pets on our volunteer staff have demonstrated that they are particularly suited for the work at McLean Hospital. In fact, pet therapy animals at McLean have to pass an exam with a national organization that assesses the animal’s temperament and behavior, be licensed in the town in which they live, have proof that they have had a series of vaccinations, and wear a photo ID badge on campus to show that they’re a legitimate volunteer.Each of our therapy animals also has to be accompanied by a human companion while on campus, and they are credentialed together as volunteer partners. These teams always stay together and only go where they are invited at McLean. This differs from a service animal, which doesn’t need an invitation to travel freely with its partner.Unfortunately, we currently don’t have enough credentialed animal therapy teams to meet demand. That’s why we are encouraging people to consider becoming a part of one of these very important partnerships. It not only helps our patients tremendously, we have also found that the human halves of the volunteer teams are richly rewarded as well.Beth L. Murphy, MD, PhD, is the associate medical director of the Clinical Evaluation Center (CEC) at McLean Hospital, a program that specializes in evaluating individuals in acute psychiatric crisis who may need inpatient hospitalization. The CEC sees individuals with a broad range of psychiatric disorders, which matches Dr. Murphy’s interest in diagnostic assessment and acute stabilization.The American Kennel Club maintains a list of organizations throughout the country that certify/register therapy dogs."

Bob Menendez speaks to journalists on Tuesday outside United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark, New Jersey, after arriving to face trial for federal corruption charges. His daughter Alicia Menendez looks on.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b1634e1400001f00fa8738.jpeg?cache=JxsVBAh5Fz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― An incumbent Democratic senator is on trial this week on charges of federal bribery, and his colleagues in the Senate would rather not talk about it.Federal prosecutors alleged Wednesday that Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) entered into a “corrupt pact” with wealthy donor and longtime friend Dr. Salomon Melgen. They said the senator received luxurious vacations abroad, flights on the Florida eye doctor’s private jet and hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign cash, and that none of the gifts were disclosed on Menendez’s annual financial disclosure forms as required by law.In return, prosecutors alleged, Menendez helped Melgen expedite visa applications so his foreign girlfriends could visit him in the U.S. They claimed in a court filing on Wednesday that the relationship dated back at least as far as 2006, shortly after Menendez entered the Senate.“This is what bribery looks like,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Koski said Wednesday as the government made its case. “These two defendants corrupted one of the most powerful offices in our country. The defendants didn’t just trade money for power, they also tried to cover it up.’’“Senator Menendez was Salomon Melgen’s personal United States senator,” Koski added.Both Menendez and Melgan, who was also present at the trial on Wednesday, have denied the allegations.“Never, not once, not once have I dishonored my public office,” Menendez said Wednesday, as he struggled to hold back tears. “I started my public career fighting corruption, that’s how I started, and I have always acted in accordance with the law and I believe when all of the facts are known, I will be vindicated.”Menendez’s defense attorneys argued on Thursday that the government’s bribery case against the senator and Melgen, who was born in the Dominican Republic, represented an “attack” on Hispanic-Americans.The details surrounding the trial, as well as Melgen’s reported ties to former Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), present an embarrassing distraction for Democrats on Capitol Hill. They are trying to focus on pressing issues, such as providing legal status to young undocumented immigrants and the tax reform debate.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday declined to say whether he would stand by Menendez if he’s proven guilty. “Senator Menendez is issuing a spirited defense,” Schumer said. “We all believe in the presumption of innocence in this country, and Senator Menendez is fighting very hard, and we respect that greatly.” Other Democrats were similarly hesitant to weigh in on the trial.“I’m a former prosecutor, so I was trained appropriately to never discuss a trial until it is completed,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). “That process needs to be completed before we all start weighing in politically.”Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said it was “not for me to decide” whether Menendez is guilty. “I think we should let the legal process play out.”Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), however, praised his colleague as a “champion” for residents of the Garden State.“He’s innocent until proven guilty. So he is an innocent man,” he said. “If he’s proven guilty, I think there’s going to be some serious appeals because I think there are some fundamental constitutional questions that I’ve never seen in a case like this.”It’s not yet clear how the trial will affect Menendez’s ability to cast votes in Washington, a likely concern for Democrats given the packed fall legislative schedule. A federal judge rejected Menendez’s request to delay the trial while he attended to congressional business, criticizing the senator for “seeking special treatment.”Republicans, meanwhile, are eager to use the trial as a way to attack vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2018. The Republican National Committee launched a series of online ads this week on Facebook and Twitter, urging high-profile Democrats to weigh in on the fate of Menendez. The committee also launched a Snapchat geofilter around the courthouse in New Jersey where Menendez’s trial is being held."

It’s a very important message. I have lots of money right now.”Instead of getting the Houston televangelist on the line, however, Roiland is surprised to hear a string of garbled words from the woman, amid her repeating: “the blood of Jesus.”“Are you talking in tongues right now?” he asks stunned. “Is that Klingon? Is that baby talk?”“Ricky ticky ta ta ta,” he tries to repeat her words.“If I were to translate this, would it be like, ‘Hey, don’t let anyone into the building during the flood because we don’t want their dirty footsteps walking on our clean carpets?’” he jokes, in reference to critics who slammed Osteen for not immediately opening his Houston facility to people seeking shelter from Hurricane Harvey.Though exactly what the woman was telling him wasn’t too clear, his own summary of the call was.“That was insane, dude,” Roiland announced after getting off the phone."

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-justice-department-gay-wedding-cake_us_59b1af6fe4b0dfaafcf69ee6,The Justice Department said artists can’t be compelled to create against their religious beliefs.,2017-09-07,Jack Phillips stands before a display of his wedding cakes at the Masterpiece Cakeshop in September 2016.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b1b3591400002000fa8847.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Department of Justice told the Supreme Court on Thursday that a baker who is religiously opposed to gay marriage should not be forced to make wedding cakes for same-sex couples.DOJ said that requiring Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado, to create a wedding cake for a gay couple under public accommodations laws would violate his constitutional rights.“Forcing Phillips to create expression for and participate in a ceremony that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs invades his First Amendment rights,” the Justice Department wrote in an amicus brief filed ahead of oral argument in the case. “In the view of the United States, a ... First Amendment intrusion occurs where a public accommodations law compels someone to create expression for a particular person or entity and to participate, literally or figuratively, in a ceremony or other expressive event.”Businesses and other places that are considered “public accommodations” are barred by law from discriminating against people on the basis of factors like race and religion. The DOJ brief suggests that such laws should not be able to compel artists to create “inherently communicative” goods, like wedding cakes.DOJ’s filing raises the possibility that if the Masterpiece Cakeshop can’t refuse to bake a cake for the marriage of a same-sex couple, then a freelance graphic designer who designs flyers for Jewish affinity groups might also be forced to do so “for a neo-Nazi group or the Westboro Baptist Church.”“A custom wedding cake can be sufficiently artistic to qualify as pure speech, akin to a sculptural centerpiece,” the Justice Department wrote. “In short, a custom wedding cake is not an ordinary baked good; its function is more communicative and artistic than utilitarian.”If forced to create such a cake for a gay couple, the DOJ brief argues, Phillips would be required to essentially “participate in a wedding celebration that conflicts with his sincerely held religious beliefs.”The Justice Department also noted that, at the time Phillips refused to make the cake for David Mullins and Charlie Craig in July 2012, the state of Colorado did not recognize same-sex marriages.“In other words, the State itself did not acknowledge the validity of the union it sought to compel petitioners to celebrate,” DOJ wrote. “Especially given that background, the State has not advanced a sufficient state interest to override petitioners’ weighty First Amendment interest in declining to create the expression at issue here.”In a statement, a Justice Department spokeswoman said the amicus brief was filed to protect the free expression of all Americans.“Although public-accommodations laws serve important purposes, they ― like other laws ― must yield to the individual freedoms that the First Amendment guarantees,” said spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam. “That includes the freedom not to create expression for ceremonies that violate one’s religious beliefs.” Louise Melling, deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the brief “was shocking, even for this administration.” She said the Trump administration “is advocating for nothing short of a constitutional right to discriminate.”Read the Justice Department’s filing below."

Mike Honda (D-Calif.), who represented Silicon Valley in the House of Representatives before being defeated last year, is joining Red to Blue California PAC as its chair, serving in an advisory role as the organization gears up for next year’s congressional elections.“In all my years of public service, I cannot think of a more critical time for us to stand up and fight for the values of equality, tolerance, and justice that we hold dear,” Honda said in a statement on Thursday. “Taking back Congress starts right here in California. We must do everything we can to not only resist Donald Trump and a Republican Party that has been hijacked by extremists and white supremacists, but we must also elect candidates that can proudly champion our shared progressive values.”Launched in June, Red to Blue California PAC supports Democratic candidates challenging GOP incumbents in seven congressional districts that voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.The group believes it can play a crucial role in helping Democrats nationwide to retain control of the House, arguing that the path “runs through ‘red’ California.”Democrats need a net gain of 24 seats for a majority in 2018.Michael Eggman, a former congressional candidate in California’s Central Valley, founded the group after narrowly losing his 2016 race challenging GOP incumbent Rep. Jeff Denham, whose seat is among the seven on the group’s radar.“These reps are standing with [President Donald] Trump and not the constituents of their district,” Eggman told HuffPost in June. “Their constituents don’t share Trump’s values, and it seems like these reps do.”In addition to its focus on 2018, the group also hopes to mobilize and train future progressive leaders for all levels of elected office, with Eggman drawing on his lessons learned as a candidate.Eggman on Thursday praised Honda as “a progressive champion, plain and simple.”“Throughout his entire career, Congressman Honda has never forgot where he came from and has always fought to make California and our entire nation a more fair and just place to call home,” he said in a statement. “I know with Mike’s leadership and support, we are going to elect more progressive champions to Congress and to offices across California.”Honda, a native of California whose grandparents immigrated to the U.S. from Japan, spent three years of his childhood incarcerated in a U.S. prison camp during World War II.He entered politics by serving in local and state offices, before winning election to the House in 2000, focusing on education and civil rights issues.In 2008, he co-founded the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, and in 2015, earned praise for his support of his transgender granddaughter. “As the proud grandpa of a transgender grandchild, I hope she can feel safe at school without fear of being bullied,” Honda tweeted.The group also announced a six-figure fundraising haul over the months of July and August. According to spokesman Andrew Feldman, most of the money came in the form of small donations from Californians, reflecting that “California voters are fired up more than ever before to elect folks that share their values, not the values of Donald Trump.”"

Velásquez’s investigation had already implicated the president’s son and brother and was nearing Morales for campaign corruption when he announced the investigator’s expulsion. The nation’s highest court stepped in and stopped the expulsion, allowing Velásquez to continue his investigation.We don’t hear much about Guatemala in the U.S. ― not now, not during the U.S.-backed coup in 1954 that removed a democratically elected president, and not during the U.S.-backed 36-year internal armed conflict with its genocide of indigenous Mayans that occurred in the 1980s and ’90s. But I can think of two really important reasons we in the U.S. should care about what goes on in Guatemala: 1. The atrocities there (past and present) are an affront to human dignity and worth, and the U.S. plays a significant role in what happens in Guatemala; and 2. The parallels between Guatemalan corruption and what’s happening in our own government are striking, and we should learn from what we see in Guatemala about the dangers of unchecked government power.In 1954, the U.S. backed a coup against land reform-minded President Jacobo Arbenz. The U.S.-based United Fruit Company (now Chiquita), whose investors included a number of high level U.S. military leaders and politicians, opposed Arbenz’s plan to buy the company’s unused land and redistribute it to the peasant farmers from whom it had been taken, and so the U.S. isolated Arbenz and Guatemala politically and economically, forcing his resignation. Castillo Armas became president and launched a series of executions of suspected Communists and crushed labor unions, leading to decades of military dictatorships and repression of Guatemala’s indigenous people, poor, and the Left.The internal armed conflict began in 1960 as guerilla fighters challenged military oppression. The government responded with a program of disappearances and executions that led to the deaths of more than 200,000 Guatemalans, most of whom were Mayan. In one region, during an 18-month period, the government wiped out five percent of the Maya Ixil population.By the 1980s, the government developed a scorched earth policy that labelled many indigenous Mayans as guerillas. The thinking was, “Drain the lake. Kill the fish.” The government assumed villagers were supporting the guerillas, and so the military entered the villages, killed the entire population, and burned their homes and crops.One of the most horrific massacres, however, had nothing to do with the guerillas. It happened because a Maya Achi village opposed the Chixoy hydroelectric dam project that would flood their village, including many Mayan sacred and archaeological sites, and dislocate them from their ancestral lands. Because of this opposition, the government labelled the villagers of Rio Negro guerillas, and that meant soldiers could do anything they wanted to them, with impunity.In February of 1982, the men of Rio Negro were called to a meeting in a neighboring village where paramilitary “Civil Defense Patrols” ambushed and murdered them. One month later, the same paramilitary, escorted by soldiers, came to Rio Negro. Sebastian, who was 16 at the time, was our guide as we walked up the mountain toward Pak’oxom. Sebastian’s mother had warned him to run if he ever heard the dogs in the village barking because it meant the soldiers had arrived. On that morning, Sebastian heard the dogs and fled into the mountains, where he lived for the next 2.5 years. The 70 women and 107 children of the village, however, were forced to march up the mountain (I had to turn back after two hours of climbing because I didn’t have the stamina to make it to the top). Along the way, a 98-year-old Mayan priest was tied up and thrown over the edge. At the top, the women and children were brutalized, raped and slaughtered.The families who survived reestablished the community higher up the mountain because of the flooding of the valley. The small village is isolated and poor, and, in a twist of irony, only got electricity a year ago. Reparations are slow in coming, despite the wealth generated by the hydroelectric dam.In recent years, Guatemala has made some attempt at justice for the genocide, particularly through the efforts of one woman, Claudia Paz y Paz, the former attorney general who created the conditions to carry out a genocide trial in 2013. The former general and dictator Efraín Ríos Montt was convicted of crimes against humanity and genocide by a Guatemalan court. However, the Constitutional Court, bowing to pressure from political and economic elites, reversed the ruling just ten days later arguing a legal technicality. The court has been slow to retry Rios Montt, who is ailing and confined to house arrest. The survivors, however, are encouraged. They understand justice as more than simply seeing Rios Montt behind bars. They’re content that he is now widely seen as guilty, even without a second trial, and that the genocide is being talked about, which they hope ensures it never happens again.Yet atrocities persist in Guatemala. On March 8 of this year, 41 girls died, and 15 more were severely burned in a fire at the Hogar Seguro Virgen de la Asunción just outside Guatemala City. The girls were in shelter because they had been reported missing at some point ― running away from abuse, kidnapped, trafficked. They were not criminals. But when they attempted to escape from the shelter because of their mistreatment there, government officials, including President Morales, abdicated responsibility for the girls and turned them over to the national police who captured them and locked them in a small room, not even allowing them to use the bathroom. The girls eventually set a mattress on fire near a window thinking the police would see the smoke and let them out. The flames, however, quickly spread out of control, engulfing the tiny room. The police, instead of freeing the girls, stood and watched them burn.Currently 400 people (half of them children) are living in the border between Guatemala and Mexico because the government of President Morales sent 1,700 members of the Guatemala security forces to evict them from their village of Laguna Larga because it is located in an area designated as a protected reserve. The government has provided them with little shelter, food, healthcare, or education. The families are living in limbo, fighting for survival until the government offers a solution to their desperate need for land, a place to call home.Human Rights Defenders in Guatemala say the internal armed conflict tore apart the country’s social fabric. Through creating divisions in communities and families, imposing mega projects (such as dams and mines), allowing unchecked government corruption, intimidating journalists, inflaming racism, attacking human rights defenders, ignoring basic rights to food, housing, education, and health, and allowing state violence with impunity, the government of Guatemala has facilitated the wealth of its ruling elite while crushing the majority of its citizens, particularly the Maya. Government power to harm is practically unchecked in Guatemala, and so what happens with Jimmy Morales matters immensely in Guatemala’s move toward or away from the rule of law.I daresay the parallels to the current situation in the U.S. are obvious. The current U.S. administration seeks to exert unchecked power, using many of the same tactics as Guatemala’s military and economic elite. We in the U.S. want to believe that it can’t happen here, as Sinclair Lewis so aptly titled his 1935 novel during the rise of fascism in Europe. But the lesson of Guatemala is precisely this: when government power is unchecked and the forces of military and economic power align, citizens suffer, and the vulnerable and marginalized suffer the most.Certainly the Dakota Access Pipeline echoes the imposition of mega projects on indigenous communities in Guatemala, and the criminalizing of Black Lives Matter looks an awful lot like the labelling of resistors as “guerillas.” Ending DACA shows the same lack of compassion and empathy Morales and his government have shown the families of Laguna Larga and Hogar Seguro.Guatemala’s President Morales was a TV star with no political experience when he ran for president as an outsider on an anti-corruption platform. Sound familiar? In another ironic twist, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley issued a statement in support of the special investigator: “As head of ‎the UN’s International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala‎ (CICIG), Mr. Velásquez is a critical voice calling out corruption and upholding the rule of law. He has the full support of the United States and the international community. We expect the Guatemalan government to allow CICIG to do its critical work without interference. Fighting corruption is essential to the future security and prosperity of Guatemala, which is something we highly value.” I wonder if the Trump administration would say the same of Robert Mueller.I am deeply moved every time I visit Guatemala by the courage of its human rights defenders who are working for justice in a system that is completely stacked against them. I’m struck that a place of such beauty could also be a place of such horror, but its people have not given up on it, the government, or themselves. Survivors have never abandoned hope, even after waiting 30 or 40 years for justice. People take to the streets to protest corruption. They even brought down the last presidency and may bring down this one. We in the U.S. can also learn something from their determination, persistence, and resistance. Unchecked government power is dangerous. Human rights defenders in Guatemala know this first hand and stand up against such power. We in the U.S. must stand alongside them, for their sake and for ours."

Commission of Inquiry on Syria said a government warplane dropped sarin on Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province in April, killing more than 80 civilians.“Government forces continued the pattern of using chemical weapons against civilians in opposition-held areas. In the gravest incident, the Syrian air force used sarin in Khan Sheikhoun, Idlib, killing dozens, the majority of whom were women and children,” the report said, declaring it a war crime.The attack was previously identified as containing sarin, an odorless nerve agent. But that conclusion, reached by a fact-finding mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), did not say who carried it out.In all, U.N. investigators said they had documented 33 chemical weapons attacks to date.Twenty-seven were by forces of the government of President Bashar al-Assad, including seven between March 1 to July 7. Perpetrators had not been identified yet in six early attacks, they said.The Assad government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. It said that its strikes in Khan Sheikhoun hit a weapons depot belonging to rebel forces, a claim dismissed by the U.N. investigators."

It is not taken long for his administration to experience its first crisis.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59affba51400002400fa83d5.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The presidency of Somalia’s Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo is only eight months old but already his administration faces its first crisis - and it is one of their own making.For a country that has experienced years of civil war, division and instability, one would imagine that the greatest challenges facing Somalia’s new administration would be internal. But nothing is ever straightforward in Somalia. So it is that the first real test for President Farmaajo has been sparked by the announcement made last week by the foreign minister of neighbouring Ethiopia that Somali authorities had “played a facilitation role” in the capture of Abdikarin Sheikh Muse.Muse is a member of a liberation movement in the Ogaden region, an almost entirely ethnically Somali area ceded to Ethiopia in the colonial era, and ever since the source of near constant tension and numerous wars in the region.The long history of animosity between the two countries makes the involvement of Somalia in the apprehension of a man wanted by Ethiopia notable; but the details have made it an outrage in Somalia. Muse has long been a resident in Mogadishu and, though heavily involved in the Ogaden liberation movement, is thought to have been born in Somalia. The country’s constitution expressly forbids the extradition of Somali citizen to foreign countries.To add to the potential illegality of Somalia’s involvement in the arrest, one has to consider the platform on which candidate Farmaajo ran his campaign. The leader of a party founded as recently as 2012, Farmaajo’s background was modest compared to many of his rivals. Without the establishment credentials, his popularity was instead based on his strong nationalism, and in particular a frostiness, not to say hostility, to Ethiopia. This provided Farmaajo a unique selling point when compared to incumbent president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud’s perceived cosiness with the government in Addis Ababa.Farmaajo’s strong national and security-based rhetoric have led to many questions about just what role his administration had in the arrest of arrest, even abduction, of Muse. Was this a case of extraordinary rendition? What did the president know and when did he know it? Did he give the go ahead or, perhaps more worryingly, was this done behind his back?For such a matter to become a true scandal though, it cannot simply be an error, or a violation of law, it must hint at a deeper fear, underlying flaw or insecurity.Somalis have never truly recovered from the trauma of their country’s breakdown. Amongst the many catastrophes witnessed in the civil war, the military intervention by Ethiopia remains a deep and unhealed wound. The sight of the Ministry of Defence occupied by Ethiopian troops - the thought of regional rivals rifling through all of the country’s secrets - is a nightmare that still haunts the national psyche. That this matter involves the president apparently reversing his rhetoric and bowing before the Ethiopian authorities hits just these traumas. For many years too, Somalis have had to live with the humiliation of Somalia being an international punchline, a byword for failure. After years of struggle to build their nation once again, this episode raises fundamental questions. To have a Somali citizen snatched from Somali soil - with the apparent complicity and even involvement of the Somali government - makes many wonder if their homeland is still nowhere near being an independent and functioning state.In a case that involves as much baggage as this, it is impossible to separate the questions of legality, history, local custom and realpolitik. With no clear statement from the president or his administration on their involvement in the case, there has been nothing to stem the growing anger and sense of disappointment.Many had high hopes for this new government, viewing it is a clean break with the past, one with a strong sense of identity. All of this has now been thrown into doubt. This is the first real test of Farmaajo as president, and at the moment he is failing it."

As president, he tapped “alt-right” sympathizer Steve Bannon and world-renowned racist Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Then, a few weeks ago, he refused to denounce neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, calling those among the KKK and other hate groups “very fine people.”And with his announcement today, President Trump stood on the side of hate and fear once again by ending DACA, a program that has opened doors for a generation of immigrant youth to work, study and contribute to their communities – without living in constant fear of deportation.Since 2012, DACA – which stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals – has allowed nearly 1 million young people to live out their dreams in the only country they’ve ever called home. The program is a tangible reflection of the values we profess as a country – values like family, hard work and freedom that have made us the economic and cultural powerhouse we are today. That’s because DACA is built on our shared belief that we must invest in our children – the future entrepreneurs, scientists, teachers, and artists – who will determine our country’s shared future.By cancelling DACA, Donald Trump broke his promise last April that the so-called Dreamers should “rest easy” knowing they would not be part of his anti-immigration agenda. Fueled by racism, hate and fear, the president’s latest decision is exactly what the white supremacists in Charlottesville are pining for: a country where people of different races, religions and backgrounds are relegated to second class citizens. We’re getting dangerously close to a new Jim Crow era, in which confederate soldiers who fought for slavery are lionized as heroes – and brown and black people are told to stay in their place.We cannot allow the hate and bigotry we witnessed in Charlottesville to become the norm. The vast majority of Americans, on both sides of the political aisle, believe DACA is in the “best interest of our nation” until we pass a permanent solution: nearly two-thirds of Americans say they’d like to see a path for citizenship for Dreamers – not deportation. That’s because family and freedom are American values – and they’re worth fighting for.Until we pass the Dream Act, DACA is a temporary solution for the hundreds of thousands of children who deserve an equal shot at life, no matter who their parents are or where they were born. With a president who seeks to divide us, we need to stand strong in the face of policies grounded in hate and beliefs based in violence and defend the democracy and the values that this country aspires to be.We cannot allow Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant, anti-family and pro-hate forces to destroy the moral fabric of this country. Let’s demand our leaders protect people and families trying to build better lives and a stronger America for all of us.Donald Trump has made his choice.
