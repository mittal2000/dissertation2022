Bennett will earn $16 million in 2017 and $19 million by March of 2018, the source told HuffPost.The deal is unheard of for a soon-to-be 32-year-old defensive linemen. It is also unique for the team, which has never done a deal with a player who has at least one year remaining on his contract. (Bennett had been signed through next season.)Bennett was previously the 27th-highest paid defensive linemen in the NFL. He held out briefly during training camp with the hopes of inking an extension, telling HuffPost, “You definitely want to get what you think you’re worth. When you put all the things together, I just don’t see a lot of guys having the type of impact I have.”Bennett helped the Seahawks lead the league in total defense over each of the last four seasons, including their Super Bowl victory over Denver. A Pro Bowl selection in 2015 and 2016, he has become one of the league’s premier two-way defensive ends, ranking first in quarterback hurries for all 4-3 defensive ends last year.Last offseason, Bennett skipped voluntary workouts but showed up for a mandatory minicamp and training camp. His production has been down in 2016, but only because he was hit by a series of injuries. He had to miss five games after undergoing knee surgery following a Week 6 game against Atlanta, and then suffered a neck injury in Seattle’s Week 15 win over the Rams. But when he’s been on the field, Bennett’s been terrific, tallying a slew of sacks and stops in the backfield.The decision to extend Bennett’s contract comes after the team has agreed to long-term extensions with linebackers Bobby Wagner and K.J. Wright, along with defensive backs Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor and Earl Thomas ― all elite players at their respective positions. Head coach Pete Carroll told HuffPost before the season, “We’re gonna make an effort ― an effort so he remains a Seahawk.”Undrafted in 2009 out of Texas A&M, Bennett was originally signed by the Seahawks before establishing himself as a legitimate starter with Tampa Bay. Then, he returned to Seattle in 2013, where he’s been a constant wrecking force ever since. The 9-5-1 Seahawks recently earned an NFC West championship for the third time in four years. Carroll and General Manager John Schneider hope that a happy and healthy Bennett means even more production for the league’s second-best scoring defense, and in turn, another deep postseason run.

3,POLITICS,Obama Will Meet With Congressional Democrats On Strategy To Block Obamacare Repeal,Laura Barrón-López and Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-repeal-president-democrats_us_5866978ee4b0eb5864892b28,Dismantling the president's signature health care law is the first item of business for Republicans in January.,2016-12-30,"President Obama will talk with Democrats about ""the work still left to do"" to save his health care reform.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5866983a1500002300916855.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Barack Obama will huddle with House and Senate Democrats next week to strategize on how best to protect the Affordable Care Act.Republican lawmakers plan to take up a repeal of Obamacare as soon as Congress returns in January. “Next week, Republicans in Congress will once again turn to repealing a law that’s provided coverage to 20 million uninsured Americans, extended consumer protections to many millions more, improved the quality of care offered by our health professionals, and helped slow the growth of health care costs,” a White House official said in a statement. “In light of this, on Wednesday, January 4, President Obama will visit a meeting of the House and Senate Democratic Caucuses.”The official added that Obama will thank the members for helping advance the health care system. “He will discuss the work still left to do, including the ideas he has put forth to strengthen the Affordable Care Act (ACA). And he will share his perspective about the dangers posed by Congressional Republicans’ stated strategy to repeal the ACA before proposing any replacement, creating chaos in the health system in the short run ― and holding hostage Americans’ health care ― while Republicans develop their plan,” the official said. A senior Democratic Senate aide confirmed that the meeting would be about the party’s “fight against GOP repeal efforts.”Democratic leaders have been defiant about Republicans’ chances of pulling off this effort. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) predicted that Republicans would not repeal Obamacare once they realized how difficult it would be to replace.“They’re not going to repeal it,” Pelosi said earlier this month. “I don’t think they’re going to repeal the Affordable Care Act.”In a letter sent to House and Senate Democrats last week, congressional leaders are advising their members to prepare for a national day of action against repeal efforts on Jan. 14 in coordination with governors. House members were directed to plan press events on Jan. 7 to highlight the risks of undoing Obamacare.Still, the GOP is rushing forward and party leaders are unanimous about scrapping the law. The American people, however, aren’t exactly enthused about the idea, according to a post-election survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Only about one-quarter of Americans favor fully repealing the Affordable Care Act, while nearly half want to leave it in place or expand it.As for what guidance Obama may be able to give congressional Democrats about how to stop, or even influence the direction of, the GOP’s repeal-and-delay strategy, that isn’t easy to imagine.Republicans control both chambers of Congress. Democrats have virtually no tools at their disposal to alter the House’s direction on health care. And in the Senate, Republicans plan to use the budget reconciliation mechanism ― which allows a measure to pass with a simple majority and can’t be filibustered ― to knock out the biggest parts of the Affordable Care Act early next year.Reconciliation bills are limited to changing laws that affect taxes and spending, which covers key elements of Obamacare. The health care reform law raised taxes on wealthy individuals and health care companies and cut Medicare payment rates to medical providers in order to finance new spending on health benefits.The GOP’s current plan is to move swiftly on repeal legislation and then spend up to four years developing a consensus on a new set of health care reforms ― an achievement that has otherwise eluded the party for years. But Republicans are already split over how long they’ll spend creating that replacement. Party leaders expect it to take years, but some conservatives are pushing for a replacement to be finished within one year. Based on the White House’s description of Obama’s planned visit to Capitol Hill, it seems the outgoing president aims to give his beleaguered party a pep talk and to remind them why they paid such a high political price over the past six-plus years. The Affordable Care Act attempted to fill the biggest hole in the social safety net and succeeded in driving down the uninsured rate to the lowest level ever recorded.Whatever Obama might have to tell them, congressional Democrats already have laid out their strategy for the Obamacare repeal vote: highlight the human cost of ripping away health coverage from as many as 30 million people, and point to the GOP’s longstanding inability to agree on what they really want to accomplish instead.Their best hope is that Senate Democrats can use their sizable minority to obstruct GOP health proposals over the next few years and to exert pressure on Republican senators who, looking to their own re-election chances, have concerns about the disruption that would be caused by repealing most of Obamacare without a “replacement” for three to four years.Democrats can also highlight fresh evidence that the Affordable Care Act is emerging from its initial troubled period and that the health insurance exchanges, where individuals and families shop for coverage and apply for financial assistance, may be improving.Enrollment during the current period, which ends Jan. 31, appears to be outpacing last year’s, the Obama administration announced this month. And after losses had led insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, to scale back their participation in the exchanges, the financial ratings company Standard & Poor’s recently reported that the financial picture for insurers on the exchanges is getting better."
4,POLITICS,Obama Closes Presidency With Far Fewer Deportations Than When He Started,Roque Planas and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-deportations-2016_us_58668157e4b0eb5864890a03,"ICE said deportations dropped when they focused on criminals, casting doubt on Trump's promise to expel millions of immigrants.",2016-12-30,"President Barack Obama was once coined the ""deporter-in-chief.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586681a41500002300916824.jpeg?cache=JcSJGScqH6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Barack Obama is closing out his time in office with dramatically lower deportation numbers from the interior of the country than when he began. Deportations from the interior of the United States continued to drop in 2016, dwindling to roughly a quarter of their 2009 peak, according to numbers released Friday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The government conducted about 65,300 removals from inside the country in the 2016 fiscal year compared to 237,900 in the 2009 fiscal year. Total ICE deportations for the year, which include people caught in the border area trying to cross illegally into the U.S., stayed flat, 240,255 ― an increase of less than 5,000 over the year before, and well below recent peaks of around 400,000. In the end, Immigration and Customs Enforcement carried out more than 2.7 million deportations from the 2009 to 2016 fiscal years ― those included in Obama’s presidency ― more than half of them coming from the border region.The declining numbers of people expelled from within the United States marks a continuing shift for Obama, who was widely derided by reformers for most of his presidency as the “deporter-in-chief.”Those numbers might not last, if President-elect Donald Trump moves forward with a promise to drastically increase the rate of deportation: He insists he can and will quickly find and deport two or three million broadly-defined “criminals.” Finding that many criminal migrants will likely be difficult. The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute estimates that there are about 820,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal records residing in the United States. That figure includes offenses as petty as traffic tickets. DHS officials themselves say the falling interior deportation numbers reflect the Obama administration’s policy of focusing their efforts on removing people with criminal histories. Virtually all of the people deported from within the interior of the United States ― 92 percent ― had been convicted of a crime that put them within one of ICE’s top three priorities for removal. But ICE’s top priority removal category includes people convicted of the offenses of illegal entry and reentry ― non-violent crimes that don’t distinguish them much from other undocumented immigrants. DHS officials did not immediately provide a breakdown of the criminal offenses deportees had been convicted of. The number of deportations has also dropped in recent years partly because the number of people trying to enter the country has plummeted. Border Patrol apprehended about 408,900 people in the 2016 fiscal year, which is generally considered an indicator of how many people attempted to enter without authorization. In 2000, agents picked up nearly 1.7 million people trying to cross the border illegally. A growing share of those who do cross illegally into the United States are Central Americans, who often seek asylum or other humanitarian relief. Their cases can take years to wind their way through backlogged immigration courts and do not result in swift deportations. In 2016, border agents apprehended more Central Americans than they did Mexicans, a switch that happened for the first time in 2014. There was some good news for Trump: Local jurisdictions that have resisted working with ICE are doing so more than they were several years ago, according to DHS officials. Any massive increase in deportations would likely require cooperation from local police, and Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding to force them to comply. Many of the counties that previously refused to help ICE have already “come back to the table,” including 21 of the 25 jurisdictions that declined the largest number of requests to hold suspected deportable immigrants, a DHS official said. The official called it “one of our most significant accomplishments this year.” "
5,HEALTHY LIVING,U.S. Melanoma Rates Keep Rising,"Lisa Rapaport, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-melanoma-rates-keep-rising_us_586686eae4b0de3a08f81047,One in 54 Americans will develop invasive melanoma – the rarest and deadliest type of skin cancer – in their lifetime.,2016-12-30,"Diagnosed melanoma cases and related deaths have been climbing for two decades, according to a recent study.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586687b91500002300916830.jpeg?cache=7ivMvZUAls&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters Health) - - The number of diagnosed melanoma cases and related deaths in the U.S. has been steadily climbing for at least two decades despite widespread prevention efforts, a recent study suggests.Researchers now estimate that one in 54 Americans will develop invasive melanoma – the rarest and deadliest type of skin cancer – in their lifetime. That’s up from a 2009 estimate of one in 58.“Physicians have improved their ability to identify melanomas in the past 30 years . . . but this alone likely does not explain the increased number of melanomas,” said study coauthor Dr. Alex Glazer, a physician based in New York City who is affiliated with the National Society for Cutaneous Medicine.“Despite public health measures and warnings people still get a high level of UV exposure from the sun and tanning beds which is likely contributing to the increased incidence,” Glazer added by email.The steady rise in melanoma diagnoses and deaths in the U.S. over the past few decades mirrors trends seen worldwide, researchers note in JAMA Dermatology.For the current study, Glazer, along with coauthor Dr. Aaron Farberg of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and their colleagues, examined melanoma trends in the U.S. since 2009, when they last reported on incidence and mortality rates.During the study period, melanoma incidence rates for every 100,000 people climbed from 22.2 to 23.6, or a compound annual increase of about 1 percent.Diagnosis rates for early-stage tumors confined to the outer layers of the skin, known as in situ melanoma, rose more rapidly, with annual increases of about 3 percent a year.At the same time, after accounting for population shifts, the annual number of deaths from melanoma rose 1.5 percent a year, the researchers estimate.Because diagnosis rates aren’t rising as quickly as fatalities, it’s possible the study findings don’t reflect recent efforts aimed at earlier detection and treatment of these tumors, the authors note.“The incidences of melanoma in situ (the earliest form of melanoma) and thin invasive tumors are increasing at a faster rate than that of thicker tumors, and the five-year survival rates are also improving, which is likely due to more melanomas being diagnosed at earlier stages,” said Dr. Elizabeth Martin, of Pure Dermatology and Aesthetics and the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine.“Early detection is the key to curing melanoma,” Martin, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.Minimizing exposure to UV rays from the sun and tanning beds can largely prevent melanoma, and fatalities can often be averted with regular skin checks at the dermatologist, Farberg told Reuters Health.“Adopting sun-protective behavior is still a work-in-progress, and the prior generations were already exposed to high levels of sun UV radiation throughout their lives,” Farberg said by email. “Indoor tanning has also led to an increase in exposure in some subsets of the population.”Because older Americans may have grown up without an emphasis on sun protection and melanoma prevention, it may take time for habits adopted by younger people to influence diagnosis or death rates, said Dr. David Leffell of Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.“I think sun exposure earlier in life in the baby boomer population is coming home to roost,” Leffell, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.SOURCE: bit.ly/2hdZ3Eb JAMA Dermatology, online December 21, 2016."
6,POLITICS,The Republican New Year’s Resolution: Destroy Medicare,"Nancy Altman, ContributorPresident, Social Security Works",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-republican-new-years-resolution-destroy-medicare_us_58658577e4b014e7c72ee032,Republicans hide their true intentions behind euphemisms about “saving” it. The truth is that Medicare doesn’t need saving.,2016-12-30,<p>Senator Bernie Sanders speaks at a recent “Hands Off Medicare” rally on Capitol Hill</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5865872c1500002d00916671.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New Year’s is a time for resolutions. Consistent with this tradition, powerful Republicans have made clear that they are resolving, in the New Year, to dismantle Medicare, ending it as we know it.Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has said that destroying Medicare is part of the Republican plan to repeal Obamacare, another Republican resolution for 2017. And Representative Tom Price, powerful chairman of the House Budget Committee, Ryan ally, and likely next Secretary of Health and Human Services, has explained that the Republicans will enact Medicare legislation in the first six to eight months of 2017, since it is probably too big a task to include it in the planned January repeal of Obamacare.These Republicans are people who carry through on their New Year’s resolutions. In discussing the goal of destroying Medicare in the New Year, Ryan explained, “With a unified Republican government, we can actually get things done.”These Republicans never say, straightforwardly, that their plan is the repeal and replacement of Medicare. Because of Medicare’s overwhelming popularity, Republicans hide their true intentions behind euphemisms about “saving” it. But no one should be fooled. Their idea of saving Medicare is to destroy it, just as, during the Vietnam war, a U.S. military officer explained, “It became necessary to destroy the town to save it.”The truth is that Medicare doesn’t need saving. There is no question that, as the wealthiest nation in the world at the wealthiest moment in our history, the United States can afford not just today’s Medicare, but a greatly expanded Medicare. In 1965, when Medicare was enacted, the nation’s Gross Domestic Product was, in real terms, a quarter of what it is today ($4.1 trillion in 1965 versus $16.7 trillion today.) Moreover, Medicare covers the most expensive part of the population – seniors and people with disabilities. Covering the rest of us is easier and cheaper.Indeed, other industrialized countries spend a small fraction of what the United States spends on health care with better outcomes, despite older populations. Japan, for example, has a much older population than we do, and theirs is aging more rapidly than ours. In 2010, seniors represented 23 percent of the Japanese population, but just 13 percent of the U.S. population. In 2050, American seniors will compose just under 21 percent of the population ― less than Japan’s percentage of seniors today! Yet, the United States today spends three times more per capita than Japan on health care. Despite the additional spending, our health outcomes are worse. Indeed, Japan’s average life expectancy is more than four years longer than that of Americans!The Republican plan to destroy Medicare will make American costs and health outcomes worse. Despite Medicare covering the most expensive part of the population, it is much more efficient than the rest of the American health care system. Japan and other industrialized countries have what amounts to Medicare for all. No other nation has the crazy patchwork system we have, which includes employer-sponsored private insurance, means-tested insurance, and individual private insurance, in addition to government-run Medicare.Ryan proposes to make the patchwork system even more of a hodgepodge, with less coverage and higher costs. He wants to end Medicare as we know it and, instead, simply give seniors and people with disabilities fixed cash stipends to fend for themselves, unprotected, on the private market. But before the enactment of Medicare, many seniors and people with disabilities couldn’t get health insurance at any price. And those that managed to find an insurance company willing to cover them paid much higher prices than other Americans.So why do the Republicans want to destroy Medicare and make our health care system less efficient and more expensive, with less coverage and poorer outcomes? Ideology, pure and simple. Republicans believe that the private sector is always superior to the government. But there are some things the government does better than the private sector. And Medicare is one of them.Insurance is most inexpensive when everyone is covered under the same plan as the result of mandatory coverage. Only the federal government has the power and the ability to cover everyone, spreading the risk and responsibility as broadly as possible. Indeed, we should be expanding Medicare, not destroying it.But, driven by ideology, Ryan and his fellow Republicans want to end Medicare as we know it. Ryan proposes to raise the initial age of eligibility for Medicare from its current age 65 to age 67, and to simply give everyone now under the age of 55 cash to buy insurance on their own, eliminating the efficiency of a single, large risk pool.While those now on Medicare may think that they will be spared, they are wrong. Republicans always say, about their efforts to end Social Security and Medicare, that those aged 55 and over will not be affected, because those politicians recognize that seniors are most concerned about the programs and they vote. This assurance, of course, is insulting, because it assumes seniors are only concerned about themselves and not their children and grandchildren.Moreover, the blatant assurance is not even true. Many Republican Social Security proposals cut current beneficiaries’ cost of living proposals. And, in the case of Medicare, the impact on current beneficiaries is likely to be even more substantial. If Ryan and his fellow Republicans have their way, Medicare will become increasingly expensive per enrollee, covering an aging and shrinking group, with high medical costs. As the group shrinks, they will have less and less political clout. Everyone not on traditional Medicare, will, by that time, be forced to fend for themselves with private insurance companies. It is extremely foreseeable that at some point, someone will propose treating this very old, small, and expensive population like everyone else. And then their Medicare will be gone, as well.If we want a health care system in this country that provides everyone with access to the best medical care possible at the lowest possible cost, the way to achieve that is not to end Medicare, but to expand it. That, indeed, was the idea of the program’s founders. They saw Medicare as simply a first step, to be followed soon after by expanding it to include all children, and then more and more of the population, until the United States had Medicare for All.We should follow that wise plan. As a next step, we should lower the initial age of Medicare eligibility, when people can first claim Social Security retirement benefits, from age 65 to 62. We certainly should not raise the age to 67 and then end the program as we know it, as the Republicans resolve to do. Unfortunately, they are now in control of all branches of government, and so have the political power to do what they want. To stop them, I urge everyone who is old or hopes to be old someday to make your own Medicare resolution for 2017. Tell your elected leaders: Hands off Medicare except to expand it. And ask your friends to join you. Mobilize and make your voices heard. Then, as a resolution for 2018, we can all resolve to elect leaders who listen to us and have the good sense to expand, not destroy, Medicare. "

The fourth and final article in a series about the National Museum of African American History and Culture.Fifteen years ago, when I worked on the design of a high-performance museum, the concept was considered so unusual that the media questioned the very idea. The US Green Building Council (USGBC) had only very recently introduced its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, so much of the public wasn’t familiar with the concept. Over the following decade, it became more and more popular in every building type, including museums. A watershed year was 2008. The Water + Life Museums in Hemet, CA, became the first LEED Platinum museum, quickly followed by the California Academy of Science, which has been called “the world’s greenest museum.” The same year, the Grand Rapids Art Museum became the first LEED-certified art museum. By 2016, International Museum Day could highlight ten LEED-certified museums in the US alone.Now the Smithsonian has completed its first LEED Gold project, the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC). (The Silver-rated National Museum of the American Indian [NMAI] was the first Smithsonian project to become a certified green building, although it wasn’t designed to this standard and didn’t achieve it until seven years after opening in 2004.) By many measures, the NMAAHC is easily the greenest museum in Washington.But the bar isn’t very high, unfortunately. Last year, the Smithsonian completed renovation of the Renwick Gallery, but it’s not clear from public records when or if LEED certification will be completed, although reportedly the building systems originally were designed to be very efficient. Earlier this year, the Smithsonian also reopened the historic Arts & Industries Building after a 12-year closure and an extensive renovation, but it didn’t pursue LEED, I’m told. The National Gallery also reopened the iconic East Building after a three-year refurbishment. No LEED. The Newseum opened in 2008. No LEED. Washington is said to be “in a class of its own when it comes to high quality museums,” but an article last year highlighting “must-see green museums” around the world included none in DC. What’s the problem?At the time it opened, the Newseum’s director told the press that it didn’t get LEED certification “for reasons of cost.” This is a common misperception. In a 2008 survey of over 700 construction professionals, 80% cited “higher first costs” as the biggest obstacle to green building. Yet, even a dozen years ago the average surcharge for LEED projects was only 2%, and the additional investment typically yielded operational savings worth ten times that much, according to a widely cited report back then. By 2007, studies showed that LEED need not cost more at all, and now green building actually can cost less than conventional construction. The LEED-Platinum 1225 Connecticut Avenue, here in DC, cost about 5% below market rate construction in 2009 and sold for the highest price per square foot ever paid for an office building in the city.Regardless, the fact that so few museums in DC are exemplars of sustainability makes the NMAAHC all the more remarkable. Its systems include “low-impact” materials, a nearly 100-kW solar array to produce energy on site, and efficient infrastructure connected to surrounding buildings to avoid redundancy. But the most impressive aspects of the building are how the basic design gestures conserve resources and enhance the visitor experience. The bronze-color metal tracery enveloping the façade is carefully calibrated to avoid undue heat gain while bathing the interior in soft light and allowing views in every direction. This lowers energy needs while improving occupant comfort (although the decision not to extend the screening to the ground floor results in occasionally heavy glare and uncomfortable temperatures when the sun is low, as I experienced one morning this winter). The latticework has another appeal that has been overlooked by reviewers and possibly by the designers themselves. As I documented in my book, The Shape of Green: Aesthetics, Ecology, and Design (2012), research shows that people generally crave the image of irregular tree-like patterns mimicking natural fractals—so much so that the pattern can lower stress by as much as 60 percent, just by being in our field of vision. The Japanese practice of forest bathing (Shinrin-yoku)—spending time immersed in wooded settings—can lower blood pressure, heart rate, and concentrations of stress hormones. Could the interior of the NMAAHC, like an artificial forest, have a similar effect?This research relates to the biophilia hypothesis, which suggests that people have an innate desire to connect with nature and other forms of life. An associated idea is the theory of “prospect/refuge,” which suggests that we seek out places that help us feel sheltered while allowing an uninterrupted view of our surroundings. A veranda or porch is a commonplace example. The main entrance to the NMAAHC is designed to act as a gigantic porch, inspired by traditions in African and African American vernacular building, as I pointed out in an earlier article. The prospect/refuge effect of this space is about as palpable as any I’ve ever witnessed. Additionally, the deep shade combined with a reflecting pool creates a cool microclimate intended to provide more comfort during the hot, humid summer months. Washington has been called the “epicenter of green building,”and with the NMAAHC the city has significantly raised the bar for museums here and everywhere. @LanceHosey"

The fourth and final article in a series about the National Museum of African American History and Culture.Fifteen years ago, when I worked on the design of a high-performance museum, the concept was considered so unusual that the media questioned the very idea. The US Green Building Council (USGBC) had only very recently introduced its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, so much of the public wasn’t familiar with the concept. Over the following decade, it became more and more popular in every building type, including museums. A watershed year was 2008. The Water + Life Museums in Hemet, CA, became the first LEED Platinum museum, quickly followed by the California Academy of Science, which has been called “the world’s greenest museum.” The same year, the Grand Rapids Art Museum became the first LEED-certified art museum. By 2016, International Museum Day could highlight ten LEED-certified museums in the US alone.Now the Smithsonian has completed its first LEED Gold project, the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC). (The Silver-rated National Museum of the American Indian [NMAI] was the first Smithsonian project to become a certified green building, although it wasn’t designed to this standard and didn’t achieve it until seven years after opening in 2004.) By many measures, the NMAAHC is easily the greenest museum in Washington.But the bar isn’t very high, unfortunately. Last year, the Smithsonian completed renovation of the Renwick Gallery, but it’s not clear from public records when or if LEED certification will be completed, although reportedly the building systems originally were designed to be very efficient. Earlier this year, the Smithsonian also reopened the historic Arts & Industries Building after a 12-year closure and an extensive renovation, but it didn’t pursue LEED, I’m told.

9,RELIGION,Why I Respectfully Disagree With The Mormon Tabernacle Choir’s Decision To Perform At Donald Trump’s Inauguration,"Dr. Benjamin Knoll, Ph.D., ContributorJohn Marshall Harlan Associate Professor of Politics, Centre C...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-i-respectfully-disagree-with-the-mormon-tabernacle_us_58667256e4b04d7df167d41e,"The Mormon Tabernacle Choir has accepted an invitation to sing at President-elect Trump’s inauguration, immediately generating",2016-12-30,"The Mormon Tabernacle Choir sings at the first session of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' 185th Annual General Conference in Salt Lake City, Utah April 4, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5866b62d1500002f00e9dbd3.jpeg?ops=crop_0_419_5033_2454%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The Mormon Tabernacle Choir has accepted an invitation to sing at President-elect Trump’s inauguration, immediately generating a degree of controversy and prompting the circulation of an online petition opposing the choir’s upcoming performance which (as of the time of writing) has more than 20,000 signatures.The petition argues that Donald Trump “DOES NOT reflect the values of Mormonism and does not represent its diverse 15+ million members worldwide.” It further states that the performance will send a signal, whether intended or not, “that the LDS Church and its diverse 15+ million members worldwide support an incoming president’s agenda, values and behaviors.” As someone who is proud of my Mormon heritage and who has publicly spoken out against Mr. Trump’s agenda, values, and behaviors, this question is an important one to me.A strong defense of the choir’s decision to accept the invitation to sing at Trump’s inauguration comes from Daniel Peterson who argues that to decline the invitation would be an explicitly political action which would be inappropriate for a politically-neutral religious institution to engage in.Perhaps the strongest defense I have seen comes from the LDS Church itself: “The choir’s participation continues its long tradition of performing for U.S. presidents of both parties at inaugurations and in other settings, and is not an implied support of party affiliations or politics. It is a demonstration of our support for freedom, civility and the peaceful transition of power.” In my view, this is a defensible and honorable motivation. Freedom, civility, and democratic norms are all things that deserve to be supported and celebrated.That being said, I also think there are important and defensible arguments against the choir’s decision.Regardless of the specific motivations of the choir to accept the invitation, it will almost certainly be interpreted by most viewers (both at home and abroad) as an endorsement of the president-elect and his values and priorities. The LDS Church has emphasized on several occasions that the choir is an official representative of the church. Given that role, it is notable that a singer recently resigned from the choir given that she could not, in good conscience, be part of an organization that chose to publicly associate with Mr. Trump and his values and priorities. Also, a high-ranking elder of the LDS Church once explained that dealing with something “in a public situation” constitutes an implied approval.Democrats and Republicans alike have acknowledged that Mr. Trump’s behavior during the campaign and since his election has been characterized by explicit appeals to racial prejudice, religious prejudice, and misogyny. He has unapologetically bragged about multiple incidents of sexual assault. He has called for a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States (something that should especially be unacceptable to Mormons who themselves were on the receiving end of such policies not too long ago). His rhetoric is strongly signaling that he would like to weaken traditional American democratic norms, freedoms, and institutions.Even though the motivation of the choir to perform at Mr. Trump’s inauguration is in my view an honorable one, the result will unavoidably be a strengthened association between the LDS Church and Mr. Trump’s shameful and disgraceful behaviors, values, and anti-democratic priorities in the eyes of both the United States and the world community.In sum, there are two important and defensible moral imperatives at play: 1) publicly standing for political neutrality and the celebration of democratic institutions, and 2) publicly standing against racism, misogyny, sexual assault, and authoritarian gestures.Recognizing that sometimes tough choices need to be made between two good options, on this particular question I would confidently choose the latter. This is because in my framework of moral reasoning, I tend to give preference to groups and priorities that are on the disadvantaged end of a power relationship. In this case, standing with racial/ethnic minorities, Muslims, victims sexual assault and harassment, and oppressed citizens of authoritarian regimes around the world is of a higher moral imperative than publicly celebrating a peaceful transition of power, especially when that transition is to an individual who is actively threatening to do harm to those disadvantaged groups.It is also worth noting again that the stated motivation of the choir is to show support for democratic norms and institutions such as “freedom… and the peaceful transition of power.” Given that honorable motivation, one could argue that a decision to decline the invitation from someone who has publicly called for weakening American democratic norms of freedom and the peaceful transition of power would be a more effective way to demonstrate that support than to appear to be publicly endorsing an individual who is not supportive of those priorities.This is why I decided to sign the petition and I encourage you to consider doing so as well.Your mileage may differ. Of course, I do not think you are wrong if you disagree."
10,ENTERTAINMENT,A Convenient List Of Things 'La La Land' Isn't,"Austin S. Harris, ContributorAustin S. Harris is a writer, director, and performer.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-convenient-list-of-things-la-la-land-isnt_us_58666101e4b014e7c72ee0ab,"Whenever a film with an insurmountable amount of positive buzz is finally released, this inevitable phenomenon occurs where",2016-12-30,"<p>Due to copyright concerns, please enjoy this fair use photo of a location used in the film.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586674aa1900001a000e2353.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whenever a film with an insurmountable amount of positive buzz is finally released, this inevitable phenomenon occurs where people, especially film critics and students, suddenly turn on it. La La Land is certainly one of those films. Before its public release it received near-universal acclaim at several film festivals, won several awards, and was on many critics’ lists of the best films of the year, all before being released to us normal people. And now that it’s finally here, people are jumping at the chance to criticize it. Now, don’t get me wrong -- people are entitled to their opinions, and I do not think La La Land was perfect. That being said, I immensely enjoyed the movie. I left the theater feeling giddy, and I haven’t stopped thinking about it for weeks (not to mention I’ve seen it twice more since that first time). But that was just me, and for the sake of people looking for reasons not to like the film, I’ve compiled a list of things that La La Land isn’t. Perhaps I can even save you the time of going to the theater and being disappointed that La La Land isn’t one or all of the following:1. A Complex Character StudyLa La Land does not have complex characters. Most musicals don’t. If that’s something you were looking for in this film, you’re barking up the wrong tree. Mia is an aspiring actress who’s stubborn, Sebastian is an aspiring jazz musician who’s stubborn, they don’t like each other, and then they do. That’s about as deep as it gets. But what’s important is that the film wasn’t trying to go deeper than that. It’s not necessary. The film focuses on the aforementioned aspects of each character because at its simplest level this is a film about pursuing one’s dreams, and how the dreams of two different people collide and affect each other.2. Saying Something WeightyIt’s news to no one that this was a year full of political strife, and appropriately enough, several films have come out this year that touch on themes that were important to the American electorate this year, such as racism, classism, and xenophobia. If you came to La La Land in hopes of seeing some of that on screen, you came to the wrong film. The film does, however, have several messages that are worth discussing. It gives a more nuanced look at the well-trodden “I wish I was a star” trope, and discusses the difference between people’s romanticized image of an aspiring actress pursuing stardom and the tough, heartbreaking, humiliating reality. The film was never trying to say something about 2016 because it’s escapism, and if there was ever a year that people needed to escape from, it’s this one.3. A Shining Example of InclusivityThis is the only item on this list that I’m actually disappointed about. Chazelle took on the big task of updating the Hollywood musical for the 21st century, and unfortunately, he did not take this chance to fix the inclusivity problem that is prevalent in those old films (see Natalie Wood’s Puerto Rican accent in West Side Story). A lot of those films had one token person of color, and this film does the same thing. A friend of mine very correctly pointed out that none of the people of color in the film have emotional arcs. I will note that Chazelle seemed to have made it a point to include as many people of color in background and small roles as possible, and did much better at including black people in the jazz scenes than he did in his previous film, Whiplash, which is nice considering that black people invented it. That being said, I really really wish we could get to a point where people of color aren’t just the best friends or people that Ryan Gosling dances with momentarily on a dock at magic hour.4. DepressingIt’s so much easier to emotionally affect somebody with a depressing film than with an optimistic one. So many Oscar bait movies are essentially pity porn. Functional family? Nah. No one’s died in the past 20 minutes? Nah. Has there been an extreme wide of the beautiful actress who’s playing an ugly woman crying yet? Better edit that in. La La Land isn’t depressing. It’s not saccharine either, though. It’s got a bittersweet ending, and while it’s uplifting overall, it’s never 100% happy. But it’s certainly not a terse drama. And in my humble opinion, those weepy dramas are a dime a dozen. I can’t think of the last film I saw that was this optimistic and this good.5. A Typical Oscar-Bait MovieThere, I said it. I was kind of getting there with the last point, but here it is. Every year around this time, a ton of dramas come out that are all trying to win Oscars. And every year, a maximum of one of them wins Best Picture, and the majority of the rest of them fade into obscurity because when it comes down to it, they aren’t unique. You can’t watch La La Land and say it’s not original. You can tell that Damien Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz loved what they were creating, and most importantly, it is unlike anything I’ve seen in theaters in recent memory. Was it the best film of the year? I don’t know, honestly. How do you compare an escapist jaunt with an emotional, intense masterpiece like Moonlight? Is it enough that I wanted to see this film multiple times because it left me feeling happy and inspired, or should the best film be a movie that strips me to my core and makes me contemplate life? That’s where the whole concept of crowning one film “Best Picture” gets thorny. All I can say is that I enjoyed La La Land, and if you did, you shouldn’t feel any guilt for it. "

Trump will carry out,” said Putin.In a separate message of New Year congratulations to Trump, he said Russia-U.S. relations were an important factor for maintaining global safety and stability.The U.S. sanctions also closed two Russian compounds in New York and Maryland that the administration said were used by Russian personnel for “intelligence-related purposes”.However, a former Russian Foreign Ministry employee told Reuters that the facility in Maryland was a dacha used by diplomatic staff and their children.Lavrov also proposed banning U.S. diplomats from using a dacha in Moscow’s prestigious waterfront park area, Serebryany Bor.But Putin said Russia would not prohibit U.S. diplomats and their families from their usual vacation spots. “Moreover, I invite all children of American diplomats accredited in Russia to the New Year and Christmas party in the Kremlin,” he said.Obama, a Democrat, had promised consequences after U.S. intelligence officials blamed Russia for hacks intended to influence the 2016 election. Officials pointed the finger directly at Putin for personally directing the efforts and primarily targeting Democrats.Washington put sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies, the GRU and the FSB, four GRU officers and three companies that he said “provided material support to the GRU’s cyber operations”.“EMBITTERED LOSERS”Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was more outspoken in his criticism. “It is regrettable that the Obama administration, which started out by restoring our ties, is ending its term in an anti-Russia death throes. RIP,” he wrote on his official Facebook page.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the Obama administration “a group of embittered and dimwitted foreign policy losers”.Obama said Americans should be alarmed by Russia’s actions in the U.S. election.“These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests in violation of established international norms of behaviour,” he said in a statement from Hawaii, where he is on vacation.The sanctions were the strongest response yet by the his administration to Russian cyber activities. However, a senior administration official acknowledged that Trump could reverse them and allow Russian intelligence officials back into the United States once he takes office.Trump has brushed aside allegations from the CIA and other intelligence agencies that Russia was behind the cyber attacks. He said on Thursday he would meet with intelligence officials soon. “It’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,” Trump said in a statement.“Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation,” he said, without mentioning Russia.U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia was behind hacks into Democratic Party organizations and operatives before the Nov. 8 presidential election. U.S. intelligence officials say the Russian cyber attacks were aimed at helping Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told Fox News he did not condone foreign governments hacking U.S. institutions.“It’s wrong and it’s something we don’t agree with,” Priebus said. “However, it would be nice if we could get to a place where the intelligence community in unison can tell us what it is that has been going on and what the investigation was and what it has led to so that we can respond.”“PERSONA NON GRATA”Obama said the State Department declared as “persona non grata” 35 Russian intelligence operatives and was closing the two Russian compounds. The 45-acre complex in Maryland includes a Georgian-style brick mansion, swimming pool, tennis courts and cottages for embassy staff.A senior U.S. official told Reuters the expulsions would come from the Russian embassy in Washington and consulate in San Francisco.The Russians have 72 hours to leave the United States, the official said. Access to the two compounds will be denied to all Russian officials as of noon on Friday.The State Department has long complained that Russian security agents and traffic police have harassed U.S. diplomats in Moscow, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has raised the issue with Putin and Lavrov.The U.S. official declined to name the Russian diplomats who would be affected, although it is understood that Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, will not be one of those expelled.Obama said the actions announced on Thursday were just the beginning.“These actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia’s aggressive activities. We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized,” Obama said.A report detailing Russia’s interference in the 2016 election as well as cyber attacks in previous election cycles would be delivered to Congress in the coming days, he added.(Additional reporting by Dustin Volz, Yeganeh Torbati, Eric Beech and Nikolai Pavlov in Washington and Katya Golubkova and Svetlana Reiter in Moscow; Writing by Anna Willard; Editing by David Stamp)"

Jeff Sessions used to chide presidential nominees for giving the Senate Judiciary Committee incomplete records on their backgrounds.

He left out major details from his years as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, from 1981 to 1993; as attorney general of Alabama, from 1995 to 1997; and as a first-term U.S. senator, from 1997 to 2002. The gaps encompass the time, for example, when Sessions was nominated to be a federal judge in 1986 ― and then rejected after being deemed too racist. He also omitted dozens of recent interviews, some of which included controversial statements he made. An October interview in which Sessions gave Trump a pass for making sexist comments, because “everybody knows that Trump likes women” and “uses this kind of talk,” was not cited in his questionnaire. A December 2015 interview in which Sessions says “the predictions aren’t coming true” about climate change having disastrous effects is also not mentioned.A Trump transition team spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did a Senate spokesman for Sessions.Ironically, Sessions, who is currently a U.S. senator from Alabama and a member of the Judiciary Committee, has chided previous nominees for failing to provide the committee with a full account of their backgrounds.“I want to share a concern that I do have about Judge Sotomayor’s answers to the Senate Judiciary standard questionnaire,” Sessions said in a June 2009 hearing on then-Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor. “It is still incomplete. I know the administration was very proud to dump a lot of records out in what they call ‘record time,’ but here, two weeks later, we still have some serious gaps in those answers to the committee questions.”In April 2010, Sessions spearheaded a letter to then-committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) torching one of President Barack Obama’s judicial nominees, Goodwin Liu, for not citing certain articles and events in his questionnaire.“At best, this nominee’s extraordinary disregard for the Committee’s constitutional role demonstrates incompetence; at worst, it creates the impression that he knowingly attempted to hide his most controversial work from the Committee,” reads the letter signed by Sessions and other Republicans. “Professor Liu’s unwillingness to take seriously his obligation to complete these basic forms is potentially disqualifying and has placed his nomination in jeopardy.”A couple days later, Sessions warned that Liu might be breaking the law by leaving information out of his questionnaire.“As a prosecutor, Title 18, Section 1001 makes it a criminal offense to make a false statement to the government. Two years in jail. A felony,” Sessions said in an April 15, 2010 committee hearing. “This is a certification that these nominees make that it is true and corrected and witnessed by a notary public. A judge who finds that a nominee or someone coming before him left out 117, or now 130 or 140 documents, would consider contemplated [sic], I think.”Democrats say the gaps in Sessions’ record mean Republicans should delay his hearing to give him more time to produce documents.“Sen. Sessions’ nomination package is still nowhere near ready for prime time, and it’s hypocritical that he so frequently slammed past nominees for submitting incomplete documents only to do the same thing himself,” said Nan Aron of Alliance for Justice. “So why not just slow down, give everyone the time they need to find everything and review everything, and not rush this really critical nomination through without allowing for due diligence.”That’s not going to happen, though. Senators in both parties regularly call for delays in hearings for nominees put forward by a president of the opposing party, and their calls go nowhere. It’s one of the only things Democrats, being the minority party, can try to do to slow down confirmation of a nominee they don’t support.That doesn’t mean Sessions won’t have to answer for holes in his record during his confirmation hearing, which is scheduled for Jan. 10. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the new ranking Democrat on the committee for the coming Congress, has already indicated she’s not happy about his “incomplete” responses to the committee’s questionnaire."

He also omitted dozens of recent interviews, some of which included controversial statements he made. An October interview in which Sessions gave Trump a pass for making sexist comments, because “everybody knows that Trump likes women” and “uses this kind of talk,” was not cited in his questionnaire. A December 2015 interview in which Sessions says “the predictions aren’t coming true” about climate change having disastrous effects is also not mentioned.A Trump transition team spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did a Senate spokesman for Sessions.Ironically, Sessions, who is currently a U.S. senator from Alabama and a member of the Judiciary Committee, has chided previous nominees for failing to provide the committee with a full account of their backgrounds.“I want to share a concern that I do have about Judge Sotomayor’s answers to the Senate Judiciary standard questionnaire,” Sessions said in a June 2009 hearing on then-Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor. “It is still incomplete. I know the administration was very proud to dump a lot of records out in what they call ‘record time,’ but here, two weeks later, we still have some serious gaps in those answers to the committee questions.”In April 2010, Sessions spearheaded a letter to then-committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) torching one of President Barack Obama’s judicial nominees, Goodwin Liu, for not citing certain articles and events in his questionnaire.“At best, this nominee’s extraordinary disregard for the Committee’s constitutional role demonstrates incompetence; at worst, it creates the impression that he knowingly attempted to hide his most controversial work from the Committee,” reads the letter signed by Sessions and other Republicans. “Professor Liu’s unwillingness to take seriously his obligation to complete these basic forms is potentially disqualifying and has placed his nomination in jeopardy.”A couple days later, Sessions warned that Liu might be breaking the law by leaving information out of his questionnaire.“As a prosecutor, Title 18, Section 1001 makes it a criminal offense to make a false statement to the government. Two years in jail. A felony,” Sessions said in an April 15, 2010 committee hearing. “This is a certification that these nominees make that it is true and corrected and witnessed by a notary public. A judge who finds that a nominee or someone coming before him left out 117, or now 130 or 140 documents, would consider contemplated [sic], I think.”Democrats say the gaps in Sessions’ record mean Republicans should delay his hearing to give him more time to produce documents.“Sen. Sessions’ nomination package is still nowhere near ready for prime time, and it’s hypocritical that he so frequently slammed past nominees for submitting incomplete documents only to do the same thing himself,” said Nan Aron of Alliance for Justice. “So why not just slow down, give everyone the time they need to find everything and review everything, and not rush this really critical nomination through without allowing for due diligence.”That’s not going to happen, though. Senators in both parties regularly call for delays in hearings for nominees put forward by a president of the opposing party, and their calls go nowhere. It’s one of the only things Democrats, being the minority party, can try to do to slow down confirmation of a nominee they don’t support.That doesn’t mean Sessions won’t have to answer for holes in his record during his confirmation hearing, which is scheduled for Jan. 10. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the new ranking Democrat on the committee for the coming Congress, has already indicated she’s not happy about his “incomplete” responses to the committee’s questionnaire."
14,POLITICS,Leaked Snowden Document Hints At Why Feds Are So Sure Russia Hacked Election,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/edward-snowden-leak-russian-election-hacking_us_5865cec6e4b0eb586488e782,NSA apparently learned successful tactics tracking Russian cyberattack on murdered journalist Anna Politkovskaya.,2016-12-30,Edward Snowden speaks via a video link during a news conference in New York in September 2016.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5865ebc71900002a000e227e.jpeg?ops=crop_296_89_3775_3081%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. intelligence officials appear certain that Russia was responsible for interfering in the presidential election — though they haven’t fully detailed how they know. But a classified document leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden reveals that they’ve tracked Russian hacking before and that the information they gleaned may have helped this time around.Russian hacking also occurred in the case of Russian journalist and American citizen Anna Politkovskaya, who was gunned down in 2006 in her Moscow apartment after writing articles critical of the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Five men were convicted of her murder, but it’s still a mystery who ordered the killing.A year before she was murdered, Politkovskaya’s email was hacked by Russian intelligence using malicious software not publicly available, according to an NSA document leaked by Snowden and published for the first time by The Intercept. Not only does the document reveal that U.S. intelligence knew about the hacking of Politkovskaya’s email, it also shows that the agency is adept at tracking cyberattacks by Russian intelligence.The classified internal NSA entry indicates that the NSA was able to use “intercept signals” to pinpoint the source of the attack. The attacks on Politkovskaya’s email account resemble the hacks of Democratic National Committee emails during the campaign that were damaging to Hillary Clinton, and the NSA could have used the same tactics to track the source as it did in Politkovskaya’s case. Snowden tweeted earlier this year that NSA has the capability to track the source of such a hack. He cited Xkeyscore, a pre-Snowden secret computer system used by the NSA for searching and analyzing global internet data, that “makes following exfiltrated data easy. I did this personally against Chinese ops.”U.S. intelligence certainty about the hacks and the credibility of its analysis will be critical in the coming weeks as President-elect Donald Trump seeks to downplay any Russian interference in the U.S. presidential campaign. He has cast doubt on the intelligence community’s statement before the election that Russia was responsible for hacking and releasing the DNC communications. Officials have since said that they believe the attacks were ordered by Putin in a deliberate effort to sway the vote for Trump, who has frequently praised the Russian leader.Trump said Wednesday that it was time to “move on” and that it was impossible to know who was responsible for the leaks. On Thursday, Trump said he would meet with intelligence officials next week to discuss the issue but said again that “it’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.”President Barack Obama has struck back at Russia with a series of sanctions for the hacking and has called for Congress to be presented with intelligence reports on the cyberattacks.The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI on Thursday released a 13-page joint report providing some details of what the agencies know about the Russian attack.

But after over 30 years in the business, the 62-year-old actor said that darker-skinned actors and actresses who call out colorism in the industry are simply looking to “blame someone else” for their failure. In an interview with BET published last week, Washington was asked whether colorism has negatively affected the careers of dark-skinned actors and actresses in Hollywood. His response was disappointing, to say the least. Referring to Viola Davis’s performance in his new film, “Fences,” Washington said:“One of the best roles for a woman of any color in the last, in a good good while or at least any movie that I’ve been in, a dark-skinned woman has in this film.”The actor added that it isn’t skin color, but acting ability, that hinders darker actors from achieving success.“The easiest thing to do is to blame someone else, the system,” Washington told BET. “Yeah, there’s a possibility, maybe, that you’re not good enough, but it’s easy to say it’s someone else’s fault. But there’s a possibility that you’re not ready and you can still blame it on someone else instead of getting ready.”Washington’s comments are unfortunate, given the fact that his “Fences” co-star Viola Davis has spoken out extensively about how colorism has affected her career. In 2015, she told The Wrap that “the paper-bag test is still very much alive and kicking” in Hollywood. “And in the history of television and even in film, I’ve never seen a character like Annalise Keating played by someone who looks like me,” Davis added.“I encourage you to search your memory and think of anyone who’s done this. It just hasn’t happened. I hear these stories from friends of mine who are dark-skin actresses who are always being seen as crack addicts and prostitutes.”While Washington seems to suggest that Davis’s talent helped her transcend colorism in Hollywood, the fact that Davis only got to play a complex, sexual-leading woman (as Annalise Keating in “How to Get Away With Murder”) after 20 years on screen suggests that we still have a long way to go. What’s most baffling about Washington’s statement, is the fact that in 2012, he himself spoke candidly about telling his own daughter that she will face discrimination in Hollywood because she is dark. “You’re black, you’re a woman, and you’re dark-skinned at that. So you have to be a triple/quadruple threat…You gotta learn how to act,” Washington said. So, Washington can concede that being a dark-skinned woman in Hollywood can hinder success, but he can’t concede that the whole “you have to work twice as hard as a white person” rule is unfair? Disappointing. "

Herbst, Contributorcivil rights lawyer and contributing opinion writier",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-kerry-speech-illustrates-our-political-dysfunction_us_58668306e4b014e7c72ee0cf,"In his UN Security Council speech earlier this week, Secretary of State John Kerry finally delivered some hard truths which",2016-12-30,"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry concludes his remarks on Middle East peace at the Department of State in Washington December 28, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5866af901500002f00e9dbb9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In his UN Security Council speech earlier this week, Secretary of State John Kerry finally delivered some hard truths which the Obama administration was too afraid to share with Americans and Israelis until its last month in office. It was a remarkable admission that the president and secretary of State, operating in our current miserable political environment, could not tell us what they really thought about Israel-Palestine – for all the years they have been in office.As Secretary Kerry said on Wednesday, nothing in his speech was new. All of it was readily apparent and known to Obama in 2009 and to Kerry when he was in the Senate and when he became Secretary of State in 2013. The belated candor Wednesday, while welcome for its substance, should be a wakeup call for the American people. If we don’t change our dysfunctional political and electoral system so that it is no longer impossible for well-intentioned leaders to level with the American people, we will not be a democracy worthy of the name. That means getting the big money out of politics. It means adopting a new paradigm of elections and campaign finance. It means no longer kowtowing to the billionaire class of donors like Haim Saban on the left and Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers on the right. It means public financing of campaigns, and millions of “little guys” giving $25 or $50 or $100 of their hard-earned wages to the candidates of their choice. We need to empower our president to tell us the hard truths throughout his time in office, so we as citizens can knowledgeably empower him or her (and the Congress) to make correct decisions on the most important and controversial of our foreign and domestic affairs.Albeit late, we can be thankful that Kerry, with Obama’s blessing, finally did give us the benefit of his experience on a conflict which must be resolved in order for both Israel and the Palestinians and the wider Arab world to stabilize and advance, and for us to finally begin to unburden ourselves of the obligations we have to clean up the mess we have made of much of the Middle East. The crux of the lesson he imparted, borne of four years of intensive labor there, is that peace can only come when “the core needs of both sides” are satisfied — when both sides are willing to satisfy the essential needs of the other.While Kerry cast his speech as though the two-state solution (“2SS”) was still breathing, the facts on the ground to which he referred actually demonstrate that the 2SS is long past saving. There is simply no way to create a contiguous viable Palestinian state in the West Bank and East Jerusalem containing almost 600,000 Jewish settlers, located in places designed precisely to prevent the establishment of such a state. Between the settlements, the outposts, and the ribbon of highways and walls, the West Bank has effectively been carved up into cantons. It would take a civil war to uproot hundreds of thousands of settlers who do not want to move, dead set on creating a Greater Israel ― Jewish dominion over all the land of Israel-Palestine. They have their own legal, administrative, political and economic infrastructure, which is not going away. And frankly, even if it were possible, there is now little support for it in Israel. The Israeli government is certainly not for it, and there is no longer a large Israeli peace movement pushing for it. If Israel did not seriously pursue the Saudi Peace Initiative, endorsed by the Arab League in 2002 and again in 2007, when it was promised full normalization and peaceful relations with every Arab and Moslem country in the region if Israel withdrew from the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Israel is not going to be persuaded to do so now without enormous outside pressure by the entire world. So if, as Kerry said, the Quartet and the UN agree with the Palestinians that any Palestinian state must be contiguous and viable and that the 1967 lines with only slight changes must be the basis of any 2SS, but Israel will not agree to return to those lines, there can and will be no 2SS.Kerry therefore told us some hard truths but not the whole truth, which is that Israel’s strategy to prevent the establishment of a contiguous Palestinian state in which Palestinians could live in freedom and dignity, free of Israeli domination, has succeeded. There is not going to be a 2SS solution. But the fundamentalist idea of a Greater Israel, privileging Jews and subjugating Palestinians, is ultimately untenable, as Kerry said. The Palestinians will never accept it, and they will continue to resist. The Arab world will not accept it, and never grant Israel peace and stability for as long as it pursues that dream. The entire world, other than the United States, will continue to reject it, and despite the election of Donald Trump, for whatever period his misbegotten Administration lasts, the American people, both Jews and Christians, will ultimately not accept it because it is inconsistent with our democratic values, and frankly with Judeo-Christian moral and religious values. Ultimately, American support will wither for this kind of Jewish state. And when American protection ends, Israel will suffer the isolation and sanction of the entire world, as South Africa did before it. This was Kerry’s explicit warning and core message.So where does this leave Jews and Palestinians? What are the alternatives to Greater Israel or two states living side by side in peace and security? Can we devise an alternative vision for the core needs of the two peoples? Is there an alternative political arrangement that meets the fundamental need for Israeli Jews to live in a peaceful and secure Jewish homeland in the heart of the Arab and Moslem world, where their political and religious rights are guaranteed in perpetuity? Can that same political arrangement meet the fundamental need of Palestinians to live in freedom, dignity and security, in the same state which is also their national homeland?With these questions in mind, if you look again at Secretary Kerry’s speech, shorn of its 2SS aspects, focusing on the fundamental principles he outlined for the achievement of peace and security between the two peoples, there are some reasons to think that the answer could be yes. He said there must be firm, full and equal rights for both peoples, no matter where they live in the two states. He acknowledged that 1.7 million Palestinians live in Israel and must be free and equal, with both sides upholding full equal rights for all their respective citizens. This fundamental principle is not only every bit as consistent with one binational state as with two separate states, but it is probably easier to achieve in one state with a single national constitutional framework.Kerry then said Jerusalem must be the international capital of both states, with all religions approving, and all religious sites protected. He also said that the basic national aspirations of both peoples to have Jerusalem as its capital should be vindicated without dividing the City. Accomplishing this second fundamental principle would be much easier in one state.Kerry next said there must be a full solution to the Palestinian refugee problem. He emphasized compensation, and an acknowledgment of Palestinian suffering. He mentioned the Nakba, the 1948 exodus or expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians from their homes and villages — perhaps the first time a senior American diplomat has given public voice and recognition to that catastrophe — but he surely was thinking also of their suffering under military occupation. This truth and reconciliation work would have to begin at the start of serious negotiations about any solution, but is likely better completed in the context of one state rather than two. He said that there must be options and assistance finding permanent homes, with the world providing support, financial and otherwise. He did not mention the right of return, but some right of return, enshrined in an early UN Security Council resolution, has been the subject of discussion for decades now. Were there one state rather than two, with constitutional and international guarantees protecting the national and religious rights of both peoples in perpetuity, it would be easier to resolve the thorny issue of the return of those Jews and Palestinians in the diaspora who might want to do so. With both peoples constitutionally protected living together in one state, there might be fewer concerns about altering its “fundamental character,” depending upon the political structure selected for the binational state.Kerry noted that any Palestinian state must not have a military, and there must be full satisfaction of Israel’s security needs. How that would be accomplished in two states, he did not say. But if the Palestinians are ultimately amenable to such a defenseless state, they may also be amenable to vindicating and guaranteeing their national, political and religious rights in one state, in which the top military leaders are Jewish.Two other important factors were alluded to in the speech. First, Palestinian leadership and governance is widely acknowledged to be inefficient, divided and corrupt. It is not at all clear that the Palestinian people would be better served by such leadership rather than, say, the leaders of the Joint List, the Israeli Arab party in the Knesset. Second, Kerry made clear that the Middle East is rapidly changing, that Egypt and Jordan are willing to coordinate on security issues with Israel, that Israel is covertly and even openly cooperating with key Arab states like Saudi Arabia, and that the time is ripe for Israel to achieve its life-long dream of peaceful and normal relations with that world if only there were genuine interest in normalizing its relations with the Palestinians as well. If the 2SS is dead, this can and must be done in one binational state, and the conversation about a feasible vision of such a state which meets the core needs of both peoples must now begin."

Krenwinkel, who has been in a California prison longer than any other female in state history, admitted at her trial that she repeatedly stabbed coffee company heiress Abigail Ann Folger, 26, at Tate’s home and helped kill grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, the next night. Authorities said she wrote in blood “healter skelter” (sic) on the couple’s refrigerator and “Death to pigs” on the wall, and helped carve the word “war” into Leno LaBianca’s abdomen.Krenwinkel met cult leader Charles Manson at a party when she was 19 years old and said she became a “monster” after she moved in with him and other female followers.“I committed myself fully to him. I committed myself to the act of murder,” she said at one of her earlier parole hearings. “I was willing to sacrifice others’ lives for my own.”Manson has said he planned the shocking murders to ignite a race war during which he and his followers would emerge to rule the world.Krenwinkel has been a model prisoner, according to prison records. She has a clean disciplinary record and earned a bachelor’s degree behind bars. She has trained service dogs for disable people and helped teach fellow inmates to read. Debra Tate called Krenwinkel a “very prolific killer” at a previous parole hearing, adding: “They may behave well in a controlled environment, but we cannot trust that, given the pressures of life, that they will be able to remain straight” beyond prison walls.Krenwinkel was initially condemned to death in 1971, but her sentence was commuted to life after the California Supreme Court ruled in 1972 that the death penalty was unconstitutional.Even if the parole board recommends that Krenwinkel be released, the final decision will be up to Gov. Jerry Brown. Earlier this year, he rejected recommendations to free Manson followers Leslie Van Houten, 67, and Bruce Davis, 74. Brown cited Van Houten’s “inability to explain her willing participation in such horrific violence.” Bill Sessa, spokesman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, told the San Jose Mercury News that the nature of a prisoner’s crimes should not be the basis of denying parole. Remorse is the key, he said.“Commissioners are not looking for guilt or innocence because the court has determined that,” Sessa said. “They are looking for insight from the inmate and a sense of true taking responsibility, contrition, accountability.”But at Krenwinkel’s last hearing, parole board Commissioner Susan Melanson said the barbarity of the crimes and Krenwinkel’s failure to fully grasp the impact of the Manson killings demanded more time behind bars, the Los Angeles Times noted.“This crime remains relevant,” Melanson said then. “The public is in fear. And that just is a fact of the crime and the consequences of the crime.”Neither Manson nor any other of the seven followers convicted of murder has been paroled. Susan Atkins died in jail in 2009 after being denied “compassionate release” due to her terminal illness.Van Houten’s lawyer, Richard Pfeiffer, told the Mercury News that, while “there’s a chance” Krenwinkel would be granted parole, he doesn’t believe Brown would allow her to be released.“If the governor is going to reverse Leslie’s [Van Houton], who is far less culpable and her conduct in prison has been so much more exemplary, how could he possibly let Patricia be paroled?” he asked.

She was a member of the Imperial Senate, a leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and New Republic and the founding general of the Resistance.Sheppard then spent the majority of the article taking a critical approach and evaluating Organa’s legacy as a revolutionary.“Hers was a life laced with controversy concerning everything from her tactics to her very ancestry,” Sheppard wrote, “but her intelligence, commitment to the Republican cause, and place at the heart of the rebellion, and later the Resistance against Neo-Imperialism, remains the indisputable core of her legacy.”Fellow fans began sharing the post after it was published on Wednesday, commenting on how fitting a tribute Sheppard’s article was for both the character and the actor who brought her to life.Sheppard said on Twitter that he was happy “Star Wars” fans liked his space fan-fiction efforts, but he kept things pretty down to Earth:Read the obituary in its entirety here."

In today’s world of fake news that many contend helped elect President-elect Donald Trump, it is now more likely to end with the person wishing that everyone had to take a similar course. Theory of Knowledge is a core requirement for all students in the International Baccalaureate diploma program, a rigorous two-year curriculum for 11th and 12th graders. The course guides students through examining the scope, concepts, methodology and historical development in different areas, such as science, math, history and ethics. Students are required to do a formal presentation on a real-life situation, from which they extract a “knowledge question” as the focal point.A pair of students this year examined the real-life situation of police violence against African Americans in Chicago through the question of how beliefs affect our interpretation of reality. Because they are expected to investigate different perspectives, students have to contemplate how their own beliefs, as well as those of others, might affect what they see and how they interpret it. The critical thinking skills at the heart of the assessment are crucial for modern media literacy and democracy. We fall victim to fake news when we don’t understand our vulnerabilities that result from our biases and assumptions.We also can’t judge the reliability of claims in the media without being knowledgeable ourselves. I saw this firsthand in a Theory of Knowledge class when a student commented that he didn’t think the Black Lives Matter movement had anything to do with slavery. I waited for other students to question the assertion, but none did. In fact, other students added that it seemed to be the product of propaganda targeted at police. I was caught off guard. Wasn’t I still in my generally progressive Massachusetts school classroom? As I dug deeper, I learned that my students had little knowledge of the civil rights movement. How could I expect them to be able to evaluate such claims without the relevant historical knowledge?The six subject-specific courses that I.B. diploma students take are not only content-rich, but students are expected to think critically about the content. They are expected to examine the value and limitations of historical sources. Students in the natural and social sciences conduct lab and field research so that they may one day be critical consumers of science literature. I.B. diploma students also write a 4,000-word essay in which they hone their ability to evaluate sources. One student this year wrote about whether Trump’s use of linguistic devices on Twitter supports the contention that Trump is a demagogue. Just as critical thinking can’t be taught in one course alone, it also can’t be left to just 11th and 12th grade. Our son’s elementary school sent a letter home a few years ago proudly announcing that Gateway (gifted and talented) teachers would now be going into classrooms, and as a result, every child would be guaranteed a critical thinking lesson once per quarter. There was surely more critical thinking than this happening, but it was telling that ― seemingly without anyone noticing ― the letter it implied critical thinking was an “extra.” Despite good intentions and good teachers, the system’s lack of emphasis on critical thinking pushed us to choose private school this year. In contrast to the weekly Gateway pull-out book group, my son’s class at his private school is doing a semester-long mock Newbery Medal nomination process in which they develop and defend their opinions about the books they are reading. Students need to develop the habit of forming independent opinions based on evidence from an early age if we expect them to demand the same of themselves and others later in life.Unfortunately, it is not unusual for classes like Theory of Knowledge and the I.B. program as a whole to be restricted to the students perceived to be most able. This often excludes students of color, poor students, students for whom English is not their first language and students with learning differences. There is a push from within the I.B. and from education reformers to increase access to the I.B. for all students. I am lucky enough to teach at one such “I.B. for All” school. A special education student in my class who would have been excluded from the Theory of Knowledge course at most schools once shared the observation that being in a hurry seems to make people less ethical. As I slow down to let a car pull out during my morning commute, I appreciate that this student was able to be in my class.Practicing critical thinking while developing content knowledge gives students a fighting chance at deciphering truth from fiction in today’s news. It’s never been O.K. for critical thinking education to be reserved for a few. But now, more than ever, it must become a right and responsibility for all. "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586569b11900002a000e212e.jpeg?cache=uM1xMm5U72&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters Health) - Prompting doctors to ask adolescents and young adults about their gender identity may improve documentation of that information in electronic health records, according to a new study. Documenting of gender identity “is really going to make a difference in what services are ultimately provided,” said lead author Dr. Stanley R. Vance Jr. of the University of California, San Francisco.Gender identity is how a people view themselves, that is, as male, female or something less specific. Gender identity may differ from the sex assigned at birth.Vance and coauthor Dr. Veronika Mesheriakova say it’s necessary to document a person’s gender in order to establish what pronouns to use, maintain records and refer patients to appropriate specialists.As reported in the Journal of Adolescent Health, Vance and Mesheriakova analyzed medical records from the UCSF Adolescent and Young Adult Clinic, which cares for patients ages 12 to 26.Starting in early 2016, computer systems at the clinic prompted healthcare providers to ask patients for their current gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. When the researchers reviewed 125 medical records from the three months before those two questions were added, they found that healthcare providers recorded gender identities for only 11 percent of patients.But when they reviewed 106 medical records from three months after the questions were added, they found gender identities recorded for 84 percent of the patients.Vance said there could be many reasons why gender identity wasn’t noted on 100 percent of the records. For example, patients may have had a pressing issue that needed to be addressed during that specific visit.“I think identification of youth who are exploring their gender identities is really important to help them to thrive,” Vance told Reuters Health.The healthcare providers at their clinic received two one-hour education sessions or online courses about gender identity and related issues before the questions were added to their computer system.Other doctors interested in documenting their patients’ gender identities should educate themselves in advance, said Vance.“Even if you’re not someone who is comfortable providing medication or services, knowing which providers you can refer to is very important,” he said.Also, he said, it’s important to address confidentiality if patients don’t wish their gender identity to be revealed. And staff members should be trained to be sensitive toward patients and to use the person’s preferred pronouns.If their pediatrician documents their preferred name and pronouns, transgender youth will be referred to in a way that makes them feel respected when they come into the office, Vance said.SOURCE: bit.ly/2hu5L9m Journal of Adolescent Health, online December 15, 2016."

After his insulting comments about the Obamas last week, the calls are growing for Paladino to step down ― or be removed ― from the local Board of Education.The outrage arose over an article in the free weekly newspaper ArtVoice, in which Paladino said he would like to see first lady Michelle Obama “return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe.” He also wished particularly horrible deaths on President Barack Obama and White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.One of Paladino’s colleagues on the Buffalo Board of Education plans to submit a resolution on Thursday demanding that he resign within 24 hours ― or the board will petition New York Education Commissioner MaryEllen Elia to oust him, according to The Buffalo News. The resolution has already been signed by six of the nine board members, who oversee a school district that serves mostly students of color. It describes Paladino’s remarks as “unambiguously racist, morally repugnant, flagrantly disrespectful, inflammatory and inexcusable.”Also on Thursday, the Buffalo Parent-Teacher Organization is holding a rally to demand that Paladino go, which PTO co-chair Larry Scott said they expect hundreds of people to attend.On Tuesday, members of the Buffalo Common Council unanimously called on the education commissioner to investigate whether Paladino’s remarks warrant removal. Council Member David Franczyk, one of Paladino’s long-time allies, said the real estate developer’s behavior warrants consequences, according to radio station WBFO. And state Assemblyman Sean Ryan said on Twitter that he’d written to Elia asking for Paladino’s removal.Paladino, who served as co-chair of President-elect Donald Trump’s New York campaign, has claimed that his comments had nothing to do with race. He said he meant to send them to his friends, not the newspaper, and he apologized to “the minority community.”But he insisted he has no plans to leave the school board. New York state has limited ways to force out an elected official. Scott, the PTO co-chair, said his organization is in the process of filing an official complaint about Paladino with the education commissioner. From there, Elia could act to remove him, Scott said.“We’ve had Mr. Paladino make some very hateful comments in the past, but the outrage we’re receiving from the community, from Buffalo parents, and even outside Buffalo has certainly reached a new level,” said Scott, who is a school psychologist in a neighboring district. “Students are hearing this. They’re paying attention. It’s all over social media, it’s in the news. It’s having an impact on them.”A number of public officials and groups outside Buffalo have also condemned Paladino’s remarks, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund wrote to Elia. Thousands of people have signed petitions urging her to take action.In response, the state Education Department issued a statement saying they’re “in the process of reviewing all of our options in this unusual situation and will closely watch the actions taken by the Buffalo Board of Education at tomorrow’s meeting.”Paladino did not immediately respond to requests for comment. This is not the first time Paladino has drawn the ire of his local community. He has come under fire for racially offensive emails. Even in endorsing him for re-election this past spring, The Buffalo News referred to “all his defects ― his offensive comments, his bullying, his sometime inability to function effectively on the board.”Earlier this month, Paladino presented a formal resolution to the Board of Education calling for pictures of Trump to be placed in the schools. He brought the request on behalf of the “patriotism committee,” which is not actually a committee, according to The Buffalo News. Instead, the board decided that schools would display posters showing all the U.S. presidents. Paladino’s latest offense sets a poor example for the students, said Eve Shippens, a local parent, teacher and co-chair of the Buffalo PTO.“If he was a student in my classroom, he would have gotten formally suspended for saying that to another student. If he had posted that on his Facebook page, he would have been suspended,” Shippens said. “So how can he make decisions that affect children and not even have the consequences they have?”――Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

In response, DOT initiated an investigation of the closures, which suggested a potential violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law requires recipients of federal funding to abide by its nondiscrimination provisions. Voting rights advocates also warned that the closures, coupled with Alabama’s voter ID requirement, would depress minority participation in the election.U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told The Huffington Post that, historically, these investigations have been “fairly infrequent” and that Alabama wasn’t exactly keen on getting a visit from DOT.“No one likes to see us come in on Title VI — I think that’s fair to say,” Foxx said. “Our goal is to get the best remedy possible for the public.”Under the terms of the deal, which is good for two years and legally enforceable, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency agreed to add more than 2,000 hours of operation to the affected counties. The agency also agreed to appoint a coordinator who will ensure compliance with federal civil rights obligations.It’s unclear if the new plan will lead to a reopening of closed offices, but a chart included with the agreement lists proposed changes in hours of operation in nine counties.“Based on its investigation, DOT has concluded that African Americans residing in the Black Belt region of Alabama are disproportionately underserved by ALEA’s driver licensing services, causing a disparate and adverse impact on the basis of race,” read the agreement signed Dec. 22.Following the outcry over the closures, which included colorful protests outside the Alabama Capitol, a bill that would have required driver’s license offices to be open at least twice a week passed with broad bipartisan support at the end of the 2016 legislative session. In May, Republican Gov. Robert Bentley let the bill die without his signature.Bentley’s office and the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency did not return requests for comment on the agreement with DOT. A DOT official said the state agency received $5.3 million in federal funding in 2016.Foxx said that the change to a Trump administration shouldn’t affect Alabama’s obligations.“We’re expecting Alabama to abide by it, and our folks here will abide by it,” he said. He added that the effort is part of “a much larger conversation we’ve tried to create around the country on transportation and inclusiveness.”Minnie Austen, president of the NAACP branch in Macon County, welcomed Wednesday’s announcement.“That’s good news for me,” Austen said. “This will help the constituents of Alabama 100 percent.”"

Paladino was Donald Trump’s New York campaign co-chair and currently sits on the nine-member Buffalo school board. In recent days, he’s faced intense criticism for his answers to a local newspaper’s questionnaire about what he would like to see happen in 2017. Paladino said he’d like President Barack Obama to die from mad cow disease and called first lady Michelle Obama a man who should go live with gorillas. Buffalonians sick of Paladino making their city look bad mobilized Thursday, first for a protest downtown in Niagara Square and later at a special school board meeting at city hall.The board met to consider a fiery resolution that said if Paladino did not resign within 24 hours, they would petition New York Education Commissioner MaryEllen Elia to remove him. Elia has so far declined to weigh in on the controversy.The resolution, introduced by board member Hope Jay, called Paladino’s remarks about the Obamas “unambiguously racist, morally repugnant, flagrantly disrespectful, inflammatory and inexcusable.” It also said they reflected negatively on “the Buffalo Board of Education, the City of Buffalo and its leadership and its citizens, the State of New York, and every decent human being in America and abroad who has been shocked and offended by his words.”When Jay read her resolution Thursday at the school board’s special session, the crowd gave her an enthusiastic standing ovation. Only two board members ― Patti Pierce and Larry Quinn, who are considered Paladino allies ― did not support the resolution. They said they would like to see Paladino apologize to the students of the district rather than resign.Pierce said she hoped the people in Buffalo could show Paladino some forgiveness for his comments and “take a page out of the horrific massacre that happened in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine innocent people in a house of worship were slain by a hateful, hate-filled man.”The comparison drew gasps from the audience and was too much for one woman, who left shouting that it was offensive to use the murdered African-American congregation members in this situation.“Although I do think he has a racial filter from time to time, I don’t know that it’s that much different from many people on this board,” Quinn said. The school board is majority black.He also recounted a moment of racial understanding he had when he was younger, telling a story about the black woman his father hired to look after him when his mother was ill. The protest Thursday morning drew several hundred people outside city hall, despite cold, slushy weather.“He’s like a test case,” said Ellie Dorritie, 74. “If we let him stay, if we give him a pass, if we even give him a week ― it’s like a green light for all the rest of the slime to come out of the sewer. And because we have the Trump administration coming up ― all of that garbage, flowing all around it ― it means that we’re going to give Trump a chance to do that. We’ve had Carl Paladino’s filth for so many years. It’s got to end now.”Trump was on the minds of many people at the protest. Josh Gordon, 31, came with his two kids, one of whom is set to begin school next year. He said he hasn’t really been very involved in local politics but after this most recent election, he’s going to start doing more.“I would like somebody to hear that this isn’t OK,” Gordon said. “I want [my son] to go into a school system where the sort of people who say the sort of shit that Carl Paladino says ― I don’t want that in my city. ... I know that I’m pretty fed up with this kind of stuff, and the election of Trump, Paladino’s support of Trump, has motivated me to do a little more than I’ve been doing.”Paladino’s comments have drawn widespread criticism, including from his own son, who called them “disrespectful.”“Carl’s comments are absolutely reprehensible, and they serve no place in our public discourse,” added a Trump campaign spokeswoman.Paladino tried to issue a form of an apology this week, saying he never intended to hurt the “minority community,” is “certainly” not a racist and actually meant to send the responses to friends ― not to the publication Artvoice.He has also indicated he won’t step down. In a statement released Thursday, he called the board’s resolution calling for his resignation “certainly not an illustration of a profile in courage or leadership” and said it was retaliation for his attempts to uncover corruption within their ranks. He added he would “fight to the end to continue to expose the corruption.”But Paladino has been losing local support. This week, the Buffalo Common Council voted unanimously to call for Paladino’s resignation, with one of his longtime supporters joining the other members.

If Paladino doesn’t immediately resign, getting rid of him could be a slow process. The Buffalo News explained that he would have the right to appeal the Buffalo board’s decision to Elia. The whole process could take six to eight months. A handful of board members have been thrown out in recent years for misconduct ― but it was their behavior, not their words, that landed them in trouble, making the Paladino case unusual. The school board’s resolution argued that Paladino violates the New York Constitution and the Dignity for all Students Act, which gives children the right to “an education free of discrimination and harassment.”When Paladino ran for New York governor in 2010, he came under fire for sending emails to associates that included references to bestiality and offensive characterizations of Obama. In one email labeled “Obama Inauguration Rehearsal,” there was a video clip of African tribesmen dancing around.Local activists are launching an anti-Paladino website this weekend and on Jan. 5 will be marching to Paladino’s house to protest.

And it’s not just about receiving emotional support. Helping and supporting others may be key to living a longer and healthier life, according to new research from the University of Basel in Switzerland.The findings, which were published in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, showed that grandparents who care for their grandchildren ― as well as older people who care for others within their social networks ― enjoy significantly longer lifespans. Using data from the Berlin Aging Study, the researchers analyzed the longevity and caregiving habits of more than 500 people between the ages of 70 and 103. The study did not look at primary caregivers, instead comparing grandparents who acted as occasional caregivers with those who did not, in addition to older adults who did not have children or grandchildren but cared for people within their social network. Those who did not have a role helping others were significantly more likely to have died within just five years of the initial testing period.This effect also extended beyond family ties. Childless older adults who provided emotional support to others within their social network lived for an extra seven years on average, while childless older adults who did not report helping or supporting others lived for only an extra four years on average. But it’s important to note that too much caregiving often has just the opposite effect. There’s a clear link between primary caregiving and a number of negative physical and mental health consequences, often resulting from high levels of chronic stress. “Helping shouldn’t be misunderstood as a panacea for a longer life,” Dr. Ralph Hertwig, a psychologist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany, said in a press release. “A moderate level of caregiving involvement does seem to have positive effects on health, but ... more intense involvement causes stress, which has negative effects on physical and mental health.”Although the new study only focused on older adults, it’s safe to assume that the health benefits of helping and taking care of others extend to those of all ages. There may be an evolutionary explanation as to why we’re rewarded for supporting others, within both our own family and the larger social community. “It seems plausible that the development of parents’ and grandparents’ prosocial behavior toward their kin left its imprint on the human body,” explains lead author Dr. Sonja Hilbrand, “in terms of a neural and hormonal system that subsequently laid the foundation for the evolution of cooperation and altruistic behavior towards non-kin.”In other words, taking care of others may be hard-wired into the human brain. To be good to yourself and your own health, try being good to others. "

The 82-year-old activist and writer will be co-chairing the event with civil rights activist and singer Harry Belafonte, organizers announced. Steinem said she was proud to participate in a statement on Wednesday:I am proud to be one of thousands who will come to Washington to make clear that we will keep working for a democracy in which we are linked as human beings, not ranked by race or gender or class or any other label.Over 157,000 people have pledged to join the march, according to the event’s Facebook page, and nearly 100 sister marches are planned in solidarity across the United States, parts of Europe and New Zealand.According to the event’s mission statement:The Women’s March on Washington will send a bold message to our new government on their first day in office, and to the world that women’s rights are human rights. We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us.Steinem has been a vocal proponent of human rights for decades, helping to establish the National Women’s Political Caucus in 1971, protesting against South African apartheid in 1984 and co-founding Choice USA, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting reproductive choice.The march has over 70 partners, including Planned Parenthood, the NAACP and Amnesty International.“Donald Trump’s administration is a nightmare being manifested into an administration,” organizer Linda Sarsour said during a press call earlier this month. “It’s important we women show we are not afraid.”The march will begin at 10 a.m. on Jan. 21 near the U.S. Capitol at Independence Avenue and Third Street SW."

Spicer replied that the president-elect couldn’t ditch the events entirely because they’re “part of the fabric of our country,” but would look for other ways, specifically through social media, to communicate with the American people.“And so maybe we do, you know, a series of press conferences, but maybe we do some town hall, you know, Facebook town halls. Maybe we go out and solicit input from Twitter,” Spicer said. “While we have to sort of do these press conferences because they’re part of the fabric of our country, if you will, there are also some new opportunities that we can be utilizing to bring more people into the process and have a conversation with the American people and not just limit it through the filter of the mainstream media.”Reince Priebus, Trump’s incoming chief of staff, made similar remarks on Hewitt’s show earlier this month, saying traditions like daily press briefings are being reassessed and may be changed. Trump held a brief question-and-answer session outside his Florida resort Wednesday, but hasn’t held a full press conference since July. He scheduled a news conference about his business conflicts of interest for this month, only to then push it back to January.Trump’s press conference drought during the transition period breaks with tradition, as does his choice not to allow a “protective pool” of reporters. The president-elect’s relationship with the press has been contentious since long before the election. During his campaign, he repeatedly blacklisted outlets from his events, verbally attacked specific reporters and threatened to sue over critical stories, making some journalists fear that his presidency will usher in an erosion of First Amendment rights. Despite his repeated complaints about mainstream media bias, Trump has received an overwhelming amount of both critical and positive coverage, including a number of stories that seem to play right into his hands.Spicer alluded to Trump’s media savvy Thursday, saying he has a “strategic understanding of how to drive a message” and understands the media and communications “probably better than anyone in modern American history.”Spicer also lobbed a blow at The New York Times, one of Trump’s frequent targets, suggesting Trump would keep allowing its reporters access despite purported bias because of the “few thousand readers or so left that still look at” the paper. (The Times has over 2.5 million subscribers and has sold around 170,000 new subscriptions since the election, according to Politico.)"

At the same time, a Tarrant County sheriff’s deputy is pointing a flashlight at Collie. The video was released Tuesday by Collie’s attorney Nate Washington. His 33-year-old client can no longer move his body below the waist.One of two shots fired by their officer struck Collie in the lower torso, Fort Worth Police Department officials said this past summer.The two officers “were working together in an off-duty capacity,” the department said. They moonlighted as security guards for the apartment complex where they encountered Collie, according to The Associated Press.That night, the cops responded to reports that two shirtless black men had robbed a gas station. They became suspicious of Collie because he matched the general description of a shirtless black man. He was just walking to a friend’s home, his lawyer has said. The officers allege that Collie first ducked down behind a bush when they appeared and then attempted to flee while ignoring orders to stop and remove his hand from his pocket.The encounter quickly escalated into gunfire. Forth Worth police officials allege that Collie menaced the officers with a shiny silver object, believed to be a firearm, before the one officer fired at him. Investigators retrieved a box cutter, but no gun. Washington said the box cutter did not belong to Collie, according to AP. He also argues that the video shows that Collie never threatened the officers and had actually complied with orders to lift his arms. In the darkened footage, it’s difficult to get a clear view of Collie’s hands or to tell how far apart the men were at the time. Fort Worth police Sgt. Marc Povero told The Huffington Post that department officials reviewed the footage “immediately after the incident” and determined that the officers’ description of what transpired matched the video. A department review of the shooting is complete, according to AP, but its findings are private. The Fort Worth officer has returned to duty.Collie, who was hospitalized for two months, was initially charged with aggravated assault on a public servant. The case has since been thrown out. Even before this latest footage was released, Fort Worth police were facing criticism for another unsettling video that shows a cop roughly arresting a 49-year-old woman and her two teenaged daughters, who’d called police to help handle a dispute with a neighbor. Their arrests have sparked protests, according to The Star-Telegram. Collie told Dallas News that he felt that incident compelled him to share the video of his shooting. On Tuesday afternoon, the Fort Worth police tweeted a conciliatory message assuring the public that they’ve heard the complaints and are investigating. Washington and the Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s inquiries. "

Obama also designated a second, smaller tract, the 300,000-acre Gold Butte National Monument in the Nevada desert.“The sacred tribal areas in and around Bears Ears should absolutely be protected but in a way that is legally sound and that makes sense,” Reyes said in the statement. “The local Navajo will no longer be able to gather medicine or firewood, graze cattle, hunt, maintain their livelihoods or access the mountain heights for their religious ceremonies.” At least one advocate is crying foul. “That is complete bull,” Mathew Gross, a spokesman for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, a 35-year-old nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to public lands issues, said Thursday. “It’s just not true.”“People like the attorney general are reaching back a century for an example to invoke fear among people about what will happen,” he added, noting that Native Americans faced discrimination under national monument designations during much of the last century. “If you read the proclamation, it’s clear that traditional uses will continue and be protected.”Reyes’ argument seems to question both presidential norms and the words of the leader of the Navajo Nation.

Only Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush declined to use the law, according to The Wilderness Society. Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye praised Obama’s decision, noting that five tribal nations petitioned the administration to conserve the land. “Bears Ears National Monument is sacred not only to the Dinépeople, but also our Hopi, Ute, and Zuni neighbors,” he wrote in a post on Medium. “These tribes came together in an unprecedented show of unity to conserve these lands for future generations of all Americans.

But that ruling was revoked on Thursday, opening Fernandez to prosecution.“The evidence does not allow for a clear dismissal of the possible commission of illicit acts,” the country’s official CIJ Judicial Information Center said in a statement. “The accusations must be weighed in advance of dismissal.”Argentine courts have accused Iran of sponsoring the attack, which killed 85 people at the AMIA Jewish community center.Nisman was found in his home shot through the head days after accusing Fernandez of trying to derail the bombing investigation as part of a plan to close the country’s energy gap by trading Argentine grains for Iranian oil.She dismisses the charge as absurd.Nisman’s death was initially classified as a suicide, but an official investigating the case said early this year that the evidence pointed to homicide.The hard-charging prosecutor was just hours away from a scheduled appearance in Congress to brief lawmakers on his accusations against Fernandez when his body was found on the floor of his apartment, a 22-caliber pistol by his side.Iran has repeatedly denied any link to the bombing, and an Argentine judge in February 2015 dismissed Nisman’s accusations as baseless. A review panel later agreed by a 2-1 vote, finding insufficient evidence to formally investigate Fernandez.She has faced several criminal charges since leaving office a year ago. She was indicted this week on charges arising from allegations she and top officials from her administration skimmed money intended for public works projects."

But it’s the most extensive analysis of its kind, its authors say, and pulls from observations made as far back as 265 years ago, including those of 19th-century naturalist Henry David Thoreau.While rising temperatures were found to prompt early migration in birds across the board, the study found that short-distance migrants are arriving at their destinations significantly earlier than long-distance migrants. Those changes throw off a delicate balance in the ecosystem and could have serious effects. If migratory birds arrive at their breeding grounds too early ― or too late, relative to those arriving even earlier ― there’s a potential for “mismatch of trophic interactions,” the study explains, meaning the birds may miss out on peak resource availability or face stronger competition for breeding sites or mates. This would affect the timing of their offspring hatching, putting the baby birds’ survival at risk, too. Of course, none of this would occur in a vacuum. The endangerment or extinction of one species can have reverberations up and down the food chain, creating a dangerous ripple effect across entire ecosystems. The study comes just days before the end of what will likely prove the hottest year on record thus far. While NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are expected to release their findings next month, Dr. Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, tweeted in October that the record was probably already “locked in.”President-elect Donald Trump has raised much alarm over wind turbines, a renewable energy tool that could prove crucial to the ongoing effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Trump has argued that turbines kill birds that collide with them.This may be true: Studies estimate that every year, turbines are responsible for somewhere between 140,000 and 368,000 bird deaths worldwide. But these numbers pale in comparison to the potential consequences of climate change. The Audubon Society has found that climate change threatens more than half of all bird species in North America alone."

I have done this before, why would I not do it again?” Duterte said during a speech to victims of a typhoon on Tuesday, a clip of which is posted on a video feed of the president’s office.Duterte’s latest threat comes just a few weeks after he admitted killing people during his 22 years as a mayor of Davao City, sometimes riding a motorcycle looking for “encounters to kill”. Some senators have warned Duterte he risks impeachment over his comments.He has repeatedly said those killings were part of legitimate police operations, including a hostage incident, and those killed were criminals, not suspects.It was not immediately clear when or where the helicopter incident Duterte spoke of took place.In an interview on Thursday with the ABS-CBN news channel, Duterte was non-committal when asked if the incident really happened.“Helicopter to throw a person?” he asked. “And if that is true, I will not admit it.”His spokesman, Ernesto Abella, suggested earlier the story was an “urban legend”.Duterte also said six people arrested last week during a seizure of more than half a tonne of methamphetamine, known locally as “shabu”, in the capital were fortunate he was out of town.“They were lucky I was not in Manila that time. If I had known there were that much shabu inside a house, I would definitely kill you,” he said.“Let’s not make any drama, I will personally gun you down if nobody else will do it.”The United Nations’ top human rights envoy has called for an investigation into Duterte’s claims of killing people, to which Duterte last week responded by calling him “stupid”, an “idiot” and a “son of a bitch” who should go back to school."

China said Tsai’s intentions were clear and urged the United States not to let her in.“We hope the U.S. can abide by the ‘one China’ policy...and not let her pass through their border, not give any false signals to Taiwan independence forces, and through concrete actions safeguard overall U.S. China relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan strait,” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, told a briefing in Beijing.The transit details are being closely watched as Taiwan media has speculated Tsai will seek to meet President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team ahead of his January 20 inauguration.Trump angered China when he spoke to Tsai this month in a break with decades of precedent and cast doubt on his incoming administration’s commitment to Beijing’s “one China” policy.The United States, which switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, has acknowledged the Chinese position that there is only “one China” and that Taiwan is part of it.China’s sole aircraft carrier, accompanied by several warships, sailed close to Taiwan this week, which followed on from air force exercises also close to Taiwan.Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun repeated that the drills were routine, but added that such drills did have Taiwan in mind.“The military’s holding of exercises is beneficial to raising our ability to oppose Taiwan independence and protecting the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and beneficial to protecting the peaceful development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations and peace and stability there,” he told reporters.Tsai’s office earlier this month said she would visit Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador in that order. She will leave Taiwan on Jan. 7 and return on Jan. 15.Taiwan had as many as 30 diplomatic allies in the mid-1990s, but now has formal relations with just 21, mostly smaller and poorer nations in Latin America and the Pacific and including the Vatican.The American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto embassy of the United States, had no immediate comment on Tsai’s itinerary.

The government accused rebels of polluting the springs with diesel, forcing authorities to cut the supplies on Friday and use reserves instead.A Damascus resident said each neighborhood only gets water for about two hours a day and bottled water prices had increased dramatically on the open market to more than double the cost at state-subsidised grocery stores.“The U.N. is concerned the water cut could lead to diseases transmitted through dirty water, especially in children, in addition to the extra financial burden for families,” OCHA said.“(People) are having to purchase water from private vendors, where prices and water quality are unregulated,” it said.Wadi Barada lies on a road from Damascus to the Lebanese border that is a supply line for the powerful Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, which is heavily involved in fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s army.Government forces have been bombing the area heavily for a week, though the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there was a lull on Thursday before the air strikes resumed.The rebels in Wadi Barada have allowed government water authority engineers to maintain and operate the pumping station and supply Damascus since they took control of the area in 2012.Fighters have, however, cut water supplies several times in the past to put pressure on the army not to overrun the area.The U.N. called on all sides to reach a peaceful settlement to reduce civilian suffering and avoid targeting infrastructure.OCHA said 15 million people needed help accessing water across Syria after nearly six years of conflict and households were spending up to a quarter of their income on water."

Some individuals, however, don’t think the rules of common courtesy apply to them.Comedian Kumail Nanjiani, costar of the HBO series “Silicon Valley,” was recently seated near one such deplorable, who decided that a 5 1/2-hour flight is the appropriate time to strip down to your skivvies and spread eagle.“I was on a plane a couple of days ago,” Nanjiani tweeted Wednesday. “A guy took off his jeans and lounged around in his boxers with his feet up on the wall.”The culprit, Nanjiani later clarified, was seated at the front of the plane, “so if you walked onto the plane, you would be greeted by this defiant fleshy V.”The man reportedly took his pants off within the first 20 minutes of the flight and had his feet up for four hours before a flight attendant asked him to put his bare legs back on the ground.After a “40-second stare down” between the man and the attendant, the man complied, according to Nanjiani.But only for a moment.Nanjiani said that, after five minutes, the man thrust one foot back up against the wall, “like a fist raised against an unjust sky.”Pants (or lack thereof) aside, Nanjiani also claimed that this man was rude to airline staff.The man stood in front of the gate during pre-boarding for 30 minutes and, at one point, said, “I can’t wait to get in there and get my pants off,” as people in wheelchairs rolled around him, Nanjiani tweeted.The actor also said that the man slammed his fist on the armrest if he failed to get the flight attendant’s attention during the flight.During his tweet storm, Nanjiani called attention to the colored lights that can be seen near the man’s boxer-clad crotch, which made some of his Twitter followers believe he was on a Virgin Airlines flight.However, they weren’t on a Virgin aircraft and those lights weren’t from the plane. The light ― which, according to Nanjiani’s video evidence, flashed various colors ― was from the man’s USB charger.“Ppl think it’s Virgin. It’s not! His USB charger made disco lights the whole time, bathing his thighs in reds, blues, greens,” the actor explained.Unfortunately for Nanjiani and his fellow passengers, this story did not have a happy ending, and justice was never served. The bare-thighed man waited until the plane had already started its descent to stand up, “in defiance of decency & lighted seatbelt signs,” and put his pants back on.Nanjiani was understandably perplexed when he saw that the pantless perpetrator suffered no consequences after forcing people to deal with his “hairy thigh V.” The actor did find a little irony within the whole ordeal, specifically in the man’s choice of movie.When fellow comedy writer Dan Harmon wondered (tweeted) whether this pants-defying man was a villain or hero, Nanjiani was quick to explain the unwritten rules of air travel."

During brief remarks outside his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump said 5,000 jobs at Sprint Wireless would be returning to the U.S. from abroad and 3,000 would be created at OneWeb “because of what’s happening and the spirit and the hope.”“I was just called by the head people at Sprint and they’re going to be bringing 5,000 jobs back to the United States,” Trump said. “They’re taking them from other countries, they’re bringing them back to the United States. And also OneWeb, a new company, is going to be hiring 3,000 people.”Media outlets quickly ran with the news that Trump was bringing jobs back to the U.S., in some cases connecting it to the president-elect’s intervention at Carrier several weeks ago that kept 800 jobs at the company from moving to Mexico. ”Look, Sprint and another company, 8,000 jobs, we will take it,” Fox News’ Heather Nauert said Wednesday shortly after Trump’s remarks. “I don’t care if he is announcing 500 jobs or whether it’s 50,000 jobs. The point is bringing jobs back and that contributes to optimism.”“This is part of the process and progression forward,” Fox News’ Kimberly Guilfoyle added.MSNBC’s Peter Alexander called Trump a “genius marketer” for the stunt.“But this does benefit Donald Trump, right, because it leads people to believe he is having a real impact on this issue,” he said.In fact, those Sprint and OneWeb jobs Trump says he created were part of a $50 billion investment plan Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. developed in October, ahead of his election. The plan was announced earlier in December following a meeting between SoftBank’s billionaire owner, Masayoshi Son, and the president-elect. Trump took credit for that investment plan too, even though (again) it predated his election.Several hours after Trump’s Wednesday remarks, when Sprint confirmed that the jobs had been previously announced, the president-elect continued to take credit.“Because of me they are doing 5,000 jobs in this country,” Trump told reporters on the steps of Mar-a-Lago.Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure tweeted Thursday that the 5,000 jobs Trump’s been touting are “NEW” jobs. “Stop speculating. This has NOTHING to do with previously announced @Sprint initiatives,” Claure wrote, directly contradicting comments made by a Sprint spokesman the night before.Trump’s incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, doubled down on the president-elect’s claim on Twitter later Wednesday.Come Thursday morning, headlines failing to succinctly frame Trump’s stunt remained, and networks continued to laud Trump for bringing jobs back.“President-elect Donald Trump delivering on his promise once again to bring more jobs to America,” Nauert said during a Thursday morning broadcast. “Mr. Trump announcing an agreement with Sprint to haul about 5,000 jobs back to the United States and another company that will bring in 3,000 jobs. ... This after that deal with Carrier to keep jobs in Indiana.”Trump’s comments follow a pattern of Trump taking credit for things he had no or little hand in, including the state of the U.S. economy before he’s even taken office. Earlier this week, the president-elect fired off several tweets patting himself on the back for recent gains in consumer confidence and the value of the stock market.As HuffPost’s Daniel Marans wrote, “The tweets illustrate what we already knew about Trump ― that he’s happy to hold up relatively innocuous economic data and claim that it’s proof of his greatness.”This article has been updated with comments from Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure."

52,QUEER VOICES,Why Broadway's 'Falsettos' Is A 'Reality Check' For LGBTQ Audiences,Curtis M.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585bfbd61800002d00e441b5.jpeg?cache=K2UiMsBjpV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When “Falsettos” premiered on Broadway in 1992, the William Finn-James Lapine musical struck a fresh chord in its depiction of gay relationships and unconventional families during the HIV/AIDS crisis.As beloved as the show was in its original incarnation, the LGBTQ community has made significant strides toward equality in the 24 years since then. So when it was announced that “Falsettos” would be returning to Broadway in a Lincoln Center Theater production this fall, Lapine sought a creative team who would approach the musical as a new work altogether.Enter Emmy-nominated choreographer Spencer Liff, who is best known for eight seasons’ worth of “So You Think You Can Dance” footwork. The 31-year-old Arizona native is no stranger to Broadway, too, with a résumé that includes dancing in the ensembles of “Cry-Baby” and “9 To 5.” Behind the scenes, he’s taught Neil Patrick Harris, Andrew Rannells, Darren Criss and others to strut in spike heels for the Tony-winning revival of “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” and worked with a cast of hearing-impaired performers for “Spring Awakening,” which was remounted on Broadway to great acclaim last season.Still, Liff said that when Lapine tapped him to choreograph “Falsettos,” he was initially hesitant. For one thing, he wasn’t familiar at all with the musical, which explores the complicated dynamics between a gay couple, Marvin and Whizzer (Christian Borle and Rannells), as well as Marvin’s ex-wife Trina (Stephanie J. Block) and son Jason (Anthony Rosenthal) in the mid-1980s. He also felt at some remove from the show’s depiction of the HIV/AIDS crisis in its second act.“I didn’t know ‘Falsettos’ at all when I started working on it. I realize that’s terrible of me because the show’s been around forever, and it’s held in such high esteem,” Liff told The Huffington Post. Ultimately, however, he came to realize that the show “was so incredibly ahead of its time when it was written. So I was interested in being able to give [audiences] a bit of a reality check into what the generation before ours went through.”Although Liff is best known for his fancy footwork, he opted for a more nuanced approach to “Falsettos,” treating the show, as he puts it, as an “abstract art piece.” Primarily, the staging requires the characters to manipulate a Rubik’s Cube-like contraption resembling a pile of cinder blocks that can morph into a kitchen, a playground and even a bedroom seamlessly. Designed by David Rockwell, the simple set piece represents the characters’ “sense of trying to find their place in the world,” Liff said. His work with “Falsettos” has certainly paid off. The revival, which opened Oct. 27 at the Walter Kerr Theatre, garnered raves in The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly and Time Out New York, among other publications. The show, which ends its limited run Jan. 8, will be preserved on film for an upcoming “Live From Lincoln Center” special to air on PBS.Liff is thrilled by the buzz that “Falsettos” has generated, particularly in a busy theater season and in a time when the LGBTQ community and other minority groups are facing an uncertain future. “We live in this new PrEP culture, and the idea of what AIDS and HIV was [has evolved],” Liff said. As an openly gay man himself, he felt that it was his responsibility to “present the show in a way that would make people stop and think about their actions, and have more respect for the battle” toward equality that LGBTQ people have had to fight across generations. Liff’s next project, however, couldn’t be any more different. He’s currently at work on the choreography for “Head Over Heels,” a musical based on Philip Sidney’s 16 century text, The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia, using the songs of the ‘80s female rock group, The Go-Go’s. The show will be fully staged in a developmental production on Jan. 16 and is aiming for Broadway in fall 2017, with “Spring Awakening” and “Hedwig” director Michael Mayer at the helm.If Mayer’s previous work is any indication, “Head Over Heels” won’t shy away from sex or politics, albeit in an entertaining way. Given the seriousness of America’s political climate, Liff told HuffPost he “can’t work on fluff right now,” but he wouldn’t have it any other way.“I’m very lucky to be an artist at this time,” he said. “We’re the ones who get to channel and funnel our emotions and our frustrations into something beautiful, something that might help the world in some sort of way. If one person a night can be changed by [a show that I’ve worked on], I’m even luckier.” “Falsettos” plays New York’s Walter Kerr Theatre through Jan. 8. Head here for more information. "

During a search of the residence, authorities seized Bates’ Amazon Echo, which they suspect could have recorded “evidence related to the case,” court documents state.The problem with the court order, Bates’ attorney, Kimberly Weber, told The Huffington Post, is that it’s “vague and full of supposition.”The e-commerce giant agrees and has refused to turn any audio recordings over to police.“Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course,” Amazon spokeswoman Kinley Pearsall told HuffPost.Even if police are eventually able to get access to the data, it’s not clear what, if anything, they would actually learn.According to Pearsall, Echo is a free-standing speaker that’s connected to the internet. It’s always on, and always listening for the “wake word” that activates the device. Once the wake word is spoken, the virtual assistant can respond to voice commands and provide information on news, weather, music and more.“Utterances are not stored on the device,” Pearsall said. “They are securely stored in the cloud, and you can see and always delete each individual utterance associated with your account or delete all voice recording history with a big ‘delete all’ button.”Authorities have not explained exactly what they’re looking for in the data from Bates’ Echo, but it appears they’re pinning their hopes on the possibility that it picked up a voice command the night of Collins’ death and went into “listen mode.” If this did indeed happen, it’s possible the Echo might have recorded something of evidentiary value.Weber believes that this is unlikely. She says authorities are grasping at straws to make a case against Bates.“My client is innocent,” she said. “There’s nothing on that device that’s going to harm his case.”The legal case was opened on Nov. 22, 2015, when Bates called police and said he’d found Collins dead in a hot tub at Bates’ Bentonville home.Questioned by police, Bates said he had invited Collins and two other friends over to his home the night before to watch a football game. The four men were drinking alcohol, and around 1 a.m., Bates went to bed, while Collins and another guest sat in his hot tub. Bates told police he awoke several hours later and discovered Collins floating facedown in the hot tub, according to an affidavit.A months-long investigation ensued, and the Arkansas State Crime Lab ruled Collins’ death a homicide by strangulation, with a contributing cause of drowning, Fayetteville’s KFSM News reported.Bentonville police arrested Bates in February on suspicion of first-degree murder. Bates, who has denied the charges, is scheduled to appear in court in March for a discovery hearing.“This was an accident,” Weber told HuffPost. “The deceased was a friend of my client, and the injuries he sustained are consistent with someone trying to get out of a hot tub and not doing too well. It was clearly a horrible, horrible tragedy.”Contacted by HuffPost on Wednesday, Bentonville police Chief Jon Simpson said he would not “address questions prior to the trial.” Simpson directed inquiries to Benton County Prosecuting Attorney Nathan Smith.According to Smith, it is “incumbent on law enforcement officers” to examine data collected by Bates’ Amazon device.“Obtaining a search warrant from a judge based on probable cause is the constitutionally authorized means for law enforcement to conduct searches of homes, property or computer devices like the Amazon Echo,” Smith said in an email to HuffPost. “Since law enforcement officers followed the constitutionally mandated procedures to obtain a lawful search warrant in this case, I am hopeful that Amazon will agree to fully comply with it.”The standoff between Amazon and Bentonville police is only the latest wrinkle in an ongoing push-and-pull between law enforcement and the tech industry over the use of personal devices in criminal cases.A similar case made headlines in the past year when Apple refused to comply with a court order demanding that it help authorities to access an iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in the December 2015 San Bernardino attack. In that case, the phone was eventually unlocked with the help of an unidentified third party."

The four men were drinking alcohol, and around 1 a.m., Bates went to bed, while Collins and another guest sat in his hot tub. Bates told police he awoke several hours later and discovered Collins floating facedown in the hot tub, according to an affidavit.A months-long investigation ensued, and the Arkansas State Crime Lab ruled Collins’ death a homicide by strangulation, with a contributing cause of drowning, Fayetteville’s KFSM News reported.Bentonville police arrested Bates in February on suspicion of first-degree murder. Bates, who has denied the charges, is scheduled to appear in court in March for a discovery hearing.“This was an accident,” Weber told HuffPost. “The deceased was a friend of my client, and the injuries he sustained are consistent with someone trying to get out of a hot tub and not doing too well. It was clearly a horrible, horrible tragedy.”Contacted by HuffPost on Wednesday, Bentonville police Chief Jon Simpson said he would not “address questions prior to the trial.” Simpson directed inquiries to Benton County Prosecuting Attorney Nathan Smith.According to Smith, it is “incumbent on law enforcement officers” to examine data collected by Bates’ Amazon device.“Obtaining a search warrant from a judge based on probable cause is the constitutionally authorized means for law enforcement to conduct searches of homes, property or computer devices like the Amazon Echo,” Smith said in an email to HuffPost. “Since law enforcement officers followed the constitutionally mandated procedures to obtain a lawful search warrant in this case, I am hopeful that Amazon will agree to fully comply with it.”The standoff between Amazon and Bentonville police is only the latest wrinkle in an ongoing push-and-pull between law enforcement and the tech industry over the use of personal devices in criminal cases.A similar case made headlines in the past year when Apple refused to comply with a court order demanding that it help authorities to access an iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in the December 2015 San Bernardino attack. In that case, the phone was eventually unlocked with the help of an unidentified third party."

Or keep an eye on what Rick Perry does at the Energy Department, which the former Texas governor famously forgot he wanted to eliminate? Or make sure the General Services Administration isn’t doing any special favors for the president-elect on his company’s lease of the Old Post Office, now home to the Trump International Hotel?That’s where the inspectors general could come in. Presuming President Donald Trump lets them stick around.The federal inspectors general system was formed some 38 years ago, tasking the appointed official with the job of rooting out fraud, waste and abuse within federal agencies, offering recommendations that could save taxpayers billions of dollars. Effective ones try to help the agency implement reform when issues are discovered, and keep track of the top management problems at each agency. Trump, whose incoming administration will face a huge number of potential conflicts of interest, could put the work of federal watchdogs front and center.Inspectors general not only conduct oversight, they help build trust and confidence in government among the public in an era when trust in the federal government is low. Voters just elected a candidate who has painted the nation’s government as entirely corrupt, and who at random calls for the dismantling of agencies. And while inspectors general disagreements with politically appointed agency heads are typically limited to sternly worded letters, it isn’t tough to imagine Trump getting into a Twitter war with a government watchdog who issues a report critical of his administration.Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), ranking member on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, expects inspectors general to be busier than ever under Trump, expressing concern over a number of the people the businessman has picked for his cabinet.“With the Trump administration coming in, inspectors general will be playing a very, very significant role because he seems to, in some instances, lack transparency and seems to want to engage in secrecy at times,” Cummings told The Huffington Post. Inspectors general are one of the “very few backstops” left, Cummings warned. “When you have the government now controlled by one party you really must have something, somebody to look over the shoulders of these agencies,” he said. There is, however, the potential that Trump could get rid of the inspectors general en masse. That’s something that hasn’t been tried since President Ronald Reagan fired most of the country’s inspectors general on the second day of his presidency. Reagan’s move caused significant controversy, and several of the inspectors general were eventually hired back. “I think that left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth,” said Michael Bromwich, who formerly served as inspector general for the Justice Department. He noted that IGs were a “relatively new phenomenon” at the beginning of Reagan’s first term, and that there’s much broader recognition of the importance of IGs several decades later. Bromwich does not expect Trump to take the same approach.“I think it’s unlikely that it would be repeated, because I think a lot of people are still around who remember that and what a fiasco it was,” Bromwich said. “But obviously one can’t be sure.”Since Reagan’s move nearly 36 years ago, inspectors general have stayed on when presidential administrations change. But Trump has already broken with other longstanding traditions ― he’s the first major party candidate since 1976 not to release his full income tax returns, for example. If he wants, he could also decide to replace all of the inspectors general upon taking office.“There is nothing stopping him from doing that,” says Nick Pacifico of the Project on Government Oversight, which tracks vacancies in inspectors general offices. “It’s sort of up in the air.”If Trump did decide to discharge the inspectors general, he would have to provide an explanation to the House and Senate 30 days before any dismissal under current law. But his explanation to Congress doesn’t necessarily have to be very in-depth. When President Barack Obama dismissed the inspector general of the Corporation for National and Community Service in 2009, he simply stated that he “no longer” had “the fullest confidence” in Gerald Walpin, who was a George W. Bush appointee.There are 73 federal inspectors general, about half of whom are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. They are required to be appointed based only on “integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial analysis, law, management analysis, public administration, or investigations.” Politics isn’t supposed to come into play.Though their role is meant to be nonpartisan, most of the permanent inspectors general currently in place are Obama appointees. But there are 10 presidentially appointed IG vacancies, including at the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency and the Office of Personnel Management. With just three weeks until Trump’s inauguration, it seems increasingly likely that the 45th president will eventually choose nominees to fill those key positions.Leaving those positions open is a recipe for disaster, Bromwich said. “These are all very significant IG positions, and one concern I have based in part on what happened in the early days of the George W. Bush administration is the selection of nominees that kind of defy the nonpartisan requirement that’s in the statute,” Bromwich said. IG positions aren’t meant to be political handouts to allies and fundraisers, he said.Bromwich also said there could be some increased friction between some inspectors general and agency heads given that many Trump nominees don’t have experience in the federal government. Individuals who worked in the private sector, for example, would not be used to having an independent watchdog on their back.“I do think there’s a risk when you’re introducing so many people who have either never been in government service at all or who have never been in federal government service,” Bromwich said. “Getting them to understand and get used to what the requirements are, I think that will probably produce some additional work for IGs in terms of investigating allegations of misconduct.”The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment on whether it expects to replace any or all of the inspectors general. A bill authored by Cummings and Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chair of the oversight committee, gives an inspector general more access to documents necessary in determining waste, fraud and abuse at an agency he or she oversees. One downfall, Cummings said, is that a provision granting the watchdogs subpoena power didn’t make it into the final bill Obama ultimately signed this month. (Chaffetz was not available for an interview by the time of publication.)Cummings expects a “whole slew” of career employees at each agency to start lining up to talk to their inspector general, and some to come to Congress directly. When that happens, he hopes his Republican colleagues will stand by their promises to protect whistleblowers. “When we show whistleblowers we are not going to protect them the whole whistleblower system falls apart,” Cummings said. “And if we don’t have whistleblowers we will have lost our last line of defense, and when I say ‘we’ I mean the American people.”The role of the inspector general isn’t strictly adversarial. IGs can be an asset to an administration in that they can help head off potential problems before they balloon into scandals that change the course of history.Take former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Her use of a personal email server to conduct State Department business became a major issue in her presidential campaign, and was a significant factor in her defeat.One source who spent decades at the State Department pointed out that there was no permanent, confirmed inspector general during Clinton’s entire term as secretary of state. While there’s no way to know for sure, a permanent inspector general operating independently could have raised the private email server issue with Clinton’s team long before it dominated the political discourse as Americans chose the next commander in chief. Now that Trump has been elected president, the role of inspectors general could potentially shift, as several potential agency heads appear to be opposed to the core mission of the agencies they wish to lead. Cummings said he’s troubled by some of Trump’s picks, like former Texas governor Perry to lead the Energy Department and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency. (The Energy Department, notably, currently lacks a permanent IG. Obama nominee Susan F. Beard has been awaiting confirmation since April.) Trump selected people who “are bent on basically taking apart the agencies that they are now being assigned to,” Cummings said.But there are limits on an inspector general’s role. POGO’s Pacifico said IGs were an “invaluable check” ― particularly when one party controls the federal government ― and can give a unique perspective to an incoming administration to help ease a transition. It can get dicey, however, if IGs attempt to assert that an administration isn’t fulfilling its mission, as they are centrally focused on combatting waste, fraud and abuse.“The problem is that there’s nothing in the law specifically that would allow them to make sure that an agency’s agenda is followed, and that is a main concern among many people,” Pacifico said. “The IGs don’t really have specific power aside from informing Congress what is going on.”Bromwich said it’s “tricky” for IGs to look at whether an agency has fulfilled its mission because the executive branch has wide latitude to implement various statutes.“There certainly can be both program reviews and audits that an IG can do to get at whether a particular program authorized by Congress is in fact being implemented in the way envisioned by Congress and required by the statute,” Bromwich said. “But I think it may be trickier than most people think for an IG to go in and say ‘Oh, because he’s not devoting any resources to this program, he’s actually undermining the purposes of the agency.’”Despite those limits, Daniel Feldman, co-author of The Art of The Watchdog and a criminal justice professor at CUNY, is hopeful they will prove themselves as a critical check in coming years. But it will all depend on who fills the posts. “The effectiveness as a watchdog depends at least as much on who you are as on what you know,” Feldman writes in his book, co-authored by David R. Eichenthal. “The best public watchdogs combine a powerful indignation with relentless persistence.” Feldman’s optimism for inspectors general is based on what he considers the inherent divisions between the different branches of government. “The legislative and executive are natural enemies,” he said in an interview. “Institutional factors will themselves result in some degree of effectiveness of IGs,” he said. “If history is any guide, but maybe it isn’t, there is an institutional conflict and my best prediction is that at a certain point in time, no more than a year from now, you will begin to see friction between the legislative branch and the executive branch.”“Yeah, there will be a honeymoon period,” he said. “But I doubt that it will last forever.”"

It can get dicey, however, if IGs attempt to assert that an administration isn’t fulfilling its mission, as they are centrally focused on combatting waste, fraud and abuse.“The problem is that there’s nothing in the law specifically that would allow them to make sure that an agency’s agenda is followed, and that is a main concern among many people,” Pacifico said. “The IGs don’t really have specific power aside from informing Congress what is going on.”Bromwich said it’s “tricky” for IGs to look at whether an agency has fulfilled its mission because the executive branch has wide latitude to implement various statutes.“There certainly can be both program reviews and audits that an IG can do to get at whether a particular program authorized by Congress is in fact being implemented in the way envisioned by Congress and required by the statute,” Bromwich said. “But I think it may be trickier than most people think for an IG to go in and say ‘Oh, because he’s not devoting any resources to this program, he’s actually undermining the purposes of the agency.’”Despite those limits, Daniel Feldman, co-author of The Art of The Watchdog and a criminal justice professor at CUNY, is hopeful they will prove themselves as a critical check in coming years. But it will all depend on who fills the posts. “The effectiveness as a watchdog depends at least as much on who you are as on what you know,” Feldman writes in his book, co-authored by David R. Eichenthal. “The best public watchdogs combine a powerful indignation with relentless persistence.” Feldman’s optimism for inspectors general is based on what he considers the inherent divisions between the different branches of government. “The legislative and executive are natural enemies,” he said in an interview. “Institutional factors will themselves result in some degree of effectiveness of IGs,” he said. “If history is any guide, but maybe it isn’t, there is an institutional conflict and my best prediction is that at a certain point in time, no more than a year from now, you will begin to see friction between the legislative branch and the executive branch.”“Yeah, there will be a honeymoon period,” he said. “But I doubt that it will last forever.”"

The reality star reportedly began eating “excessively” and gaining weight amid ongoing drama with his fiancée, Blac Chyna. Chyna, Kris Jenner and Jenner’s boyfriend, Corey Gamble, were all photographed entering the hospital in Hidden Hills, California, Wednesday night. Kardashian and Chyna welcomed daughter Dream together last month, though their relationship was on-and-off before the holidays. Chyna moved out of Kardashian’s house, taking Dream with her, after the two got into a fight over hacked Instagram messages on Chyna’s account. “She was punching him in his back and arms and was in a drunken rage,” a source told E! News about the argument, which was only broken up after Gamble reportedly “ripped Chyna off of Rob.”“I got him out of Khloe’s house, helped him lose all that f**king weight for him to do nothing & gain it all back!” she wrote, via People. “Rob asked for all of this! Rob begged me to have Dream! He stressed me out my ENTIRE PREGNANCY!!! Accusing me of cheating, going crazy on me with massive text blast daily! being an absolute lunatic & then cover it up with gifts!” Soon after the fight, the two apparently reconciled. We just can’t keep up. The Huffington Post has reached out to reps for Kardashian and will update this post accordingly. "

Is there, then, a way he can create jobs through infrastructure investment, construct a physical obstacle at the U.S.-Mexico border that helps stem unlawful and dangerous crossings while, at the same time, mending rifts with Mexico, liberal and environmentally-conscious California ― and even China?The answer is “yes.” He can do so by expanding on an imaginative proposal by one of Mexico’s leading environmentalists, Homero Aridjis, and James Ramey, a professor at Mexico City’s Metropolitan Autonomous University. They propose building a border of solar panel arrays one-third the width of a football field along their side of the almost 2,000-mile border with the U.S. to capture the intense sunlight of Mexico’s northern desert. A new high-voltage direct current grid would distribute energy to the cities and populations that line both sides of the border from Texas to California. Yes, Mexico would pay for this installation ― and reap the revenues from selling the energy to utilities and households in both countries. And the jobs it would provide would help keep would-be migrants at home.Further, as Aridjis and Ramey wrote recently in The WorldPost, the physical facility, “would have a civilizing effect in a dangerous area.” They continued: “Since solar plants use security measures to keep intruders out, the solar border would serve as a de facto virtual fence, reducing porousness of the border while producing major economic, environmental and security benefits on both sides. It would make trafficking drugs, arms and people all the more difficult for criminal cartels.”Since sunlight roughly falls equally on both near sides of the border, the obvious question is, why shouldn’t the U.S. mirror this project on its territory, doubling the energy capacity (and thus reducing costs), the jobs and the border security?Such a project seems a compelling candidate for some of the president-elect’s proposed $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan. California could invest revenues from its cap and trade system toward this end. It could also, as needed, issue revenue bonds paid for not by the taxpayer, but out of energy usage fees. Either way, a solar border would help significantly in meeting California’s legal commitment to reduce greenhouse gases to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.Another source of financing could come from the new Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or AIIB, which is set up for just this kind of project across the Pacific Basin as well as Eurasia. Chinese President Xi Jinping has been arguing that, despite other conflicts, there are “win-win” possibilities for the U.S. and China.

Mexico has stayed out under U.S. pressure.If a President Trump were to make joining the AIIB an early priority of his administration, it would show that he is willing to cooperate with China as well as confront it when necessary. Mexico then would also likely join. Former CIA director Jim Woolsey, a Trump adviser, has publicly argued that the U.S. should correct the U.S. “mistake” and become a member of the AIIB. As dealmaker-in-chief, a President Trump could probably even negotiate a concessionary rate with the AIIB for the sake of furthering peace and fighting climate change, a Chinese priority. He could also convincingly argue that this is one way for China to recirculate the some $3 trillion in reserves it has accumulated as a result of the trade surplus with the United States.Such an innovative approach to jobs, the border, China and climate change would seem likely to appeal to key members of Trump’s powerful inner circle as well as his broader associates. His daughter, Ivanka, after all, ushered in Al Gore for a high profile meeting with the president-elect at Trump Tower and is said to want to make climate change a priority of whatever portfolio she ends up having in a new administration.

And while it’s true that they give substantial amounts of money to this candidate and that, and they spent a ton of dough on television ads supporting he-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned, the fact is that the NRA’s real success on the legislative playing field is due not to what is spent, but what is not. At the federal level, most of the NRA’s lobbying activity consists of shooting down gun bills promoted by the other side. And the funny thing about increasing gun regulations, such as expanding background checks to cover private sales, for example, is that someone has to foot the bill. The gun owner who wants to give a gun to his son or sell it to a neighbor or friend has to pay a gun dealer to do the requisite paperwork and background check; the FBI will have to hire more staff to respond to the increased volume of NICS calls; the ATF will want to increase the number of agents because the dealers whose stores they inspect will have many more transactions on their books.Like it or not, most schemes to regulate anything, not just guns, live or die based on the ability of the relevant government agencies to ensure through enforcement that the new regulations are being followed and kept. When Nixon dropped the speed limit to 55 mph in 1974, it was estimated that gasoline consumption declined by a whole, big 1 percent because most states ignored the rule and drivers were rarely, if ever ticketed for exceeding the new limit on speed. But guns are already a highly-regulated industry, so additional regulations would be enforced.The real political clout of the NRA is felt at the state level because this is where the entire licensing procedure for gun ownership takes place. Thirteen states require a pre-purchase permit requirement for hand guns, long guns or both which means finding the time and money to process such transactions; carrying a concealed weapon is now legal everywhere but requires some kind of permit in 44 of the 50 states. Again, the issuing authority for these licenses needs to spend money to get the job done.Take a look at laws which the NRA is promoting at the state level, again and again such laws would cost nothing at all. Texas is now the eighth state to allow students to bring concealed guns onto college campuses, a law that might make a college administrator decide to hire some more security, but it won’t be at the taxpayer’s expense. Back in 2014 Georgia passed a ‘guns everywhere’ law which opened bars, restaurants, churches and just about every other public place to those hardy souls who just can’t walk around without their guns. Did this law require an uptick in the state budget bottom line? Not one bit.A recent study from three researchers at the Harvard Business School tracked state legislative responses to mass shootings from 1999 through 2014. What they found was that after a mass shooting, laws that loosened gun restrictions increased in Republican-controlled state governments by 75 percent, no comparable activity for tightening gun restrictions in states with blue governments was found. I’m not sure that I entirely buy their research because Connecticut, New York and Maryland all passed restrictive gun laws after Sandy Hook, but all three laws mandated new regulations which could only become effective with enforcement at every turn.Going forward, Gun-sense Nation will have to tread carefully when it comes to advocating new gun regulations which bear any cost. Because we are clearly entering a time when ‘tax relief’ and ‘downsizing government’ will be the orders of the day. And since most laws cost money to enforce, this puts Gun-nut Nation in the driver’s seat because they don’t want any gun laws at all."

If we are really honest with each other, we have to acknowledge that Democrats accidentally contributed to dividing the country, and the president-elect saw it as an opportunity.Yes, our party clearly has a problem connecting with working-class Americans. But it was much more than that, and if we think that was our only problem we will continue to lose elections we shouldn’t lose. Democrats fell in love with the idea that winning elections was a matter of talking to voters about the one issue we think impacts them, instead of our plan to move the country forward as a whole. Too many people believed that all we had to do was find the right set of messages to motivate the right blend of voters to go to the polls, and the result was going to be a lot of wins for a long time. It turns out that dividing the country into so many little segments can actually contribute to dividing the country for real. When Democrats concede the idea that some voters are not our voters, we shouldn’t be surprised when those voters agree. Imagine two lawyers standing in front of a jury for closing arguments. The first lawyer spends 10 minutes arguing passionately for his client. The second lawyer – with the whole jury listening – goes juror by juror individually explaining why they personally benefit from a verdict for his side. Also, the second lawyer has obviously chosen to skip a couple jurors that seem less amenable to his client. I’m not saying we should stop talking about issues that directly affect specific groups more than others. In fact, I’m saying the opposite: We should passionately make our case about these exact issues with everyone rather than just the Americans most affected by them. And as long as we have a unifying vision of a country that rewards everyone willing to work toward the American dream, voters will listen.Voters are smart. They know the difference between a Democratic Party that wants their vote and a Democratic Party that believes in making their life better. They’ll forgive you for pushing a policy they don’t like as long as they believe you’re doing it because you genuinely believe it’s what’s best for the country.We want everyone who is willing to work to have a chance at the American dream. And we can’t make that a reality if we aren’t talking about minimum wage, women’s health care, LGBT equality, social justice, criminal justice reform, organized labor, sensible gun laws, saving our environment, or any other issue to everyone instead of micro-targeting the message depending on the audience. We can talk about all of that in every part of this country if we make clear our overarching desire to put the American Dream back within reach for everyone.In the past four years, I’ve run statewide in Missouri twice. I won once and lost once, always substantially outperforming the top of the Democratic ticket by wide margins in a pretty red state. When I lost in November, I received 225,000 more votes than our presidential ticket and held the incumbent to under 50 percent. I was able to do that because I made an argument for progressive ideas rather than apologizing for the letter next to my name on the ballot or running a conservative campaign.I told audiences that black lives matter in Ferguson, but I did the same in rural areas. I stood up for an increase in the minimum wage no matter whether I was at a union hall or a local chamber of commerce. In each case, I’ve been unafraid to tell voters why lifting up people they don’t know lifts them up too. They may not all agree with me every time, but they know I mean it and they know I care about everyone, including them.I whole-heartedly believe that progressive policies are best for the entire country. I whole-heartedly believe that having a Democrat in the White House is better for the lives of every single American no matter their wealth, their geography, their race or their religion. And, essentially, that’s the argument I made in my campaign. And I darn near won with that strategy in a red state that Donald Trump carried by 19 percent.As Democrats consider the way forward as a party out of power, my humble suggestion is this: Let’s start by being unafraid to make our argument to everyone. I’m not interested in conceding a single voter to the Republicans. Let’s never again focus on getting enough voters to win. Let’s get back to trying to win every single vote. My experience as a progressive in a red state has taught me this: Voters will forgive you for disagreeing with them on something so long as they know you are genuine in your belief and that they are included in your vision for the country. Democrats need to get back to doing that again.Jason Kander is Missouri’s Secretary of State and was a Democratic nominee for Senate in 2016."

For Trump, the real culprit isn’t the Russian president or his hackers. It’s computers and technology. “I think we ought to get on with our lives,” Trump said Wednesday, according to the pool report. He was at his Mar-a-Lago resort, standing next to boxing promoter Don King. “I think that computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on. We have speed, we have a lot of other things, but I’m not sure we have the kind the security we need. But I have not spoken with the senators and I will certainly will be over a period of time.”U.S. intelligence agencies have been clear in saying that they have a pretty good idea of what’s going on. The FBI, CIA and the director of national intelligence have agreed that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections to help Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Intelligence officials also recently told NBC News that they have “a high level of confidence” that Putin himself was involved in the covert operation.“There will be bipartisan sanctions coming that will hit Russia hard, particularly Putin as an individual,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Wednesday.When asked directly about Graham’s suggestion about sanctions on Putin, Trump replied Wednesday, “I don’t know what he’s doing. I haven’t spoken to Sen. Graham. ... [A]s you know, he ran against me.”Although a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called for a special select panel to probe cyber-warfare threats from Russia and other U.S. adversaries, including Iran and China, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has insisted any investigation will stay within the Senate Intelligence Committee. Trump has long had a cozy relationship with Putin, going out of his way to praise him during the campaign and resisting joining the chorus of criticism over Russia’s involvement in the elections. He has said the idea that Russia tried to help him win was “ridiculous.”“Nobody really knows, and hacking is very interesting,” he said on “Fox News Sunday” earlier this month. “Once they hack, if you don’t catch them in the act you’re not going to catch them. They have no idea if it’s Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace. I mean, they have no idea.”During the presidential campaign, emails from the Democratic National Committee and the private account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, were hacked and released on WikiLeaks. The DNC emails, in particular, caused turmoil within the party as supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), citing exchanges in the released emails, accused party officials of tipping the scales for Clinton during the primary campaign. Trump rarely, if ever, uses computers, and despite his savviness with social media, it’s not clear he understands much about how they work.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

66,POLITICS,Israeli Settler Colonialism Is The Obstacle To Peace,"Andrew Meyer, ContributorPolicy Analyst, The Rachel Corrie Foundation",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/israeli-settler-colonialism-is-the-obstacle-to-peace_us_58655b30e4b04d7df167d358,As Israel chooses increased self-isolation in response to rightful condemnation from the UN Security Council and John Kerry,2016-12-29,<p>The Hagana (Zionist militia) force Palestinians out of Haifa at gunpoint in May 1948.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5865611415000029019165b9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Israel chooses increased self-isolation in response to rightful condemnation from the UN Security Council and John Kerry attempts to resurrect a two-state solution, we must remember that the scope of the Israeli settler colonial project is not limited to its settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.Israeli settlements are, in one word, imposing. They assert the will of the Israeli government upon an occupied Palestinian land and its population, commanding control over facts on the ground – the allocation and use of resources, freedom of movement, land ownership. Their geographical placement and architecture contribute to this imposing nature. As I traveled between Beit Sahour, Bethlehem, and Beit Jala during my first trip to Palestine years ago, the settlements of Har Homa and Gilo, which house more than 65,000 illegal settlers, dominated the panorama. High rise apartments built upon the hilltops, the lights shining through unshuttered windows at night made the compounds look foreign and invasive, like spaceships hovering over Palestinian territory.These settlements are also illegal under international law and, in a move last week that took many by surprise, the United States refused to veto United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemns continued settlement construction. The move was not entirely unprecedented, as previous Democratic and Republican administrations have wielded their power at the UN to condemn Israeli settlements for decades. The abstention was unprecedented for the Obama administration, however, which has consistently shielded Israel from critical UN resolutions over the past eight years.Predictably, Israel has taken the only route available to a country drowning in the perils of exclusivist ethno-nationalism, a disposition that has been perpetually stoked by Benjamin Netanyahu in his quest to construct and maintain the most far-right government in Israeli history. The path is one of severe self-isolation, creating an absurd parallel universe where Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev asserts that “the Americans...were never our friends” and Netanyahu warns New Zealand’s foreign minister that their support for the resolution amounts to a “declaration of war.”But Israel has a much larger problem in relation to its international legitimacy, one that the state has, since its founding, obsessively labored to obfuscate. That is, Israel is a settler colonial state, and not just because it builds settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.As the late Patrick Wolfe reminded us, settler colonial invasion is a structure, not an event. Israeli settler colonialism cannot be reduced to Minister of Education Naftali Bennett’s rhetoric about annexing the West Bank or the announcement of a new settlement bloc in East Jerusalem. The genesis of Israeli settler colonial invasion dates back to decades before the first “settlement” – as we commonly conceive of them today – was constructed. The state’s very existence is necessarily accompanied, as all settler projects are, by a legacy of foundational violence. The ethnic cleansing carried out by Zionist forces during the early twentieth century displaced at least 750,000 Palestinians and destroyed more than 400 of their villages. This is to say that, when the latest UN resolution notes that the Security Council wishes to “[reaffirm] the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force,” it is imperative to also recognize the territory acquired through the force leveled by Zionist militias in the lead up to Israel’s declaration of independence in 1948.Once declared, the primary goal of the settler colonial state is supersession, where the newly imposed settler structure becomes a de facto hegemonic order, replacing that which is indigenous through the elimination of the native. When Israel defends its “right” to build settlements on what is left of Palestinian territory, it expands the explicit face of its settler project while beclouding the deeper settler colonial roots that can be found within “Israel proper.” In other words, as dictated by the mainstream discourse, Tel Aviv is not a settlement because Ma’ale Adumim is. But the two must be seen in a continuum, for as Israel’s first prime minister David Ben-Gurion wrote to his son in 1937, “[A] Jewish state on only part of the land is not the end but the beginning...We shall organize an advanced defense force – a superior army which I have no doubt will be one of the best...At that point I am confident that we would not fail in settling in the remaining parts of the country…We must expel [the] Arabs and take their place.”It is also this settler colonial reality that renders the most commonly prescribed political process for negotiated peace in the region completely impotent. The Peace Process purports to seek the establishment of a Palestinian state while Israeli settler colonialism explicitly denies that possibility. To speak plainly, there is no room for a viable and sovereign Palestinian state within the Zionist – and now Israeli – political imaginary. It cannot exist. The two-state solution is not dead; it was, in fact, never alive. As such, Secretary of State John Kerry’s anachronistic warnings of the potential demise of the two-state solution, such as those he issued again in his speech on Wednesday, amount to little more than an American effort to avoid the eventual blame of history books for the failure of negotiations.The Oslo Accords offer a perfect glimpse into this dynamic. Considered far and wide as the most hopeful and potentially productive moment in the annals of the Peace Process, the Declaration of Principles have been hailed for decades as an astonishing breakthrough in the Palestinian-Israeli impasse. But what has come of these agreements? For more than two decades since their signing, every final status issue – refugees, Jerusalem, borders, settlements – has been deferred, while security and economic arrangements meant to buttress Israel’s position of strength have remained the center of attention. Life for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip continues under a complete military blockade that has rendered the territory in danger of becoming uninhabitable by 2020. The Israeli settler population in the West Bank and East Jerusalem has nearly tripled. This is all to say that, two decades after the shining moment of the Peace Process, we have never been farther away from the establishment of a Palestinian state.Yes, international condemnation of the current phase of the Israeli settlement enterprise is important, but a substantial challenge to this reality cannot stop at a UN resolution. The possibility of a political settlement is bleak not because the situation is “complicated” or because of Palestinian intransigence, but precisely because settler colonialism is particularly and staunchly resistant to decolonization efforts. If Kerry and his cohort truly wish to help reach a just peace in historic Palestine, the effort must be toward the comprehensive dismantlement of this system of settler domination. Perpetual calls for segregation within a nationalist framework while ignoring the ills of Israeli settler colonialism will continue to reap exactly what the Peace Process has produced in the past two-and-a-half decades: precisely nothing."

It was not clear if he will be able to immediately overturn the measures announced on Thursday.The Russian diplomats would have 72 hours to leave the United States, the official said. Access to the two compounds, which are used by Russian officials for intelligence gathering, will be denied to all Russian officials as of noon on Friday, the senior U.S. official added.“These actions were taken to respond to Russian harassment of American diplomats and actions by the diplomats that we have assessed to be not consistent with diplomatic practice,” the official said.The State Department has long complained that Russian security agents and traffic police have harassed U.S. diplomats in Moscow, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has raised the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov.“By imposing costs on the Russian diplomats in the United States, by denying them access to the two facilities, we hope the Russian government reevaluates its own actions, which have impeded the ability and safety of our own embassy personnel in Russia,” the official said.The U.S. official declined to name the Russian diplomats who would be affected, although it is understood that Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, will not be one of those expelled.(Reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Yara Bayoumy and Alistair Bell)"

Paula White spent much of the 2016 presidential campaign convincing evangelicals to vote for Trump, assuring them that he “accepts Jesus as his Lord and savior,” she told Politico. Now she’ll be praying with Trump at his inauguration.But the popular pastor, who Trump originally became smitten with after seeing her preach on television, has some issues of her own. White is often criticized for preaching the “prosperity gospel,” which suggests that God is happiest when his followers are rich, The Daily Beast points out. She’s even written a sermon titled “Why God Wants You Wealthy” (it costs money to download).And if being rich is an indicator of holiness, White must be in His good graces. White told Politico she was once worth “millions,” and her business practices suggest she knows how to handle money while manipulating her followers.In 2007, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) launched a congressional probe into the spending habits of White’s ministry, along with five other pastors. Grassley had questions regarding the televangelists’ use of church-owned airplanes and luxury homes. The Senate inquiry was eventually dropped, in part because White refused to cooperate with investigators.Years later, White declared bankruptcy on the church she initially ran with her then-husband that had been the subject of the probe, Politico reported.But whatever fortune she’s amassed has been in large part to her followers, who give her money to get in God’s good graces. On her website, she refers to sending money as giving a “seed” to the almighty Himself:I feel impressed of the Lord to ask you to do something that I believe will create a memory in the mind of God and this will change your future. I want you to give a seed offering that I call a “Gratitude” seed. This is an extremely powerful seed for you… especially at this time in your life. This seed will do two things for you. It’s a tactic that other religious leaders frown upon. Earlier this year, Southern Baptist leader and Trump critic Russell Moore tweeted out his distaste of White, Politico reported.“Paula White is a charlatan and recognized as a heretic by every orthodox Christian, of whatever tribe,” the tweet read.White denied the assertion that she’s only trying to grift money in an interview with the publication.“Do I believe that God is a sugar daddy? Not at all,” White said.The recommended “seed” amount on her website is $115. "

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-sanctions-russia-over-election_us_586560e7e4b0d9a5945a9b3a,"With Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell welcoming the move, it would be politically difficult for Donald Trump to reverse it.",2016-12-29,"A billboard featuring pictures of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Danilovgrad, Montenegro, on Nov. 16, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586582861900002a000e21bf.jpeg?ops=crop_0_9_3583_2352%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama sanctioned Russian officials and entities on Thursday in response to Moscow’s reported hacking during the U.S. presidential election.“All Americans should be alarmed by Russia’s actions,” the president said in a statement.In addition to hitting two Russian intelligence agencies, three companies and four individual intelligence officers with sanctions banning them from travel and business with U.S. companies or individuals, Obama ordered 35 Russian operatives posted at diplomatic facilities in Washington and San Francisco to leave. The president asked the State Department to bar Russians from entering two Russian-owned compounds in Maryland and New York that were used to gather intelligence, according to his statement. And Obama’s Treasury Department barred U.S. business with two Russians accused of cyber-theft of money and data.Obama left the door open for further action, including a potential cyberattack on Russia. “We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized,” he stated.If Russia is not deterred now, the Obama administration believes it will continue to interfere in U.S. elections, as well as elections in U.S.-friendly countries, officials told reporters in a call. One official described Russian government actions against U.S. diplomats posted in Russia as part of the country’s “flagrant violation of diplomatic norms.”Obama’s successor, president-elect Donald Trump, has cast doubt on the U.S. intelligence community’s pre-election declaration that Russia was responsible for unearthing and releasing Democratic National Committee communications damaging to Trump’s opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Following Trump’s victory, leaks to The Washington Post revealed that many intelligence officials ― including the leaders of the FBI and the CIA ― believe Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized the hacks to aid Trump, who has previously praised the Russian leader. On Wednesday, Trump said it was time to “move on” and repeated that he believes it’s impossible to know who targeted Clinton.In a statement Thursday, the president-elect said he would meet with intelligence officials next week to discuss the issue, but said he still wanted the matter to be left in the past.“It’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,” Trump said Thursday.But Obama appears committed to proving Russia’s responsibility despite the denials from Trump and the Kremlin. His administration wants Congress to receive intelligence reports that lay out the evidence before Trump enters office and is able to call off such investigations.“I would never expect Russia to come out with their hands up and acknowledge they did it,” an official said on the Thursday call. “They still deny that they are intervening in eastern Ukraine.”The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI tried to bolster their case to the public on Thursday by releasing a 13-page joint report providing some details of what the agencies know about the Russian actions. The report cites “technical indicators” that the hacking was tied to Russian civilian and military intelligence services. It adds that in some cases, the Russian actors “masqueraded as third parties, hiding behind false online personas designed to cause the victim to misattribute the source of the attack.”Actors “likely associated” with Russian civilian and military intelligence services “are continuing to engage in spearphishing campaigns,” and launched one attack “just days after the U.S. election,” the report stated.The government also released a list of IP addresses associated with the alleged Russian activity, including addresses based in the U.S., Mexico, Puerto Rico, Germany, Vietnam, Canada, Thailand, South Korea, Spain, China, Denmark, the U.K., Luxembourg and Russia.The report does not go into detail about how the U.S. determined that the Russian government was involved. But senior U.S. officials said there was “no debate” within the intelligence community that Russia interfered in the election. This wasn’t a “he-said-she-said” situation, one official said. Instead, the official added, there are facts, and then there’s what Russia said.Officials said they plan to release another public report with more details on the findings before Obama leaves office.The independent cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike has conducted its own analysis and concluded that the Russian military intelligence agency now under sanctions, the GRU, was behind the attack on the Democratic National Committee.The Intercept reported Thursday morning that the National Security Agency has successfully tracked Russian hacking in the past; its capabilities may be the key to the intelligence community’s confidence in Russia’s meddling.“These data theft and disclosure activities could only have been directed by the highest levels of the Russian government,” Obama said on Thursday. “Moreover, our diplomats have experienced an unacceptable level of harassment in Moscow by Russian security services and police over the last year. Such activities have consequences.”Putin’s spokespeople attacked the Obama team in personal terms, calling them “losers” and promising retaliation.The president’s actions are occurring under executive order, so it is possible that Trump could undo them once he’s in office. But Obama’s team believes their framing of the issue would make such a step highly embarrassing for the new president. “If a future president decided he wanted to allow in a large tranche of Russian intelligence agents, presumably a future president could do that,” an Obama aide said. “We don’t think it would make much sense to reopen Russian intelligence compounds ... we don’t think it makes much sense to invite back in Russian intelligence agents.”Trump would also face strong political opposition if he attempted to soften Obama’s approach. Many on Capitol Hill, including Republicans, are keen to signal toughness against Moscow.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) issued a statement commending Obama’s plan soon after the president announced it. “Russia does not share America’s interests. In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world,” he said, though he criticized the president’s past handling of Moscow.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) praised the move as well.Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff (Calif.), praised the actions as well.“We can never know if the Russian dirty tricks campaign was decisive in tipping the outcome of the presidential election, but make no mistake ― Putin’s real target was not the Clinton campaign or one political party, but our entire system of governance,” Schiff said.German officials have been warning for months that Russia may interfere with its own elections, which will be held next year, and the Obama administration officials on Thursday’s call said they worried that U.S. allies are already in Moscow’s crosshairs.Schiff suggested further sanctions may be necessary, echoing Republican Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.), who praised Obama’s actions Thursday and said they are looking at further punishments for Moscow.The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House informed them of the move earlier in the day, CBS reported.Sam Levine contributed reporting.This story has been updated with Mitch McConnell’s stance on the sanctions, as well as a statement from Vladimir Putin’s spokespeople and Trump’s Dec. 29 statement."

And a year like 2015, highlighted by marriage equality brought to the entire nation, was certainly one that would be met with fierce political backlash — and we saw that beginning to play out before the end of that historic year.But what happened in 2016 represents a much more malevolent and sinister outcome of that backlash. We saw that the forces of hate we’d thought we’d beaten back can rise up in an instant. We saw that these forces could inspire a horrific mass shooting, or help to prop up a populist leader promising to “make America great again” — which, in the eyes of many of his followers, means a return to the days before LGBTQ people were out of the closet.The election of Donald Trump ― coupled with the GOP’s control of both chambers of Congress ― threatens minorities, gender equality and the very stability of our democracy. And we see that even the gains or positive developments for LGBT rights that occurred this year — and in years past — can be swept away by the Trump administration and a Republican party that is drunk on power, at both the federal level and in the states. So much of what happened this year does in fact hinge on Trump ― and how we take on his administration and the GOP.It’s a wake-up call for a new generation of queer people. This year will be remembered as one that challenged us all to use our collective power to beat back oppression, as we have in decades past. We know from our experience and our queer history that hate sometimes wins. And we know that we’re resilient and that we have no option but to fight it off. And we will.The year’s impact on LGBTQ people began with the death of Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia in February. A force on the court for 30 years, Scalia was among the most homophobic justices to ever serve on the high court, blocking LGBT rights at every turn. He compared homosexuality to bestiality, incest and child pornography and believed that banning homosexuality was similar to banning murder. Scalia not only wrote a blistering, unhinged dissenting opinion in the historic marriage equality case in 2015, Orbergefell v. Hodges; he was virulently opposed to striking down sodomy laws, writing the dissenting opinion in the Lawrence v. Texas case in 2003, attacking the “law-profession culture” which he claimed had “signed on to the homosexual agenda.”Scalia’s death was a shock to liberals and conservatives alike. Certainly his absence from the high court brought the belief that the grip the far right had on the court could be released indefinitely. The hope by progressives was that we’d secure protections on so many issues, from the environment to abortion — and LGBTQ rights.But then the GOP-controlled Senate outrageously blocked President Obama from filling the vacancy, in a horrendous act of congressional overreach. Our only hope was for Hillary Clinton to win the election. But that didn’t happen. And now Trump is set to replace Scalia with someone “in the mold” of the late justice, as Trump described. And Trump may replace one or two other justices, dramatically altering the court and civil rights in ways that are unfathomable. The future of anti-LGBTQ employment discrimination, transgender equality, religious exemptions for those who discriminate and even marriage equality hangs in the balance.North Carolina’s legislature held a special session in March to pass the infamous Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, otherwise known as HB2, which Republican governor Pat McCrory signed and which has been described as the most anti-LGBTQ bill in American history. The bill, Republicans said, was inspired by their anger at the city of Charlotte for passing a wide-reaching ordinance which included protections for transgender people in public accommodations, including rest rooms. But HB2 went much further than responding to Charlotte’s actions.The bill rescinded not just all local LGBTQ ordinances in cities and localities across the state protecting LGBTQ people in housing and employment, but it prevented municipalities from deciding upon a local minimum wage, passing child labor ordinances, or passing laws protecting city workers. The most infamous part of the bill regulates which rest room transgender people may use in a public building, mandating that individuals only use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the how their gender is defined on their birth certificates.It was heartening to see an uproar across the country, from leaders in other states, and among big business and prominent college sports programs. Businesses moved out of the state or canceled plans to relocate there, as the NBA, NCAA and other sports programs important to North Carolina’s economy and culture left the state throughout the spring and summer. And the action eventually cost McCrory re-election in November, when he lost by a slim margin to North Carolina’s Democratic state attorney general Roy Cooper even as Donald Trump took North Carolina with by a 3 point margin.But by the end of the year, after the election, it seemed that advocates and supporters of LGBTQ rights began to cave to pressure. In December Charlotte rescinded its local ordinance in a deal that Roy Cooper and Democrats had negotiated to have HB2 repealed, a deal some LGBTQ activists opposed, saying that HB2’s repeal should not come at the cost of protections in Charlotte. But then the GOP outrageously didn’t even keep its end of the bargain. After calling a special session supposedly to repeal HB2, legislators ended the heated session with HB2 still in place, while Charlotte had rescinded protections, leaving LGBT North Carolinians in a more dire situation than ever.The enemies of LGBTQ rights, looking at the success in rescinding Houston’s Human Rights Ordinance in 2015 and the passage of HB2,  began pressuring Republicans across the country in state houses and at the federal level throughout 2016, pushing over 100 anti-LGBTQ bills ― including everything from marriage-related defense bills to first amendment defense acts to bathroom bills.After his nomination was held up for eight months by Senate Republicans, Eric Fanning was confirmed as the first openly gay Army Secretary in May. It was an historic moment for President Obama’s powerful actions in advancing LGBTQ equality in the military, beginning with the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” in 2010.As MSNBC reported last May, “A slate of senators from both parties joined in the praise for Fanning. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, tweeted that Fanning’s selection is ‘an historic moment for #LGBT servicemembers,’ while Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, tweeted that he ‘appreciated (Fanning’s) recognition of Alaska’s strategic importance & need for larger @USArmy.’”But after serving less than a year, Fanning was set to be replaced by Trump with another billionaire among the billionaires and multimillionaires Trump chose as nominees for his cabinet. It wasn’t lost on activists that the anti-LGBTQ Family Research Council, which had condemned Fanning’s confirmation as a “cultural land mine” — and which endorsed Trump’s candidacy after he made promises to evangelical groups — is well represented among members of the Trump transition team, led by anti-LGBTQ Vice President-elect Mike Pence. It seemed to be another sign that Trump, even if he tried to present himself as more supportive of gays, knew to whom he had to give payback.President Obama’s administration issued an historic directive on the treatment of transgender students, specifically describing how transgender students should be allowed to use the restroom and facilities that conform to their gender identity.“No student should ever have to go through the experience of feeling unwelcome at school or on a college campus,” John B. King Jr., the secretary of the Department of Education, said in a statement. “We must ensure that our young people know that whoever they are or wherever they come from, they have the opportunity to get a great education in an environment free from discrimination, harassment and violence.”Predictably, the directive, issued in May, caused an uproar among anti-LGBTQ conservatives. Texas and a dozen other states filed a lawsuit against the administration, claiming it was an example of government overreach. In August, a federal district court judge in Texas put a temporary hold on the directive, a blow to the administration ― and to transgender students ― as the lawsuit proceeds.Now, the directive faces opposition under a Trump administration. Trump’s choice for education secretary is Michigan billionaire Betsy DeVos, who has been a long-time opponent of LGBTQ rights and a contributor with her husband, Amway heir Richard DeVos Jr., of millions of dollars to groups like the National Organization for Marriage and Focus on the Family, which promotes “conversion therapy.” LGBTQ-inclusive anti-bullying programs pioneered by the Obama administration could be threatened, as could the transgender directive. And Vice-President Elect Mike Pence, during a campaign stop, promised that he and Trump would end the transgender directive, saying, “Washington has no business intruding on the operation of our local schools.”Transgender rights headed to the Supreme Court in October when the high court decided to take the case involving Gavin Grimm, a 17-year-old Virginia student who has been in a years-long battle with his high school over bathroom access, as he has been banned from using the boys’ rest room. In April, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals had overturned a lower court ruling, ordering the school to allow Grimm access to the boys’ rest room. The school board appealed to the Supreme Court.“I hope they say we don’t want to hear this case,” Grimm told The Huffington Post before the high court’s announcement. “I’ll be able to take a nice big deep breath and feel like I have my life – to some extent – back. It’s felt very much like it’s been put on hold for this case.”But the high court not only took the case; it first stayed the appellate court decision pending its own decision to take the case. With a Supreme Court with only eight members, many are wondering about the court’s choice to take the case, and if it will wait until it has a ninth member before scheduling arguments. Whatever the outcome, many are hopeful that transgender youth are beginning to get the attention they rightly deserve. And though Grimm never sought the spotlight, he’s become a hero to many transgender youth, named this year to Time magazine’s list of 30 most influential teens in America. In June, Pride Month, our souls were crushed when 49 people, most of them queer people of color, were brutally executed by a gunman filled with homophobic rage, who also wounded 53 people. The massacre at the LGBT Pulse nightclub in Orlando was the largest mass shooting in modern American history. We were numb trying to grapple with this hate crime, coming to terms with the reality of the danger we face every day. We think we’ve created safe spaces away from the homophobia and transphobia we face only to see those spaces violently invaded. More than that, we saw the indifference of Republican politicians who wouldn’t even mention that the victims were LGBTQ until pressured, and even Hollywood celebrities who refrained from offering support because it was perhaps too political.We also witnessed the media, and Donald Trump, distorting the killer’s motivations and playing up the fact that the gunman was Muslim — and thus somehow connected to foreign terrorism, pitting queer people against Muslims — even though the assailant grew up in this country, on homophobia nurtured here, and had no actual ties to international terrorism. The tragic event underscored how much work we have to do in educating the public, as we also deal with the grief and the loss.The Pentagon lifted its ban on transgender people serving openly in the military. It was a glorious moment last summer that came after years of pressure by transgender activists and allies, and four years after Congress repealed the ban on gay, lesbian and bisexual people serving openly. (”Don’t ask, don’t tell” had been written into law by Congress, while the ban on transgender people serving openly was simply a Pentagon regulation that could be ended at any time by the executive branch.) It also was another measure of the enormous strides for LGBTQ rights under the Obama administration, and, in Obama’s second term, particularly for transgender Americans, a group that has been the most marginalized among LGBTQ people.Again, however, there’s much trepidation about implementation and integration of the military — for all queer service members — as Trump’s National Security Advisor pick, Lt. General Michael Flynn, mocked transgender people in the military during his speech at the Republican convention. Trump’s Defense Secretary nominee, General James N. Mattis, has hinted at his own possible hostility, having written in a book that it’s dangerous when civilian leaders’ “progressive agenda” imposes “social change” on the military.Much of President Obama’s and our hard-fought progress on LGBTQ rights was suddenly under threat in November, after Donald Trump won in a bitter, hate-filled election. There were many warnings about what he might do regarding LGBTQ rights― even as tried to present himself as more supportive of the community, including using the initialism “LGBTQ” at he Republican convention, in what many saw as an empty gesture  ― and looking at his cabinet choices now, it’s a who’s who of enemies of queer people.Some years are about learning lessons, and in 2016 we learned, in the most startling way, how fragile rights are. But there’s great hope for 2017 and beyond as we come together, now with so many more allies and resources, and approaching rights in an intersectional way. So many groups will feel the brunt of Trump’s brutality, and many LGBTQ people are members of several of those groups. Together we’re a powerful force.We’ve always thrived and fought back fiercely when we’ve woken up to the stark reality of the oppression we still face. This moment will be no different."

A body camera pilot project was launched in January 2015.A number of high-profile misconduct incidents, most notably the release in 2015 of a video of the fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald by white officer Jason Van Dyke, has thrust Chicago into a national debate over police use of force, particularly within minority communities. The U.S. Justice Department is conducting the probe of the department.“Body cameras, while not a panacea, are a win-win for officers and the public,” Emanuel said in a statement. “They provide a firsthand look at the dangerous situations officers encounter on a daily basis, and improve transparency while building trust.”The union representing Chicago police officers voiced displeasure over the lack of communication about the accelerated rollout of the cameras.The union would prefer a broader range of footage released so the public also sees video showing mistreatment of officers, union president Dean Angelo Sr said in a telephone interview.“We don’t see the encounters that are challenging, disrespectful and borderline illegal, threatening someone in uniform just because they are in uniform,” he said.At a Wednesday demonstration, police Commander Marc Buslik said he was most concerned with the cameras invading the privacy of crime victims or bystanders during police encounters.Buslik could not detail the amount each police camera will cost the city since the accelerated plan was not originally in the 2017 budget, but said the mayor’s office had the funds to pay for it.All patrol officers will be trained to turn on body cameras whenever they make a personal encounter, he said. For those who do not, disciplinary action has yet to be determined.In July, a Chicago police officer killed a black teenager after he stole a car, but the fatal shots were not captured because a policeman’s body camera was not recording.(Editing by Ben Klayman and Matthew Lewis)"
77,POLITICS,Barack Obama's Pearl Harbor Speech Seen As Rebuke Of Trump World View,Ashley Alman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-pearl-harbor_us_5863ccc2e4b0d9a59459a097,The president urged unity in remarks that many saw as a thinly veiled shot at the president-elect.,2016-12-28,"President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe place wreaths at the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5863db871900002b000e1d48.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just weeks after the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe joined President Barack Obama at the USS Arizona Memorial. Abe is the first Japanese prime minister to visit the memorial, which marks the resting place of the over 1,000 U.S. service members who died in Japan’s surprise 1941 attack.The image of two world leaders joined in remembrance and reconciliation was both historic and symbolic. Obama emphasized how far U.S.-Japan relations have come during his remarks at the memorial on Tuesday. He lauded the nations for choosing “friendship” despite their history and called for inclusivity and measured judgment.“I hope that together, we send a message to the world that there is more to be won in peace than in war. That reconciliation carries more rewards than retribution,” he said. Some have interpreted Obama’s message on Tuesday as a thinly veiled shot at president-elect Donald Trump, whose campaign proposals included banning Muslims from entering the U.S. and building a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.“It is here that we remember that even when hatred burns hottest, the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward,” Obama said Tuesday at the memorial. “We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different.”On Wednesday, Trump hit back at Obama on Twitter for his “inflammatory” statements, though it’s unclear whether he was specifically responding to the president’s remarks at Pearl Harbor.Trump’s comments about defense spending during his campaign and his threat to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership could challenge relations between the U.S. and Japan. Obama has spent much of the transition attempting to smooth things over with foreign leaders worried about the president-elect’s remarks, and he has warned Trump to deal cautiously with leaders in China, Taiwan and Russia.“As nations, and as people, we cannot choose the history that we inherit. But we can choose what lessons to draw from it, and use those lessons to chart our own futures,” Obama said on Tuesday."

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Labor Secretary Tom Perez have not yet weighed in on the U.S. resolution.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586423791500002c0091630c.jpeg?cache=i4DpvbGHC6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Obama administration’s abstention from a United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem has engendered impassioned reaction from all corners of the political universe, save one.The candidates running to take over the Democratic National Committee have, so far, steadfastly avoided the topic, even as it divides their own party.A spokesperson for Labor Secretary Tom Perez told The Huffington Post that Perez wouldn’t be weighing in on the matter “given his role in the cabinet.” Several requests for comment sent over several days to Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) were not returned. A similar request to New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley went unanswered, while a statement from South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison notably avoided taking a position. “Supporters of a two-state solution may differ on the tactics that are most likely to bring it about. Where there are good-faith policy disagreements among Democrats, it is not the role of the DNC Chair to take sides,” Harrison said. “What I will do as DNC Chair is lead the charge where Democrats are united. Here, that means maintaining our support for a two-state solution and opposing any measures the Trump Administration may take to undermine Israel’s future as Jewish and democratic, principles which the President-elect appears to have minimal appreciation for.”That those seeking to become the public face ― if not the titular leader ― of the Democratic Party are conspicuously absent from the divisive debate illustrates just how fraught the topic has become within Democratic circles. President Barack Obama’s abstention at the U.N. has been touted by liberals as a much-needed, if not long overdue, implicit rebuke of a settlement policy that has complicated Israel-Palestine peace negotiations. On the flip side, elected officials and other establishment types have decried the decision to not block the U.N. resolution as an abandonment of Israel ― one that only hampers the prospects of peace by discouraging bilateral negotiations.“It is extremely frustrating, disappointing and confounding that the Administration has failed to veto this resolution. Whatever one’s views are on settlements, the U.N. is the wrong forum to settle these issues,” said incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)“Blaming Israel for the continuation of the conflict is not only wrong and unjust; it will also do nothing to move the parties closer to a peaceful and lasting solution,” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said in a statement. For Ellison and Perez ― the two front-runners for the DNC post ― the question is how to approach the topic, if at all. Ellison has already been forced to tread carefully on Israel policy due to past associations and comments on the peace process ― though some of those comments, such as warning that Israel risked becoming an apartheid state if settlement activity continued, were echoed in theory by Secretary of State John Kerry in his much-publicized Wednesday address.Perez’s position on the matter is vaguer, in part because he’s had limited involvement in foreign policy matters. But his institutional ties to Obama could create some friction, with donors and establishment figures pressuring Perez to adopt a stronger line.Both men can look to a recent occupant of the DNC chair post for a sense of just how difficult this topic can be for party leaders. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) often found herself in a painfully conflicted position on Obama administration Middle East policy. Though she did eventually endorse the president’s Iran nuclear accord, it was only after a difficult and lengthy period of consideration."

Pruitt now sits on the group’s board. The group, which keeps the identities of most of its donors secret, received $175,000 in 2014 from Freedom Partners, a business organization that organizes political activities for the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, who run the privately held chemical and oil giant Koch Industries. “Before the Senate votes to confirm you to run EPA, it is important that you provide a full disclosure of your relationship with the energy industry so we can determine how that will influence your ability to run the agency,” read a letter signed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Sen. Jeffrey Merkley (D-Ore.), Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Sen. Benjamin Cardin (D-Md.). The senators are all members of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), the committee’s chair who last year infamously displayed a snowball on the Senate floor as evidence of climate change being a hoax, derided the letter as a “baseless political stunt.” The Rule of Law Defense Fund denounced the letter as “partisan obstructionism” and called on Pruitt to dismiss it as having “no legal significance.”“Aside from disrespectfully lecturing you about the purpose of the agency you have been nominated to lead, and with which you are acutely familiar, the Democrats seek information about RLDF that they are not entitled to under the law, including confidential donor information,” Charles R. Spies and James E. Tyrrell III, lawyers representing the Rule of Law Defense Fund, wrote in a letter to Pruitt later on Wednesday. “The Democrats’ letter is transparently a partisan fishing expedition intended to smear your confirmation process and gin up fundraising support from radical, far-left environmentalist groups.”Pruitt’s ties to fossil fuel companies run deep, making him “too extreme,” the Denver Post declared in an editorial, to lead an agency tasked with defending the environment from polluters. He led the charge to block President Barack Obama from implementing his Clean Power Plan, a set of new EPA regulations aimed at cutting carbon emissions from utility companies. The 48-year-old once signed his name to a letter to the EPA, authored by lawyers of a major oil and gas company in his state, that criticized estimates on emissions from natural gas drilling sites. After publishing 84 pages of correspondence in 2014 between Pruitt and the company, Devon Energy, The New York Times called the communications evidence of an “unprecedented, secretive alliance that Mr. Pruitt and other Republican attorneys general have formed with some of the nation’s top energy producers to push back against the Obama regulatory agenda.” “We have been troubled that as Attorney General of Oklahoma you used, nearly verbatim, industry talking points in official correspondence your office sent to EPA concerning EPA’s estimation of methane pollution in your state,” the senators wrote in the letter. “Your relationship with the Rule of Law Defense Fund (the Fund) has received less attention but is no less troubling.”This year, Pruitt defended Exxon Mobil Corp. as it fought off Democratic state attorneys generals’ probes into its history of funding a disinformation campaign that questioned fossil fuels’ role in global warming. In May, he wrote an op-ed criticizing the attorneys general as a “climate-change gang” just three weeks after Exxon Mobil donated $50,000 to an association Pruitt led for two years, The Huffington Post reported last week. Pruitt is even suing to block an EPA rule to protect streams and wetlands under the 1972 Clean Water Act. “The confirmation process, starting with your responses to Committee questions before your hearing, is an opportunity for you to dispel the notion that the advocacy you have undertaken on environmental issues as Attorney General of Oklahoma has been directed by and for the benefit of the energy industry,” the senators wrote. “Accordingly, we look forward to your timely response to this request.”This story has been updated with comments from Sen. Jim Inhofe and the Rule of Law Defense Fund.Read the senators’ full letter below."

Bad news: You’ll have to live in it for one second longer.At 6:59:59 p.m. Eastern time on Dec. 31, 2016, we’ll have a “leap second,” where an extra second will be added to world clocks as an adjustment to keep time in sync with the Earth’s rotation relative to the sun.“Historically, time was based on the mean rotation of the Earth relative to celestial bodies and the second was defined in this reference frame,” explained Geoff Chester, a public affairs officer at the U.S. Naval Observatory, which announced the 2016 leap second in July.“However, the invention of atomic clocks defined a much more precise ‘atomic’ timescale and a second that is independent of Earth’s rotation,” he said.As a result, leap seconds have been added as needed at irregular intervals since 1972, to reconcile the difference between the two systems. A whopping 10 seconds were added to the clock that first year. While there’s a chance timekeepers may some day have to subtract a second, that has yet to happen.If we didn’t add leap seconds, eventually the celestial bodies would end up way out of whack with our Earthly timepieces. Per National Geographic, we’d face a two- to three-minute difference by 2100, and a full 30-minute discrepancy if we put off changing our clocks until 2700.Practically speaking, the additional second should have little effect on the average person’s day-to-day life, though it is critically important for many digital systems we’ve come to rely on, such as telecommunications. A leap second in July 2012, for instance, wreaked havoc on Reddit and a number of other websites including Gawker, Instagram, Pinterest and Netflix.Alternatively, we could just follow comedian Kumail Nanjiani’s advice and stay inside until the year meets its merciful end:"
