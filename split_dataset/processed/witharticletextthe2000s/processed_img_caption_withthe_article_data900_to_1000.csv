0,POLITICS,House Republicans Were Handed A Historic Opportunity. They're Blowing It.,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-trouble-governing-vacation_us_58e6aef4e4b0cdad578e49b9,"But from the GOP's angle, ""It's going great!""",2017-04-06,"Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) says that if the House Republicans want to solve the problems before them, ""they might as well talk to a few Democrats.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e6ccfa2c00006568ff2c25.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House lawmakers are heading out of town for two weeks with a health care bill in tatters, a government funding deadline looming, and a White House and congressional leadership apparently unable to find consensus or face reality. But, according to House Republicans, everything is just fine.“It’s going great! We’re making America great again,” Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) told The Huffington Post on Thursday when asked how things in the House were going.That appears to be the honest assessment of Republicans right now. They aren’t bothered by their inability to pass a health care bill, or by Trump or Speaker Paul Ryan’s sinking poll numbers, or by the unprecedented dollars flowing into Democratic candidates’ coffers. And they firmly believe that, yes, they will find agreement on health care. Any day now.“We’re making progress on all those things,” Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) said. “When you have a bill that’s not ready for prime time, the best thing for the American people is that we back up and get it right.”Time and again, Republicans praised leadership for slowing down the health care debate, and they insisted that no part of their agenda had slipped.Even Speaker Ryan (R-Wis.), who presented Republicans with a timeline at the beginning of the year that had them finished with their health care bill before the Easter break, said Republicans were still on schedule.“We have in our timeline lots of flexibility built in,” Ryan said. “You know why? Because we have to work with the United States Senate.”But all the flexibility on timing won’t account for the inflexibility of Ryan’s conference. Conservatives insist the GOP health care bill eliminate regulations that protect people with pre-existing conditions from being charged more for insurance. Moderates have said they can’t go along with that. And Republicans appear to have no way to break those disagreements.If Republicans really do insist on passing health care, it’s easy to see how their entire agenda could be foiled. There are only 47 legislative days before the August recess after House Republicans return from their April break. The omnibus spending bill will chew up the first week of the schedule. Then, if they somehow broke the logjam, they’d still have to debate and pass their health care bill. And then pass another budget ― which doesn’t look like it’ll be automatic ― so they can do tax reform. And then Republicans would actually have to do tax reform, an issue that has evaded Republicans arguably for the last 30 years.And they’re supposed to pass a massive infrastructure bill. And a defense supplement. And 12 appropriation bills.Things are certain to slip.Meanwhile, the White House already appears to be lashing out at Ryan, unable to accept that he and other congressional leaders can’t just make Republicans pass the health care bill.In the sense that Republicans aren’t being jammed into voting on a bill with a 17% approval rating, maybe lawmakers have a right to be encouraged.For Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Republicans pumping the brakes on their health care legislation is a good sign.“It’s weird to be worried about not rushing enough, which is what they seem to be worried about,” Amash said Thursday. “We should take our time with it.”But there’s still no evidence Republicans can bridge the divide in their conference on much of anything. Lawmakers appear no closer to passage than they were two weeks ago when GOP leaders pulled the health care bill from the floor, and members are heading back to their districts for two weeks. Presumably, dissatisfaction with what Republicans are discussing will further drive the conference away from a functional majority.One of the most noteworthy critics of Republicans has been reliable Republican Rep. Tom Rooney of Florida. He recently told The Atlantic that, if Republicans can’t accomplish something, then it’s hard to justify why they’re in power.“I’ve been here for eight years,” Rooney told HuffPost on Wednesday. “And for the Republican Party, we need to start passing bills that are positive, rather than just being an opposition or stopping things from happening.”Again, however, most Republicans haven’t given up hope on their health care bill.“Most people that I talk to realize that health care is the biggest problem in America,” freshman Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) said Thursday. “It was a problem before Obamacare. It’s gotten worse after Obamacare. And they realize it’s not going to be solved in a matter of a few weeks; it’s going to be a several month process.”One member who spoke on the condition he not be identified said that, although there were conservatives and other members who were “not happy” with Ryan, no one seemed to be talking about a coup.“It is not Paul Ryan’s fault at all,” Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) said. “This is just simply the process.”When Hice was asked at what point Republicans would start clamoring for leadership changes, he said, “We’re not at that point.”But reality is about to smack Republicans in the face.The odds of them actually repealing and replacing Obamacare look worse every day. When they return from their Easter break, they’ll have four legislative days to debate and pass an omnibus spending bill that no one has seen ― with obvious pitfalls all over the legislation. (Will the omnibus fund Planned Parenthood? Will it fund a border wall? How much money above previously set spending caps can Congress accept?)And, unlike the health care bill, Republicans need Democratic votes ― at least in the Senate ― to get a spending measure to President Donald Trump’s desk. If conservatives insist on funding the border wall and Democrats say no, who will blink first? And whose side will Trump be on?While there are easy criticisms you could make of Ryan, senior GOP aides were eager to point out that, ultimately, the GOP’s inability to get anything done was a reflection on Trump.“Despite what Paul Ryan’s detractors think, at the end of the day, this is Donald Trump’s Washington now,” one senior GOP aide said.“You can’t just come in 24 hours before a vote, make some phone calls and expect anything to change,” the aide continued, referring to the ill-fated health care bill.“Paul Ryan is the only thing holding this place together. It’s just one distraction after another.”One distraction has been Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his questionable Russia probe. After Nunes seemed to be coordinating with the White House, the California Republican stepped aside from leading the investigation on Thursday. Aides ask how those sorts of wounds are Ryan’s fault.For Democrats, the answer is easy: Everything is a reflection of the speaker.“They’re in the majority,” Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said Thursday. “Speaker Ryan is the speaker. So one would think if they want to get something done, they would lead to get something done. And that’s not what they’re doing.”Other Democrats were happy to pile on and point out how poorly things are going for House Republicans. “The definition of dysfunction” is how Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) described the House GOP conference.“They can’t govern,” said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.). “I mean, they may have more members of the House and more members of the Senate, but one thing they don’t have is a majority.”Democrats urged Republicans to reach across the aisle to work out legislation.“It’s not the House of Republicans; it’s the House of Representatives,” Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. “And if they want to solve these problems, they might as well talk to a few Democrats.”He added that the answer on health care was obvious: “If they want to deal with real problems, they can sit down with some of us. I see more of Speaker Ryan on TV than I do in the chamber.”But Republicans, miraculously, blame Democrats for not working with them. Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) said Thursday that it was difficult for Republicans to pass legislation because “you have the other side of the aisle that refuses to do anything whatsoever.”“Not an idea, nothing, not even a vote,” he continued.When it was pointed out that Republicans didn’t seek input from Democrats on the health care bill ― they literally hid the bill from their counterparts, adopted zero of their amendments and Ryan proudly said he didn’t want to work with the other side ― Bishop called it “cute spin.”“Our side did go. And they refused to do anything,” he said.Bishop implored Democrats to come up with a health care alternative, and he said it was one of the “sad elements” of the Affordable Care Act that Democrats didn’t come to them in 2010 when Congress was working through Obamacare.That line of attack doesn’t exactly square with reality. Democrats point out that President Barack Obama held summits with Republicans, Congress debated the health care bill for over a year and more than 100 Republican amendments were ultimately incorporated into the bill.Lee even suggested she was a little uncomfortable with how much Obama was asking for their ideas and incorporating their input. “Oftentimes I would just not have to say anything,” she said.There is a growing chorus of moderate Republicans who say Republicans should reach across the aisle. Tuesday Group Chairman Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) suggested on Wednesday that working with Democrats was the best path forward for health care, and Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) essentially said the same thing.That continues to be an option of last resort, however, partially because Republicans are holding out hope that they can come together and partially because leaders know it would further weaken them.That dynamic isn’t exactly new, but with the implosion of the health care bill, it’s maybe worse than ever. Still, aides didn’t think much had changed.When one senior GOP aide was asked for comment on this story, the aide shrugged it off.“Sounds like your story is a real barn burner, but the barn has been on fire for seven years now,” he said."

Beristain had visited a relative in the U.S. in 1998 and simply stayed in the country, where he met his wife, Helen. Immigration officials discovered he was undocumented in 2000, and ordered him to leave, but he opted to stay in the U.S. to be with his then-pregnant wife.Since then — for 17 years — Beristain has routinely checked in with ICE officials and has been informally permitted to stay in the U.S., even obtaining a Social Security card, driver’s license and work permit.

If they cannot undo Beristain’s removal order, he would have to remain outside of the U.S. while waiting for permission to reapply for a legal visa.“That process would generally take 1-2 years, during which time he’d be separated from his family,” Roth said."

5,THE WORLDPOST,Trump Says 'Something Should Happen' As U.S. Considers Military Response In Syria,Nick Robins-Early and Eline Gordts,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-tillerson-assad-syria_us_58e692efe4b05894715f1022,The White House is now embroiled in a debate over how to respond to this week's toxic gas attack.,2017-04-06,"US President Donald Trump speaks to the press on Air Force One on April 6, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e6bfe02c00006268ff2bef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Something should happen” in response to the deadly chemical attack in Syria, President Donald Trump said Thursday, two days after warplanes dropped toxic gas over the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun. In a separate statement, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said there was “no doubt” forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad were behind the attack, which killed at least 70 civilians, and added that he sees no role for Assad in Syria’s future. “There is no doubt in our minds, and the information we have supports that Syria, the Syria regime under the leadership of President Bashar al-Assad, are responsible for this attack,” Tillerson told reporters. Trump stopped short of calling for Assad’s removal on Thursday, but told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One, “I think what Assad did is terrible.”“I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity and he’s there, and I guess he’s running things, so something should happen,” he added.The Trump administration’s harsh condemnation of Assad and its ally Russia presented a marked shift in messaging. The White House’s reaction to the gas attack has also renewed discussion of the possibility of U.S. military action against Assad, a policy option that had moved to the background since former President Barack Obama decided against strikes targeting the regime following its previous use of sarin gas in 2013.The Pentagon and the White House are discussing a range of military options that could be pursued in response to the attack, according to Reuters, and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis is expected to brief the president on those this weekend at Mar-a-Lago. A U.S. official told the news service those options could include deploying cruise missiles and grounding Syrian military aircraft.Tillerson also urged Russia on Thursday to reconsider its support for the Syrian regime. “It is very important that the Russian government consider carefully their continued support for the Assad regime,” he said. Russia has supported Syria politically for years, and has been backing Assad militarily since September 2015. While Moscow indicated Thursday it would not support the Syrian president unconditionally, it has challenged the U.S.’ assessment that Syrian regime forces were behind this week’s chemical attack. Asked whether the U.S. would lead international efforts to remove the Syrian president, Tillerson replied that “steps are underway,” Peter Baker of The New York Times reported.Russia’s deputy U.N. envoy warned late on Thursday of “negative consequences” if the United States would decide to carry out a military strike in Syria. “We have to think about negative consequences, negative consequences, and all the responsibility if military action occurred will be on shoulders of those who initiated such doubtful and tragic enterprise,” Vladimir Safronkov told reporters.The U.S. does not currently have the legal authority to attack the Assad regime, and it’s not clear that Trump could get a war authorization from Congress. Even if he did, opening a military front against the Syrian government risks entangling Moscow.And if the U.S. did succeed in toppling Assad, he has no obvious U.S.-friendly successor ― in part because of Assad’s effort to decimate the moderate opposition so extremist groups are the only alternative to his rule.U.S. policy in Syria has, for years, primarily focused on attacking the self-described Islamic State and offering military support to Kurdish militias that are taking territory away from the extremist group. Hundreds of U.S. troops are currently in Syria to support an upcoming advance on the ISIS-held city of Raqqa. Until the gas attack on Tuesday, the Trump administration had begun openly acknowledging that it could possibly live with a Syria ruled by Assad. As recently as last week, Tillerson said in Turkey that the “longer-term status of President Assad will be decided by the Syrian people,” and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the United States’ “priority is no longer to sit there and focus on getting Assad out.”Like Tillerson, Haley shifted her rhetoric following the gas attack. On Wednesday, she vaguely suggested that the U.S. could take unilateral action if the United Nations failed to act, and condemned Russia’s support of Assad.This is a developing story and will be updated.Jessica Schulberg contributed reporting to this article."

8,POLITICS,Environmental Groups Take Trump EPA To Court To Force Ban Of Brain-Draining Pesticide,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/environmental-court-trump-epa-chlorpyrifos_us_58e65f0be4b0fe4ce08920c5,"“The Trump administration is not above the law — and we will not let them put our kids at risk.""",2017-04-06,"Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, speaks during an event in Texas last month.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e69d2016000020004d930a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Three environmental organizations have asked a federal appeals court to force the Environmental Protection Agency to ban a widely used pesticide linked to brain damage in children.A motion filed Wednesday by Earthjustice on behalf of two other organizations challenges EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s decision last week to reject the scientific findings of his own agency and allow chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide used on fruits, vegetables and nuts, to remain on the market for agricultural use. The groups asked the court to require EPA to ban the pesticide within 30 days.Patti Goldman, an Earthjustice attorney, told The Huffington Post that the Trump administration is failing to protect the public from a chemical its own scientists found to be dangerous.“If the head of the EPA isn’t respecting, following the law or the science, that will be of great concern across the board,” Goldman said. Earthjustice is representing the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Pesticide Action Network North America, which in 2007 petitioned the EPA to ban the chemical.“The Trump administration is not above the law — and we will not let them put our kids at risk,” Erik Olson, a senior attorney at NRDC, said in a statement. “The science is clear that this chemical is dangerous, yet Administrator Pruitt is ignoring findings from EPA’s own experts and brushing off the courts to keep it on the market.”In November 2015, under the Obama administration, the EPA proposed permanently banning the chemical on food crops, citing potential risks to human health. In announcing his reversal last week, Pruitt said the proposed ban relied largely on studies “whose application is novel and uncertain.” He called for additional study and claimed his decision was about “returning to using sound science in decision-making — rather than predetermined results.”Goldman said Pruitt is “obviously following the industry line on this.” Dow Chemical Co., which produces the insecticide, said it “remains confident that authorized uses of chlorpyrifos products offer wide margins of protection for human health and safety.”Chlorpyrifos, also known by its trade name Lorsban, is used in nearly 100 countries on more than 50 crops, including corn, soybeans, cranberries, apples, almonds and broccoli. It was largely banned for at-home use in the U.S. in 2000, but continues to be widely used on thousands of American farms. Even low-dose exposure to organophosphates, particularly in the womb, has been found to harm brain development in children, leading to higher risk of disorders like autism.Pruitt’s order has been met with a outrage from environmental groups, medical professionals and lawmakers.Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) this week requested all documents related to EPA’s decision, which Carper said “could undermine the trust the public has in the agency to keep its food, water and air safe.” And four Democratic members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote a letter to the committee’s chairman, Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), urging him to investigate.Pruitt’s decision, the congressmen wrote, “increases our concern that the Trump Administration is failing to properly implement the Food Quality Protection Act.” They added that the “action seems to be part of an emerging pattern” of ignoring health risks of pesticides.In an apparent attempt to quell the unrest, the EPA website posted a press release that includes numerous statements from agricultural entities praising Pruitt’s decision.

11,POLITICS,What Would Trump’s Deposal Mean For Democrats — And Are They Ready?,"Donna Kassin, ContributorPolitical Writer and Commentator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-would-trumps-deposal-mean-for-democrats-and_us_58e13870e4b0d804fbbb740e,We may well have to embrace some of Trump’s disillusioned followers to the fold of Democratic communities — and practice forgiveness.,2017-04-06,"<p>A Twitter mock-up depicts the possible fate of Donald Trump, if FBI investigations prove treasonous collusion with Russia in the last presidential elections.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e163221400007165072df5.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump and his sycophantic enablers like campaign adviser Carter Page continue to deny the allegations, calling them “a political stunt from the get go... absolutely ridiculous on every level.” However, far from being a “witch hunt,” as Trump also insists in one of his idiotic Twitter rants, the investigations regarding whether there was treasonous collusion with Russia — either directly through Trump, or through his campaign cohorts — to affect the outcome of our presidential elections appear to be gaining real traction.By the hour, it seems, the legal and financial noose of convicting certainty is tightening around the necks of Trump’s campaign aides, and even some within his Cabinet, whose prime reason for appointment now appears to center around their ties to Russia. If some reports are to be believed, under the weight of mounting evidence, which could lead to his impeachment or imprisonment, Trump is ostensibly considering resignation.But don’t light up the fireworks — at least, not just yet.Resignation seems highly unlikely since Trump may not yet understand from his “intelligence sources” at FOX News that the Feds are at the White House gate. In fact, just last week, Trump further rooted son-in-law Jared Kushner in a West Wing role that could only rightfully be described as “Assistant President.” Simultaneously, First Daughter Ivanka, who swore up and down to America that her only role in the Trump administration would be that of “daughter,” was also further entrenched in a new West Wing office as an official White House employee covered by ethics rules — to be Daddy’s adviser.Impeachment or imprisonment it is, then. To be sure, these options befit far more the noble hand of justice for the degree of criminal effrontery already perpetrated against the American public. Indeed, if Trump somehow evades charges of corruption or treasonous collusion with Russia — the details of which now require mapping on charts and diagrams to track — then every person in this country ever convicted of a crime based upon circumstantial evidence should be freed. Reasonable doubt long exited this political theater.If based only upon the bombshell testimonies of FBI Director James Comey and NSA head Michael Rogers to members of the House Intelligence Committee on Mar. 20, what is clear is that the FBI has more than probable cause to warrant several streams of investigations into Trump’s dealings with Russia. Subsequent reports confirmed also that the FBI has information indicating that Trump’s associates communicated with suspected Russian operatives, seemingly to coordinate the release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.Last week, there was further corroboration also that, just prior to joining the Trump campaign, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort worked secretly for Russian billionaire, Oleg Deripaska — a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — with whom he eventually signed a $10 million annual contract, beginning in 2006, to design a plan that would “greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success.” In a 2005 memo, obtained by the Associated Press, Manafort offered Deripaska “a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government.”It is highly unlikely that Trump did not know of his former campaign manager’s clandestine activities throughout Eastern Europe, his dubious political clientele, or his direct involvement in promoting Russia’s interests — Manafort’s slimy resume trail is too substantial. To not know would have been criminally negligent at best and further proof of Trump’s eminent unsuitability for the more nuanced tasks of managing American Intelligence as Commander-in-Chief.Last week, additionally, former Trump national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn, also under investigation, offered himself to be interviewed by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence committees in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Flynn exited Trump’s Cabinet rather unceremoniously back in February after a record 24 days of least service in that capacity because of conflicting statements to Congress regarding his level and frequency of contacts with Russian officials and inopportune discussions before Trump’s inauguration regarding the lifting of US sanctions. His offer was rejected.In light of subsequent disclosures of unreported streams of income from Russian companies to Flynn — and by his own assessment — one could say that his jailhouse door has already slammed shut. And the FBI knows it.“When you are given immunity, that means you have probably committed a crime,” Flynn said back in a September interview, referring to Clinton’s five aides, who had been given some measure of immunity to testify in FBI investigations regarding Clinton’s use of a private email server and the subsequent mishandling of classified information.Karma is, indeed, a bigly bitch.Furthermore, Flynn may have a long time in prison to contemplate his vitriolic speech at last year’s Republican national convention in which he initiated anti-Clinton chants — “Lock her up!” — and publicly derided her for “crimes” that have repeatedly cleared FBI scrutiny. Trump’s campaign gained significant momentum through Flynn’s hateful political rhetoric. Its followers drank that Kool-Aid in frenzied cult-like fashion — until reality started creeping in.“That plays great before the election — now we don’t care, right?” Trump declared slyly in a post-election “thank you” rally in Michigan — an inevitable sign that it would take 4-part editorial spreads in major papers like the L.A. Times and exhaustive social commentaries by a stunning array of media stalwarts — some of whom have come out of retirement — to unravel the extent of Trump’s lies and explain his artistry in, well, bullshit.Democrats, meanwhile, wait for the hand of justice to prevail, anxiously hoping that FBI and other intelligence agency investigations into Russia's meddling, as well as the related probe by the House Intelligence Committee, are not compromised. Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), a partisan bootlicker who appeared more protective of the Republican power grab afforded by the Trump administration than the assault on our democracy by a hostile foreign power, recused himself today, just moments before the House Ethics Committee announced an investigation into his potential ""unauthorized disclosures of classified information."" In any event, what does all of this mean for Democrats seeking vindication after an election defeat in which their candidate actually won the popular vote by unprecedented margins? Most are still angry, not fully reconciled to the fact that there will be no do-over, no justice that will see Clinton awarded the presidency.""As it stands today, the Constitution contains a serious design flaw,” Harvard Constitutional Law Professor Laurence Tribe told me Sunday in an email communication. “If a President is impeached, convicted, and removed from office for fraudulently or even treasonously stealing the presidency, there is no way to redo the national election as logic would seem to require. A constitutional amendment would be needed to cope with such a crisis."" Tribe is unambiguous in his views regarding Trump — that “he’s a usurper.” Nevertheless, he confirms that the deposing of Trump would usher the swearing in of Mike Pence as president — unless he, too, is taken down in the Russian scandal, in which he seems inextricably tied to Flynn. According to the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, next in line is House Speaker Paul Ryan. Yes, he of the TrumpCare debacle fame.All of which begs the question, what then is the strategic plan to mobilize Democrats going forward into the November 2018 midterms and 2020 — the plan that does not have Clinton cast in some kind of leading role? Clinton is signaling her readiness to “come out of the woods” to fight for the causes she believes in. However, the Democratic Party needs to disavow itself of any illusions that embracing Clinton in another significant campaign would be anything less than ill-advised. Not known for diplomacy or tact, political commentator, Bill Maher voiced, rather more colorfully, on a recent Real Time episode what others, like me, are thinking about Clinton’s “return.”“Hillary, stay in the woods,” Maher said in exasperation. “You had your shot. You f**ked it up. You’re Bill Bucknor. We had the World Series and you let the grounder go through your legs. Let someone else have the chance. The fact that she’s ‘coming back’ just verifies every bad thing that anyone’s ever thought about the Clinton’s — that it’s all about them. Let some of the other shorter trees get a little sunlight.”Yes, I understand the injustice of it all. Russia dealt Clinton a debilitating political blow, as did our own Electoral College. I wrote about it here, and here. However, let’s not tarry in the land of Wishful Thinking. A recent poll from Suffolk University places the Democratic Party’s favorable/unfavorable ratings at 36 percent/52 percent behind the media, the GOP, Trump, and Mike Pence — ahead only of Hillary Clinton and Congress. In my last essay, I connected this finding with the 123.1 million American voters out in “no man’s land,” those who voted “Other,” or didn’t bother to show up at all in the last election — a problem that Clinton’s candidacy did not resolve. People feel disenfranchised — “forgotten” — through income inequality and by their inability to fulfill the American dream of financial stability and home ownership despite hard work and college degrees that leave them gasping in the choke-hold of unconscionable student loan debts. According to Bankrate, savings are practically non-existent, with 6 in 10 Americans not having $500 in savings. What’s more, the cost of raising a child, born in 2015, just to age 17 and not including college, is now pegged at $233,610.Conscious Americans recognize these imbalances as the only real consequences that have trickled down from the economics subscribed to by Wall Street and the political establishment. They see Clinton, inextricably, as part of that whole — a truth Democrats must face if they are to understand the loss of more than 1,000 seats to Republican control since Obama took office in 2009. For many who loved Obama, “hope” was deferred. Under Trump, hope is already in death throes. Therefore, kudos to newly-elected DNC Chairman Tom Perez for at least making a show of cleaning house and initiating CPR on a party still reeling from its November defeat without cohesive leadership. Last week, Perez requested resignation letters from all current DNC staffers — a crucial, strategic move to distance his administration from the trail of corruption, affiliated with former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Shultz and the cheating scandal that surrounded former DNC Vice Chair Donna Brazile, which led to her being fired from CNN as a political commentator. Justice must not only be done for those like Bernie Sanders, caught in the cross-hairs of their zeal to elect Clinton as the party nominee and president, justice must also appear to be done. In a Mar. 30 interview, when asked by Susan Page, USA TODAY’s Washington bureau chief, if he had talked to Clinton, Perez carefully replied, “We talked about how we make sure we build a better Democratic Party. I talked to President Obama, I talked to Secretary Clinton, yes, to Joe Biden, Senator Sanders, Senator Schumer, Leader Pelosi, other leaders — we're all working together.” The interview was an enlightening exchange insofar as it presented a DNC Chair who ostensibly understands the past missteps of the organization and the monumental task ahead to repair its image and restore trust. Perez also appears more gracious and inclusive toward all who provide leadership for the Democratic Party.More importantly, Perez and Deputy DNC Chair Keith Ellison are already on the campaign trail. Perez’s Twitter page tracks their tours of states like Texas, New Jersey, and California — critical grassroots campaigning, as Democrats notoriously do not turn out for mid-term elections. We cannot accept this prevailing status quo in 2018.“We have to build a Democratic Party that is vibrant in every state,” Perez told Page. “We have to make sure we make house calls. We have to get back to basics. We did not invest enough in organizing over the last ten years — I'm not just talking about simply the 2016 cycle — we ignored too many zip codes. And so, as a result, I hear from people in my travels, ‘Where have you been?’ and ‘You don't stand for me!’ And so what we have to do is lead with our values and be present in making a difference in communities across this country.”As it turns out, we may well have to embrace some of Trump’s disillusioned followers to the fold of Democratic communities — and practice forgiveness. The miasma of despair already rising from the consequences of their vote would be funny, if it didn’t affect us all.Nevertheless, we are stronger, together. And evicting Trump and his fascist squatters from the White House will take all the strength we’ve got."
12,HEALTHY LIVING,Addressing America’s Fentanyl Crisis,"Nora Volkow, ContributorDirector, National Institute on Drug Abuse",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/addressing-americas-fentanyl-crisis_us_58e67760e4b06671a472f0b8,Many people addicted to opioids as well as other drugs like cocaine are accidentally being poisoned by fentanyl-laced products.,2017-04-06,<p><strong>Image showing lethal doses of heroin (left) and fentanyl (right)</strong></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e67ebf1500002a00c7e560.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every day, 91 Americans fatally overdose on an opioid drug. It may be a prescription analgesic or heroin—4-8 percent of people who misuse painkillers transition to heroin—but increasingly it is likely to be heroin’s much more potent synthetic cousin fentanyl. In the space of only two years, fentanyl has tragically escalated the opioid crisis. This drug is 50-100 times more potent than morphine and able to enter the brain especially quickly because of its high fat solubility; just 2 milligrams can kill a person, and emergency personnel who touch or breathe it may even be put in danger. Unfortunately, many people addicted to opioids as well as other drugs like cocaine are accidentally being poisoned by fentanyl-laced products.Although fentanyl is a medicine prescribed for post-surgical pain and palliative care, most of the fentanyl responsible for this surge of deaths is made illicitly in China and imported to the U.S. via the mail or via Mexican drug cartels. Its high potency and ease of manufacture make it enormously profitable to produce and sell. According to the DEA, one kilogram of fentanyl can be purchased in China for $3,000 to $5,000 and then generate over $1.5 million in revenue through illicit sales in the U.S. Thus distributors of illicit drugs are eager to adulterate heroin or cocaine powder with fentanyl or put it in counterfeit prescription drugs, such as pills made to look like prescription pain relievers or sedatives. Last month, for example, a wave of deaths in Florida was linked to fake Xanax pills containing fentanyl.Deaths from fentanyl and a handful of other synthetic opioids tripled from 3,105 in 2013 to 9,580 in 2015, and those numbers are likely underestimates; some medical examiners do not test for fentanyl and many overdose death certificates do not list specific drugs involved. Thus far, New Hampshire has recorded the most fentanyl overdoses per capita; a NIDA-funded HotSpot study found that in 2015, almost two-thirds of the 439 drug deaths in that state involved fentanyl.Although most who fatally overdose on fentanyl are unaware of what they have taken, news of such fatalities has driven some people with severe opioid addictions to seek it out. Part of the cycle of an opioid use disorder is increased tolerance, causing diminished response to the drug, which leads users to seek products with higher potency so they can experience the euphoria they initially felt. Roughly a third of opioid users interviewed as part of the HotSpot study in New Hampshire knowingly sought fentanyl.The fentanyl problem is already a high priority for policymakers. Last month, NIDA’s Deputy Director Wilson Compton testified before Congress on the science of fentanyl, accompanied by representatives from the DEA, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the CDC, and other agencies. Diplomatic and law enforcement efforts to cut off the supply of illicit fentanyl and the chemicals needed to manufacture it will be important, but the emergence of very high potency opioids—which can be transported in smaller volumes—will make addressing supply increasingly difficult. Thus, a public health strategy to address the opioid crisis and overdose epidemic is more important than ever.First, we must improve pain management and minimize our reliance on existing opioid pain medications. Second, treatment centers and health care systems must make much wider use of available, effective medications for opioid addiction (buprenorphine, methadone, and extended-release naltrexone). Third, the opioid-overdose reversing drug naloxone needs to be made as widely available as possible, both to emergency first responders as well as to opioid users and other laypeople who may find themselves in a position to save a life. In cases of fentanyl overdose, multiple doses of naloxone may be needed to reverse an overdose and additional hospital care may be needed. And all individuals who overdose on opioids need to be linked to a treatment program to prevent it from happening again.Only by mobilizing health care systems to deliver effective prevention and treatment of substance use disorders, utilize naloxone to prevent and reverse overdoses, and develop safe effective treatments for the management of chronic pain will we be able end the current opioid crisis, as well as prevent it from happening again.Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

Seven of them wear camo uniforms bearing the logos of various government agencies: U.S. Forest Service, National Guard, California Fish & Wildlife, Plumas County Sheriff. Most have blackened faces and assault rifles at the ready. An 11-year-old Belgian Malinois named Phebe and her K9 handler lead the way.Number eight is tall and dressed in black, with a rumpled bush hat and a Springfield Armory 9 millimeter pistol in a hip holster. With a kaffiyeh wrapped under a dark beard, and eyebrows (in his words) “like two caterpillars about to mate,” Dr. Mourad Gabriel could pass as a local interpreter on a Special Forces raid if this were Iraq or Afghanistan. Instead, he’s a wildlife biologist accompanying law-enforcement agents on an illegal marijuana farm bust.The group traverses hillsides, fords streams, tiptoes through thickets of fern and willow, trying not to snap twigs or shake saplings. Radios crackle with whispers. Tiptoeing through rough terrain is slow going: It takes almost four hours to go three miles.At last the goal is in sight: a dense garden of pot plants on a steep slope above Palmetto Creek. The dog team and two others move in while the rest, including Gabriel, hold tight down by the creek. Growers are often armed, and if there are any around, they could make a break for it. Runners usually head downhill.Word comes back: Nobody’s home. The whole team can enter safely. It’s time for Gabriel to go to work.RELATED: Weed Weddings Are Now a Thing* * *A combination of ideal growing weather and proximity to tens of millions of potential customers has always made northern California a great place to grow dope. California was the first to permit medical marijuana, in 1996, and this past November, residents voted “yes” on Proposition 64, making California the fifth state to legalize recreational pot. Almost two-thirds of the country’s total legal harvest comes from the Golden State. The crop brought in $2.8 billion in 2015, putting it somewhere between lettuce and grapes, and some estimates project the state’s “green gold rush” could become a $6.5 billion market by 2020.Even as California embraces the booming legal marijuana market, though, it is also seeing an explosion in illegal cultivation, much of it on the state’s vast and remote stretches of public land. National forests and even national parks have seen a surge in large-scale illegal “trespass grows,” some with tens of thousands of plants spread across dozens of acres. As much as 80 percent of illegal pot eradicated in California is grown on federal lands, and that’s just the fraction that authorities find. (Trespass grows occur in other states in the American West, and even in remote areas back east, but at nowhere near the scale of California.) The surge has overwhelmed land-management and law-enforcement agencies, whose resources are already stretched thin. Here in the Plumas National Forest, for instance, three USFS officers have to cover some 4,600 square kilometers (1,790 square miles). That’s why so many different agencies are cooperating on this raid.As the executive director of the non-profit Integral Ecology Research Center (IERC), Gabriel’s usual purview is studying ecosystems and their inhabitants, from big cats to endangered invertebrates. He never expected to find himself packing heat and creeping through the forest, let alone facing other threats to his and his family’s safety. But he has taken up the challenge because of illegal pot growing’s insidious side effects: The lethal poisons growers use to protect their crops and campsites from pests are annihilating wildlife, polluting pristine public lands, and maybe even turning up in your next bong hit.* * *Up on the hillside, bright green plants sprout from shallow holes gouged into the slope. Some plants are more than 2.5 meters (eight feet) tall — a sativa strain, known for its energizing highs — while others are shorter, with the darker leaves of mellower indica. A tangled web of plastic irrigation lines feed every hole. It smells like you’d expect a pot garden to smell as it bakes in the sun: herbal and musky and medicinal all at once.As soon as they arrive, officers begin chopping down the plants with machetes and garden pruners. Gabriel pulls on blue nitrile gloves, plucks a pot leaf and sticks it into a small plastic bag to test for pesticide residue. Then he kneels to examine a Gatorade bottle lying on the ground. Growers often use empty containers like this to store toxic chemicals. In the previous year, every Gatorade bottle Gabriel and his team found at grow sites tested positive for carbofuran, a neurotoxic insecticide that is so nasty it has been banned in the U.S., Canada and the EU. Farmers in Kenya have used it to kill lions. Symptoms of exposure range from nausea and blurred vision to convulsions, spontaneous abortions, and death. “They just leave these sitting around,” Gabriel says as he carefully swabs the bottle.In 2009, Gabriel was studying Pacific fishers (Pekania pennanti), cat-sized carnivores that live in old-growth forests in the Rockies and Sierra Nevadas. Fishers look cute and cuddly, but they’re the only animals that regularly kill and eat porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum). Small, isolated populations live in Washington, Oregon, and California. (Just last year, despite the numerous threats fishers face, including logging and wildfires, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service decided against granting the animals federal protection under the Endangered Species Act.)There are fewer than 500 fishers left in the mountains of northern California. So when Gabriel performed a necropsy on one individual in 2009 and found its body cavity filled with blood from some kind of hemorrhagic response, red flags went up. Tests showed the animal was full of an acute rodenticide (AR) so toxic it is not sold legally in the U.S. (Acute or second-generation rodenticides are exceptionally lethal, designed to kill in a single dose.) As more poisoned fishers turned up, Gabriel and other biologists were baffled. Radio collar data showed the animals hadn’t gone near farms. Where were the poisons coming from?Gabriel started reporting his findings at scientific conferences, in part to see if anyone could help figure out what was going on. At one of these, a conservation officer approached him afterward and offered an explanation: illegal marijuana grow sites, where the officer would often see containers of rodenticides and other chemicals.Suddenly the puzzle made sense. Gabriel and his colleagues tested 58 fisher carcasses they had collected over the previous three years and found that more than 80 percent had rodenticide in their systems. It even showed up in nursing kits, meaning the mothers passed it through their milk. Some animals tested positive for four separate toxic compounds. Since then the numbers have only risen. In 2016, the scientists tested 22 radio-collared fishers that had apparently died of natural causes; every one had some kind of synthetic poison in its system.Some 50 different toxicants have turned up at grow sites. (“Toxicants” are manmade poisons, while “toxins” are naturally occurring.) Growers use the poisons to keep rodents and other animals from eating the sugar-rich sprouting plants, from gnawing on irrigation tubing, and from invading their campsites in search of food. Acute rodenticides cause neurological damage and internal bleeding. Animals literally drown in their own blood or stumble around until they’re eaten themselves, passing the poison up the food chain to predators like owls and fishers.Growers bait open tuna cans with pesticides, which are often flavored like meat or peanut butter, or string up poisoned hot dogs on fishhooks. People have found bears, foxes, vultures, and deer with chemicals from grow sites in their bodies. One study of barred owls (Strix varia) in the Pacific Northwest found that 80 percent of the birds tested positive. And for every animal found, there are probably dozens more in a similar condition.“It’s a massive problem,” says Craig Thompson, a wildlife ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service. “People don’t tend to grasp the industrial scale of what’s going on. There are thousands of these sites in places the public thinks are pristine, with obscene amounts of chemicals at each one. Each one is a little environmental disaster.” Thompson also studies fishers in the Sierras, and he is one of the few scientists besides Gabriel who studies the problem firsthand. “I can stand at the intersection of two forest roads and generally know of three or four pot gardens within a quarter or half a mile.”Gabriel and Thompson fear the poisons could spread far beyond each grow site and contaminate the water supply of towns and cities far downstream. The toxicants can leach into the soil and linger for years. Using water monitors, Gabriel has already found organophosphates—nerve agents used to make insecticides and certain types of chemical weapons—several hundred meters downhill from grow sites. “We know it’s happening, we just don’t know the extent, and we don’t know what other chemicals are involved,” he says.* * *“I think they were out of here already, maybe to resupply,” says Chris Hendrickson, a detective with the Plumas County Sheriff’s Office who coordinated the raid. Hendrickson is soft-spoken, with glasses and a light mustache. He’s sifting through the mess of the growers’ campsite, a dirt platform under a camouflage tarp just beyond the last plot. It contains everything a few people would need to live for months: sleeping bags, cots, a propane stove, bug spray, cartons of eggs and bags of rice, potatoes, and sugar. Many of the food labels are in Spanish; a jar of pickled nopales — prickly pear cactus pads — sits near a pile of dirty clothes and a solar cell phone charger.Hendrickson estimates he has gone on about 50 raids in his nine years as an investigator. This one is typical, he says: probably two guys tending the plots for anywhere from two-to-four months, with occasional food drops and extra help during planting and harvest.It takes about an hour for the team to chop down or uproot all 5,257 plants. While wholesale prices for illegal pot have fallen by half over the past decade, even at the current rate of around $1,500 per pound, at a rough estimate of a pound per plant, that’s almost $8 million lying in the dirt. Someone’s going to be severely disappointed when they come to check the crop. “These guys will be coming back,” Hendrickson says. “It would be interesting to be a fly on the wall when they see what has happened.”Pot from illegal sites like this one can end up anywhere. “These guys aren’t growing for the legal recreational market or medical dispensaries — they’re growing to exploit a black market somewhere,” says Mark Higley, a wildlife biologist with the Hoopa Tribe in Humboldt County, whose reservation has seen an explosion in illegal grow sites. While there is no proof that illegal pot ends up in the burgeoning legal market, many familiar with the industry suspect it does.Law enforcement officials think many trespass grows are set up by Mexican drug cartels, which prefer to ship marijuana from state to state rather than smuggle it over the international border. Growers arrested during raids are often undocumented immigrants in their 20s from Michoacan, experienced in covert agriculture and hard living. They earn around $150 a day for two-to-four months, much more than they would at a farm or winery.Captured growers sometimes claim their employers are holding their families hostage until the harvest is collected. Whether or not that’s true, they’re motivated to protect the crop. Hendrickson estimates between a quarter and half of raids turn up some kind of weapon, from crossbows to automatic rifles. He has found elevated sniper positions set up near grow sites.Growers have followed, detained, threatened, pursued, and shot at officers and civilians, including scientists and field techs. One Forest Service biologist who stumbled upon a grow site in Sequoia National Forest was chased for close to an hour by armed growers. When he briefly lost radio contact, his supervisors feared he had been captured or was dead, but he made it out safely. In a single week in the summer of 2016, two K9 dogs were stabbed while apprehending suspects at trespass grows. (Both survived and have returned to work.)“I’m worried about my family going hiking and running across one of these, or my friends,” Hendrickson says. Gabriel looks up from counting empty bags of fertilizer. “I’ve hiked and snowmobiled through this drainage,” he says. “We’ve done spotted owl surveys here, too. There’s a nest right over there.”Pesticides have been the biggest recent game-changer for law enforcement, Hendrickson says. The possibility of coming into contact with a neurotoxin sprayed on a plant or hidden in a Coffee-mate jar makes raids even more dangerous, not to mention slower. “We still make sure a garden is safe when we go in, but now it takes a lot longer to assess if there are dangerous chemicals or not. Safety-wise, it’s huge for us.”RELATED: Why the Patriarchy Hates the MoonJust walking through rows of plants coated with toxic chemicals can be enough to bring on symptoms like lethargy and headaches — let alone spending hours cutting them down in the hot sun under the wash of a helicopter. Gabriel and his employees have started getting monthly blood tests to check for pesticide exposure.Some chemical threats are more immediate. At one site Gabriel was inspecting an unfamiliar container full of aluminum phosphide, a poisonous powder used to kill rodents and insects. It had gasified and built up pressure in the heat of the sun. When he touched it, it exploded in his face. Luckily he was wearing a hazmat respirator.“My biggest fear is that some kid will come across one of those bottles,” Thompson says. “Carbofuran is pink, it looks like Pepto, like candy. Can you imagine what a five-year-old would do with that?”As the last of the plants at Palmetto are cut down, Gabriel totals up his findings: 3.6 kilograms (8 pounds) of bromodialone, a restricted-use neurotoxic rodenticide, and two bottles of malathion, an organophosphate insecticide that’s basically a watered-down version of the nerve agent sarin. Each bottle is enough to make 1,900 liters (500 gallons) when mixed with water. All of it has to be left behind, at least for now, since moving it would require hazmat protocols and more time and money than anyone has at the moment.Gabriel’s expertise in wildlife toxicology has become a huge asset to law enforcement, both in terms of keeping officers safe and gathering evidence for prosecution, says Forest Service patrol commander Chad Krogstad. “He’s helping us out tremendously, giving us environmental background data and even testifying in some of our cases.” But the work comes at a cost.* * *That evening in a tiny pizzeria in nearby Greenville, the stress of the morning’s efforts shows in Gabriel’s face and posture. Usually he’s fizzing with energy, peppering conversations with “Dude!” and going off on endearingly geeky tangents about chemistry or animal behavior like a kid talking Minecraft. Now he’s glancing at the clock, wondering where dinner is. Three simultaneous orders have overwhelmed the kitchen.“I never thought that studying wildlife diseases would land me in the middle of the drug war,” he says. “But you can’t just stand by and do nothing.” He’s quick to emphasize that his role is strictly that of an objective observer. He’s not advocating or making arrests; he’s a scientist, collecting and analyzing data and reporting his results — even though that entails going on raids and packing heat, and in the end, seeing his efforts help put people in jail.“I gave up being objective about this a long time ago,” Thompson says. “I think it was the day I looked at a map and saw a grow site maybe 100 yards upstream of a place I’ve taken my kids to play in the water and fish. That makes it a personal issue.”It’s an unusual position to be in for a scientist trained in dispassionate data collection and objectivity above all, and one that’s often uncomfortable as well as dangerous. Gabriel’s many published papers and presentations on the topic of pot poisons have raised his public profile significantly. In the heart of drug country, that’s not a good kind of notoriety.Growing marijuana has been a way of life in northern California for decades. Even though more and more is being grown legally, Gabriel’s inadvertent role as “the scientist who helps cops raid pot farms” has — in some eyes — brought unwelcome attention. In Eugene, near where he lives, strangers at the supermarket and gas station have invited him to go fuck himself. Grower websites have posted the latitude and longitude coordinates of his home, and his office has been burglarized. From the pattern of door and room alarms that were triggered, it looked like the intruder headed straight for his desk. “That means someone was probably watching where I sit,” he says.The worst fallout came one evening in February 2014. Gabriel and his wife Greta Wengart, who was pregnant at the time, called their two dogs in from the backyard. Nyxo, a 100-pound black lab mix, had been barking at something across the fence. He was a gentle giant they had adopted from a local shelter ten years before, after he had been shot at, tossed from a truck, and left for dead. Nyxo seemed sluggish as he went to sleep. In the middle of the night they heard him throwing up.Early the next morning Nyxo started drooling and collapsed. Gabriel rushed him to the vet, but the dog slipped into a coma. That afternoon he had to be put down. Mourad helped with the necropsy — “one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do.” He found Nyxo had been poisoned with brodifacoum, an anticoagulant rodenticide. A reward of $20,000 still has not brought in a single lead. Gabriel and Wengart’s daughter was born two weeks later.Since then Gabriel has surrounded his house with high-def cameras and motion-sensor lights. He has learned to live with one eye over his shoulder, always scanning for suspicious cars or strangers. “I’m not being ignorant,” he says. “I have to be perceptive, for my family’s sake.”Wengart is also a biologist, and serves as the IERC’s assistant director. She and Gabriel work closely on grow sites and other projects. “I worry about him less than I used to,” she says. “When he’s doing ground entry, that’s the only time I get nervous.” But that’s the only way to get certain kinds of information, by questioning captured growers, and the only way to make sure no one on the entry team stumbles upon anything toxic. The couple started out working together on busts, but now they try to take turns. Not being in the same place at the same time is both safer and more efficient. “It’s definitely a conscious choice,” she says.“I think we’re all worried a little about Mourad,” says Higley, who often delivers public presentations along with Gabriel. “I wish he would keep a lower profile.” Higley himself has documented dozens of trespass grow sites on the Hoopa reservation, including one last year, the first, with a cache of carbofuran.In his defense, Gabriel says legal growers have thanked him in person for drawing attention to the issue of illegal pot grows — not just because of the threat they pose to their profits, but also because the environmental and health risks could tarnish the industry’s overall image.* * *Early the next morning, Gabriel and five field techs from IERC park along a dirt road in the hills northwest of Quincy. The brushy slopes bristle with blackened tree trunks, remnants of a forest fire years earlier. The team is here to survey a grow site nicknamed Rattlesnake that was busted in 2015. Henderson is along for security, as is a burly National Guardsman from a specialized unit trained in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. The Guardsman doesn’t want his name used, and later pulls on a balaclava for a group photo. “Mourad’s a badass,” he says. “He’s smarter than all of us, and he’s a goat on the trails.”Gabriel goes over security protocols as everyone gears up and tests radios. “No wallets, no cell phones, nothing identifiable.” The chance of dropping something that could lead someone unpleasant to your front door, while tiny, just isn’t worth it. “If you run into a grower, remember: Turn your mic on, and the safety code word is ‘hammerhead.’” He shoulders his backpack and checks his pistol. “Everyone have their mace?”Personal safety has become a primary concern for anyone doing field work on public land in California, Thompson says. “It’s an entirely different paradigm than five or ten years ago. It pervades every aspect of the job.” It’s too dangerous to send anyone out alone, which means having to pay two people to do a job one could do. Law enforcement regularly declares scientific study areas off limits because of safety concerns.“My techs are going in with guys with M-16s to recover dead animals, and that’s just to do our normal wildlife job,” Thompson says. Techs are taught to identify signs of illegal grow sites, such as trash, new trails, and sneaker prints in places where people generally don’t wear Nikes. They also learn how to appear as nonthreatening as possible in the field: no camo clothing, scientific equipment in full view. “I have to talk about it in job interviews now when I hire people,” Thompson says. “It used to be the risks were bears, snakes, driving mountain roads. Now it’s pot gardens.” It’s enough to scare away applicants, he says.With all this in mind, Gabriel and Henderson lead the group up the hillside in the open sun. The field techs, two women and three men in their 20s, are clearly inspired by their boss’s enthusiasm. “This is real-world applied biology,” says Alex Reyer, climbing over a crumbling log. “I feel like I’m actually having some sort of impact for the better.”Topping a bare ridge reveals Mt. Lassen’s snowy peak just above the horizon. On the other side of the ridge, a wide basin spills to the northwest. Somewhere down there, amid the dense wild lilac bushes and blackened 60-meter (200-foot) snags, is the grow site. Gabriel was on the bust, which netted 16,455 plants growing across 300 vertical meters (1,000 feet). One suspect was captured and another escaped by fleeing down the valley, evading two K9 dogs.Today the team wants to catalog the environmental damage caused by two large campsites, to help plan a cleanup effort. Step one is finding the three plots, but in the past year, the vegetation has grown more than two meters (six feet). It’s so dense that soon none of the team members can see anyone else. Drifting pollen fills mouths with a bitter taste.RELATED: Trees Have Their Own Songs It takes half an hour of sweaty bushwhacking to find the first piece of water tubing. Gabriel turns on a satellite tracker to map the plot, pulls on nitrile gloves, and starts digging through a trash pile inside a burned-out stump. He pulls out a propane canister, red Solo cups used to transport seedlings, a filthy pair of underwear. He counts empty bags and containers out loud: “Twenty pounds of 6-4-6 fertilizer,50 pounds of 0-50-30, one pound of unknown white powdery substance in a Gatorade bottle.”The irrigation lines lead along what were once rows of thriving plants, now barely visible indentations in the ground. A few still hold dead plants, their buds dry and mildewed. Someone calls in a dead bird on the radio. “Take a swab inside the mouth,” Gabriel replies. “Grab liver or kidneys if you can.”Suddenly he pulls up short. It’s a single marijuana plant, small but definitely alive. “No way!” Just as quickly, excitement turns to concern. Growers often return and replant a raided site if all the irrigation line is left in place, like here. Could someone be here right now? But the plant has a taproot, which means it wasn’t planted by hand. Somehow it sprouted from a leftover seed, survived a winter buried in snow, and got itself pollinated. “Amazing. I’ve never seen that.” Gabriel shakes his head and takes a leaf sample to test for contaminants.As it turns out, survival isn’t the only thing exceptional about the plant. Its leaves test positive for carbofuran, most likely from the soil, meaning the chemical persisted much longer than anyone suspected it could. According to official estimates, the chemical should have been gone from the soil within a month. “It’s completely new data nobody would have ever conjured up,” Gabriel says.Pesticides are showing up on both leaves and buds at trespass grows, Gabriel says, and they appear at detectable levels when the plant is smoked. If any of this harvest makes its way to a medical dispensary, it could end up in the lungs of people who are already immuno-compromised from AIDS or cancer. There hasn’t been any formal research in California yet, but studies and investigations in Colorado and Oregon have found pesticides on marijuana in legal dispensaries, including in products that were supposedly certified pesticide-free. Last year, the Emerald Cup, a major cannabis competition in Sonoma County that focuses on organic growing, started testing entries for pesticides. About a quarter of the concentrates and more than 5 percent of flowers were disqualified.Higher up the hillside, at the edge of the burn scar, is what looks like a sprawling homeless encampment in the trees. Folding camp chairs, a pile of sneakers, and at least 20 cans of athlete’s foot spray are scattered around a dirt sleeping platform reinforced with logs. Four rolls of unused irrigation pipe as big as truck tires lie near a deep drift of food cans that smells like death. Each roll is a thousand feet long and retails for $250. “All of this was trucked in on someone’s back,” Gabriel says. “This is not done on a whim. This takes organization and capital.”Just below the campsite are three natural springs, or at least what’s left of them. When Gabriel was doing owl surveys here ten years ago, the trickling springs fed a thriving wetland of willows and alders. To give the pot plants a reliable, controllable source of water, the growers dug out the springs into pools the size of hot tubs, covered with sticks and tarps to hide them from the air. As a result, the wetland is virtually gone.In a controlled setting, a marijuana plant uses about six gallons of water per day, which over a 150-day growing season comes out to 3,400 liters (900 gallons) of water per plant. Legal growers have found their once-unrestricted water use under increased scrutiny as the state confronted extreme drought conditions. (Some grows in Humboldt County have literally sucked creeks dry, leaving salmon and steelhead to flop and die in puddles.)Under a law passed last June, growers now have to secure official water rights to get a growing permit.Illegal grows, of course, are another story. Gabriel has estimated that trespass grows use 50 percent more water because of less efficient irrigation systems and added stressors like pests, pathogens, and drier weather at higher elevations. Worse, some trespass growers leave their irrigation systems running around the clock throughout the year, even when nothing is growing. Multiply that by hundreds of thousands of plants and you have a serious water problem. One study by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife estimated that trespass marijuana grows used about 300 million gallons of water per square mile, roughly the same as almond orchards.To put things into perspective, by Gabriel’s estimates the 1.1 million illegal pot plants removed in California in 2016 would have used somewhere around 1.3 billion gallons of water — as much as 10,000 average California households do in a year. He calculates that this Rattlesnake site alone could have used enough water in a single season to fill seven Olympic pools.Near one of the springs, an empty jar of ibuprofen lies on the ground. This is where the one grower was caught: Fleeing a K9 dog, he took a bad jump and broke his leg. “I gave him some pills — he appreciated that,” Gabriel says. Not all of Gabriel’s interactions with growers are so friendly: He once had to help tackle a grower who had thrown off a law enforcement officer twice his size.To keep growers from returning and replanting the site, it will have to be remediated, returned to something like it was before it was planted. By Gabriel’s calculations that would mean removing around 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) of irrigation tubing and hauling out all the trash in 50-gallon bags, probably 40 or 50 in all. The springs will have to be rebuilt to function naturally, an expensive and lengthy process. This site is close enough to a road that all the crap can be hauled out on foot; more remote sites require helicopters.Remediation requires money and manpower, both of which are scarce to nonexistent — just as they are on the law enforcement end. Out of the roughly 80 grow sites Gabriel and his team have investigated since 2014, they have been able to remediate just 29 so far. “We’d like to get that to a hundred percent, but there’s just no money for it,” he says. “Right now it’s all soft money, grants through our NGO, volunteers helping. I’m on the cusp of putting up a GoFundMe site. Next I’ll try selling cookies.”He nudges a grimy digital scale with his boot. “How do you clean up hundreds of sites?” he says, with an edge of bitterness in his voice. “That’s a lot of bake sales.”* * *The biggest trespass grow sites are broken up into dozens of smaller subplots, making it less likely every plot will be busted — and also spreading out the environmental impact. “It used to be a single gaping wound, like a bullet hole,” Gabriel says. “Now it’s a shotgun.”Last September, the IERC team surveyed two grow complexes in Lassen National Forest. Together they covered 2.6 square kilometers (one square mile), the largest site the team has ever seen. There were 30 camps in all, each with its own cache of rodenticide, and more than 65 kilometers (40 miles) of irrigation tubing that sucked up 269,000 liters (71,000 gallons) of spring water a day.They also found the carcasses of a bear (Ursus americanus) and a gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Test results are still pending, but they’re reasonably sure the fox, at least, is full of poison. Right next to it was the carcass of a turkey vulture (Cathartes aura); by all appearances, it took a bite or two and dropped dead. As he was taking samples, Gabriel watched flies land on the fox and die within seconds. “That night was the longest shower I ever took,” he says.Twenty years after giving the thumbs up to medicinal marijuana, Californians voted in November to allow anyone over 21 to buy pot legally. By some estimates, Proposition 64 could double the state marijuana market to $6.6 billion by 2020. But as long as the plant is still illegal in other states, the demand that fuels trespass grows will continue.* * *Gabriel knows he’s fighting the good fight. He also knows he can’t keep going like this forever. Almost all his working hours are eaten up by “drug stuff” now. The raids, the long field days of surveys and remediation, the endless presentations and interviews: It’s rewarding — but draining, too.He’d like to train other researchers and law enforcement officers to identify and remove chemical threats at grow sites. If enough people learn to do what he does, then he can step aside and become just another researcher again. “But if I stopped right now, it would be gone,” he says.The idea of moving away comes up a lot at dinner, he says. The legal-growing boom is making Humboldt County a crazy place: Real estate is through the roof, and the murder rate just hit an all-time high. Gabriel’s mother is from Michoacan, and a lot of what he’s seeing in California is starting to sound like the stories he hears from south of the border. “I worry about raising a family here,” he says. “You do it for your kid, but you have to be there for your kid.”The legal and illegal marijuana markets are different beasts, with different suppliers and customers, but in the end it’s all about growing the same plant. Even as the industry as a whole goes more mainstream, the ever-changing jumble of law and jurisdiction between different states and the federal government will encourage entrepreneurs and criminals to take advantage of blind spots and blurred lines.As far as Gabriel and many others are concerned, only a uniform national marijuana policy could potentially resolve the issue. But if President Trump’s cabinet nominations are any indication, we may instead be in for a revival of the old-school drug war that President Obama let languish. Many of Trump’s cabinet picks, including Jeff Sessions as Attorney General and Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency, have opposed marijuana reform or legalization in various ways during their careers. Even more ominously, a bill introduced in the House in January proposes to completely eliminate the law enforcement functions of the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management and turn those duties over to the states. And some members of Congress have been pushing to entirely de-fund the Drug Enforcement Administration’s marijuana eradication program, whose budget has already dropped from $18 million to $14 million. California received more than a third of the funds in 2015.As long as pot is still illegal in some parts of the U.S., the demand for illegally grown marijuana will persist. And as long as there are places where it’s cheaper and less risky to grow it, that is where it will happen. In the meantime, wildlife and the environment — and likely pot smokers themselves — will pay a price we’re only beginning to understand.This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: The Life-Changing Magic of Mushrooms, The Different Stakes of Male and Female Birth Control"

Seven of them wear camo uniforms bearing the logos of various government agencies: U.S. Forest Service, National Guard, California Fish & Wildlife, Plumas County Sheriff. Most have blackened faces and assault rifles at the ready. An 11-year-old Belgian Malinois named Phebe and her K9 handler lead the way.Number eight is tall and dressed in black, with a rumpled bush hat and a Springfield Armory 9 millimeter pistol in a hip holster. With a kaffiyeh wrapped under a dark beard, and eyebrows (in his words) “like two caterpillars about to mate,” Dr. Mourad Gabriel could pass as a local interpreter on a Special Forces raid if this were Iraq or Afghanistan. Instead, he’s a wildlife biologist accompanying law-enforcement agents on an illegal marijuana farm bust.The group traverses hillsides, fords streams, tiptoes through thickets of fern and willow, trying not to snap twigs or shake saplings. Radios crackle with whispers. Tiptoeing through rough terrain is slow going: It takes almost four hours to go three miles.At last the goal is in sight: a dense garden of pot plants on a steep slope above Palmetto Creek. The dog team and two others move in while the rest, including Gabriel, hold tight down by the creek. Growers are often armed, and if there are any around, they could make a break for it. Runners usually head downhill.Word comes back: Nobody’s home. The whole team can enter safely. It’s time for Gabriel to go to work.RELATED: Weed Weddings Are Now a Thing* * *A combination of ideal growing weather and proximity to tens of millions of potential customers has always made northern California a great place to grow dope. California was the first to permit medical marijuana, in 1996, and this past November, residents voted “yes” on Proposition 64, making California the fifth state to legalize recreational pot. Almost two-thirds of the country’s total legal harvest comes from the Golden State. The crop brought in $2.8 billion in 2015, putting it somewhere between lettuce and grapes, and some estimates project the state’s “green gold rush” could become a $6.5 billion market by 2020.Even as California embraces the booming legal marijuana market, though, it is also seeing an explosion in illegal cultivation, much of it on the state’s vast and remote stretches of public land. National forests and even national parks have seen a surge in large-scale illegal “trespass grows,” some with tens of thousands of plants spread across dozens of acres. As much as 80 percent of illegal pot eradicated in California is grown on federal lands, and that’s just the fraction that authorities find. (Trespass grows occur in other states in the American West, and even in remote areas back east, but at nowhere near the scale of California.) The surge has overwhelmed land-management and law-enforcement agencies, whose resources are already stretched thin. Here in the Plumas National Forest, for instance, three USFS officers have to cover some 4,600 square kilometers (1,790 square miles). That’s why so many different agencies are cooperating on this raid.As the executive director of the non-profit Integral Ecology Research Center (IERC), Gabriel’s usual purview is studying ecosystems and their inhabitants, from big cats to endangered invertebrates. He never expected to find himself packing heat and creeping through the forest, let alone facing other threats to his and his family’s safety. But he has taken up the challenge because of illegal pot growing’s insidious side effects: The lethal poisons growers use to protect their crops and campsites from pests are annihilating wildlife, polluting pristine public lands, and maybe even turning up in your next bong hit.* * *Up on the hillside, bright green plants sprout from shallow holes gouged into the slope. Some plants are more than 2.5 meters (eight feet) tall — a sativa strain, known for its energizing highs — while others are shorter, with the darker leaves of mellower indica. A tangled web of plastic irrigation lines feed every hole. It smells like you’d expect a pot garden to smell as it bakes in the sun: herbal and musky and medicinal all at once.As soon as they arrive, officers begin chopping down the plants with machetes and garden pruners. Gabriel pulls on blue nitrile gloves, plucks a pot leaf and sticks it into a small plastic bag to test for pesticide residue. Then he kneels to examine a Gatorade bottle lying on the ground. Growers often use empty containers like this to store toxic chemicals. In the previous year, every Gatorade bottle Gabriel and his team found at grow sites tested positive for carbofuran, a neurotoxic insecticide that is so nasty it has been banned in the U.S., Canada and the EU. Farmers in Kenya have used it to kill lions. Symptoms of exposure range from nausea and blurred vision to convulsions, spontaneous abortions, and death. “They just leave these sitting around,” Gabriel says as he carefully swabs the bottle.In 2009, Gabriel was studying Pacific fishers (Pekania pennanti), cat-sized carnivores that live in old-growth forests in the Rockies and Sierra Nevadas. Fishers look cute and cuddly, but they’re the only animals that regularly kill and eat porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum). Small, isolated populations live in Washington, Oregon, and California. (Just last year, despite the numerous threats fishers face, including logging and wildfires, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service decided against granting the animals federal protection under the Endangered Species Act.)There are fewer than 500 fishers left in the mountains of northern California. So when Gabriel performed a necropsy on one individual in 2009 and found its body cavity filled with blood from some kind of hemorrhagic response, red flags went up. Tests showed the animal was full of an acute rodenticide (AR) so toxic it is not sold legally in the U.S. (Acute or second-generation rodenticides are exceptionally lethal, designed to kill in a single dose.) As more poisoned fishers turned up, Gabriel and other biologists were baffled. Radio collar data showed the animals hadn’t gone near farms. Where were the poisons coming from?Gabriel started reporting his findings at scientific conferences, in part to see if anyone could help figure out what was going on. At one of these, a conservation officer approached him afterward and offered an explanation: illegal marijuana grow sites, where the officer would often see containers of rodenticides and other chemicals.Suddenly the puzzle made sense. Gabriel and his colleagues tested 58 fisher carcasses they had collected over the previous three years and found that more than 80 percent had rodenticide in their systems. It even showed up in nursing kits, meaning the mothers passed it through their milk. Some animals tested positive for four separate toxic compounds. Since then the numbers have only risen. In 2016, the scientists tested 22 radio-collared fishers that had apparently died of natural causes; every one had some kind of synthetic poison in its system.Some 50 different toxicants have turned up at grow sites. (“Toxicants” are manmade poisons, while “toxins” are naturally occurring.) Growers use the poisons to keep rodents and other animals from eating the sugar-rich sprouting plants, from gnawing on irrigation tubing, and from invading their campsites in search of food. Acute rodenticides cause neurological damage and internal bleeding. Animals literally drown in their own blood or stumble around until they’re eaten themselves, passing the poison up the food chain to predators like owls and fishers.Growers bait open tuna cans with pesticides, which are often flavored like meat or peanut butter, or string up poisoned hot dogs on fishhooks. People have found bears, foxes, vultures, and deer with chemicals from grow sites in their bodies. One study of barred owls (Strix varia) in the Pacific Northwest found that 80 percent of the birds tested positive. And for every animal found, there are probably dozens more in a similar condition.“It’s a massive problem,” says Craig Thompson, a wildlife ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service. “People don’t tend to grasp the industrial scale of what’s going on. There are thousands of these sites in places the public thinks are pristine, with obscene amounts of chemicals at each one. Each one is a little environmental disaster.” Thompson also studies fishers in the Sierras, and he is one of the few scientists besides Gabriel who studies the problem firsthand. “I can stand at the intersection of two forest roads and generally know of three or four pot gardens within a quarter or half a mile.”Gabriel and Thompson fear the poisons could spread far beyond each grow site and contaminate the water supply of towns and cities far downstream. The toxicants can leach into the soil and linger for years. Using water monitors, Gabriel has already found organophosphates—nerve agents used to make insecticides and certain types of chemical weapons—several hundred meters downhill from grow sites. “We know it’s happening, we just don’t know the extent, and we don’t know what other chemicals are involved,” he says.* * *“I think they were out of here already, maybe to resupply,” says Chris Hendrickson, a detective with the Plumas County Sheriff’s Office who coordinated the raid. Hendrickson is soft-spoken, with glasses and a light mustache. He’s sifting through the mess of the growers’ campsite, a dirt platform under a camouflage tarp just beyond the last plot. It contains everything a few people would need to live for months: sleeping bags, cots, a propane stove, bug spray, cartons of eggs and bags of rice, potatoes, and sugar. Many of the food labels are in Spanish; a jar of pickled nopales — prickly pear cactus pads — sits near a pile of dirty clothes and a solar cell phone charger.Hendrickson estimates he has gone on about 50 raids in his nine years as an investigator. This one is typical, he says: probably two guys tending the plots for anywhere from two-to-four months, with occasional food drops and extra help during planting and harvest.It takes about an hour for the team to chop down or uproot all 5,257 plants. While wholesale prices for illegal pot have fallen by half over the past decade, even at the current rate of around $1,500 per pound, at a rough estimate of a pound per plant, that’s almost $8 million lying in the dirt. Someone’s going to be severely disappointed when they come to check the crop. “These guys will be coming back,” Hendrickson says. “It would be interesting to be a fly on the wall when they see what has happened.”Pot from illegal sites like this one can end up anywhere. “These guys aren’t growing for the legal recreational market or medical dispensaries — they’re growing to exploit a black market somewhere,” says Mark Higley, a wildlife biologist with the Hoopa Tribe in Humboldt County, whose reservation has seen an explosion in illegal grow sites. While there is no proof that illegal pot ends up in the burgeoning legal market, many familiar with the industry suspect it does.Law enforcement officials think many trespass grows are set up by Mexican drug cartels, which prefer to ship marijuana from state to state rather than smuggle it over the international border. Growers arrested during raids are often undocumented immigrants in their 20s from Michoacan, experienced in covert agriculture and hard living. They earn around $150 a day for two-to-four months, much more than they would at a farm or winery.Captured growers sometimes claim their employers are holding their families hostage until the harvest is collected. Whether or not that’s true, they’re motivated to protect the crop. Hendrickson estimates between a quarter and half of raids turn up some kind of weapon, from crossbows to automatic rifles. He has found elevated sniper positions set up near grow sites.Growers have followed, detained, threatened, pursued, and shot at officers and civilians, including scientists and field techs. One Forest Service biologist who stumbled upon a grow site in Sequoia National Forest was chased for close to an hour by armed growers. When he briefly lost radio contact, his supervisors feared he had been captured or was dead, but he made it out safely. In a single week in the summer of 2016, two K9 dogs were stabbed while apprehending suspects at trespass grows. (Both survived and have returned to work.)“I’m worried about my family going hiking and running across one of these, or my friends,” Hendrickson says. Gabriel looks up from counting empty bags of fertilizer. “I’ve hiked and snowmobiled through this drainage,” he says. “We’ve done spotted owl surveys here, too. There’s a nest right over there.”Pesticides have been the biggest recent game-changer for law enforcement, Hendrickson says. The possibility of coming into contact with a neurotoxin sprayed on a plant or hidden in a Coffee-mate jar makes raids even more dangerous, not to mention slower. “We still make sure a garden is safe when we go in, but now it takes a lot longer to assess if there are dangerous chemicals or not. Safety-wise, it’s huge for us.”RELATED: Why the Patriarchy Hates the MoonJust walking through rows of plants coated with toxic chemicals can be enough to bring on symptoms like lethargy and headaches — let alone spending hours cutting them down in the hot sun under the wash of a helicopter. Gabriel and his employees have started getting monthly blood tests to check for pesticide exposure.Some chemical threats are more immediate. At one site Gabriel was inspecting an unfamiliar container full of aluminum phosphide, a poisonous powder used to kill rodents and insects. It had gasified and built up pressure in the heat of the sun. When he touched it, it exploded in his face. Luckily he was wearing a hazmat respirator.“My biggest fear is that some kid will come across one of those bottles,” Thompson says. “Carbofuran is pink, it looks like Pepto, like candy. Can you imagine what a five-year-old would do with that?”As the last of the plants at Palmetto are cut down, Gabriel totals up his findings: 3.6 kilograms (8 pounds) of bromodialone, a restricted-use neurotoxic rodenticide, and two bottles of malathion, an organophosphate insecticide that’s basically a watered-down version of the nerve agent sarin. Each bottle is enough to make 1,900 liters (500 gallons) when mixed with water. All of it has to be left behind, at least for now, since moving it would require hazmat protocols and more time and money than anyone has at the moment.Gabriel’s expertise in wildlife toxicology has become a huge asset to law enforcement, both in terms of keeping officers safe and gathering evidence for prosecution, says Forest Service patrol commander Chad Krogstad. “He’s helping us out tremendously, giving us environmental background data and even testifying in some of our cases.” But the work comes at a cost.* * *That evening in a tiny pizzeria in nearby Greenville, the stress of the morning’s efforts shows in Gabriel’s face and posture. Usually he’s fizzing with energy, peppering conversations with “Dude!” and going off on endearingly geeky tangents about chemistry or animal behavior like a kid talking Minecraft. Now he’s glancing at the clock, wondering where dinner is. Three simultaneous orders have overwhelmed the kitchen.“I never thought that studying wildlife diseases would land me in the middle of the drug war,” he says. “But you can’t just stand by and do nothing.” He’s quick to emphasize that his role is strictly that of an objective observer. He’s not advocating or making arrests; he’s a scientist, collecting and analyzing data and reporting his results — even though that entails going on raids and packing heat, and in the end, seeing his efforts help put people in jail.“I gave up being objective about this a long time ago,” Thompson says. “I think it was the day I looked at a map and saw a grow site maybe 100 yards upstream of a place I’ve taken my kids to play in the water and fish. That makes it a personal issue.”It’s an unusual position to be in for a scientist trained in dispassionate data collection and objectivity above all, and one that’s often uncomfortable as well as dangerous. Gabriel’s many published papers and presentations on the topic of pot poisons have raised his public profile significantly. In the heart of drug country, that’s not a good kind of notoriety.Growing marijuana has been a way of life in northern California for decades. Even though more and more is being grown legally, Gabriel’s inadvertent role as “the scientist who helps cops raid pot farms” has — in some eyes — brought unwelcome attention. In Eugene, near where he lives, strangers at the supermarket and gas station have invited him to go fuck himself. Grower websites have posted the latitude and longitude coordinates of his home, and his office has been burglarized. From the pattern of door and room alarms that were triggered, it looked like the intruder headed straight for his desk. “That means someone was probably watching where I sit,” he says.The worst fallout came one evening in February 2014. Gabriel and his wife Greta Wengart, who was pregnant at the time, called their two dogs in from the backyard. Nyxo, a 100-pound black lab mix, had been barking at something across the fence. He was a gentle giant they had adopted from a local shelter ten years before, after he had been shot at, tossed from a truck, and left for dead. Nyxo seemed sluggish as he went to sleep. In the middle of the night they heard him throwing up.Early the next morning Nyxo started drooling and collapsed. Gabriel rushed him to the vet, but the dog slipped into a coma. That afternoon he had to be put down. Mourad helped with the necropsy — “one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do.” He found Nyxo had been poisoned with brodifacoum, an anticoagulant rodenticide. A reward of $20,000 still has not brought in a single lead. Gabriel and Wengart’s daughter was born two weeks later.Since then Gabriel has surrounded his house with high-def cameras and motion-sensor lights. He has learned to live with one eye over his shoulder, always scanning for suspicious cars or strangers. “I’m not being ignorant,” he says. “I have to be perceptive, for my family’s sake.”Wengart is also a biologist, and serves as the IERC’s assistant director. She and Gabriel work closely on grow sites and other projects. “I worry about him less than I used to,” she says. “When he’s doing ground entry, that’s the only time I get nervous.” But that’s the only way to get certain kinds of information, by questioning captured growers, and the only way to make sure no one on the entry team stumbles upon anything toxic. The couple started out working together on busts, but now they try to take turns. Not being in the same place at the same time is both safer and more efficient. “It’s definitely a conscious choice,” she says.“I think we’re all worried a little about Mourad,” says Higley, who often delivers public presentations along with Gabriel. “I wish he would keep a lower profile.” Higley himself has documented dozens of trespass grow sites on the Hoopa reservation, including one last year, the first, with a cache of carbofuran.In his defense, Gabriel says legal growers have thanked him in person for drawing attention to the issue of illegal pot grows — not just because of the threat they pose to their profits, but also because the environmental and health risks could tarnish the industry’s overall image.* * *Early the next morning, Gabriel and five field techs from IERC park along a dirt road in the hills northwest of Quincy. The brushy slopes bristle with blackened tree trunks, remnants of a forest fire years earlier. The team is here to survey a grow site nicknamed Rattlesnake that was busted in 2015. Henderson is along for security, as is a burly National Guardsman from a specialized unit trained in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. The Guardsman doesn’t want his name used, and later pulls on a balaclava for a group photo. “Mourad’s a badass,” he says. “He’s smarter than all of us, and he’s a goat on the trails.”Gabriel goes over security protocols as everyone gears up and tests radios. “No wallets, no cell phones, nothing identifiable.” The chance of dropping something that could lead someone unpleasant to your front door, while tiny, just isn’t worth it. “If you run into a grower, remember: Turn your mic on, and the safety code word is ‘hammerhead.’” He shoulders his backpack and checks his pistol. “Everyone have their mace?”Personal safety has become a primary concern for anyone doing field work on public land in California, Thompson says. “It’s an entirely different paradigm than five or ten years ago. It pervades every aspect of the job.” It’s too dangerous to send anyone out alone, which means having to pay two people to do a job one could do. Law enforcement regularly declares scientific study areas off limits because of safety concerns.“My techs are going in with guys with M-16s to recover dead animals, and that’s just to do our normal wildlife job,” Thompson says. Techs are taught to identify signs of illegal grow sites, such as trash, new trails, and sneaker prints in places where people generally don’t wear Nikes. They also learn how to appear as nonthreatening as possible in the field: no camo clothing, scientific equipment in full view. “I have to talk about it in job interviews now when I hire people,” Thompson says. “It used to be the risks were bears, snakes, driving mountain roads. Now it’s pot gardens.” It’s enough to scare away applicants, he says.With all this in mind, Gabriel and Henderson lead the group up the hillside in the open sun. The field techs, two women and three men in their 20s, are clearly inspired by their boss’s enthusiasm. “This is real-world applied biology,” says Alex Reyer, climbing over a crumbling log. “I feel like I’m actually having some sort of impact for the better.”Topping a bare ridge reveals Mt. Lassen’s snowy peak just above the horizon. On the other side of the ridge, a wide basin spills to the northwest. Somewhere down there, amid the dense wild lilac bushes and blackened 60-meter (200-foot) snags, is the grow site. Gabriel was on the bust, which netted 16,455 plants growing across 300 vertical meters (1,000 feet). One suspect was captured and another escaped by fleeing down the valley, evading two K9 dogs.Today the team wants to catalog the environmental damage caused by two large campsites, to help plan a cleanup effort. Step one is finding the three plots, but in the past year, the vegetation has grown more than two meters (six feet). It’s so dense that soon none of the team members can see anyone else. Drifting pollen fills mouths with a bitter taste.RELATED: Trees Have Their Own Songs It takes half an hour of sweaty bushwhacking to find the first piece of water tubing. Gabriel turns on a satellite tracker to map the plot, pulls on nitrile gloves, and starts digging through a trash pile inside a burned-out stump. He pulls out a propane canister, red Solo cups used to transport seedlings, a filthy pair of underwear. He counts empty bags and containers out loud: “Twenty pounds of 6-4-6 fertilizer,50 pounds of 0-50-30, one pound of unknown white powdery substance in a Gatorade bottle.”The irrigation lines lead along what were once rows of thriving plants, now barely visible indentations in the ground. A few still hold dead plants, their buds dry and mildewed. Someone calls in a dead bird on the radio. “Take a swab inside the mouth,” Gabriel replies. “Grab liver or kidneys if you can.”Suddenly he pulls up short. It’s a single marijuana plant, small but definitely alive. “No way!” Just as quickly, excitement turns to concern. Growers often return and replant a raided site if all the irrigation line is left in place, like here. Could someone be here right now? But the plant has a taproot, which means it wasn’t planted by hand. Somehow it sprouted from a leftover seed, survived a winter buried in snow, and got itself pollinated. “Amazing. I’ve never seen that.” Gabriel shakes his head and takes a leaf sample to test for contaminants.As it turns out, survival isn’t the only thing exceptional about the plant. Its leaves test positive for carbofuran, most likely from the soil, meaning the chemical persisted much longer than anyone suspected it could. According to official estimates, the chemical should have been gone from the soil within a month. “It’s completely new data nobody would have ever conjured up,” Gabriel says.Pesticides are showing up on both leaves and buds at trespass grows, Gabriel says, and they appear at detectable levels when the plant is smoked. If any of this harvest makes its way to a medical dispensary, it could end up in the lungs of people who are already immuno-compromised from AIDS or cancer. There hasn’t been any formal research in California yet, but studies and investigations in Colorado and Oregon have found pesticides on marijuana in legal dispensaries, including in products that were supposedly certified pesticide-free. Last year, the Emerald Cup, a major cannabis competition in Sonoma County that focuses on organic growing, started testing entries for pesticides. About a quarter of the concentrates and more than 5 percent of flowers were disqualified.Higher up the hillside, at the edge of the burn scar, is what looks like a sprawling homeless encampment in the trees. Folding camp chairs, a pile of sneakers, and at least 20 cans of athlete’s foot spray are scattered around a dirt sleeping platform reinforced with logs. Four rolls of unused irrigation pipe as big as truck tires lie near a deep drift of food cans that smells like death. Each roll is a thousand feet long and retails for $250. “All of this was trucked in on someone’s back,” Gabriel says. “This is not done on a whim. This takes organization and capital.”Just below the campsite are three natural springs, or at least what’s left of them. When Gabriel was doing owl surveys here ten years ago, the trickling springs fed a thriving wetland of willows and alders. To give the pot plants a reliable, controllable source of water, the growers dug out the springs into pools the size of hot tubs, covered with sticks and tarps to hide them from the air. As a result, the wetland is virtually gone.In a controlled setting, a marijuana plant uses about six gallons of water per day, which over a 150-day growing season comes out to 3,400 liters (900 gallons) of water per plant. Legal growers have found their once-unrestricted water use under increased scrutiny as the state confronted extreme drought conditions. (Some grows in Humboldt County have literally sucked creeks dry, leaving salmon and steelhead to flop and die in puddles.)Under a law passed last June, growers now have to secure official water rights to get a growing permit.Illegal grows, of course, are another story. Gabriel has estimated that trespass grows use 50 percent more water because of less efficient irrigation systems and added stressors like pests, pathogens, and drier weather at higher elevations. Worse, some trespass growers leave their irrigation systems running around the clock throughout the year, even when nothing is growing. Multiply that by hundreds of thousands of plants and you have a serious water problem. One study by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife estimated that trespass marijuana grows used about 300 million gallons of water per square mile, roughly the same as almond orchards.To put things into perspective, by Gabriel’s estimates the 1.1 million illegal pot plants removed in California in 2016 would have used somewhere around 1.3 billion gallons of water — as much as 10,000 average California households do in a year. He calculates that this Rattlesnake site alone could have used enough water in a single season to fill seven Olympic pools.Near one of the springs, an empty jar of ibuprofen lies on the ground. This is where the one grower was caught: Fleeing a K9 dog, he took a bad jump and broke his leg. “I gave him some pills — he appreciated that,” Gabriel says. Not all of Gabriel’s interactions with growers are so friendly: He once had to help tackle a grower who had thrown off a law enforcement officer twice his size.To keep growers from returning and replanting the site, it will have to be remediated, returned to something like it was before it was planted. By Gabriel’s calculations that would mean removing around 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) of irrigation tubing and hauling out all the trash in 50-gallon bags, probably 40 or 50 in all. The springs will have to be rebuilt to function naturally, an expensive and lengthy process. This site is close enough to a road that all the crap can be hauled out on foot; more remote sites require helicopters.Remediation requires money and manpower, both of which are scarce to nonexistent — just as they are on the law enforcement end. Out of the roughly 80 grow sites Gabriel and his team have investigated since 2014, they have been able to remediate just 29 so far. “We’d like to get that to a hundred percent, but there’s just no money for it,” he says. “Right now it’s all soft money, grants through our NGO, volunteers helping. I’m on the cusp of putting up a GoFundMe site. Next I’ll try selling cookies.”He nudges a grimy digital scale with his boot. “How do you clean up hundreds of sites?” he says, with an edge of bitterness in his voice. “That’s a lot of bake sales.”* * *The biggest trespass grow sites are broken up into dozens of smaller subplots, making it less likely every plot will be busted — and also spreading out the environmental impact. “It used to be a single gaping wound, like a bullet hole,” Gabriel says. “Now it’s a shotgun.”Last September, the IERC team surveyed two grow complexes in Lassen National Forest. Together they covered 2.6 square kilometers (one square mile), the largest site the team has ever seen. There were 30 camps in all, each with its own cache of rodenticide, and more than 65 kilometers (40 miles) of irrigation tubing that sucked up 269,000 liters (71,000 gallons) of spring water a day.They also found the carcasses of a bear (Ursus americanus) and a gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Test results are still pending, but they’re reasonably sure the fox, at least, is full of poison. Right next to it was the carcass of a turkey vulture (Cathartes aura); by all appearances, it took a bite or two and dropped dead. As he was taking samples, Gabriel watched flies land on the fox and die within seconds. “That night was the longest shower I ever took,” he says.Twenty years after giving the thumbs up to medicinal marijuana, Californians voted in November to allow anyone over 21 to buy pot legally. By some estimates, Proposition 64 could double the state marijuana market to $6.6 billion by 2020. But as long as the plant is still illegal in other states, the demand that fuels trespass grows will continue.* * *Gabriel knows he’s fighting the good fight. He also knows he can’t keep going like this forever. Almost all his working hours are eaten up by “drug stuff” now. The raids, the long field days of surveys and remediation, the endless presentations and interviews: It’s rewarding — but draining, too.He’d like to train other researchers and law enforcement officers to identify and remove chemical threats at grow sites. If enough people learn to do what he does, then he can step aside and become just another researcher again. “But if I stopped right now, it would be gone,” he says.The idea of moving away comes up a lot at dinner, he says. The legal-growing boom is making Humboldt County a crazy place: Real estate is through the roof, and the murder rate just hit an all-time high. Gabriel’s mother is from Michoacan, and a lot of what he’s seeing in California is starting to sound like the stories he hears from south of the border. “I worry about raising a family here,” he says. “You do it for your kid, but you have to be there for your kid.”The legal and illegal marijuana markets are different beasts, with different suppliers and customers, but in the end it’s all about growing the same plant. Even as the industry as a whole goes more mainstream, the ever-changing jumble of law and jurisdiction between different states and the federal government will encourage entrepreneurs and criminals to take advantage of blind spots and blurred lines.As far as Gabriel and many others are concerned, only a uniform national marijuana policy could potentially resolve the issue. But if President Trump’s cabinet nominations are any indication, we may instead be in for a revival of the old-school drug war that President Obama let languish. Many of Trump’s cabinet picks, including Jeff Sessions as Attorney General and Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency, have opposed marijuana reform or legalization in various ways during their careers. Even more ominously, a bill introduced in the House in January proposes to completely eliminate the law enforcement functions of the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management and turn those duties over to the states. And some members of Congress have been pushing to entirely de-fund the Drug Enforcement Administration’s marijuana eradication program, whose budget has already dropped from $18 million to $14 million. California received more than a third of the funds in 2015.As long as pot is still illegal in some parts of the U.S., the demand for illegally grown marijuana will persist. And as long as there are places where it’s cheaper and less risky to grow it, that is where it will happen. In the meantime, wildlife and the environment — and likely pot smokers themselves — will pay a price we’re only beginning to understand.This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: The Life-Changing Magic of Mushrooms, The Different Stakes of Male and Female Birth Control"

WertheimerDropping a handout with a photo on each student’s desk, the teacher Kathryn Leslie asked the teens to study the picture of Richard Spencer, the leader of the “alt-right” movement who advocates for a homeland just for whites. There was Spencer, the image of confidence, smiling in a suit coat and open-collared shirt as he leaned against a brick wall.Does Spencer, Leslie asked her Brookline High School students, fit the stereotype of a white nationalist? Spencer had no visible tattoos advertising white pride or hate against non-whites or non-Christians. He also had graduated from college.“Sometimes, our stereotype of a white nationalist can be different than a young, articulate, clean-cut guy who espouses lots of racist views,” said Leslie. The high-school sophomores and their pair of teachers at the suburban Boston high school were tackling a subject that many adults have struggled to understand — the so-called alt-right movement and how it and its main figurehead, Spencer, managed to surface in the mainstream in the 2016 election and afterward. It’s a topic many teachers would prefer to avoid, given how polarized America has become over the election of President Donald Trump and anything remotely related.RELATED: Will The Alt-Right Promote a New Kind of Racist Genetics? The subject, though, was a natural for Leslie and Malcolm Cawthorne, who co-teach a course about race and identity in America and how it plays out in students’ lives, school, town, and nation. Cawthorne, who is black, recruited Leslie, who is white, to co-teach the elective because he wanted students to realize that many whites care about confronting racism. He and Leslie teach in a school that has gone from 71 percent white two decades ago to 55 percent now. They are helping their students, many of whom identify with more than one race, sort out their own racial and ethnic identities in two sections of the course.Spencer, who’s credited with coining the term alt-right nearly a decade ago, made national news last November after The Atlantic published a clip of him addressing an alt-right conference in Washington, D.C. He got his group of white male followers to echo his “Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail Victory” rallying cry. Many in the room flashed a “Heil Hitler” type of salute.Spencer’s and the alt-right (short for alternative right) movement’s stances conflict with common mores in American society, the Brookline teachers said.“When it feels more partisan, we walk more of a tightrope. For the ‘alt-right,’ I didn’t feel we had to walk a tightrope,” said Leslie, who viewed teaching about the alt-right as akin to teaching about the KKK. Racism ought to be a non-partisan subject, she said.Yet, many teachers, regardless of where they stand politically, might lump the alt-right and Spencer into the too-hot-to-touch category. Even during the 2016 campaign, many teachers were afraid of talking about anything related to the election, according to a Southern Poverty Law Center survey, “The Trump Effect, The impact of the presidential campaign on our nation’s schools.” A little more than 40 percent of the roughly 2,000 teachers surveyed said they were hesitant to teach about the election out of concern of backlash from their communities, school administrators, and parents. Those fears have only heightened. In a November survey of 10,000 teachers, also by Teaching Tolerance, the proportion of teachers nervous to teach about the election and the post-election season rose a little higher to 46 percent. “We’re hearing from teachers that they’re afraid to talk in favorable terms about diversity, that they really are afraid of being accused of partisanship now and the line about what is partisan has moved since the election,” said Maureen Costello, the author of the Trump Effect report and director of the Teaching Tolerance project at the Southern Poverty Law Center.The relative newness of the alt-right also makes some teachers leery of teaching about it, Costello and others added. Her project’s website provides educational resources to about 500,000 people a month on race and other topics related to prejudice. Teaching Tolerance hopes to create resources on the alt-right for teachers for use next school year. Students, she said, need to learn about extremism of all kinds and how it works for various reasons, including avoiding getting swept up into it themselves.The white-nationalist groups, based on their tactics, seem to believe that teens and 20-somethings are particularly susceptible to their messaging, said Oren Segal, the director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. Segal noted that the groups are aiming for a younger demographic by reaching out through social media and trying to set up talks on college campuses or disseminate fliers there. Two groups connected to the alt-right, Identity Evropa and American Vanguard, have been responsible for many of the fliers, according to the ADL. Last May, Spencer and the head of the Identity Evropa group held an event at the University of California at Berkeley. As of March 28, the ADL has counted 124 incidents of white-supremacist fliers showing up on 90 different college campuses in 32 states since the school year began, Segal said. Spencer, who also made a highly publicized visit to Texas A&M University in December, announced his own college-campus tour, further fueling concerns about the alt-right.RELATED: A ‘One-Stop Shop’ for the Alt-RightSpencer, Segal added, presents an alt-right follower as someone different from a Neo-Nazi skinhead, but that’s a façade. “All it is, make no mistake, is a repackaging of white supremacy,” he said.The common civic norm of disavowing overt and explicit expressions of racism has not changed, said Meira Levinson, a professor of education at Harvard University.“But the question is, how quickly and to what extent will there be a shift?” said Levinson, who has been coaching educators on how to navigate the 2016 election in their classroom. “It is the case already, thanks to Trump’s tweets, statements, and rallies, that he has been redefining certain civic norms and values that had been seen as common and unproblematic.”Teachers always have taught about controversial issues and have the leeway to push students to think critically about presidential policies. They should not equate teaching about the alt-right to teaching against Trump, said Christopher Martell, an assistant professor and program director of social-studies education at Boston University. Rather, Martell continued, they ought to approach the alt-right like they would a lesson about apartheid in South Africa or the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s. Teachers also should keep in mind that, after winning the election, Trump publicly disavowed the alt-right.In the 2000s, teachers grappled with similar decisions about whether to dedicate some of their curriculum to the gay-marriage debate, recalled Martell, who was teaching social studies at the time. Very quickly, public opinion on gay marriage in the country overall shifted toward acceptance, with roughly 55 percent of Americans supporting it in 2016 (compared to 35 percent in 2001). Teachers, when the future of gay marriage was still undecided, were torn over whether to teach about the controversial current event. Many were unsure how to address the topic, if at all, and fretted how parents and students would react. They also questioned how to keep their own biases out of the classrooms.But teaching about controversial topics this school year has been particularly challenging, Martell and other education researchers acknowledged. Teachers are reporting witnessing racist and xenophobic views they did not know were so present in their schools. A high-school teacher from the state of Washington wrote in comments on the Teaching Tolerance survey: “In over 15 years of teaching high school, this is the first year that swastikas are appearing all over school furniture.” Or a student in the hall chanting, “White power.”What she used to think was non-controversial to teach has changed, said Meghan O’Keefe, who has taught English for a dozen years in Chicago Public Schools. “A lot of people have confused the rhetoric the president used to get elected with making it okay to express racist ideas again,” O’Keefe said. “A lot of people believe they have the right to be racist and that we have to honor that as a legitimate point of view.”That kind of atmosphere makes her wary about introducing a unit on the alt-right, she said.Teachers may be censoring themselves more than necessary when deciding what to teach, said Diana Hess, the dean of the School of Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Educators should use current events to help students learn about authentic political controversy, said Hess, who co-authored The Political Classroom with Paula McAvoy. Learning about the alt-right, for example, is a lesson in political literacy. Teachers should not ask students to decide whether the alt-right is a good thing, but they can teach how it came about and how it has affected the political system, Hess said.At Brookline High School, Cawthorne and Leslie were aware of the boundaries they must follow when designing the alt-right unit—and, so far, they haven’t gotten any pushback in response to their decision to teach it.“It’s not our job ethically to push kids to go against Trump. It’s not our job to indoctrinate,” said Cawthorne.Cawthorne and Leslie developed a class period devoted to the alt-right as part of a larger unit on white identity. Before tackling the alt-right, they talked to students about the concept of white identity and white fragility, the idea that whites can get so overwhelmed with guilt about the state of racism in American society that they simply cannot and will not talk about race. They also talked about how the concept of whiteness and who is white has changed in America as various groups of immigrants—whether they were Jews, Italians, or Irish—went from being considered second-class citizens and essentially of another race to part of the white majority. There was a diversity of whiteness in the 19th century that has largely disappeared, Cawthorne told the students.Discussions about the alt-right fit into lessons on the complexities surrounding just what it means to be white in America, the teachers said. To prompt nuanced discussion backed up by facts, they first gave students a news-article explainer about the alt-right, then pushed the students to describe what they thought followers of the alt-right believed. The students saw the movement as leaving out people of color and focusing on America as a country for whites. They viewed the alt-right as a way for white people to take pride in themselves when they feel they have been pushed aside.Then, the teachers played a recording of a 23-minute episode of the Revealpodcast titled “A Frank Conversation with a White Nationalist.” Al Letson, an African American journalist and anchor of the podcast, interviewed Spencer. Letson, in his introduction, described Spencer as a white nationalist who “sees Trump’s election as the first solid steps toward a new post-America whites-only nation.” (Spencer did not respond to emails requesting his input for this story.)During the Reveal interview, Spencer lamented how Americans now lived in a world with a “white-guilt complex,” where it was seen as good if a person of color became a CEO.RELATED: The Psychological Approach to Educating KidsLetson countered: “What you’re talking about is the country is trying to find a balance where everybody gets a seat at the table.”On a few occasions, Spencer referred to whites as “my people” and said his notion of a white-ethno state was a grand goal. “We want a new type of society that would actually be a homeland for all white people,” he told Letson. Several students in the classroom cringed.Letson, who kept his tone civil and polite just like Spencer’s, pushed harder. “What’s the difference between you and the racists that hung people up from trees? What’s the difference between you and the Klansmen that burned crosses on people’s lawns?”Spencer refused to comment on what he called “hypothetical Klansmen.” When Letson kept pushing, Spencer said he was not those people. Asked who he is, Spencer said he’s a European person, born in Massachusetts and raised in Texas, who likes mountain biking.Nearly every student gasped as soon as Spencer said Massachusetts. That Massachusetts, viewed as generally a liberal place, was Spencer’s birth state flabbergasted many of the teens — even though their own school has not been immune from racist and anti-Semitic graffiti and incidents during the past few years.Asked to react to the podcast, nearly every student raised a hand to offer an opinion. While many could understand how white nationalism might increase as a reaction to the country’s changing demographics, some were shocked to hear that Spencer would want whites to live in a separate country. Others said little surprised them, given personal experience with racism in Brookline, a town known for its liberal-progressive bent.The phrase “my people” particularly grated on white students. Many see themselves as more than simply white. Their religion and family backgrounds play a role. One is part Syrian. Many are Jewish, given Brookline’s large Jewish community; Brookline is home to 14 synagogues and Jewish worship groups; combined with neighboring Newton and Brighton, it makes up nearly 30 percent of the Boston area’s Jewish population, according to a Brandeis University study. What does “white” even mean?The student Hassan Abdirahman, who is black and Somalian American, thought it weird that as a white man in America, Spencer described himself as European. “Why doesn’t he go to Europe?” Abdirahman asked.Cawthorne advised students to be careful about wishing the same thing for Spencer that he wished for people of color by advocating for a country or homeland for whites only. In Spencer’s interview with Letson, he rejected the idea that blacks and whites could live in peace together, saying he thought the two races actually kind of hate each other.Cawthorne, as a teacher, said he wanted Abdirahman to think more deeply about what he was saying because racists have told black people they should go back to their own country. “I find it ironic he didn’t say where in Europe,” he said of Spencer’s description of his own identity. “I identify myself as African American, no hyphen, because where in Africa?”Satchel Tsai, who is half white and half Asian, saw Letson’s handling of the interview as a model for other Americans. “It was very civil. It’s important to be civil when you talk about race,” said Tsai.While Tsai had previously read news about the alt-right, her classmate, Richard Desir, who is black and Haitian American, had never heard of it. He was perturbed that Spencer could not understand that people of color did not have a chance to succeed for such a long time and that there still isn’t an even playing field based on race.Alexis Raitt, who’s Jewish, wrinkled her face in disgust throughout most of the podcast. She had heard of the white-nationalist movement but hearing the smooth-talking Spencer in his own words was chilling for her. The 38-year-old Spencer, according to a profile of him in Mother Jones, had made it as far as a Duke University doctoral program before dropping out. Raitt normally would have seen someone like Spencer as ignorant and uneducated but he was educated. Listening to Spencer made her want to go out and educate peers that this kind of thinking existed.“Some people in our class didn’t know about it. That is enough to make it worth teaching,” she said.Sari Gubar, also Jewish, speculated that schools’ emphasis on European history could make people like Spencer feel empowered to believe that ‘Yeah, Europeans did it all.’ She told her teachers that the ideas Spencer promoted were “really creepy.”“Yes, it should be creepy,” Leslie said. “If you weren’t freaked out right now, we wouldn’t be doing our job.”This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: The Life-Changing Magic of Mushrooms, The Different Stakes of Male and Female Birth Control"

Security Council, “How many more children have to die before Russia cares?”Haley’s statement was a response to a chemical weapons attack the day before in Syria’s Idlib province that killed scores of people, including many children, and provoked international condemnation. The U.S. alleges that Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime was behind the killings, dropping sarin gas from its aircraft on the town of Khan Sheikhoun.Russia has tried to absolve its Syrian ally of responsibility for the attack, saying that rebel fighters possessed the gas and that bombs merely hit a depot storing the agent. Chemical weapons experts and Syria analysts, however, say the Kremlin’s claim is untrue and does not fit the facts of how sarin gas actually works.Haley, who at certain points in her address held up photos showing the bodies of children killed in the attack, also scoffed at Russia’s allegation that rebels were at fault.“Time and time again, Russia uses the same false narrative to deflect attention from their allies in Damascus. Time and time again, without any factual basis, Russia attempts to place blame on others,” Haley said. “The truth is that Assad, Russia, and Iran have no interest in peace.” Haley gave her speech at an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council, where the U.S., Britain and France proposed a draft resolution that blames Assad for the attack. Russia is expected to use its veto power to shoot down the resolution, as it has repeatedly done on past occasions when the council aimed to introduce measures against the Syrian government.Haley concluded her speech with the vague suggestion that the U.S. may act unilaterally if the U.N. fails to respond to Syria’s chemical weapon violations. “There are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action,” she said.In her few months as U.N. ambassador, Haley, formerly the Republican governor of South Carolina, has issued staunch condemnations of Russia’s foreign policy. Her first public remarks at the council included placing blame on the Kremlin for instigating a surge in violence in eastern Ukraine, and she has said that Russia was involved in the 2016 presidential election. Haley’s message at the U.N. has often been starkly different from President Donald Trump’s expressions of admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his talk of detente with Russia.Parts of Haley’s remarks on Wednesday closely echoed a speech that former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power gave in December, when she rebuked Russia, Iran, and Assad for their part in atrocities during the battle for the Syrian city of Aleppo.“Are you truly incapable of shame? Is there literally nothing that can shame you?” Power asked then. “Is there no act of barbarism against civilians, no execution of a child, that gets under your skin?”Despite Haley’s comments, it’s unclear whether the U.S. will go beyond condemnations in terms of taking action against Assad or pressuring Russia to use its influence to push for a peace process in Syria. The U.S. and the international community have for years issued harsh denunciations of the Syrian government, and of Russia’s military intervention, but these have resulted in few concrete actions. Trump also addressed the attack Wednesday, saying that his “attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much” following the gas attack. But the president refused to go into detail about whether the U.S. would take any actions to respond to the killings.“I’m not saying I’m doing anything one way or the other,” Trump told reporters."

The first time, 25 years ago, she was fleeing the Eritrean regime with her husband toward the Arabian Peninsula, with hopes for a better future.The second time, in 2015, they fled in the opposite direction to escape war in Yemen. This time, they went with fewer hopes and “no future,” she says.They are among thousands of refugees fleeing in both directions across the narrow passage of water that separates the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa.The desperate choices these refugees face were horrifyingly illustrated this month when a boat carrying around 150 Somali refugees was attacked by a helicopter gunship and military ship after it departed from the Yemeni rebel-held port Hodeidah. At least 42 refugees were killed.Houthi rebels blamed the Saudi-led coalition for the March 16 attack, which the coalition denied. Officials believe the boat was headed for Sudan.The closest country for refugees from Yemen is Djibouti, where Ali and her family now live in a refugee camp in Obock, a small port on the coast facing Yemen.Djibouti, strategically located on the slender Bab el-Mandeb strait, has long been a major transit country for migrants and refugees attempting to make their way to Yemen, and often onward seeking work opportunities in Saudi Arabia or Jordan.The war has not stopped migrants from continuing to take boats to Yemen. More than 117,000 refugees and migrants, mainly Ethiopians and Somalis, arrived in Yemen last year according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.“The number of migrants going to Yemen have not really changed since the war, there are always people who go despite the danger,” says Nada Mahmoud, migration response center manager of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) office in Obock. “They are convinced that the danger is not going to fall on them.”Since the war broke out in Yemen two years ago, boats have also been going back toward Africa. They carry Yemenis fleeing war as well as African migrants and refugees who ended up in the middle of the conflict and had no choice but to turn around.Ali and her husband came to Yemen as refugees from the authoritarian Eritrean regime. They eked out a living in the impoverished country, with Ali selling homemade Eritrean bread called injera on the streets of Taiz, Yemen’s third largest city. Her husband found odd jobs and other people often stepped in to help them make ends meet. They had four children, who now speak only Arabic rather than their parents’ mother tongue.But in March 2015, as the U.S.-backed coalition started bombing the Houthi rebels who had taken over swathes of the country, including the capital Sanaa, Ali and her family decided to leave. More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in the conflict, while around 2 million people are displaced inside Yemen and thousands have fled the country.“The war was difficult – a lot of bombings. [So] we fled to the sea,” Ali says. “We cannot go back to Yemen. We cannot go back to Eritrea. We want to go out, to Europe.”Djibouti shelters around 26,000 refugees, according to UNHCR. “When the crisis in Yemen started, many countries did not accept to host the refugees,” says Amira Abd el-Khalek, UNHCR’s communications officer in Djibouti. The small country has “a welcoming spirit,” she says.There are three official refugee camps in the country. Ali Addeh and Holl Holl in the south mainly host Somalis, Ethiopians and Eritreans, some of whom have been there for almost 30 years. Following the recent wave of arrivals from Yemen, UNHCR and Djiboutian authorities constructed Markazi camp in Obock, where Ali and her family live.Around 1,500 people live there in tents and small huts, according to UNHCR. Directly opposite the camp is the reception center of the U.N.’s migration agency, the International Organization for Migration (IOM).IOM is in charge of organizing the repatriation of refugees and migrants from Yemen to Djibouti and on to their native country, where possible. All of this requires rigorous logistics and the approval of the Saudi-led coalition to get access to Yemen’s maritime waters and ports. IOM has evacuated around 4,000 migrants by sea and 2,000 by air since the outbreak of war.Obock has temperatures above 122F (50C) in summer and a harsh desert wind called khamsin. “It’s like a sand tornado, with everything, sand, garbage … You can’t eat, you can’t sleep, it gets everywhere, sometimes it blows tents away,” says Irsaal, a Yemeni refugee in her late forties living in Markazi camp.Except for the wind, the heat and the sand, there is not much in Obock. Official records say 20,000 people live here, but people in the town say the true figure is closer to 5,000. The economy officially relies on fishing, unofficially on migrant trafficking.The port lies very close to the Yemeni coast. So close that some residents of Markazi camp sometimes go back to Yemen – to visit family, pick up official papers, or just be home for a while – like Irsaal’s sister who went back to Aden with her family.“I begged her not to go. She said she’d rather die there than live here,” Irsaal says. “I’ve not heard from her for six months.”Irsaal’s husband was killed in a bombing that destroyed her apartment building in Yemen. She fled to Djibouti in the spring of 2015.She has painted the walls of her hut pink and installed a television to pass the time. She is determined to keep going for the sake of her teenage son who fled with her. But she cannot get used to her new surroundings. “There are spiders, mice, scorpions … We used to live like princes, now we’re like beggars,” she says.Irsaal fears they may be stuck in the desert for a while. “The war is not over, it has just begun,” she says. This uncertain future is shared by thousands of Yemenis, as well as the refugees who thought that crossing the Red Sea would lead to a better life.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

He said there were around 10 attackers, including two suicide bombers.A total of 31 bodies were taken to hospital, including 14 belonging to policemen, said Nawfal Mustafa, a doctor at the city’s main hospital. The death toll rose in the morning as more bodies were found, belonging to civilians killed in their shops.The attacks targeted a police checkpoint and the house of a police colonel, who was killed with four members of his family, officers said.Two suicide attackers detonated their vests when surrounded by police, and three others were killed in separate clashes.Five militants are thought to be hiding and Mahmoud said Tikrit authorities had declared a curfew on Wednesday. Sporadic gunfire could be heard in the morning.The attacks come as a U.S.-backed offensive is underway to dislodge Islamic State from the remaining districts under its control in Mosul, 225 km (140 miles) away, the group’s last major urban stronghold in Iraq.The militants overran about a third of Iraq’s territory nearly three years ago, capturing most Sunni Arab cities located north and west of Baghdad, including Tikrit.Iraqi forces and Iranian-backed Shi’ite militias drove the militants away from Tikrit two years ago. Tikrit is the home region of Saddam Hussein, the former president toppled in the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq."
20,ARTS & CULTURE,A Museum In Germany Is Asking Designers To Give Peace A New Sign,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peace-sign-logo-design_us_58e4ea10e4b0f4a923b3dcfa,Give peace a chance... and a new logo?,2017-04-05,"During a 1963 anti-nuclear demonstration from Aldermaston to London, a peace symbol frames the marchers and their banners.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e500aa16000020004d8e37.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A museum in Frankfurt wants to give peace a sign. A new sign, that is.The Schirn Kunsthalle museum recently issued an open call inviting designers both professional and amateur to submit new graphic images that communicate the contemporary notion of peace.“We feel it is high time for a new peace logo,” Philipp Demandt, the director of the Schirn Kunsthalle museum, wrote in the invitation. “A logo for today that reflects our current notion of peace.” The hunt for the next peace sign comes in conjunction with the exhibition “PEACE,” on view at the museum this summer.The current reigning peace sign symbol was created in 1958 for the first Aldermaston march, a massive demonstration advocating for nuclear disarmament. Among the hordes of protesters who marched over 50 miles from Trafalgar Square in London to the site of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment was Gerald Holtom, a designer and art school grad. Many, many protesters raised original, politically-charged imagery above their heads as they marched, but Holtom’s image was the one that stuck ― it was adopted by the Direct Action Committee against nuclear war.While Holtom’s peace sign ― created without copyright ― might look radically simple upon first glance, there is some purportedly heavy symbolism lurking within the circle inscribed with three intersecting lines.First, the symbol allegedly references the semaphore signals for the letters “N” and “D,” alluding to nuclear disarmament. (Semaphore is a telegraphy system meant to convey information at a distance using visual signals like flags; “N” looks like this and “D” looks like this.)But yet another inspiration behind the peace sign reportedly comes from the annals of art history, specifically the 1814 painting “The Third of May 1808” by Francisco de Goya. The image depicts a Spanish man standing before a firing squad of Napoleon’s army, arms spread in surrender, a Christlike image rooted in Spanish history. The revolutionary painting captured the horrors of war in a single, emotionally riveting image. In a letter to Hugh Brock, the editor of Peace News, Holtom explained his motivation for the sign. “I was in despair. Deep despair,” he wrote. “I drew myself: the representative of an individual in despair, with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of Goya’s peasant before the firing squad. I formalized the drawing into a line and put a circle round it. It was ridiculous at first and such a puny thing.”Holtom’s symbol caught on nearly immediately, its exterior simplicity evoking authentic feelings of despair and political urgency. Today, however, the Schirn Kunsthalle believes it is time for the next iteration of peace imagery, one that more aptly communicates what peace means at this particular moment in human history. While Holtom’s image was made in response to the looming threat of nuclear violence, there are a barrage of new issues threatening safety and harmony among humans today. Participants are invited to submit their peace logos for review until May 8. The winner will receive €1,000 and his or her logo will be used in advertising efforts accompanying the “PEACE” exhibition. You can also vote for one of the top 10 logos online in May to help determine the Audience Prize. "

The attack, carried out by a British-born assailant near the Houses of Parliament and on Westminster Bridge, left four people dead and at least 40 injured. Prince William laid a wreath at the Innocent Victims Memorial and delivered a reading during the service. After the service, Kate, Will and Harry met with victims of the attack and their families. Melissa Cochran, the American woman whose husband, Kurt Cochran, died in the attack, was brought into the abbey in a wheelchair after sustaining a broken leg and rib in the incident.

24,POLITICS,House Democrats Are Inviting Trump To Expand Social Security,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-democrats-social-security-expansion_us_58e567fbe4b06a4cb30f01aa,"One way or another, Connecticut Rep. John Larson's bill is a political winner.",2017-04-05,"Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), seen speaking to the media in 2012, introduced legislation to expand Social Security on Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e569a12c00006268ff2846.jpeg?cache=ND7OjbXxV2&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.) introduced a bill Wednesday to expand Social Security benefits and shore up the program’s finances.The Social Security 2100 Act already has 156 co-sponsors, all of them Democrats, giving it the support of some 80 percent of the party’s House caucus.Surrounded by seniors advocacy groups and fellow Democratic House members at a press conference on Capitol Hill, Larson said he was “optimistic” about the bill’s prospects despite Republicans’ control of both chambers of Congress.A key reason: President Donald Trump’s campaign-trail promises to protect the program.“We do have a president who did stand out, in a very difficult time when he didn’t have to, and talked about not just preserving Social Security, but expanding it,” Larson said. “So we think this is an opportunity for us to seize on what the president of the United States has said and join with us.”In fact, Trump vowed only that he would not reduce benefits, and his first budget did not address Social Security at all.Larson’s staff shared the legislation and related materials with the White House, and is hoping to arrange a meeting to discuss it. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill or confirm that it had received Larson’s overture.Seeking Trump’s cooperation on Social Security is an unlikely strategy for congressional Democrats, who have been locked in conflict with the president virtually since he took office.And even if Trump were personally inclined to consider a bill that expands benefits, he has surrounded himself with ultra-conservative figures like budget director Mick Mulvaney, a former member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. Mulvaney claims he is trying to convince Trump of the need to dramatically scale back Social Security and Medicare.Instead, Larson appears to be trying a less aggressive variation of what Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has done in the Senate, using Trump’s campaign promises to protect Social Security against him. Sanders invoked those comments when introducing his own expansion bill back in February.If Democrats constantly remind voters of Trump’s pledges, the lawmakers’ thinking goes, he will either feel pressure to stick to them, or suffer politically if he does not.Should Trump take Larson up on his offer to collaborate, however, he may find the legislation more palatable than other progressive Social Security expansion bills that seek to raise taxes on more people.Larson’s Social Security 2100 Act would increase benefits across the board through a change in Social Security’s benefit formula. It would also adopt a cost-of-living adjustment tailored for older Americans that has historically been more generous, and create a minimum benefit that would be 125 percent of the poverty level.The legislation would pay for these increases by subjecting earnings of $400,000 or more to the 6.2 percent payroll tax. (At present, Americans only pay into Social Security on the first $127,200 of their earnings, a limit that climbs in tandem with the average wage index.) The added revenue would also enable Social Security to pay out promised benefits for the next 75 years, according to an analysis by the Social Security Administration’s chief actuary.Sanders’ Social Security expansion bill, by contrast, would pay for its benefit increases by taxing incomes of $250,000 or more.And Larson’s legislation would cut the taxes of some Social Security beneficiaries by raising the income threshold for seniors’ benefits to be taxed.The Connecticut Democrat’s Social Security expansion bill comes as Democrats seek to go on the offensive after the collapse of the Republican Obamacare replacement bill.The progressive wing of the party, in particular, views this moment as an ideal time to generate support for single-payer health insurance, or “Medicare for all.” A universal Medicare bill introduced by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has picked up a dozen more co-sponsors since the GOP health care bill’s defeat last month.Asked whether the two legislative pushes were part of a common strategy by Democrats to get behind ambitious progressive reforms, Larson demurred, calling health care and Social Security “separate issues entirely.”Larson does not plan to join Conyers’ bill, since he likes the idea of preserving both private and public health insurance options to ensure competition. Instead, he intends to introduce legislation that would lower the Medicare eligibility age to 50.However, Social Security Works, a group advocating for Social Security expansion that backs Larson’s bill, supports single-payer health insurance.Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, said the organization welcomes a variety of measures that would increase access to Medicare.“This is the debate I want to have,” Lawson said of disagreements between Democrats who want to lower the Medicare age and those who would like to make the program universal. “We’re going to support Bernie Sanders’ Medicare-for-all bill when it comes out,” Lawson said. “And we’ll support Larson’s push to lower the age to 50, because both of those are wise policy and politics.”"

26,POLITICS,Do Republicans Have Amnesia Over How They Treated Merrick Garland?,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/merrick-garland-neil-gorsuch-scotus_us_58e554e9e4b06a4cb30ee0c3,"“We don’t conduct partisan filibusters of Supreme Court nominees,"" said one GOP senator.",2017-04-05,"“When you win the White House, you have the ability to appoint people to the Supreme Court,” says Sen. Lindsey Graham.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e569e216000020004d903e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― There’s a surreal aspect to this week’s Senate confirmation fight over Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch: The more reasons Republicans give for why he deserves a vote, the more they reinforce how badly they treated President Barack Obama’s pick for the court, Merrick Garland.GOP senators spent most of 2016 preventing Garland from getting a vote. Obama nominated him in March, and Republicans, who controlled the Senate, ignored him. They denied Garland a hearing. Some wouldn’t even meet with him. He was a moderate pick whom many Republicans actually liked, and a respected judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They just didn’t want Obama to fill the empty court seat.Yet, now that President Donald Trump’s nominee is scheduled for a key vote on Thursday and Democrats plan to filibuster him (which won’t stop him from being confirmed), Republicans are outraged that Democrats would treat a Supreme Court nominee this way. Their arguments for why Gorsuch deserves a vote sound, well, familiar.“When you win the White House, you have the ability to appoint people to the Supreme Court,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Monday. “I’m not going to be part of a Senate where Democrats get their judges and Republicans can never get theirs.”“I’m very disappointed in my colleagues to politicize this the way they have,” scolded Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) on Monday.“All they can come up with are facts that have absolutely nothing to do with his qualifications as a jurist,” said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).These are all points being made, without irony, by the same senators who opposed even giving a hearing to Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. Democrats made these exact arguments last year to explain why Garland deserved a vote. It’s easy enough to imagine; just swap in “Garland” for “Gorsuch” as GOP senators explain why Trump’s nominee deserves fair treatment.“We are simply asking for a fair vote. A vote!” Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said Wednesday. “Let us move past these political games.”“The president has nominated an exceptionally qualified judge to take Justice Scalia’s seat,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Judiciary Committee and refused to schedule a hearing for Garland all year. “We don’t conduct partisan filibusters of Supreme Court nominees.”“I do not believe Judge Gorsuch is getting a fair shake in today’s Senate,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said Wednesday.It’s hard to believe these senators don’t see how their own words fly in the face of how they handled Garland’s nomination. They never gave him a committee hearing, yet some are mad that Democrats opposed Gorsuch in his. “Every Democrat voted no,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lamented on Monday. “Not based on qualifications. Not based on temperament. Not based on anything in his record.”Of course, when it looked like Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would win the presidency last fall, it was Cruz who said Republicans might block future Supreme Court nominees indefinitely and argued that the court functions just fine with eight justices instead of nine.One of Republicans’ complaints this week is that Democrats are breaking with precedent by vowing to filibuster Gorsuch. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been mentioning it regularly and tweeting about it.In a technical sense, he’s right. There has never been a party-line filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. But it was McConnell who led last year’s unprecedented and partisan effort to deny Garland a hearing or a vote ― a filibuster, in effect ― and argued that the next president should get to fill the court vacancy, even though Obama had a year left in his presidency. McConnell felt pretty good about doing it, too.“One of my proudest moments was when I looked at Barack Obama in the eye and I said, ‘Mr. President, you will not fill this Supreme Court vacancy,’” he boasted to constituents in August."

So it may come as surprise when Eric Trump agreed with those critics.“Nepotism is kind of a factor of life,” the president’s second oldest son told Forbes Tuesday. “We might be here because of nepotism, but we’re not still here because of nepotism. You know, if we didn’t do a good job, if we weren’t competent, believe me, we wouldn’t be in this spot.”The Trump sons’ promotions pose several potential conflicts of interest for their father. Most notably, the Emoluments clause, an obscure provision found in the Constitution, prohibits the president from receiving payments from foreign countries. The president no longer runs his namesake businesses, but he still profits off of them. Though he’s agreed not to discuss businesses with his sons ― ostensibly avoiding the appearance of using his political power for profit ― critics have found that claim hard to swallow.The federal anti-nepotism law doesn’t apply to the private sector, but it has been cited in another potential conflict of interest: the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner taking official White House positions. However, the Department of Justice has said that the law doesn’t apply their specific roles."
28,POLITICS,Trump Administration Won't Routinely Separate Families At The Border After All,Elise Foley and Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dhs-separating-families-border_us_58e50d4fe4b0f4a923b448b7,Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said he “can’t imagine” splitting up children and their mothers except under certain circumstances.,2017-04-05,"Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly prepares to testify during the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on April 5, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e50d7f1500002000c7e152.jpeg?cache=Qmd8CpRasO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on Wednesday he is not planning to routinely split up children and mothers at the U.S.-Mexico border, after previously alarming immigrant advocates by suggesting such a policy would help deter illegal border crossings. Speaking before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Kelly said he would separate families apprehended at the border “only if the situation at that point in time requires it” ― for example, if a mother is sick or addicted to drugs. He said he “can’t imagine” doing it unless there is reason to believe a child is in danger. Kelly’s statement, which followed vaguer assurances to senators last week, represents a rare walk-back by the Trump administration from a potential method of deterring unauthorized immigration. President Donald Trump has even taken a hard-line stance toward women and children fleeing violence in Central America, casting them as a dangerous drain on the U.S. regardless of their right to seek asylum. Kelly, who has said the administration’s policies are successfully bringing down the number of illegal entries, indicated last month that family separation could be part of those efforts. “I would do almost anything to deter the people from Central America to getting on this very, very dangerous network that brings them up through Mexico into the United States,” he said on CNN’s “The Situation Room” in March, confirming a report that DHS was considering separating families.Last week, the secretary denied he’d ever indicated he was considering splitting up families at the border as a method of deterrence. He also told Senate Democrats that he was not separating families at the border. Some interpreted that as a statement that DHS simply wasn’t currently separating families, but others believed it was a commitment to refrain from doing so in the future, except under extenuating circumstances.The latter interpretation was “fair,” Kelly told reporters at the time.At the hearing, Kelly left some wiggle room ― he said DHS policies would depend “on what’s going on on the ground,” but that keeping families together at the border “generally would be [his] approach.”He also told Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) that DHS officers and agents would need his approval to separate any families. Harris asked Kelly if he would provide written guidance on the policy, and he said he didn’t need to, because he’d done it verbally. “My staff knows already that they will not separate anyone unless I’m informed and [they] get my permission,” Kelly said. Kelly’s comments appeared to throw cold water on a proposal in the Texas legislature that would relax the standards for giving child care licenses to family detention centers. Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes proposed the Texas bill as a way to allow the federal government to lock up children with their mothers in immigrant detention indefinitely. To comply with a federal court ruling, most women apprehended at the border with their children are released from family detention after three weeks while their cases go through the immigration courts.Hughes and other Texas Republicans justified the bill last week at a state Senate committee hearing by saying it would keep the federal government from separating children from their mothers at the border. Reed Smith ― the regional vice president of GEO Group, the private prison contractor that runs the family detention center in Karnes City, Texas, as a for-profit enterprise ― also told legislators at the hearing that his company would likely have no choice but to convert the center into an adult facility unless it was licensed as a child care facility.With no place to lock up moms and kids together, Reed speculated, the Trump administration might instead separate families at the border. “There’s nothing in the immigration laws that says the mother and the children have to be housed together,” Smith told the committee. “There would be nowhere to put the children together [with their parents].”Kelly’s comments on Wednesday appeared to remove that concern.“The rationale provided for this bill was that families will be separated at the border,” Texas Sen. José Rodríguez (D) wrote in a statement to The Huffington Post. “This is simply not true ... We must treat people fleeing violence and national instability with greater dignity and respect, not jail them in for-profit prisons that cage families as though they were felons.” Immigrant rights advocates said that Kelly’s remarks were a positive step ― as long as he and border agents follow through and keep kids and their moms together. Systematically separating women and children at the border “would have been a cruel punishment for those fleeing harm and trying to find safety at our borders,” stated Katharina Obser, senior program officer at the Women’s Refugee Commission.“We have already documented that separating families causes immense harm and prevents access to legal protection in the United States,” Obser said. “Given that families will continue to flee countries where their lives are in danger – such a policy would likely drive families only further into the hands of traffickers or smugglers. WRC intends to monitor closely whether the experiences of families apprehended by immigration officials at the border match what Secretary Kelly has said.”This story has been updated with a statement from Texas Sen. José Rodríguez."

Mimi Walters (R-Calif.) in 2018. “This is a unique time in our history,” Min said in a press release Wednesday. “So much of what we value, what makes our communities in Orange County strong, and what makes America great is under attack. Congresswoman Mimi Walters is complicit in these attacks with her 100% support of Donald Trump and has proven herself deeply out of touch with residents in our communities.”Prior to teaching at UCI, Min served as the associate director for financial markets policy at the Center for American Progress, a leading liberal think tank. Min is the second Democrat to announce a challenge to Walters, who has held the Orange County seat since 2015. Earlier this week, consumer advocate Katie Porter announced her candidacy, accompanied by endorsements from Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).Min, meanwhile, has drawn support from local leaders, including former Irvine Mayor Sukhee Kang and former Irvine council member Mary Ann Gaido. Eager to take back the House from GOP control, Democrats have their sights set on several Orange County seats. Although the region is a longtime conservative stronghold in mostly-blue California, the county voted for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election — the first time the area sided with a Democrat since 1936.So far, the race is shaping up to be a referendum on President Donald Trump, with both candidates citing Walters’ support for the president’s legislative agenda. Min also criticized Walters for not holding public town halls, a move that has also drawn complaints from her constituents. While Porter has drawn national buzz for her high-profile endorsements and her role in the $25 billion mortgage settlement by Wall Street banks, Min’s establishment credentials and potential demographic edge (Min is Korean-American, and Irvine is home to one of the nation’s largest Korean populations) make him a formidable contender. But either candidate likely faces a tough race against Walters, who was re-elected last fall with 59 percent of the vote. With more than 18 months until Election Day, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is staying neutral for now.“Congressman Walters is very vulnerable this cycle, and her actions this year – including voting with President Trump’s agenda 100 percent of the time and supporting a disastrous repeal bill that would raise your costs and slap an age tax on older folks – have further clarified how out-of-touch she is with her constituents,” said DCCC spokesman Tyler Law. “It’s no surprise that there are very qualified candidates stepping up to provide the 45th District with the representation it deserves.” "

One tradition, beginning with Thomas Jefferson and running through Franklin Delano Roosevelt, presented Democrats as defenders of the common man against the predations of elite financiers. Another, epitomized by 19th century Bourbon Democrat Grover Cleveland and his 20th century disciple Bill Clinton, viewed big business as an engine of progress and prosperity.There are other traditions in the party’s history, some shameful (see: segregation) and others obsolete (Prohibition). But the Democratic Party has spent most of its earthly tenure defining itself through its economic agenda. By the time of the George W. Bush presidency, Democrats had evolved into the party of Economic Whatevz. If an economic program worked ― cool. If it didn’t ― well, that could be worked out. Voting rights, abortion rights, the Iraq War ― these were the pressing matters of principle. Economics, that was just a slate of numbers that needed to add up. The banking crash should have discredited this financial complacency. “We’re going to need an assload of food stamps if Wall Street blows up the economy again,” a House Democratic aide once griped to The Huffington Post, a comment that didn’t make the cut for a 2014 story on a new crop of (you guessed it) Wall Street Democrats. That staffer was voicing frustration with a party leadership that had essentially punted on the economic meltdown. A Democratic president had pursued Wall Street regulatory reforms while shrugging off the pursuit of criminal prosecutions for blatant fraud and agreeing to civil settlements that one of his top economic advisers now decries as a con job on the public.This toxic two-step played out in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primary, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) excoriating big banks as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defended her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs. What was a Good Democrat ― or the general public ― to think? It appears that not even Donald Trump can keep the modern Bourbon Democrats from the object of their hearts’ desire. On Tuesday, Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) voted to advance the nomination of Jay Clayton, a man who worked as the bailout attorney for Goldman Sachs, to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a regulator tasked with overseeing, among other big banks, Goldman Sachs.Clayton spent much of his confirmation hearing decrying cruel, counterproductive government regulations on “capital formation” while insisting he had no opinion about a rule that would require CEOs to disclose the ratio of their own pay to that of a typical company worker.“How exactly will Tester, Warner and Heitkamp explain to their constituents that they voted for a man to be Wall Street’s top cop whose only professional experience has been fighting to protect the interests of Wall Street’s most powerful institutions?” asks Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, a liberal group that advocates for tougher rules on banks and payday lenders. “They can spin and offer hollow rhetoric to excuse their actions, or they can simply point to their bulging campaign bank accounts.”Most Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee opposed Clayton’s nomination. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) excoriated him during the confirmation hearing and voted against him in committee. And not every Red State Democrat on the committee decided that a vote for a Wall Street elite was the way to win over constituents. Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) voted against Clayton, and others may join him when Clayton is up for a vote on the Senate floor.But the Warner-Heitkamp-Tester axis will be an important coalition for Democrats in the Trump era, as on-again, off-again Democratic donors like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon pursue bank deregulation under President Trump. Deregulating banks isn’t just about making it easier for bankers to pay themselves bigger salaries. It’s also about making it easier for banks to careen into crises that undermine ostensible Democratic priorities like preserving abortion rights, dealing with the racial wealth gap and not bombing the hell out of civilians.“It’s disappointing and unnecessary to see three Democratic senators line up with Trump’s agenda of enriching powerful corporations at the public’s expense,” notes Kurt Walters, campaign director for the liberal advocacy group Demand Progress. “Few states are filled with voters clamoring for a full-scale takeover of government positions by the most powerful corporate special interests in the country.”Warner, Heitkamp and Tester are often described as moderates ― politicians who don’t toe the party line. But they are better understood as Wall Street Democrats. Their collective willingness to support Trump’s SEC nominee, after all, demonstrates that there is no real party line against Wall Street ― Democratic leaders aren’t putting any feet down on the bailout attorney for Goldman Sachs and demanding that senators oppose his nomination. One cannot moderate partisanship by deviating from a party standard that does not exist. It’s a matter of simply swearing fealty to a different leader.Warner, Heitkamp and Tester declined to comment for this article. Clayton’s nomination will now be considered on the Senate floor."

Even Rasmussen Reports, whose numbers are often more conservative than those of other pollsters, found him with lower ratings in its March 27 poll.Ryan is most well-liked among Republicans, although only 57 percent of them viewed him favorably in Quinnipiac’s latest poll. Even among demographic groups that have most strongly supported President Donald Trump ― such as white voters without a college degree, people over the age of 65, and men ― Ryan doesn’t come close to a net positive approval rating.The speaker’s ratings were lower than those of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who had a 30 percent favorability rating.

His more recent decline tracks closely with that of the Trump administration, which suggests voters are associating Ryan with Trump."

Facebook announced a suite of new tools Wednesday to combat revenge porn on the site.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e5423016000020004d8f99.jpeg?cache=mr1sjgdgZK&ops=crop_137_440_2863_1423%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On Wednesday, Facebook unveiled a handful of new tools aimed at reducing the spread of so-called “revenge porn” on the site, a category Mark Zuckerberg defined as “any intimate photo shared without permission.”To be clear, Facebook has never permitted this type of content, and generally restricts nudity of all sorts. These new tools simply enable Facebook to remove a photo faster when a user reports it. Critically, they will also automatically flag the photo if it’s uploaded again elsewhere, thereby keeping Facebook censors from playing an endless game of whack-a-mole and scrapping photos one by one.“If someone tries to share the image after it’s been reported and removed,” Facebook Head of Global Safety Antigone Davis explained in a blog post on the subject, “we will alert them that it violates our policies and that we have stopped their attempt to share it.”The company said it typically also disables the accounts of people who share intimate images without permission.A spokesperson told The Huffington Post the initiative arose from a series of roundtables with women’s safety organizations.A 2016 study by the Data & Society Research Institute and the Center for Innovative Public Health Research found one in 25 Americans has been a victim of revenge porn, with that number skyrocketing to one in 10 women under the age of 30.It’s unclear just how widespread the revenge porn problem is on Facebook, and the company declined to share data to that effect with HuffPost, but given Facebook’s reach ― which includes Instagram ― there’s no doubt these tools will carry significant impact.The social networking giant pointed to a 2013 study from the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, noting the spread of “non-consensual intimate images” can be extremely emotionally distressing for victims.“It’s wrong, it’s hurtful, and if you report it to us, we will now use AI and image recognition to prevent it from being shared across all of our platforms,” Zuckerberg said in his post.He added the new tools will begin rolling out Wednesday on Facebook, Messenger and Instagram."

The CPB annually receives about $500 million from the federal government. The Trump administration has said that the country must cut spending in places like CPB so it can afford to keep the country safe by raising military spending, which the White House proposed increasing in the next fiscal year by $54 billion. But McChrystal takes issue with that dichotomous approach to running the country. The CPB, he said, is “a small public investment that pays huge dividends for Americans. And it shouldn’t be pitted against spending more on improving our military.”“That’s a false choice.”The 34-year veteran argued that public television teaches children to be “curious, resilient and empathetic,” filling a need by helpings kids learn “social-emotional skills like persistence and self-control” in homes where the parents aren’t always around. The suggested cuts to the CPB would hurt NPR and PBS, but prove devastating to local broadcast and radio stations, where more than 90 percent of CPB money is allocated. Many of those stations exist in more rural areas where educational resources are scarce, making them all the more valuable. McChrystal retired from the military in 2010 after Rolling Stone published an unflattering profile of him, in which those around him were highly critical of President Barack Obama and others in the administration. He has since founded a consulting firm.Last year, he said he would decline “any role” in the Trump administration. Today, he made clear that safety at home is established on different grounds than it is abroad. “We need to defend against weaknesses within and enemies without, using the tools of civil society and hard power,” he said. “We don’t have to pick one over the other.”"
34,POLITICS,Ivanka Trump Says She'll Push For Women's Equality -- But Not In A Pushy Way,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivanka-trump-women_us_58e50a97e4b0d0b7e166e5ac,"“Most of the impact I have, over time most people will not actually know about.” she says.",2017-04-05,"<br>In the CBS interview, Ivanka Trump dodged a question concerning criticism that she is “complicit” with the president’s agenda.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e50f0416000021004d8e6c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You’ve seen the photos. Finding a woman in the White House is the Where’s Waldo of 2017. And it seems that each week, the administration floats a new policy that would curb the rights of women in some respect.But don’t worry everyone, Ivanka Trump is on it. In her (unpaid) role as a special assistant to her dad, President Donald Trump, she will be “advocating for the economic empowerment of women,” she told Gayle King in an interview with “CBS This Morning” that aired on Wednesday.She’ll be doing this very quietly, apparently. Trump said she is candid about her opinions with her father, but made it clear that she has little control over what he does. And when she does have some kind of effect, we may never learn about it.“I think most of the impact I have, over time most people will not actually know about,” she told King.How empowering!The interview makes clear that Ivanka Trump is actually continuing in a well-trodden tradition, particularly for white women. For decades, they were stranded at home with little economic power and often resorted to a quiet behind-the-scenes passive aggression to get things accomplished. It’s a plot straight out of a 1950s sitcom.More generally speaking, many women have learned ― consciously or otherwise ― not to seem too pushy, aggressive or loud because femininity is stereotypically considered a passive trait.For female CEOs, the technical term for this is called “the double-bind.” They need to be bossy, but without being seen to be bossy, lest they’re labeled a bitch.The tradition of the woman quietly working behind the scenes, doing the grunt work carries over to the corporate world, too. For years now, women have taken on what is often invisible and administrative work, for which they don’t seek (or get) credit, while men aggressively advocate for themselves out in the world.At companies, men are typically overrepresented in so-called “line roles,” the mission-critical jobs responsible for profits and losses. Women get slotted into administrative positions ― it’s why at a lot of companies you’ll see a woman running the human resource or legal department but not in the CEO chair or heading up sales.That’s been changing for a lot of forward-thinking companies and it had been changing in the White House, too. Previous administrations have had a greater percentage of women in important roles ― former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama each had a female secretary of state, for example.Alas, there are only four women in the Trump cabinet and not in the top posts that matter. Overall, only 23 percent of the White House staff is female.And it’s not like the men over there are pounding the pavement for women. So far, the Trump administration has restricted abortion rights around the world, cut funding from an international program that prevents maternal deaths and unsafe abortions, fought to defund Planned Parenthood and weakened protections for women who’ve been sexually harassed or discriminated against at work.In the CBS interview, King asked Ivanka Trump what she thought about the criticism that she is “complicit” with the president’s agenda. King didn’t get into specifics, but one would want to know ― is she cool with all the actions the administration’s taken around women’s rights?She dodged the question. (Or possibly she doesn’t know what “complicit” means.) “If being complicit is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then I’m complicit,” Trump said. “I hope time will prove that I have― done a good job and much more importantly, that my father’s administration is the success that I know it will be.”We know from her father’s statements, that she has pushed him to consider a paid maternity leave policy ― the U.S. is the only developed country without one. And she’s also been advocating behind-the-scenes for a child-care tax credit.Nothing has come of either idea.Want more updates from Emily Peck?

Over 100 smaller marches are due to take place in cities across the country.Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee; Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee; and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) will join a host of faith, policy and grassroots leaders scheduled to speak on Trump’s continued lack of financial transparency.“I am proud to join Americans across this country in holding Trump accountable for deceiving the American people and refusing to tell the truth about his financial entanglements and conflicts of interest,” Rep. Waters said in a statement announcing her participation. “He should have to face the consequences of trying to hide from the American public.”A broad of array of liberal groups and labor unions are convening for the Tax March, including MoveOn.org, Public Citizen, Demos, Credo, the Working Families Party, the National Women’s Law Center and the American Federation of Teachers. They also plan to address what they believe are the inequities of the current tax system.“Donald Trump and his billionaire Cabinet are proposing even bigger tax cuts for the wealthy when what we need is a fairer system that allows our nation to meet the needs of its people,” Demos president Heather McGhee said in a statement.Although the date of the march was chosen because it is usually Tax Day, this year individual tax returns are due on Tuesday, April 18. April 15 is a Saturday and the following Monday government workers have off for Emancipation Day, a Washington, D.C. holiday.It is extremely unlikely that a liberal protest march will prompt Trump to release his tax returns. The day’s actions are instead aimed at reminding the public of Trump’s historic lack of transparency at a time when the president is struggling politically.Trump is the first president in four decades who has not released his tax returns or comparable financial information. The practice became a tradition when former President Richard Nixon released his returns after he was audited.Critics have wondered if Trump has something to hide by refusing to disclose information about his finances, such as whether he is violating the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause prohibiting a president from receiving foreign gifts or payments. The opacity of Trump’s finances also makes it impossible to know whether he has a financial stake in pursuing certain policies.White House officials insist that Trump has no plans to release the returns. Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway claimed in January that Trump’s election showed that the public does not care.Congressional Republicans have voted down Democrats’ efforts to use obscure legal provisions to compel their disclosure.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Emancipation Day was a federal holiday. It is a Washington, D.C. holiday."
36,POLITICS,"Conservative Megadonor Wrote $450,000 Check To Spread Indicted Congressman's Fake News Across Texas, Prosecutors Say",Jacob Fenton,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stockman-uihlein-fake-news_us_58e3f8f3e4b03a26a367020b,The indictment of former Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) offers a rare look at how a wealthy conservative's money was spent.,2017-04-05,"Former Rep. Steve Stockman is scheduled for an arraignment on Wednesday, where his attorney says he will plead not guilty.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e3f9cf16000020004d8b8d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Late last month, federal prosecutors indicted ex-Rep. Steve Stockman and two of his aides, charging that the Texas Republican and his confidants ripped off charities, laundered money, lied to regulators and misled wealthy donors before, during and after his failed 2014 primary campaign against John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate. The fact that the former congressman is facing multiple felony counts made national news. But one of the most interesting details in the 46-page Stockman indictment escaped notice: The suggestion that Richard Uihlein, one of the country’s biggest conservative political donors, personally wrote a check for $450,571.65 to mail a fake newspaper called The Conservative News to voters across Texas. The paper, which prosecutors say was part of a Stockman-run, secretly funded operation intended to take down Cornyn, included the dubious claims that Cornyn wanted to ban veterans from having guns, had voted to fund abortion, and was secretly working with Democrats to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. Mailing a fake newspaper is not a crime, nor is secretly funding a candidate to do so. Thanks to a series of court decisions now known collectively as Citizens United, billionaires are allowed to fund anonymous attacks as long as they abide by an arcane set of tax and campaign finance rules. And Uihlein, who has given more than $43 million to conservative candidates and super PACs since 2011, is a particularly big fish. He is the chief executive of a family-owned shipping and packing materials company that’s confusingly named “Uline,” which Forbes estimated was worth at least $700 million in 2014. And through his private foundation, Uihlein has given millions more to nonprofits that push a conservative policy agenda and train a new generation of political operatives to sell it. It’s not clear what, if anything, Uihlein knew about Stockman’s fake-news scheme. He is described as a victim in the Stockman case: Prosecutors say Stockman and his staffers fraudulently diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars Uihlein had donated. Uihlein’s funding of the fake-news operation would likely never have become public had Stockman not gotten tangled up with an FBI investigation — meaning this episode exposes a side of the U.S. campaign finance system we don’t often get to see.Uihlein isn’t named in the court filings; he is identified as “Person B” in one indictment and “Person C” in another. Melissa Annis, an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Texas who is one of the prosecutors on the case, said it is her office’s policy not to identify anyone who hasn’t been charged in a case. But details in the case files make it clear that “Person B” and “Person C” are both Uihlein.According to the documents, “Person B” gave $350,000 from his family foundation to Life without Limits, a social welfare nonprofit Stockman aides controlled, in January 2013. The money was meant to fund Freedom House, a townhouse in Washington, D.C., that “would serve as a meeting place, dormitory and training facility for young people,” according to court documents. The first criminal complaint unsealed in the case describes a meeting between Stockman, an aide and “a wealthy businessman who operated a charitable foundation” located near Chicago.Uline is based in the Chicago suburb of Waukegan, Illinois, and tax records from Richard Uihlein’s nonprofit, the Ed Uihlein Family Foundation, reported a 2013 donation to Life Without Limits of $350,000. (The foundation bears the name of his father, who died in 2005, but Richard Uihlein has been the foundation’s president and sole donor through its entire history, and is the only man on its three-person board.) Larry Barry, director of legal affairs at Uline, refused to answer questions about the case, but said in an emailed statement that “we are deeply troubled by the allegations ... that certain contributions made in good faith may have been used for unintended personal and political purposes.” Barry referred to Uihlein as “a victim of this alleged misconduct” and said that “we have and will continue to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice in this investigation.”The U.S. government alleges that Stockman “did not use any significant portion” of Uihlein’s $350,000 donation to fund Freedom House. Instead, prosecutors say, $50,000 went to Stockman’s political campaigns, $41,000 to surveilling a “potential challenger in a future primary election,” $20,000 to support his brother’s “book business,” $11,000 for an associate’s inpatient alcoholism treatment, and $2,200 for summer camp for a nephew and friend.Prosecutors are pursuing charges against Stockman related to the fake newspapers because the Center for the American Future, a nonprofit that a Stockman aide named Jason Posey controlled, made “independent” expenditures that prosecutors allege were illegally coordinated with Stockman. Although there’s no limit to “independent” spending, “coordinated” spending was capped at $2,600 per election at that time. Posey has also been accused of falsely claiming the spending was not coordinated in a sworn affidavit related to a Federal Election Commission complaint.Through this nonprofit, Stockman and his aides printed hundreds of thousands of fake papers. Stockman had the direct mail company bill Uihlein for the postage, who cut a check on Feb. 18. According to the indictment, Stockman stopped the fake news operation “in or about late February or early March.” Stockman got creamed in the crowded March 4 primary, winning less than 20 percent of the vote to Cornyn’s 59 percent.This is not the first time Stockman, an accountant by trade, has been in trouble with the FEC. Both his two-year House terms resulted in sprawling investigations of fake news and accounting problems. The FEC fined Stockman $40,000 in 1998 over contributions related to producing a fake newspaper during the 1994 election, The Southeast Texas Times, and the 1996 election, The Southeast Texas Statesman. Both were produced with Jeff Van Fleet, an officer at the the Center for the American Future, which produced the 2014 fake newspaper. A separate FEC investigation into a fake newspaper produced during the 2012 election, The Southeast Texas Courier, was dropped. A warrant for Posey’s arrest was issued the day he was indicted, March 28. The U.S. Attorney’s Office said on Tuesday that he hasn’t been arrested, and thus his status remains “fugitive.” Stockman was arrested in mid-March as he tried to board a plane bound for the United Arab Emirates. He is scheduled for an arraignment on Wednesday, where his attorney says he will plead not guilty.One of the biggest unanswered questions in the Stockman case is how he apparently fooled Uihlein twice. Prosecutors say Posey told Uihlein’s accountant in a May 13, 2014, email ― sent two months after Stockman lost the election ― that some of the money that was supposed to be used for Freedom House had gone to delivering medical supplies to “third world” countries. The email, which also included an attached tax exemption letter for Life Without Limits, allegedly constituted wire fraud ― though prosecutors don’t spell out exactly why. What the documents don’t clear up is why Uihlein would fund Stockman’s direct mail campaign a year after his donation for Freedom House ― especially since it seemed like so little progress had been made on that first project. “You raise a good question, but it’s not one I can talk about today,” said Dane C. Ball, a Houston lawyer defending Stockman.An answer may be in the offing if the case goes to trial. If that happens, it’s likely Uihlein would be called to testify, said D.C. campaign finance lawyer Brett Kappel. “Get your popcorn,” he quipped."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e3ff712c00006568ff240a.jpeg?cache=3RRb6GODfs&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Harvey Fierstein cultivated a larger-than-life persona in the musical adaptation of “Hairspray,” but his latest theatrical project sees the star in a much more intimate light. The Tony-winning actor and playwright returns to the Off-Broadway stage April 5 in “Gently Down the Stream” at New York’s Public Theater. Written by Martin Sherman, the three-person play stars Fierstein as Beau, a gay cabaret musician whose tryst with a young lawyer, Rufus (Gabriel Ebert), blooms into a deep and surprisingly complex relationship. The London-based couple’s intergenerational differences, and the presence of another man (Christopher Sears), threaten to fracture their romance at every step. But as months turn into years, the men discover they may just be each other’s soulmates, no matter how idiosyncratic their companionship may be. In a unique twist, Sherman intercuts the play’s dramatic scenes with a series of monologues in which Fierstein addresses the audience from the lip of the stage, recounting the 1973 UpStairs Lounge fire ― which was the largest attack to target the LGBTQ community before being surpassed by Orlando’s Pulse nightclub massacre last year ― and the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s. According to director Sean Mathias, the choice to punctuate Beau and Rufus’s relationship with references to such sobering moments in queer history was “metaphorically optimistic.” “As everyone will tell you about history, it’s easy to forget the bad things that happened,” Mathias, who directed Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in “No Man’s Land” and “Waiting for Godot” on Broadway in 2013, told The Huffington Post. “Gently Down the Stream,” he added, “puts the last 50, 60, 70 years of LGBTQ history into perspective. It shows us how far we’ve come in surviving illness, disease, repression, being illegal [and] complete injustices in the law.” Though Fierstein hadn’t been seen in a dramatic play since 1983’s “Torch Song Trilogy,” which he also wrote, Mathias said the star was his first choice for the role of Beau. “It’s nothing like he’s ever done before. It was my idea to cast him, so if it didn’t work out, I was the one to blame,” Mathias quipped. Noting how devoted Fierstein has been to furthering LGBTQ equality over the years, the role still “feels very personal to him, because he’s central to so much of the story, in a way,” the director said. The cast and creative team began working on the play well before the election of President Donald Trump, who ran on an explicitly anti-LGBTQ platform. Now that Trump has already rolled back some LGBTQ rights, the queer community finds itself at a bit of a political crossroads, which Mathias feels lends “a further irony” to “Gently Down the Stream.” “We didn’t know we were going to be doing this play right now in America ― to be looking at how far we’ve come at a time when we might have to become activists all over again,” he said. Still, the play concludes on a bittersweet, if upbeat, note for its three characters, which Mathias said was the incentive behind the quirky title. “Having a nursery rhyme as a title is a wonderful irony,” he said. “But it’s totally ironic, because it’s been anything but gently down the stream. You wouldn’t have survived in a canoe, because there have been waterfalls and crashing waves... but the point is survivors have made it to the other side.” “Gently Down the Stream” opens April 5 at New York’s Public Theater.

The London-based couple’s intergenerational differences, and the presence of another man (Christopher Sears), threaten to fracture their romance at every step. But as months turn into years, the men discover they may just be each other’s soulmates, no matter how idiosyncratic their companionship may be. In a unique twist, Sherman intercuts the play’s dramatic scenes with a series of monologues in which Fierstein addresses the audience from the lip of the stage, recounting the 1973 UpStairs Lounge fire ― which was the largest attack to target the LGBTQ community before being surpassed by Orlando’s Pulse nightclub massacre last year ― and the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s. According to director Sean Mathias, the choice to punctuate Beau and Rufus’s relationship with references to such sobering moments in queer history was “metaphorically optimistic.” “As everyone will tell you about history, it’s easy to forget the bad things that happened,” Mathias, who directed Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in “No Man’s Land” and “Waiting for Godot” on Broadway in 2013, told The Huffington Post. “Gently Down the Stream,” he added, “puts the last 50, 60, 70 years of LGBTQ history into perspective. It shows us how far we’ve come in surviving illness, disease, repression, being illegal [and] complete injustices in the law.” Though Fierstein hadn’t been seen in a dramatic play since 1983’s “Torch Song Trilogy,” which he also wrote, Mathias said the star was his first choice for the role of Beau. “It’s nothing like he’s ever done before. It was my idea to cast him, so if it didn’t work out, I was the one to blame,” Mathias quipped. Noting how devoted Fierstein has been to furthering LGBTQ equality over the years, the role still “feels very personal to him, because he’s central to so much of the story, in a way,” the director said. The cast and creative team began working on the play well before the election of President Donald Trump, who ran on an explicitly anti-LGBTQ platform. Now that Trump has already rolled back some LGBTQ rights, the queer community finds itself at a bit of a political crossroads, which Mathias feels lends “a further irony” to “Gently Down the Stream.” “We didn’t know we were going to be doing this play right now in America ― to be looking at how far we’ve come at a time when we might have to become activists all over again,” he said. Still, the play concludes on a bittersweet, if upbeat, note for its three characters, which Mathias said was the incentive behind the quirky title. “Having a nursery rhyme as a title is a wonderful irony,” he said. “But it’s totally ironic, because it’s been anything but gently down the stream. You wouldn’t have survived in a canoe, because there have been waterfalls and crashing waves... but the point is survivors have made it to the other side.” “Gently Down the Stream” opens April 5 at New York’s Public Theater.

From what I have seen and heard, I would have to say that Kendall was my favorite, because she never did too much. However, this week she, as well as Pepsi, did entirely too much.Pepsi released a commercial starring Kendall Jenner. The commercial shows Ms. Jenner in a blonde wig modeling for a photo shoot on the sidewalk as protesters march past her. The protesters are people of all different ethnicities, religions, orientations who are passionately marching, dancing, and photographing. One guy nods at Kendall, which encourages her to rip off her wig and join the march. Of course after having been in the crowd for less than 20 seconds, she makes her way to the front, just in time to offer a police offer a nice, cold Pepsi.Wow, suddenly every societal ill is fixed. All thanks to Kendall Jenner and Pepsi.Except, that’s not the case at all. This commercial just encourages more problems rather than helps solve any. To begin with, the photo used for this article is much too similar to this photo of Ieshia Evans, a Black Lives Matter activist.Unlike Kendall, however, Ieshia was arrested. Pepsi’s use of the likeness to this image is an insult to Ieshia, and other black women like her, who put their freedom and their lives on the line to proclaim that black lives matter.On a larger scale, this commercial is an insult to all Americans who are marginalized and mistreated, especially now with the fear and anger building up in the midst of this 45’s presidency. The only thing that Pepsi cares about in regards to the current struggle this nation is facing is how they can capitalize off of it. People are not out here marching and protesting day and night so that a mega corporation can make money off the aesthetic. They are doing it because they have real fear, real anger, real sadness, and real passion. The fact that Kendall is the star of the commercial is just further evidence that Pepsi does not care about the political activism portrayed in the background, but rather that a marketable young star is opening a can of their soda.If only it all were as easy as being a pretty woman, walking up to a police officer, and offering him a can of soda. But social change is never that easy. It is time that corporations like Pepsi realized this, and stopped trying to monetize the struggle. Put some respect on the names and faces of all the people who have put in hard work to make a positive difference."

View from the top of a mountain. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e499ef16000028004d8d38.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s a belief that travel is the door through which we find ourselves. So “gap year” students, Molly, Polly and Lolly, head off overseas to discover who they really are. They hit the backpacker trail, stay in cool hostels and make news friends who are also on their travels “finding themselves”. And they all come back to Blighty knowing who they are and what they want.Yeah, my arse.Sorry guys, but travel is not how we find ourselves. It is not the mechanism by which we discover who we really are. I grew up with an older brother and two loving parents; a family unit of four people with very strong personalities. Who was I? I was “the youngest.” I was four years behind my brother in terms of developing my own identity, and with such strong personalities around me, it was hard not to adopt them partly as my own.As we grew into our teens and my brother became well known at school, I was “the little sister.” As an adolescent, I had to fight to defend my “alternative” identity, and I ended up just fighting everything ― teachers, parents, pupils, inanimate objects, and of course myself. So, while my brother was being celebrated and adored, I upset people and got into trouble. I became “the black sheep.”As the years went by, my identity continued to be defined by the people and things around me. I was “the smoker,” “the party animal,” “the girlfriend.”Then I went on a round the world trip by myself aged 19. And I “found myself” ― hoorah!No, course I didn’t. I did some cool stuff, got into some slightly hairy situations, survived, met some new friends and distant relatives, stayed with Miss Tahiti 1983, got a tattoo and had an incredible time, then came home again.After that, the pattern resumed; I became “the marketer,” “the mental health campaigner,” “the PR girl.” And each time a relationship ended or a new interest developed, to some degree, I became defined by that.But none of these identities lasted. None of them are who I am, I see that now.Why now?When you start a life in another country (in my case, Australia), particularly one far away from all the people and things that have always defined you, you realise that it’s not travel per se that allows you to know who you are; it’s solitude. Or to be more specific, it’s distance from who you were or, rather, who everyone thinks you are. You’re on your own. And the silence is deafening.But then slowly, you begin to hear something. It sounds like a voice. It’s your voice. And it’s telling you things you’ve never been able to hear before because you’ve been too busy playing your latest character. And maybe I’m a fool for never having been able to hear this voice before. Perhaps I’m the weird one, that it’s taken me until the age of 31 to feel like I’m finally getting somewhere.Or maybe, just maybe, there are some others out there that are like me, who’ve felt a little lost in the past, a bit confused, not knowing where they belong or what they should do. Or who to please.In which case, this blog post is for you. Disagree with me? Did YOU “find yourself” on the backpacker trail?

As I said in a HuffPost travel post a few days ago, we also ate the local version of home-fried potatoes, patate in tecia (tecia being Triestino for frying pan). There are dozens of variations on this dish, all containing boiled potatoes, onions and some sort of fat. Beyond those basic components, some people use bacon/pancetta (smoked or unsmoked), and some use broth; it seemed to me that what was served at Da Pepi used both of those options, the broth being a byproduct of the boiled meats they offer. I loved it; others found it a little too fatty and rich, so when I made a dish based on patate in tecia as soon as we returned to New York, I kept it simpler. The results were delicious, not identical to what we ate in Trieste, but also not like any standard American plate of home fries or potato hash. It took time and intermittent attention, but it was well worth it.What I did was this: I boiled about two pounds (just shy of a kilo) of potatoes in salted water until tender, then drained them and let them cool until they could be handled without discomfort. I used Idaho russets; yellow-fleshed potatoes would be just fine. Meanwhile, I was very slowly frying a medium-large onion (or two small ones) cut into 1/4-inch (6 mm) dice, using three tablespoons of lard, which will look like a lot until later, when the potatoes go into the pan. The lard was flavorful and fresh – bought from the farmers’ market and rendered from first-class pork. If you can get only mass-production lard from the supermarket, use butter or a mixture of butter and bacon grease instead: it must be aromatic and enticing. (You could add a strip or two of bacon, cut into matchsticks, or a like amount of pancetta or guanciale, but it seems to me that the onions and lard provide plenty of flavor on their own.)By “slowly frying” I mean using very low heat with a sprinkle of salt, stirring regularly and waiting patiently for the onions to brown without burning, which will take anywhere from 35 to 60 minutes, during which time they will grow soft and sweet and will smell powerfully appetizing. In addition to stirring, spin the pan 90 or 180 degrees every now and then to make sure the heat is even (this is a tip from Alain Passard of restaurant Arpège in Paris, and it’s worth doing with any frying).By now, the potatoes will have cooked and cooled; roughly and unevenly crush them in your fist (or use a fork) and stir them into the onions, adding salt and black pepper. Now you can edge the heat up from very low to low. Every five or ten minutes, stir the potatoes, crushing them further in the process, loosening brown bits as they form and turning them into the mass of oniony potatoes. Continue this for as long as it takes to get a potato hash with flakes of brownness predominant throughout; this has taken 45 minutes, and it has taken an hour. If you like, you can compress the mass into a disk and turn it out onto a serving platter. But for my part, I just slide the potatoes onto a plate and use the spatula to shape them into a mound. (They’ll hold for a while in the pan over super-low heat, so timing isn’t all that critical - and note that, while brown and crusty, these potatoes are meant to be soft, not crisp.)These potatoes are completely permeated by the flavor of the onions and the onion-scented fat in which they browned, whether it was lard, other pork fat or butter (if you don’t use pork, duck fat would be a good alternative).

Perhaps the most remarkable thing is that a country which long ago became a hell for civilians can sink further still.There is no peace on the horizon, we can see only more violence, fresh horrors, crimes upon crimes. A world that had apparently said “never again” to chemical weapons, to sexual violence in war, to genocide, has seen its illusions shattered again and again in Syria. Conflict itself is like a chemical agent, disintegrating the fabric of society, its brutalizing effects stripping away our humanity, poisoning the minds of all those it touches.We see more wretched symbolism in the timing of the attack on Idlib. Today, world leaders meet in Brussels for a conference entitled Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region. Yet another meeting of the apparently powerful in distant, gilded meeting rooms, more unfulfilled commitments, more unheeded recommendations, more unread communiques.It seems extraordinary to plan for a future for Syria when as we speak war crimes are committed with impunity. If so much energy can be expended on talking about the conflict with nothing to show for it, then what hope is there for the region? If we can secure so little for Syria, then you can be sure that we will have even less for the people of South Sudan, of Yemen, of Somalia.The world it seems has limited attention to pay to conflicts in the Arab region and Africa, and the intensity of the war in Syria means that it takes most of the available headlines. The signs across the region are sadly no less ominous than they are in Syria. Whether it is escalation in conflict or ever more militarization, we cannot afford to ignore what is going on.Weeks after the U.S. raid in Yemen that killed 30 civilians - including nine children under the age of 13 - the Trump administration shredded combat rules designed to protect civilians in Somalia. For years resentment, anger and extremism in the region have been fueled by drone strikes that have killed thousands. Instead of stepping back from this lethal policy, the new administration has chosen to go even further.Solutions to ending violent extremism in the Arab region and Africa will only be found in the communities, not by drone operators in aircraft hangers thousands of miles away, who either don’t know or don’t care about the difference between an extremist cell and a wedding party.Even in Somaliland - the autonomous state on the Horn of Africa’s northern coast that has experienced far greater stability and peace than Somalia as a whole - we can see the warning signs of militarization. Earlier this year, Somaliland’s parliament gave permission to the United Arab Emirates to build a military base in the port city of Berbera. The UAE has been an active member of the coalition accused of targeting civilians just across the Gulf of Aden in Yemen. The decision proved so controversial that a small group of MPs vocally opposed to the base were marched out of the chamber by soldiers.The region already has some of the most militarized societies in the world. Military spending by governments in the Arab region is 65% higher than the global average. For every dollar Sudan’s government spends on healthcare, it spends $70 on its military.Smaller levels of resource and effort have been put into development, trying to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and now the Sustainable Development Goals. The focus on making development progress sustainable is crucial, but to bring it about we must recognize that peace and security are absolutely fundamental.Attempting to achieve important but narrow goals - like trying to end child marriage in Yemen - while conflict rages is a fruitless task. Like taking an aspirin to deal with a tumor, the treatment fails to deal with the core of the issue, and any results will be short-lived.Security has become the watchword for governments across the region, the excuse for more military spending. But we are not more secure, it is not peace that we see breaking out. If spending in any other area - in health, education, in the private sector - failed so spectacularly to achieve its aim, you would expect to see screeching u-turns in policy.Perhaps if the resources and political effort currently being thrown into escalating conflict and militarizing our region had been put into building peace, we might not be where we are today. Any meeting being held in the West on peace in the region needs to start with Western policy and Western responsibility on this issue in particular.When arms made in Europe and bought by the U.S. meant for “friendly” forces end up in the hands of violent extremists, the West needs to drastically rethink its security policy. At the same time as leaders meet in Brussels to talk peace in the Arab region, the prime minister of the world’s fifth largest arms exporter is in Saudi Arabia to talk business with a regime being investigated for war crimes.This contradiction of only talking peace while actually selling war has played a huge role in bringing us to where we are. It is time we recognized that peace is central to our goals of achieving security and development progress, and based our policies on that."

Trump’s affection for Fox News is well-known, evident in his promotional tweets for sympathetic morning show “Fox & Friends” and the fact that he gave the conservative-leaning network more interviews as president than any other. Still, the notion Trump would consider only Fox News to broadcast the peaceful transfer of power in the United States was surprising ― and troubling. CNN chief Jeff Zucker relayed a conversation with Trump about the issue in a New York Times Magazine feature published online Tuesday:Shortly before Trump was sworn in, Zucker heard that he was considering giving Fox News exclusive rights to televise the inauguration and that [son-in-law and top adviser Jared] Kushner was in the process of brokering a deal with Rupert Murdoch, whom Kushner once courted as a mentor. Zucker called Trump. “Bottom line is that I said, ‘This is crazy,’ ” Zucker recalls. “You’re just going to give your inaugural coverage to your base of support? It makes no sense.”There’s no precedent for a network getting exclusive TV rights for the public portions of the inauguration, like the swearing-in ceremony and parade. And the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, not the president-elect’s team, oversees those events. A spokesman for Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who was most recently chairman of the committee, said there was no discussion about giving Fox News exclusive television rights. Spokespeople from CNN and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It would have been possible for Trump and his team to give out exclusive television rights for ancillary events, which are overseen by the his Presidential Inaugural Committee. In 2009, ABC received broadcast rights to televise the “Neighborhood Inaugural Ball,” an event that featured President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama’s first dance following the inauguration.

The prosecution had five days to appeal judge Eloy Velasco’s decision and submitted it to the National Court’s Criminal Division on Thursday.In a phone interview with Syria Deeply, Sandoval said the prosecution appealed on the grounds that Spanish courts do not have the “competence” to hear the case because no Spaniards are among the victims.The two international lawyers spearheading the case, Almudena Bernabeu and Maite Parejo, had argued for universal jurisdiction – the principle that allows any national court to prosecute crimes against international law regardless of where they were committed – to bring the case accusing Syrian officials of allegedly playing a role in the detainment, disappearance and death of Syrian national Abdulmuemen Alhaj Hamdo.Though Spanish law states that Spain can only claim criminal jurisdiction over crimes committed against victims with Spanish nationality and residency, the lawyers argued that the plaintiff, Hamdo’s sister, Spanish national Amal Hag Hamdo Anfalis, should be considered an indirect victim of the alleged crime.Details of the appeal are not publicly available, however Sandoval said they were essentially “the same” arguments included in her recommendation to dismiss the case that she submitted to judge Velasco on February 15. In the report she argued that “the concept of the victim must be interpreted as the passive subject of the crime,” she told Spanish newspaper El Mundo, adding that “the wider concept of the affected and/or indirect victim applies exclusively in cases of indemnization or damage reparations.”Despite Sandoval’s original recommendation, Velasco opened the investigation, arguing that indirect victims are considered as victims under the Spanish Statute of Victims. In his court order, he also cites the European Parliament and Council’s directive on the basic rights of victims, and a U.N. resolution on “the right of victims of manifest violations of the international norms on human rights and on grave violations of the international humanitarian right to appeal and obtain reparations,” which specifically states that the immediate family members will also be considered victims.“It’s a pity that the Spanish public prosecution is insisting on the archaic stance that the victim is only the passive subject of the crime,” Almudena Bernabeu, the lawyer spearheading the case, told Syria Deeply.Spain has a history of using the laws of universal jurisdiction in its courts to open cases against alleged human rights abusers in other countries. Most notably, judge Baltasar Garzón was able to issue an international warrant for the arrest of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998 – a big victory for international justice.But as the universal jurisdiction cases grew bolder and went after powerful countries – and especially after a case opened in 2006 accusing Chinese officials of genocide in Tibet, and another opened in 2008 involving Israel’s attacks on Palestine – “the political and economic pressure on the Spanish government was hard. In other European countries, the same, more or less, has happened: After having proceedings against powerful countries, they had to reform their law,” Maite Parejo, another lawyer leading the case, told Syria Deeply in an earlier interview.The Spanish government passed laws restricting universal jurisdiction in 2009 and 2014, requiring that the victims be Spanish nationals, effectively forcing such politically contentious cases to be shelved. “This is an archaism that not only shames Spain internationally but also puts in serious danger the Statute of Victims of Terrorism and its achievements,” Bernabeu said, stressing the importance of this case for international justice.As it stands today, Spanish law makes it nearly impossible to exercise the universal jurisdiction principle, Manuel Ollé Sesé, international criminal law professor at the Complutense University of Madrid, told Syria Deeply.Other cases involving Syria have been brought to European courts under the principle of universal jurisdiction, but this is the first naming high-level officials in Assad’s regime and directly linking them to alleged crimes. The defendants include Syrian vice president and former foreign minister Farouk al-Sharaa, the head of Syria’s National Security Bureau, Ali Mamlouk, and the head of Syria’s air force intelligence, Gen. Jamil Hassan.In February 2013, Hamdo was detained somewhere between his hometown of Mashta al-Helou in Latakia and Homs city, a route he regularly took from his job as a delivery van driver. His family was unable to find out his whereabouts or fate for the next two years, until mid 2015 when Hamdo’s son identified his father’s body in a photo from the Caesar File, a collection of more than 50,000 photographs that document the deaths of over 6,000 people in government-run detention facilities, smuggled out of Syria by a defected Syrian forensic officer code-named Caesar in 2013.From Caesar’s photo, the family was able to deduce that Hamdo was tortured and executed in Branch 248, a government-run detention center in Damascus.Anfalis, the victim’s sister, and Caesar will testify on April 10, and the investigation into the alleged acts of state terrorism – which judge Velasco said should include evidence provided by France and Portugal – will continue despite the appeal, Parejo said.Bernabeu told Syria Deeply that she is optimistic that the new judge will rule in favor of their argument.This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

Colon, who was 15 at the time, planned to recruit a sniper to shoot the pontiff during a papal Mass and set off explosive devices in the vicinity.The teen contacted someone he believed to be a sniper, who turned out to be an undercover FBI employee, according to a release from the Department of Justice. “Colon engaged in target reconnaissance with an FBI confidential source and instructed the source to purchase materials to make explosive devices,” Monday’s release stated.FBI agents arrested him in 2015. According to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to law enforcement on Aug. 14, 2015, Colon was charged with trying to provide material support to a terrorist organization, ABC News reported at the time.Monday’s court documents revealed the teen, a U.S. citizen, also went by the name Ahmad Shakoor and aimed to carry out the attack in support of the Islamic State group, according to Agence France-Presse.The pope traveled to Washington, D.C., New York City and Philadelphia in September 2015 for his first and only papal trip to the U.S. so far. His visit to Philadelphia took place on Sept. 26-27 for the Vatican-sponsored World Meeting of Families. Hundreds of thousands of people attended Francis’s papal Mass on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, which Colon reportedly planned to target in an attack.Kenneth A. Gavin, a spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, said in a statement to The Huffington Post on Tuesday: “The Archdiocese is extremely grateful to all members of the law enforcement community and to the various security agencies who worked to provide a safe atmosphere for the Holy Father and those who traveled from around the world to be with us for the World Meeting of Families and Pope Francis’ visit in September 2015.”Colon has not been sentenced, but he faces up to 15 years in prison and a fine of $250,000."

But climate change has led to soaring temperatures and rapidly melting sea ice, opening once-inaccessible areas up to fishing, shipping, energy development and even luxury cruise liners.“These activities have the potential to inflict further stress on Arctic marine ecosystems already straining under the effects of climate change,” Prince Albert II of Monaco writes in the report’s preface. “ I believe we have a historic opportunity, and a profound obligation, to do what we can to educate people around the world about the need to protect ecologically important and sensitive ocean habitats in the Arctic for future generations. The need to act is urgent.”The IUCN report, supported by Natural Resources Defense Council and the World Wildlife Fund, highlights seven important and highly productive marine areas worthy of protection.“The Arctic Ocean’s beauty and bounty are unparalleled,” said Mechtild Rössler, director of UNESCO’s World Heritage Centre, in a statement. “From the sea life superhighway of the Bering Strait to the breath-taking fjords of Scoresby Sound, this region is unlike any other on the planet.”The IUCN’s warning comes roughly three months after a team of international scientists released the 2016 Arctic Report Card, which painted an equally dire picture of the rapidly changing Arctic, where sea ice has reached record lows and temperatures are warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet.Scientists and environmentalists have grown increasingly worried about increased opportunities for fishing and oil and gas development.

The Kyrgyz GKNB security service identified the suspect as Akbarzhon Jalilov, born in the city of Osh in 1995, but provided no other details.The explosion on Tuesday in the middle of the afternoon occurred when the train was in a tunnel deep underground, amplifying the force of the blast. The carriage door was blown off, and witnesses described seeing injured passengers with bloodied and blackened bodies.State investigative authorities said fragments of the body of the suspect had been found among the dead, indicating that he was a suicide bomber. IS, now under attack by all sides in Syria’s multi-faceted war, has repeatedly threatened revenge and been linked to recent bombings elsewhere in Europe.If it is confirmed that the metro bomber was linked to radical Islamists, it could provoke anger among some Russians at Moscow’s decision to intervene in Syria, a year before an election which President Vladimir Putin is expected to win.The National Anti-Terrorist Committee said on Monday an explosive device had been found at another station, hidden in a fire extinguisher, but it had been defused. It was unclear who had placed that device and no arrests have been made.Russia has been on alert against attacks in reprisal for its military intervention in Syria, where Moscow’s forces have been supporting troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad against Western-backed armed groups as well as the hardline Islamic State (IS) which grew out of the conflict. PREVIOUS BOMBINGOfficials said they were treating the blast as an act of terrorism, but there was no official confirmation of any link to Islamist radicals.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it was cynical to say the bombing in St Petersburg was revenge for Russia’s role in Syria. He said the attack showed that Moscow needed to press on with its fight against global terrorism.Russian officials said they did not want to reveal the suspect’s identity. But a picture was starting to emerge on Tuesday of the man named by Kyrgyz authorities.A page on social media site VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, belonging to someone with the same name and year of birth as Jalilov, included photos of him relaxing with friends in a bar, smoking from a hookah pipe. He was dressed in jackets and a baseball cap, and showed no outward sign of any religious affiliation.A Reuters reporter visited a house in Osh, southern Kyrgyzstan, which neighbors said was the family home of Jalilov. The home, a modest but well-maintained one-storey brick building, was empty.Neighbors said Jalilov was from a family of ethnic Uzbeks, and that while they knew his parents they had not seen the young man for years. They said his father worked as a panel-beater in a car repair shop.Osh is part of the Fergana Valley, a fertile strip of land that straddles Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan which is mainly populated by ethnic Uzbeks.

The Kyrgyz GKNB security service identified the suspect as Akbarzhon Jalilov, born in the city of Osh in 1995, but provided no other details.The explosion on Tuesday in the middle of the afternoon occurred when the train was in a tunnel deep underground, amplifying the force of the blast. The carriage door was blown off, and witnesses described seeing injured passengers with bloodied and blackened bodies.State investigative authorities said fragments of the body of the suspect had been found among the dead, indicating that he was a suicide bomber. IS, now under attack by all sides in Syria’s multi-faceted war, has repeatedly threatened revenge and been linked to recent bombings elsewhere in Europe.If it is confirmed that the metro bomber was linked to radical Islamists, it could provoke anger among some Russians at Moscow’s decision to intervene in Syria, a year before an election which President Vladimir Putin is expected to win.The National Anti-Terrorist Committee said on Monday an explosive device had been found at another station, hidden in a fire extinguisher, but it had been defused. It was unclear who had placed that device and no arrests have been made.Russia has been on alert against attacks in reprisal for its military intervention in Syria, where Moscow’s forces have been supporting troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad against Western-backed armed groups as well as the hardline Islamic State (IS) which grew out of the conflict. PREVIOUS BOMBINGOfficials said they were treating the blast as an act of terrorism, but there was no official confirmation of any link to Islamist radicals.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it was cynical to say the bombing in St Petersburg was revenge for Russia’s role in Syria. He said the attack showed that Moscow needed to press on with its fight against global terrorism.Russian officials said they did not want to reveal the suspect’s identity. But a picture was starting to emerge on Tuesday of the man named by Kyrgyz authorities.A page on social media site VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, belonging to someone with the same name and year of birth as Jalilov, included photos of him relaxing with friends in a bar, smoking from a hookah pipe. He was dressed in jackets and a baseball cap, and showed no outward sign of any religious affiliation.A Reuters reporter visited a house in Osh, southern Kyrgyzstan, which neighbors said was the family home of Jalilov. The home, a modest but well-maintained one-storey brick building, was empty.Neighbors said Jalilov was from a family of ethnic Uzbeks, and that while they knew his parents they had not seen the young man for years. They said his father worked as a panel-beater in a car repair shop.Osh is part of the Fergana Valley, a fertile strip of land that straddles Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan which is mainly populated by ethnic Uzbeks. It has a tradition of Islamist radicalism and hundreds of people have set out from the area to join Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.A blast at a nightclub in Istanbul on New Year’s Eve that killed 39 people involved a suspect from the same part of central Asia.

She’s proud to have been a part of such a culturally impactful show ― she just really, really doesn’t want to revive those supernatural beings, people. During an interview with The Huffington Post on Build Series Monday, Gellar joked that nostalgic television fans want reboots and reunions until they’re actually greenlighted and released. “They want it until they see it and don’t like it, and then they’re like, ‘Why did you do that?! You ruined my favorite show!’ And then it all comes back down on you,” Gellar said, smiling.Although she believes revivals like “Gilmore Girls” are successful due to progressing storylines, the actress and author just thinks “Buffy” is one of those shows that wouldn’t work as well now that the cast is older. “We have to remember it was about the horrors of adolescence and how those manifest into the monsters that were the actual monsters in our show, and I don’t know necessarily what that translates to into today,” she explained. “I also think that you can’t please everyone and we had seven amazing seasons. And it still lives on in fan fiction and comic books and graphic novels, and I think that’s really cool that it can live on in that immortal way. Because James [Marsters], David [Boreanaz], myself ― none of us are immortal.” Boreanaz echoed Gellar’s sentiments during a previous interview with HuffPost, admitting, “[Angel] is just the type of character that’s youthfully oriented. I’m getting a little older, so ... It’s one of those things [where] I loved what I did, but just kind of move on from there.”“He’s very adamant,” Gellar said of Boreanaz’s comments, throwing in the fact that she’s, also, no longer in her 20s. “This body, I don’t think could put up ... I would break every bone in my body,” she joked. “I’m just not sure how the horrors of adolescence translate into a very tired girl over here that really doesn’t want to work all night in a graveyard. If the show still works and people are enjoying it, don’t mess with it. If it ain’t broke, I’m not fixing it! I feel like there’s other ways to keep it going and honor what we created.”Despite all that, Gellar is so thankful for everything the role of Buffy Summers has given her, calling the fandom “incredible.” “As an actor, all you hope is that you do something that means something to someone, that makes an impact, that stands the test of time,” she said. “So, it’s awesome.”And although a reboot may be forever dead, the 20th anniversary reunion hosted by Entertainment Weekly was just as special for fans as it was for Gellar. “Very rarely, maybe at a college reunion, do you sit back and reminisce a little bit. But you don’t really get to think about the impact on both you and on the culture, and it was nice to sort of be able to take that walk.” Sarah Michelle Gellar’s new cookbook, Stirring Up Fun with Food, is out now.

57,POLITICS,Senators Put Pressure On Trump To Create Hate Crime Task Force,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hate-crime-task-force-senators-trump_us_58e3af1be4b03a26a3663961,Civil rights groups have raised alarm over a rise in hate incidents since November's election.,2017-04-04,"Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), speaks during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee confirmation hearing on Jan. 17. Cantwell led a group of Democratic senators this week in writing a letter to President Donald Trump and asking him to form a task force to address hate crimes.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e3da7b16000021004d8b1d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Thirteen Democratic senators are calling on President Donald Trump to establish a task force to combat an increase in hate-inspired violence across the country. Led by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), the senators sent a letter to the president on Monday in which they detailed a slew of recent high-profile hate crimes. Such incidents are “unacceptable” and “contrary to America’s foundational values of tolerance, respect, and freedom of religion,” they wrote. “A Presidential Task Force to prevent and combat hate violence would bring together faith leaders, community advocates, federal and local government agencies, law enforcement, and other relevant professionals to analyze the causes behind the rise in hate, identify possible solutions, and to improve access to resources to fight back,” the letter states. The letter lists a series of crimes in recent months, including a white supremacist in New York City killing a black man named Timothy Caughman; an Indian-American man in Kansas being killed by a man who allegedly screamed “get out of my country”; vandalism of Jewish cemeteries and synagogues; threats of violence against Jewish community centers and other Jewish organizations; three mosques targeted with arson in less than seven weeks; and, in Cantwell’s own Washington state, the shooting of a Sikh man by a suspect who allegedly yelled “go back to your country.”The month of March was particularly horrifying for Muslims and people perceived to be Muslim. Death threats and anti-Muslim vandalism greeted an Iranian refugee at his Oregon home; someone wrote “FUCK MUSLIMS” and destroyed a Quran inside the Virginia home of a Muslim family; a man in Minnesota allegedly told police his hatred of Muslims motivated him to stab a Somali man; in Colorado, a man allegedly threw a Bible and rocks through the glass doors a mosque; and men threatened to shoot Muslim women twice in one week. “A Presidential task force could facilitate broader dialogue needed to stop the rise in hate violence, to improve security & to save lives,” Cantwell tweeted Monday. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups and hate crimes in the U.S., expressed support for the senators’ letter to Trump. “There has been a disturbing rise in hate incidents and violence nationwide, particularly since the election, targeting immigrants, LGBT community members, Muslims and others because of their skin color, religion or background,” Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC’s Intelligence Project, said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “We’ve recorded a spike in vandalism with swastikas and other racially charged attacks,” she added. “A presidential task force if it includes a multitude of voices could be a helpful step to work towards solutions to addressing hate violence.”The SPLC was among 150 prominent civil rights groups ― including Amnesty International, the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Muslim Advocates and the National Bar Association ― that last month sent the president a letter and called on him to more forcefully denounce hate crimes when they happen. That letter also stated that Trump and his surrogates have “too frequently used rhetoric and proposed and enacted policies that have fostered a hostile environment” toward minorities in America. Trump briefly spoke about hate during his address to Congress in February, saying, “We are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.” But many people thought the statement rang hollow because of Trump’s long history of disparaging marginalized groups, scapegoating Muslims, mocking disabled people, boasting of sexual assault, and promising to lift certain protections for the LGBTQ community. According to the FBI, there were 5,580 hate-related crimes in 2015, a 7 percent increase from the year before that was driven largely by a 67 percent increase in hate crimes targeting Muslims. (The FBI’s 2016 hate crimes statistics haven’t yet been released.) "

61,POLITICS,Federal Workers Union Slams Trump Climate Order As 'Assault' On Public Health,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-union-trump-climate-order_us_58e3b1b5e4b0f4a923b21cde,"Trump wants to dismantle the environmental agency, the union's president says.",2017-04-04,"A protester has a message for Scott Pruitt as the American Federation of Government Employees and environmental groups rally outside the Environmental Protection Agency on March 15, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e3d3121500002000c7de11.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — A labor union representing 700,000 federal and D.C. government employees lashed out at President Donald Trump Tuesday after he signed an executive order that takes aim at an Obama-era effort to combat climate change.Trump’s order, signed last week, instructs the Environmental Protection Agency to review President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.The American Federation of Government Employees, which includes EPA workers, called the order the latest in a “a continued assault on the country’s top-line of defense for community health.”It’s “frustrating” but not surprising to see the Trump administration rolling back key regulations protecting public health and ignoring years of agency science, AFGE National President J. David Cox Sr. said in a statement.“The EPA’s enormous success in protecting America’s natural resources and public health seems lost on this administration, as the signing of this executive order demonstrates,” he said.The White House unveiled a preliminary skinny budget last month that calls for deep cuts to climate and environmental programs and proposes slashing the EPA’s funding by 31 percent, from $8.2 billion to $5.7 billion. Pruitt, Trump’s pick to lead the EPA and the former attorney general of Oklahoma, is a longtime critic of the agency and denies the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change.Cox said Trump’s latest order, called the “Energy Independence Executive Order,” is part of a larger effort to dismantle the EPA. “If the administration continues to hack away at the EPA and push more work to the cash-strapped state and local governments, there will be dire consequences for generations to come,” Cox said. “President Trump says he is bringing back jobs and eliminating ‘job crushing regulations.’ But he is hurting the clean energy industry and driving up future healthcare costs for the citizens who will suffer as a result of having more toxins spewed into America’s air and water.”If a recent letter to The New York Times is any indication, morale at the agency may be at an all-time low.Michael Kravitz, an EPA scientist in Cincinnati, wrote to the Times that he has enjoyed his career working to help protect the environment. To see the agency taken over by Scott Pruitt, its longtime antagonist, has left Kravitz feeling “very saddened.”“I walk among my colleagues like a zombie in a bad dream; they also seem dazed,” he wrote. “I hope the nightmare ends soon.” At a union gathering last week in Philadelphia, Marie Owens Powell, a 27-year EPA employee and vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3631, also told NPR’s StateImpact that she’s had colleagues come to her office in tears over what’s playing out at the agency. “The mood in the office is fear, dread,” she said."
62,POLITICS,Democratic Trade Union Members Warm To Donald Trump's Populist Pitch,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trade-unions-trump-infrastructure_us_58e3fcbfe4b0f4a923b2ede3,But talk is cheap. They're looking for the president to deliver on infrastructure.,2017-04-04,President Donald Trump speaks at the North America’s Building Trades Unions national conference at the Washington Hilton on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e3fee616000020004d8bae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s speech at a gathering of construction and building trade unions on Tuesday left many of the Democrats there feeling cautiously optimistic about his administration, welcoming his vow to pass a major infrastructure initiative aimed at renewing the nation’s crumbling roads, bridges and waterways.“He’s saying things that we’ve wanted to hear for a long time ― that we haven’t heard,” said George Boecker, an Elevator Constructors union member from Baltimore.“I’ll be honest with you. I didn’t want to see him win. I voted labor. I voted with Hillary,” he said, referring to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. “But he’s here. It sounds right. We’ve got four years with him, so let’s make the best of it.”Trump stuck to his populist, anti-free-trade message at the event, and earned several standing ovations for his executive actions approving construction of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. He also drew lengthy applause for withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a major trade deal negotiated by President Barack Obama’s administration.“We’re a nation of builders, and it’s about time you had a builder in the White House,” the real estate mogul added, touting his knowledge of building materials such as concrete and rebar.Trump has courted the support of construction unions, a major Democratic constituency, since Day One of his presidency, when he met with members of the North America’s Building Trades Unions at the White House. The umbrella group represents the 14 trade unions that were in attendance at NABTU’s annual conference at the Washington Hilton hotel on Tuesday, including boilermakers, bricklayers, electricians, sheet metal workers, painters, laborers, plasterers and plumbers.Trump’s speech was received positively by most in the audience. He drew some boos and chuckles, however, when he claimed that “almost everybody” in the room supported him during the election.“Nope! Nope!” one man called out amid applause.Malik Staten, a Laborers’ union member from Philadelphia, said he appreciated Trump reaching out to union members, many of whom are Democrats.“He’s not with any particular group or any particular lane,” he said. “He’s one of those guys that if he thinks something at the time, he’ll do it.”Trump has had a few things to offer to the construction trades ― such as signing off on major infrastructure projects ― so their leadership has warmed to him. He has offered very little to service-sector and public-sector unions such as the Service Employees International Union and the AFL-CIO, however, and they remain less enthused by the president.Marion Davis, a director at the Teamsters union in Washington, said he liked that Trump was “going to finally try and improve our country’s infrastructure.” He was disappointed, however, that the president did not speak positively about the Davis-Bacon Act, a Great Depression-era law that established “prevailing wages” for publicly funded construction projects. Many conservatives support suspending the law.“But I understand it would have been a pretty hot topic,” he added.Trump has yet to formally announce his promised $1 trillion infrastructure initiative. Elaine Chao, his secretary of transportation, on Tuesday said the proposal would be unveiled sometime in “late May.” Appearing alongside Gary Cohn, Trump’s chief economic adviser, at a town hall at the White House, Chao said the administration is looking to fund projects around the country by offering tax breaks to private-sector investors who put money into infrastructure projects. Many Democrats are leery of such funding vehicles, however, and prefer using hard federal dollars. “If it’s an infrastructure bill disguised as a tax bill, it’s not going to go,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said last week.Bob Lynn, an organizer for the Plumbers, Steamfitters & Service Mechanics union from Toledo, Ohio, welcomed Trump’s talk of infrastructure investment. But he said he remains skeptical about how the administration plans to pay for it.“The devil’s always in the details, just like with his health care bill. It wasn’t about health care, it was about tax credits,” he said Tuesday. “And if the infrastructure bill winds up being tax credits instead of putting real dollars into public works, I don’t know how far that goes. We don’t need more toll roads, we need public roads. We need public infrastructure.”"

The latter, in particular, ensures that sick people are not charged more than the healthy ― which is a key component of the Obamacare guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions that Republicans promised to retain.But GOP leadership spent a good part of Tuesday hearing from moderates who said they could not accept such changes. While those rank-and-file moderates were publicly telling reporters they’d be willing to look at the legislative text of the proposal, some of them told The Huffington Post privately that the community rating change would be a non-starter for them.Even aides to normally reliable Republican members said gutting pre-existing condition protections would force their bosses to vote no.And that puts GOP leaders in the same familiar position they’ve been in for weeks now: How do they win over recalcitrant conservatives in the Freedom Caucus who are insisting on changes that could send moderates fleeing from the bill?As of early Tuesday evening, there was still no legislative text for members to review ― the White House had promised to send over text at 8:30 that night ― and lawmakers from all corners of the GOP were wondering what the amendments might look like, particularly considering the newfound opposition to the community rating change.But conservatives were still holding out hope that the administration wouldn’t go back on its offer.“I’ve read reports that this deal is falling apart because the Freedom Caucus has made demands too onerous,” caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost on Tuesday night. “And those reports are based on a confidential GOP aide, which is not representative of the facts, and they’re a total fabrication.”Meadows said that conservatives seemed likely to accept the deal that Vice President Mike Pence laid out to the group on Monday night, which would allow states to opt out of the community rating requirement and the 10 essential health benefits. But he worried that the deal might falter because moderates and GOP leadership couldn’t swallow the changes ― and that the Freedom Caucus would somehow catch the blame for, once again, moving the goal posts.Meadows was clear in saying that the Freedom Caucus didn’t make an offer, that the White House came to them after vetting the proposal with moderates, and that moderate Republicans who had signaled their willingness to move forward were now complaining that they couldn’t accept a repeal of those Obamacare requirements.In essence, though Meadows refused to say it, he was blaming moderates and the White House for now moving the goal posts.Other Freedom Caucus members told HuffPost on Tuesday just how firm the offer from the White House had seemed to be, with lawmakers and top administration officials getting into policy specifics during their meeting Monday night. When one caucus member asked about the ability of states to obtain waivers of those particular regulations, they said that Andrew Bremberg, the White House director of domestic policy, told them waiver approval would be “pro forma.”Now, moderates and conservatives are waiting to see what the White House and GOP leadership will come up with. A meeting between some members of the Freedom Caucus, the Republican Study Committee ― a larger but less conservative group ― and the moderate Tuesday Group was still on for Tuesday night. With the text of the proposal expected to drop around 8:30 p.m., there could potentially be a lot for lawmakers to discuss."

While the characters relay their experiences in a setting that takes place years before President Donald Trump took office, the play slyly answers a question on the minds of many American voters: How did we get here?(Here, of course, being the “Trump era” of note.)In an interview with The Huffington Post, Nottage announced that she is currently working on a companion piece to her groundbreaking production. “I have another play that’s in conversation with ‘Sweat,’” Nottage explained, when asked about her plans now that “Sweat” is running smoothly after its Broadway debut earlier this month. According to Playbill, the new play is currently titled “Floyd” and will be a comedy. (”Sweat” is a drama, though it has moments of comedic relief.) Nottage did not provide any further details regarding her companion piece, but she did supply us with a few more future credits to her name.“I have some other projects,” she told HuffPost. “I’m doing an adaptation of ‘Black Orpheus,’ the movie, for the stage with director George Wolf; an adaption of ‘The Secret Life of Bees’ with Duncan Sheik and Susan Birkenhead; and I’ve recently finished an adaptation of my play ‘Intimate Apparel’ as an opera with composer Ricky Ian Gordon.”When pressed on the upcoming companion piece, and how the experience of making “Sweat” influenced Nottage’s practice, she added:It’s made me think much more expansively about why and how I make art and where I want to make it. And the impact that it can have. I don’t have all the answers to those questions, but certainly, being in Reading has challenged me to think about what it is I want to do and why I do it.Nottage’s play, set in 2000 and 2008, has been widely celebrated as an illuminating piece of contemporary art.“The immediacy of it is almost freakish,” MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes told Variety. “I’m not sure how [Nottage] managed it. Not only is it great as drama, in that it’s incredibly well-crafted with well-drawn characters, but it’s also one of the most sophisticated political texts I’ve encountered in a long while.”Read more about “Sweat” here."

Roy Cooper (D) last week signed a compromise law to repeal HB2, the anti-transgender law otherwise known as the “bathroom bill.”HB2, which became law in March 2016, barred cities and localities from enacting laws to protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and restricted public restroom access for transgender people. The compromise to repeal the law but put in place new provisions drew immediate criticism from LGBTQ groups in North Carolina and across the country because, they said, it still left room for discrimination against transgender people. “HB2.0,” as one North Carolina LGBTQ group dubbed the compromise, still prohibits cities from passing nondiscrimination ordnances to protect transgender or other LGBTQ people until the end of 2020, leaving major parts of the discriminatory law in place.But despite its strong stance against the original law, the NCAA’s Board of Governors “reluctantly voted to allow consideration of championship bids in North Carolina,” the NCAA said in a statement issued Tuesday morning. “This new law has minimally achieved a situation where we believe NCAA championships may be conducted in a nondiscriminatory environment,” the statement said. “If we find that our expectations of a discrimination-free environment are not met, we will not hesitate to take necessary action at any time.”“We have been assured by the state that this new law allows the NCAA to enact its inclusive policies by contract with communities, universities, arenas, hotels, and other service providers that are doing business with us, our students, other participants, and fans,” the statement continued. The NCAA previously relocated seven championship events out of North Carolina ― including opening round games for this year’s men’s NCAA Tournament ― because of HB2’s passage. The organization is currently considering host sites for championship events to be held from 2018 to 2022, and delayed the process to give North Carolina a chance to repeal the law. The NCAA reportedly told lawmakers they had a deadline last week, and the compromise repeal plan was pushed through the state legislature soon after.The Atlantic Coast Conference, which is based in North Carolina, also moved championship events out of the state last year. The conference said last week that it was open to returning events to the state.But LGBTQ and civil rights groups, including the ACLU, pushed the NCAA to stay out of the state. Athlete Ally, an LGBT group that works in sports, blasted the compromise as a “fake repeal of HB2” that “makes it illegal to protect people from discrimination.”“This replacement law fixes zero issues the NCAA found with the initial law HB2,” Athlete Ally said in a statement last week. “For that reason, the NCAA must continue to protect its LGBT constituents, and ban North Carolina from hosting championship events.”LGBTQ groups continued their criticism following the NCAA’s announcement Tuesday morning.“The NCAA’s decision to backtrack on their vow to protect LGBTQ players, employees and fans is deeply disappointing and puts people at risk,” Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. “After drawing a line in the sand and calling for repeal of HB2, the NCAA simply let North Carolina lawmakers off the hook.”Chris Sgro, the executive director of the North Carolina-based LGBTQ organization Equality NC, said in a statement that the NCAA’s decision “put a seal of approval on state-sanctioned discrimination.”This article has been updated with more details on the law."
66,ARTS & CULTURE,A Play About A Small Pennsylvania City Is What Art Should Look Like In Trump's America,Katherine Brooks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lynn-nottage-sweat_us_58dd6566e4b08194e3b87de1,Lynn Nottage is making a new kind of political theater.,2017-04-04,"Chris Davis as Chris and Lance Coadie Williams as Evan in ""Sweat.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dd72ec1d0000f42c7d17a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Since Lynn Nottage’s play “Sweat” opened at New York City’s Studio 54 earlier this month ― marking the Brooklyn-born playwright’s Broadway debut ― the theater world has felt a little different. The play is small in setting and large in scope. Pivoting in time from 2000 to 2008, the story follows a tight group of working-class people ― spanning generations; black, white, Latino ― who feel tethered to a dying city plundered by factory layoffs. The particular town is Reading, Pennsylvania, but that fact feels necessary one moment and utterly irrelevant the next. Nottage’s Reading is eerily reflective, it seems, of many small American cities facing layoffs and accompanying pangs of uncertainty, rage and despair. While her modest cast of nine carefully-crafted, fictional characters is based on several years worth of in-person interviews and research, their stories flood together into a narrative that bleeds beyond one family, one factory or one fractured hometown. “What I saw ― and what was the initial impulse for going to Reading ― was that there was a large swath of people across the country who were in a great deal of pain,” Nottage explained in a phone interview with The Huffington Post, days after her play’s opening night. “And that story was not being told. And I think that, unfortunately, the fact that we are where we are is because there are people who were shouting and who felt unheard, and as a result, they made some extreme decisions that have impacted and jeopardized all of us.”Dubbed “The First Theatrical Landmark of the Trump Era,” Nottage’s attempt to answer that itchy question plaguing a country divided ― How did we get here? ― has provided Broadway with a much-needed elemental shake-up. It’s not to say theater hasn’t attempted to tell stories fundamental to the politics of our time before, or reflect on the lives of people outside of its capitol, New York City. But Nottage’s approach, likened to a journalistic method in which she spent years alongside director Kate Whoriskey getting to know the people of Reading, has tested the role of art in politics. Her desire to push popular conversations forward, her desire to not only mirror but engage with culture right now, has offered a contemporary model for connecting with audiences outside of Broadway’s institutions.”Sweat” is ecstatic and devastating, peppered with sweet humor that can easily descend into knee-buckling hate. It revolves around a watering hole, where factory workers past and present discuss the realities of their vanishing lives. These conversations happen in two loosely defined points in time: in the year before Sept. 11, 2001 and moments before the global financial crisis of 2008. Throughout, the characters profess honest and sometimes hard-to-hear opinions about race and entitlement, and they deal, sometimes violently, with the effects of incarceration, immigration and the opioid crisis.Reading’s experiences, unfiltered on Nottage’s stage, roll out in fragments, leaving the audience to piece together an answer to that lingering question: How did we get here? If there is an answer, it’s stuck in a heap of emotions, tangled in a mass of perspectives. If we can’t look back, Nottage seems to imply, can we look forward? For her, after countless hours spent speaking with the people of a small Pennsylvania city, the answer is yes.“In order for us to move forward, we as a community must take care of each other,” she explained to HuffPost. “When we become fractured, and we retreat into our individual silos, we create these cultural collisions that destroy culture as a whole. [...] In order for us to move forward, we have to figure out a way for all these disparate voices to stand in one place and find common ground.”Read more of our conversation with the “Sweat” playwright below:You’ve mentioned in interviews that this play was inspired by your own friends who’ve suddenly found themselves close to poverty. How exactly did you decide upon Reading as the setting for “Sweat”?I was really wanting to sort of understand with more depth the nature of what was happening in this country on a large scale to folks who were living in these mid-sized deindustrial cities. Reading, Pennsylvania, seemed like an ideal city in that it had once been quite a robust manufacturing town, with its base being textiles and pretzel and candy factories and baking factories and steel factories. It was a place that, for years, if you got off a bus, within an hour you could have a job. Within the course of maybe 30 years, those jobs began to disappear to the point where it had a staggering unemployment rate and was deemed the poorest city of its size in America. So that is why that city in particular ― that’s what drew me there.The preparation for the play began when ― if what I’ve read is correct ― Oregon Shakespeare commissioned a play from you about American revolutions.Right, yes. Oregon Shakespeare gave me a commission to write a play specifically about an American revolution. They invited playwrights to really think expansively. They wanted large-scale plays that investigated key moments in American history. I became very interested in the moment at the turn of the 21st century, which was the deindustrial revolution, and how that was really going to reshape our cultural narrative in ways that hadn’t been done since the mid-century with the civil rights movement.What was your first day in Reading like?Well, it’s interesting to enter a place that you don’t know at all. When we drove into the city, we were sort of surprised to see a lot of physical beauty ― homes that are colonial in many respects, mid-century; homes that are ornate and quite lovely. So that was the first thing we encountered. And we were like, perhaps we’re in the wrong city! This can’t possibly be the Reading that we’ve read about. What we discovered is that a lot of those houses have been segmented and house multiple families inside of them. So that was our first impression of Reading: as a place of physical beauty, but underneath, was a city that was struggling and crumbling. And then when you get inside of the city, you find these people with these really rich histories, who in some instances felt trapped by circumstance, because they couldn’t find jobs in the city and because [...] they didn’t have the economic means to leave. So they have this strange investment in seeing the city resurrected, but they are not able to do that. But the fascinating thing about Reading is that it’s an over 50 percent Latino city, so you definitely feel the flavor of the Puerto Rican and Dominican and much, much smaller Mexican populations.How many people did you speak to in Reading throughout the course of your research for the play?Oh, I can’t even [count] ― many, many, many, many, many people. It was over the course of a number of years, so some people we spoke to over great lengths and multiple times over the course of years. A lot of people who we interviewed once, we did very short, five- to 10-minute interviews. There were people [with whom] we did half-hour interviews. And then there were people who we got to know, and over the years, we didn’t just do interviews, we had many conversations. We were able to peel away the layers and figure out what their personal struggles or triumphs were.Were there any initial obstacles to bringing the story to the stage?I didn’t feel as though there were many obstacles in the writing of the story. The obstacle was before writing it and sort of deciding what to write about. Having so many things to look at and trying to distill how to tell a story that’s mentally complicated and isn’t just representative of Reading, but of what I felt was happening as a whole. And how the play can serve as a metaphor of deindustrialization without being overly heavy-handed.But also, I’m one of these playwrights ― I’m not afraid of the words “political theater.” I resent the fact that in this day and age, [playwrights] are supposed to be invisible in the storytelling. I thought, it’s very rare in any other form that you’re asked to disappear. I think that now is the time, particularly as artists, that we have to take the initiative and really engage with the culture and say things that people really do not want to hear, in order to push the dial forward. So if you talk about an obstacle, it was just understanding that there would be some resistance to a play in which the playwright carried a hammer.After conducting your research, did you feel as though you needed to weave together separate perspectives into a cohesive narrative, or did you immediately find that all these realities ― related to labor, race, immigration, incarceration, the opioid crisis ― had a central point of origin?I found that the city ― everything ― is integrated. People say, “Oh, the play is about a lot of things.” But you know, the fact is, you can’t tell one story without telling the other. It is a city where you have a workforce that’s been diminished, and as a result, a lot of people have turned to substance abuse, and you have these collisions that happen, when people become really panicked and begin to turn on each other and place blame across the racial divide. So I found that all these stories were so intertwined, you couldn’t tell one without the other.As an audience member, you watch these characters, and, even as you’re developing this incredible well of empathy, it’s almost impossible not to pass judgment on some of their beliefs ― particularly when Tracey expresses xenophobic ideals or Jason discounts Affirmative Action. It’s hard not to see them, in those rare moments, as either good or bad. How did you handle the idea of morality throughout writing and developing this play?You know, when I was sitting down to write the play, I knew that I was writing about people who all had individual flaws, which I think is true of most of us. In these particular circumstances, everyone is trying to survive and, as a result, make incredibly difficult and compromised choices ― compromised choices that are detrimental to the entire community ― in order to protect the individual. The phrase, and I’ve said this to the media, that I used when I was talking to people is “replace judgment with curiosity.” I was trying to understand who these people are fundamentally, rather than entering with resistance, because I think that if I entered Reading with resistance, the people I sat down with would not have told me their stories, and I would have not been able to find a way to build empathy.Following the 2016 election, conversations in the media started revolving around the Rust Belt working class and these people who may or may not have voted for the current president because they felt “left behind” by the past administration. They felt invisible. But you wrote this play before the election. What has it felt like to create a piece of theater that seems so perfectly centered in culture right now?It’s interesting. You know Werner Herzog, the filmmaker? He said something that I’ve sort of embraced. He said the role of the artist is to keep their eyes open when everyone else’s are shut. And I do think it’s our responsibility to begin asking those difficult questions perhaps earlier than the culture at large. I think that when art and culture collide in moments like this it’s because of a certain necessity. That’s what I felt. I began asking those questions because those questions were not being asked by the culture at large. And the play happened to collide with culture at just the right moment. I do think that’s part of our responsibility as artists.How have the people of Reading reacted to the play? Have they seen it? Have you been in contact with the town?At the end of our run at the Public Theater, [before the play went to Broadway], one of the things that we decided to do was to embrace the mission of the Public, which is really to take the play to the people. To take it out of that proscenium setting, out of the institution, and we took the play to Reading. The entire cast. We did a very stripped-down version of it for a hundred folks in Reading, Pennsylvania, in their Miller theater. It was kind of an electric evening because the actors were very scared about portraying people in the town that absolutely were very familiar with a lot of the cultural references in the play. But at the very end, there were a ton of questions and people seemed to be quite moved. And it almost became like a revival meeting, in which people stood up and testified and told their personal stories about what they’re going through. It was very, very moving.But, by the same token, there have been a couple of people, and they tended by and large to be business people, who worried about ... will this be bad for business in Reading? I think that any time you open up a dialogue around a particular city, it has to be good for the city.Was anyone outright angry about the play?I don’t know that anyone … certainly, when we did the performance [in Reading], no one was angry about the play. I think there’s only been one person I’ve encountered who was angry about the play, from Reading, because it was bad for business. Be damned the people who are struggling, it’s bad for business.Did you feel indebted to these people in any way? Did adapting their stories create another layer of responsibility for you as a playwright?I think it’s not adapting the stories that creates a different layer of responsibility. Sort of getting to know them and forging friendships certainly did. Spending so much time with people you care about and wanting to see a space that’s struggling thrive. I think that’s where I feel my responsibility lies ― with those friendships.What was it like to work on this play over the course of a few years? What were some of the benefits of taking your time to tell this story?I think the benefits of doing it over the course of years is that you can track the movement of people. My assumption, when we first went into Reading, was that we were going to be very typically looking for pockets of resilience ― people who were struggling and found ways to resurrect their lives. Because as a writer, I’m always attracted to the light. I’m never attracted to the darkness or the ugly stories. I’m really looking for people who’ve struggled and really pulled themselves out of their circumstances. Just over the course of two years, you can track and see where people are going, how they are navigating difficult times.That was the benefit, of getting to track people over time and getting a sense of the movement of the city as a whole. And how it was reacting to this article about it being the poorest of cities, how it went into emergency mode and tried to resurrect itself. And where it is today. There are these amazing things that are happening now. In the center of town, there’s a DoubleTree Hotel, in which the manager has committed to hiring 70 percent people within walking distance of the hotel. He’s someone who gives people second chances, too. If you’ve checked that box that says you’ve gone to prison or you’ve been through rehab, he’s not going to automatically reject your application. When you go into that hotel, you feel the vibrancy and the vitality. It’s a perfect case of the community taking care of itself. When it does that, it succeeds.Personally, do you have hope for towns like Reading or other cities similarly situated across the U.S.?I do think that if cities like Reading ― you take the example of the DoubleTree, when cities begin to invest in everybody in the town ― those cities have a good chance of survival. I know that there are a lot of cities saying, you know, let’s let these inner-city neighborhoods die and let’s bring people back from the suburbs. And that’s tough. That’s when you create “ghettos,” in which people become trapped and have no opportunity to leave. But I think that when you say, you know, we’re invested in everyone here, and [ask], ‘How can we build businesses that are inclusive? Businesses that really create opportunity? How can we be creative in the new businesses?’ What Reading realizes is that a lot of those manufacturing jobs aren’t going to come back. So they have to create other ways to employ folks, and I think the more creative cities can be, the better chance they have of resurrecting themselves.In the great New Yorker profile that came out last month, you are quoted as saying “the goal is to create a whole generation of resistance,” in reference to arts institutions closing in and demanding that playwrights shape their visions to the space. Broadly speaking, what is your hope for the future of theater?A perfect example is a time like this, in places like Reading. What they really need, I feel, are storytellers. They need art, they need celebration. But they don’t have those institutions, because all the cultural institutions are in New York and Philadelphia and Chicago. I think that we as artists need to figure out strategies in which we can pull away from some of those institutions that are asking us to create work that can only exist in those spaces and figure out ways to take art to places that are sort of much more hungry for it. And become more agile in the way in which we make art.Are there any plans to tour “Sweat” to places outside of New York?I know that Oskar Eustis became very excited when we did the production in Reading. He said he wants to fundraise to figure out a way to bring, if not “Sweat,” plays like “Sweat” to small towns that don’t have regional theaters and don’t have these big traveling houses. So that people who aren’t used to engaging with theater can come in contact with stories that really resonate with them. What if you take “Sweat” to the Rust Belt towns or upstate New York or small towns in Connecticut or around the country? How cool would it be to begin igniting some sort of dialogue around the issues that are raised in “Sweat” with people who are really touched by some of what’s happening in the play?The tail end is that we’re building this big performance and installation in Reading that will be there in July. The goal is to create something that’s really beautiful for the city, that’s reflective of all of the people; a celebration of them. Something that builds empathy, so that when they leave it, they have a greater sense of who their neighbors are and might be more inclined to reach out to them. It’s going to be at the Franklin Street railroad station in Reading, downtown. It was closed in the ‘80s and became dilapidated, and then five years ago, they renovated the space. Since then, I don’t think it’s been used for anything. So we asked if we could reanimate the space with art. We’ve done a great deal of fundraising and that’s what we’re going to do. It’s our gift to Reading. Our way of saying thank you for inviting us in and allowing us to get to know you.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

The Obama administration issued safety rules for chemical plants in the wake of the deadly explosion, and the GOP is now aiming to repeal them.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e27a3e16000021004d86e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans in Congress are moving to repeal safety regulations issued by the Obama administration in the wake of the deadly 2013 explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas.The House GOP is expected to take up a bill soon that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from moving forward with its new chemical safety regulations this year as planned. A companion bill has already been introduced in the Senate. If approved by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, the legislation would forbid the EPA from ever issuing similar rules again.“I wish I could say I am shocked that Republicans attempting to undo this progress are prioritizing profits over workplace safety,” said Rep. Don Beyer, a Virginia Democrat. “Sadly, this is reflective of the Trump Administration’s efforts to put well-heeled private interests ahead of public safety.”The chemical safety rule is one of more than 30 regulations issued late in Barack Obama’s presidency that Republicans have sought to quash using an arcane tool called the Congressional Review Act. That law enables Congress to pass “resolutions of disapproval” undoing significant federal rules before they take effect. Such resolutions only require a simple majority to pass in the Senate, leaving the Democratic minority unable to filibuster them. The GOP-controlled Congress has sent more than a dozen repeals to Trump already, covering everything from pollution to gun control to workplace safety. The president has signed eight of them so far and is expected to eventually approve all of the ones that land on his desk. Until this year, the Congressional Review Act had only been used successfully once, in 2001. But with the GOP controlling both chambers of Congress as well as the White House, it has become the go-to tool for dismantling new regulations opposed by businesses and their lobbies.The Obama administration began pursuing the chemical safety reforms in 2013 after the infamous Texas explosion killed 15 people, 12 of them first responders, and destroyed much of the surrounding community. In their official investigation on the incident, federal officials discovered safety lapses by the company and its insurers, as well as shortcomings in oversight by federal and state agencies.The new regulation that Republicans want to scuttle was meant to address lapses by the EPA in its risk management program. Among other changes, the new regulations would require facilities covered by the law to study whether they could be using safer technologies to protect workers and the surrounding community. It would also require facilities that have had accidents to pay for safety audits performed by independent third parties. In other words, companies would be expected to help fund some of the safety improvements.Lobbies for the chemical and petroleum industries asked the Trump administration to temporarily stop the rules from going into effect. EPA head Scott Pruitt, who sued the agency repeatedly before being plucked to lead it, obliged. Now Congress may block the rule for good.Jordan Barab, a former official at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, wrote on his blog that businesses have tried to block the rule by citing the possibility that the explosion in West was sparked by arson, as opposed to a breakdown in corporate accountability. Barab said the arson issue is a red herring. “They don’t want to pay for the safeguards that are needed and they don’t want any stinkin’ government agencies telling them how to do their business,” he wrote.When the EPA rolled out its reforms, it noted that the disaster in West, Texas, was just one of many deadly chemical plant mishaps in recent years. According to the agency, over the past decade there have been more than 1,500 accidents, including 60 deaths, at facilities covered by the risk management program.The Trump administration has not said explicitly what it will do with a repeal of the EPA rule if it’s passed by Congress, but all the signals so far suggest Trump will sign it. The White House has launched a full-scale assault on federal regulations, including executive orders that make it harder for federal agencies to issue new rules. Trump has said he wants to repeal two regulations for every new one that goes into effect.The new president has shown little love for chemical safety regulations in particular. In fact, his proposed budget would wipe out the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, which is responsible for investigating accidents and enforcing safety laws. Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Kulig jumped into action — after checking to make sure a train wasn’t bearing down on him.“Once I looked and saw that a train wasn’t coming, I sort of had a path of where to go,” he told Fox News.He knew a little about where to step because he’d recently taken a track-safety training program provided by the city’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Kulig told the New York Post.“I’m not an expert, but I knew enough to keep myself safe,” he said.As Kulig was picking the man up, an audio recording announced that a train was entering the station on the Brooklyn-bound tracks. Although he didn’t know it at the time, he had about a minute before the train would arrive.Kulig lifted the man onto the platform and then hauled himself up in time. The man was later taken to a nearby hospital for non-critical injuries, the Post reported citing the city’s fire department.Asked by Fox News if he blamed others for not jumping onto the tracks as well, Kulig answered no. He figured they were likely scared and unsure of what to do, whereas he at least had some training.Asked if he would do it again, he replied, “Yeah, I think I would.”He also shared that yes, he is single."

Flynn subsequently resigned that post after his contacts with Russian officials were revealed despite his claims that there had not been any.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e3f5d41500002100c7deaa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump’s White House is turning its fire on a favorite Republican villain as it tries to deflect attention from his campaign’s contacts with the foreign power that worked to get him elected.Susan Rice, the Obama administration’s national security adviser, became a GOP scapegoat for her initial explanation for the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya. Now, she has again become the go-to culprit for her possible role in “unmasking” the names of Trump associates in intelligence reports during the final weeks of President Barack Obama’s tenure. “The more we find out about this, the more we learn that there was clearly something there,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday. “There is a civil liberties component to this that should be very troubling.”Rice, in an interview with MSNBC, denied leaking classified information, but said it was part of her job to find out the names of Americans who were speaking with agents of foreign governments that may have interfered in the November election. The names of Americans appearing in those reports are redacted and referenced with codes. Top national security officials are permitted to ask intelligence agencies to provide the names, should they deem it important.“Imagine if we saw something of grave significance that involved Russia, or China, or anybody else, interfering in our political process,” Rice said. “For us not to try to understand it would be dereliction of duty.”Rice was Obama’s ambassador to the United Nations in 2012, when four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, were killed in Benghazi. In the days afterward, the Obama administration and Rice attributed the attack to protests over a YouTube video that mocked Islam.The administration corrected this account to call it a planned, coordinated terrorist attack, but Republican outrage over Rice’s erroneous “talking points” remained a favorite GOP attack line for years. Obama had wanted to appoint Rice secretary of state for his second term, but she wound up withdrawing her name when it became clear that Senate Republicans would not support her nomination. That post went to Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, and Obama instead made Rice his national security adviser, a job that does not require Senate confirmation.It was in her final weeks in that role that Rice, according to a report published by Bloomberg, asked intelligence agencies to “unmask” the names of Americans appearing in surveillance reports of foreign agents.Spicer asserted on Tuesday, without offering evidence: “There is no value in this intelligence. Why was somebody unmasked if that was the case?”When pressed how he knew that Rice, as the sitting national security adviser, did not have good reason to ask for unmasking, Spicer conceded that he did not know.“It depends on the purpose of why they were asking and what they were trying to accomplish,” Spicer said.By the time of the election, U.S. intelligence agencies believed that Russia not only had been meddling in the campaign, but was actively trying to help Trump win.“From basically August through the end of the administration, we were hearing more and more, getting more and more information, about Russian interference in our electoral process. It was of grave concern to all of us in the national security team of the president, and the president himself,” Rice said.“A hostile government inserted itself in our election process in a significant way, and doing so with biased intent,” she added. “It’s important that the American people understand this, and it’s important that we improve our defenses against this kind of effort in the future. Because if we don’t, we should well assume that they will continue to try to do so.”"

Kids were hugging each other, jumping up and down, screaming! It was more than I imagined,” she told The Huffington Post.Last September, Blomquist started a campaign on GoFundMe entitled “Every Kid Deserves A Bike!” “I see directly the struggles and the difficult hands in life some children are dealt,” she wrote in her GoFundMe campaign. “Many do not have the chance to visit places outside their immediate community or have a variety of experiences over weekends and the summer; rather, many children solely play on their street with neighborhood kids or strictly watch television.””I soon began to envision how each student’s quality of life could improve if they had more freedom to ride around their neighborhoods,” she added. Blomquist ultimately raised a little over $80,000. In addition to the bikes, helmets and locks, the money was also used to pay for the trucking company who brought the bikes to the school and stored them overnight. The bikes were originally intended to be a Christmas gift, but the money wasn’t raised in time and shipping was delayed. Instead, they were delivered just in time for spring. “A bike represents so many things,” Blomquist told The Huffington Post. “It represents a sense of ownership, of freedom, exercise, transportation, but most importantly it represents the basic childhood right ― a right to joy.” Inspired by the experience, Blomquist has created a GoFundMe for her new charity, which is called “Going Places,” and has the mission “to bring joy to deserving children from low income families by providing them with bikes, swim lessons, summer camp opportunities, and more.” "

Together, they plan to unite activists across all fields to rally around shared values and intersecting struggles. As part of their first full-fledged effort, The Majority launched Beyond The Moment on Tuesday, an effort that aims to educate people across the country about important political issues and engage them in various organized efforts to speak out against issues that could harm marginalized communities most. The campaign, which kicks off on April 4, the anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King’s assassination, and ends on May 1, the national day of action, includes a series of events, protests, rallies and teach-ins designed to attract people of all backgrounds and ethnicities to stand up against both local and national issues.Some of the events occurring in different cities throughout the month include the Resist. Reimagine. Rebuild. Citywide Teach-in in Chicago, IL, the #NoCopsInSchool rally in Madison, WI and the Still Fighting for the Dream event in Detroit, MI. “In the context of Trump’s presidency, it is imperative that we put forth a true, collective vision of economic justice and worker justice, for all people,” The Majority said in a statement sent to The Huffington Post. The Majority was largely put together by The Movement for Black Lives, which is a network that includes several organizations focused on a “hopeful and inclusive vision of Black joy, safety and prosperity,” according to the coalition’s website. “In this moment, Black and Brown people, immigrant communities, the economically unstable, women, children, the disabled, the LGBTQ community, those working to protect our right to work and those fighting for our right to clean air and water, are all facing attacks because a minority whose values are rooted in white supremacy, division and hatred have taken power,” a statement on the website reads.“Although in power, hate is not the majority,” it notes. “People who believe in freedom, justice and the humanity of all people are the majority, and we’ve had enough.” For more information on Beyond The Moment, check out www.beyondthemoment.org or use the hashtag #beyondthemoment.Correction: An earlier version of this story misreported the name of the Beyond The Moment campaign.

Fanning, who held the job under President Barack Obama, was the first openly gay person to serve in the role.Green is the sponsor of SB 127, a bill that would bar government entities from taking “discriminatory action against a business entity on the basis of the internal policies of the business entity.” Tennessee does not currently have nondiscrimination protections on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, although some municipalities do have stronger rules protecting LGBTQ government employees.

She cited time and costs for travel, lost wages, and child care.The judge issued a temporary injunction against the law, and dinged the “near absence of evidence” by Indiana to support its contention that the ultrasounds would further what legislators see as the state’s interest in convincing women not to have an abortion. (The state’s evidence claiming that abortions cause negative mental health outcomes is “suspect at best,” the judge noted.)The provison’s “burdens ... on women seeking to terminate their pregnancies ... dramatically outweigh the benefits, making the burdens undue and the new ultrasound law likely unconstitutional,” Pratt wrote.The change in ultrasound timing was part of a series of abortion restrictions the state had passed, which then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed last spring. Previously, women could obtain ultrasounds immediately before an abortion.Pratt previously blocked the law’s ban on abortions because of genetic abnormalities in a fetus — and a provision requiring that aborted fetuses be buried or cremated, the Indianapolis Star reported Monday.The suit against the mandate, which the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky filed, argued that nine women were unable to get abortions because they could not afford to make two trips to clinics. One woman could not afford care for her special needs child.There was no immediate statement on the decision from Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill, and no word on whether the state would appeal.“I’m hoping the state gives up and we agree that this become final,” said Ken Falk, legal director of ACLU Indiana, according to CBS News. “But I don’t think that will happen.”"

As the camera turned to look at the object of the commotion, one woman summed it up perfectly: “It got Grandma!”There, sitting in the front row, grandma turned to reveal a chunk of feces stuck to her nose. (Everyone was laughing, but we can only imagine what happened when they got home.)In a statement, the zoo acknowledged the filthy incident but suggested that the chimp’s behavior was fueled by the audience’s own antics.“One of the chimpanzees is very focused on and likes to interact with people. Sometimes, this chimpanzee will exhibit behaviors that some people respond to with laughter, loud noises, and imitation. This, unfortunately, encourages even more of this behavior and resulted in the situation on Sunday,” the zoo stated in a Facebook post.The YouTube video’s description also discourages “taunting” and “teasing” of animals in zoo habitats, stating: “Zoo staff would like to keep animals as calm and comfortable in their habitats as possible. It is critical to not tap on glass, shout at the animals, or attempt to feed them.”Though the video is listed as having been filmed by a member of the zoo’s staff, the zoo, in its statement, said that it was taken by a guest and “not a current zoo employee.”The zoo added that its staff met with a chimpanzee behavioral specialist over this past winter to encourage “more appropriate behaviors” among their animals. They also plan to install additional barriers to prevent such an incident from happening again.Not everyone responding to the Facebook post agreed with the idea of more barriers, however, or the zoo apologizing for what happened ― as unfortunate as the incident was.

Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for that attack. Damascus blamed rebels.The head of the health authority in rebel-held Idlib said more than 50 people had been killed and 300 wounded in the latest incident. The Union of Medical Care Organizations, a coalition of international aid agencies that funds hospitals in Syria, said at least 100 people had died.The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack killed at least 58 people and was believed to have been carried out by Syrian government jets. It caused many people to choke and some to foam at the mouth.Director Rami Abdulrahman told Reuters the assessment that Syrian government warplanes were to blame was based on several factors such as the type of aircraft, including Sukhoi 22 jets, that carried out the raid.“We deny completely the use of any chemical or toxic material in Khan Sheikhoun town today and the army has not used nor will use in any place or time neither in past or in future,” the Syrian army command said in a statement.Damascus has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the six-year civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands and created the world’s worst refugee crisis.The Russian Defence Ministry said its aircraft had not carried out the attack. The U.N. Security Council was expected to meet on Wednesday to discuss the incident.Reuters photographs showed people breathing through oxygen masks and wearing protection suits, while others carried the bodies of dead children. Corpses wrapped in blankets were lined up on the ground.Activists in northern Syria circulated pictures on social media showing a man with foam around his mouth, and rescue workers hosing down almost-naked children squirming on the floor.A senior U.S. State Department official said it appeared that the attack blamed on Assad amounted to a war crime.HOSPITALS OVERFLOWINGMounzer Khalil, head of Idlib’s health authority, said hospitals in the province were overflowing with victims.“This morning, at 6:30 a.m., warplanes targeted Khan Sheikhoun with gases, believed to be sarin and chlorine,” he told a news conference.Warplanes later struck near a medical point where victims of the attack were receiving treatment, the Observatory and civil defense workers said.The civil defense, also known as the White Helmets - a rescue service that operates in opposition areas - said jets struck one of its centers in the area and the nearby medical point.The White House called the attack an “intolerable act” and said President Donald Trump was alarmed by the reports.French President Francois Hollande directly blamed Syrian government forces and said Assad’s allies were emboldening him to act with impunity.Assad has enjoyed staunch military backing from Iran and Russia in the war.Britain said he would be guilty of a war crime if it were proved that his government was responsible. British Prime Minister Theresa May called for an investigation into the attack.The U.N. envoy for Syria said the “horrific” chemical attack had come from the air.In February, Russia, backed by China, cast its seventh veto to protect Assad’s government from Security Council action, blocking a bid by Western powers to impose sanctions over accusations of chemical weapons attacks during the conflict.A series of investigations by the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) found that various parties in the Syrian war had used chlorine, sulfur mustard gas and sarin.A joint U.N.-OPCW report published in October said government forces used chlorine in a toxic gas attack in Qmenas in Idlib province in March 2015. An earlier report by the same team blamedSyrian government troops for chlorine attacks in Talmenes in March 2014 and Sarmin in March 2015. It also said Islamic State had used sulfur mustard gas.The OPCW said it had begun “gathering and analyzing information from all available sources” about the suspected Khan Sheikhoun attack.Turkey, which backs the anti-Assad opposition, said the attack could derail Russian-backed diplomatic efforts to shore up a ceasefire.Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency said 15 people hurt in the attack, mostly women and children, had been taken to Turkey.Footage from Turkey’s Dogan news agency showed at least four people being brought out of ambulances on stretchers in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli by medical staff wearing face masks.

Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for that attack. Damascus blamed rebels.The head of the health authority in rebel-held Idlib said more than 50 people had been killed and 300 wounded in the latest incident. The Union of Medical Care Organizations, a coalition of international aid agencies that funds hospitals in Syria, said at least 100 people had died.The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack killed at least 58 people and was believed to have been carried out by Syrian government jets. It caused many people to choke and some to foam at the mouth.Director Rami Abdulrahman told Reuters the assessment that Syrian government warplanes were to blame was based on several factors such as the type of aircraft, including Sukhoi 22 jets, that carried out the raid.“We deny completely the use of any chemical or toxic material in Khan Sheikhoun town today and the army has not used nor will use in any place or time neither in past or in future,” the Syrian army command said in a statement.Damascus has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the six-year civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands and created the world’s worst refugee crisis.The Russian Defence Ministry said its aircraft had not carried out the attack. The U.N. Security Council was expected to meet on Wednesday to discuss the incident.Reuters photographs showed people breathing through oxygen masks and wearing protection suits, while others carried the bodies of dead children. Corpses wrapped in blankets were lined up on the ground.Activists in northern Syria circulated pictures on social media showing a man with foam around his mouth, and rescue workers hosing down almost-naked children squirming on the floor.A senior U.S. State Department official said it appeared that the attack blamed on Assad amounted to a war crime.HOSPITALS OVERFLOWINGMounzer Khalil, head of Idlib’s health authority, said hospitals in the province were overflowing with victims.“This morning, at 6:30 a.m., warplanes targeted Khan Sheikhoun with gases, believed to be sarin and chlorine,” he told a news conference.Warplanes later struck near a medical point where victims of the attack were receiving treatment, the Observatory and civil defense workers said.The civil defense, also known as the White Helmets - a rescue service that operates in opposition areas - said jets struck one of its centers in the area and the nearby medical point.The White House called the attack an “intolerable act” and said President Donald Trump was alarmed by the reports.French President Francois Hollande directly blamed Syrian government forces and said Assad’s allies were emboldening him to act with impunity.Assad has enjoyed staunch military backing from Iran and Russia in the war.Britain said he would be guilty of a war crime if it were proved that his government was responsible. British Prime Minister Theresa May called for an investigation into the attack.The U.N. envoy for Syria said the “horrific” chemical attack had come from the air.In February, Russia, backed by China, cast its seventh veto to protect Assad’s government from Security Council action, blocking a bid by Western powers to impose sanctions over accusations of chemical weapons attacks during the conflict.A series of investigations by the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) found that various parties in the Syrian war had used chlorine, sulfur mustard gas and sarin.A joint U.N.-OPCW report published in October said government forces used chlorine in a toxic gas attack in Qmenas in Idlib province in March 2015. An earlier report by the same team blamedSyrian government troops for chlorine attacks in Talmenes in March 2014 and Sarmin in March 2015. It also said Islamic State had used sulfur mustard gas.The OPCW said it had begun “gathering and analyzing information from all available sources” about the suspected Khan Sheikhoun attack.Turkey, which backs the anti-Assad opposition, said the attack could derail Russian-backed diplomatic efforts to shore up a ceasefire.Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency said 15 people hurt in the attack, mostly women and children, had been taken to Turkey.Footage from Turkey’s Dogan news agency showed at least four people being brought out of ambulances on stretchers in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli by medical staff wearing face masks. One was a young boy.An official at the Turkish Health Ministry said Turkey’s disaster management agency was first “scanning those arriving for chemical weapons, then decontaminating them from chemicals” before they could be taken to hospital.Idlib province contains the largest populated area controlled by anti-Assad rebels - both nationalist Free Syrian Army groups and powerful Islamist factions including the former al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the suspected attack, Turkish presidential sources said.

78,MEDIA,Fox News Is Hit With Another Sexual Harassment Suit,Emily Peck and Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-sexual-harassment_us_58e26717e4b0ba359596b0b2,Contributor Julie Roginsky claims former Fox News chief Roger Ailes harassed her and the network targeted her for retaliation.,2017-04-03,Fox News contributor Julie Roginsky is the latest woman to sue former Chairman Roger Ailes over harassment.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e277f82c00006568ff1f27.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fox News, its co-president Bill Shine and its former chairman Roger Ailes were hit with another sexual harassment lawsuit on Monday, the latest accusations to rock a network already reeling from revelations this past weekend about its biggest star, Bill O’Reilly. On-air contributor Julie Roginsky filed a complaint Monday in New York state court claiming that Ailes made repeated sexual advances toward her. After she turned them down, Roginsky alleges that Fox News and Shine, specifically, retaliated against her by denying her opportunities at the top-rated cable news network.Shine, a longtime Fox News executive, became co-president after the resignation of Ailes, who left amid widespread harassment allegations in July. The lawsuit alleges that Roginsky faced repercussions for not joining “Team Roger” by initially defending the network boss following the sexual harassment lawsuit filed by former host Gretchen Carlson. The latest allegations raise more troubling questions about Shine’s current stewardship of Fox News and the toxic culture fostered during Ailes’ 20-year reign.Roginsky’s claims follow other recent lawsuits against high-level Fox employees that alleged sexual assault and racial discrimination, and a New York Times investigation published Saturday on $13 million having been paid in settlements to five O’Reilly accusers. Meanwhile, Fox News host Andrea Tantaros’ suit against Ailes, Shine, and others executives is still outstanding. A Fox News spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The recent suits come as federal investigators are looking into whether 21st Century Fox, the Murdoch family-run parent company of Fox News, properly informed investors about settlement payments to various women who’d accused Ailes of harassment. Though 21st Century Fox hired an outside law firm last summer to investigate claims against Ailes, Lisa Bloom, the attorney for a former Fox News guest accusing O’Reilly of harassment, called Sunday for an independent investigation.Ailes’ interest in Roginsky, who’d been appearing on Fox News since 2004, allegedly began in earnest in 2015, after she landed a co-hosting role on the afternoon show “The Five.” According to the suit, Ailes would call her in for one-on-one meetings, where conversation would lead to Roginsky’s personal life. Ailes allegedly would ask who she was dating and why she wasn’t married.This was just the beginning of the inappropriate behavior Roginsky describes in the suit: “During these meetings, Ailes additionally (and without irony) volunteered the advice that Roginsky should engage in sexual relationships with ‘older, married, conservative men’ because ‘they may stray but they always come back because they’re loyal.’” Ailes also told Roginsky, in what seemed like a clear warning, that he was loyal but that loyalty was a two-way street, according to the suit. At the meetings, Ailes would insist on a kiss hello, but he would be seated in a low armchair. That meant Roginsky had to bend down to reach his cheek, according to the suit. All along, Roginksy, who the lawsuit describes as a liberal, thought she was in the running for a permanent position on “The Five.” But in April 2015, Ailes called Roginsky in for what would be their final one-on-one. He “toyed” with Roginsky, the suit alleges, about giving her a permanent spot. Then he allegedly said that “if it wouldn’t get us both in so much trouble,” he would take her out for a drink. Instead, Ailes suggested a drink in his office. When Roginsky declined, Ailes dismissed her and refused to meet with her again, despite repeated requests, according to the suit. Ailes gave Roginsky’s spot to Geraldo Rivera.After Carlson filed her suit against Ailes last summer, another Fox contributor, Angela McGlowan, asked Roginsky if she was game to join “Team Roger,” the group of Fox employees and contributors publicly defending Ailes against Carlson’s allegations and other complaints.Roginsky refused to sign up for the project, telling McGlowan she believed Carlson’s claims and that she had also been propositioned by Ailes. According to the suit, McGlowan told Fox News executives ― including Shine, the current co-president ― about Roginsky’s claims.Roginsky is being represented by attorney Nancy Erika Smith, who also represented Carlson. The accusations in Roginsky’s suit appear particularly damming for Shine. She claims that even after she personally told him of her experience with Ailes, he and other executives at Fox took no action to investigate ― even as an outside law firm, hired by Fox, investigated the charges against Ailes over the summer.Yet Roginsky remained hopeful, particularly after Ailes was ousted in July. She repeatedly tried to meet with Shine, seeking a full-time slot on the Fox program “Outnumbered.”But instead of meeting with Shine, she heard from Fox News counsel Dianne Brandi, who told Roginsky that she would not be considered for a position if she was threatening to sue Ailes, according to the suit.When she finally met with Shine in the fall, he seemed more interested in talking about the Eagles than about her career prospects. According to the suit, Shine told Roginsky she should watch a Showtime documentary about the rock band because their story was very similar to the story of Fox News.“In the same way that such brilliant musicians as Glenn Frey, Linda Ronstadt and Jackson Browne could only have come together at ‘one place and one time in history,’ so it was with Bill O’Reilly, Sean Hannity, Suzanne Scott, Roger Ailes and Bill Shine coming together to form Fox News,” the lawsuit says, in an apparent paraphrase of Shine’s remarks.In a follow-up meeting in December, Shine told Roginsky he’d only recently learned about Ailes’ harassing women at Fox. But the suit argues that couldn’t have been true, since Shine had years before helped negotiate a secret multimillion-dollar payment to former Fox employee Laurie Luhn, who said she’d suffered years of abuse from Ailes.At the December meeting, Shine again asked Roginsky if she’d seen the Eagles documentary. She had not.Shine didn’t wind up giving her a permanent hosting slot.Read the full suit below:"

Terry McAuliffe said President Donald Trump is a ""one-man wrecking crew"" on the economy.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e2bd5a2c00006568ff206d.jpeg?ops=crop_20_193_3473_2141%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe has a two-pronged strategy for his fellow Democrats to regain power in the age of Trump: Don’t get distracted by the chaos and prioritize the states. In an interview with The Huffington Post, McAuliffe called on Democrats to simplify their message down to its most fundamental, Clintonian core. For all the talk of Russian connections, disorganization and dubious ethics, McAuliffe argued, voters care most about the economy. Democrats would be wise to explain how President Donald Trump is failing them on that front. “Don’t chase the shiny objects,” McAuliffe said, advising those running for office. “The public is sick of people picking partisan fights for the sake of fights. I don’t pick fights with Trump for the sake of picking arguments. I am one of his most vocal critics because, as I’ve said, this man is a one-man wrecking crew to my economy.”A year ago, few would have imagined McAuliffe playing the role of Moses leading Democrats through their desert days. Prohibited from running for re-election himself in 2017, the longtime ally of the Clintons seemed poised to find his way to the White House in some capacity once Hillary Clinton won.  Trump’s victory changed that. So too did the Democratic Party’s paltry showing in governor’s races across the country. Suddenly, McAuliffe was one of just 16 Democrats in a top executive office and one of the few who hailed from a swing state. In the first few months of the Trump administration, he emerged as a party power broker, one of the president’s most assertive critics, and an oft-rumored candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. For now, McAuliffe said his sights are set on the midterm elections. Twenty-seven of the 38 governorships on the ballot this year and the next are Republican-held. A failure to score gubernatorial wins in 2018, McAuliffe argues, could very well doom the Democratic Party’s future by leaving it with too little power in the redistricting battles of 2021. He has joined the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, alongside former Attorney General Eric Holder and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).“We, as a party, if we don’t win a vast majority of these governorships, then we are out of the game. I don’t care what you say,” McAuliffe said. “Our party loves to focus on the federal. We love every four years to come out in the presidential and raise untold amounts of money and then everybody goes away. We have got to focus on those state chambers and on governors.”Declaring a focus on 2018 is one thing. Building up to win back the House and flip multiple governor’s mansions is another. A former chair of the Democratic National Committee himself, McAuliffe said he didn’t expect the newly elected Tom Perez to be the face of the party’s revival. The chair’s job, he said, was about the “nuts and bolts of our party,” not necessarily being the “chief spokesman.” Instead, McAuliffe wants Democratic leaders in Congress and the states to speak up. He encouraged them to weave arguments that rest heavily on the idea that Trump has failed in his pledge of economic revival, whether it be in straightforward ways (cutting budgets, failing to prioritize infrastructure) or a roundabout manner (instituting a travel ban that discourages companies from doing business in America, hampering academic and scientific research). “That train is so far off the track today,” McAuliffe said. “I said early on during the transition that I would work with the president. … Every governor will give you the same speech: ‘We will work with him if he works with us on jobs and infrastructure and health care.’ He hasn’t done any of it. He has shattered that. The glass is gone. It is on the floor shattered.”"

He’s done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation. We are very much behind Egypt and the people of Egypt,” Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with the Egyptian leader.The trip was Sisi’s first official U.S. visit since being elected president in 2014. Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, never extended an invitation.Obama froze aid to Egypt for two years after Sisi, then a general, overthrew President Mohamed Mursi in mid-2013 after mass protests against Mursi’s rule. Mursi, a Muslim Brotherhood member, had been elected the previous year.The one-on-one meeting between Trump and Sisi, followed by a separate gathering with top aides, showed how intent the new U.S. president is on rebooting the bilateral relationship and building on the strong connection the two presidents established when they first met in New York last September.“I just want to say to you, Mr President, that you have a great friend and ally in the United States, and in me,” Trump said.Sisi said he appreciated that Trump has been “standing very strong ... to counter this evil ideology.”While Trump noted the United States and Egypt “have a few things” they do not agree on, he made no public airing of U.S. concerns about human rights in Egypt.Rights groups have called for the release of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American who works with street children and was arrested in May 2014 on human trafficking charges.Hijazi has been held in custody for 33 months in violation of Egyptian law, which states that the maximum period for pretrial detention is 24 months.A senior administration official said the subject of Hijazi did not come up in the meeting with Trump, Sisi and their advisers but said the detention is an issue of concern and a case that is being watched closely by the Trump administration.White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the two presidents had an “honest discussion focused on areas of cooperation” and that they discussed “both areas of cooperation and of concern.”At the United Nations in New York, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said the Trump administration is not backing away from human rights “because they fully support me speaking about human rights in the Security Council.”Human rights groups have estimated that Sisi’s government has detained at least 40,000 political prisoners.Egypt has long been one of Washington’s closest allies in the Middle East, receiving $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid annually. It is fighting an Islamist insurgency in Sinai in which hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police have been killed.A U.S. official said Sisi would find a White House ready to soften U.S. criticism of Egypt on human rights and to work on counter-terrorism but unwilling to provide additional aid to the most populous Arab nation.“He’s going to get an end to finger-wagging. We’re not giving him any more money,” said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity before Sisi’s meetings with Trump.“He’s going to be disappointed because he wants more assistance and he’s not going to get it,” the official added, saying it was not yet clear whether Egypt would escape a cut in its foreign aid as part of the Trump administration’s plan to cut the overall State Department budget by 28.7 percent.(Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed, Ayesha Rascoe, Roberta Rampton and Jeff Mason; Editing by James Dalgleish)"

PETERSBURG, Russia, April 3 (Reuters) - A blast in a St Petersburg train carriage on Monday that killed 11 people and injured 45 was carried out by a suspected suicide bomber with ties to radical Islamists, Russia’s Interfax news agency cited a law enforcement source as saying.If it is confirmed that the bomb was carried out by radical Islamists, the Kremlin is likely to argue the attack underlines the importance of its campaign in Syria, where it is backing President Bashar al-Assad in a fight against Islamist militants.But some sections of Russian society may see the metro bombing as proof that Putin’s decision to intervene in Syria has again made Russian civilians into targets.Two years ago, the Islamic State group said it brought down a plane carrying Russian tourists home from a Red Sea resort. All 224 people on board the flight were killed.BLOODY FACESSoon after the blast happened at 2:40 p.m., ambulances and fire engines descended on the concrete-and-glass Sennaya Ploshchad station. One helicopter hovered overhead and then landed on a broad avenue to take away an injured passenger.“I saw a lot of smoke, a crowd making its way to the escalators, people with blood and other people’s insides on their clothes, bloody faces,” St Petersburg resident Leonid Chaika, who said he was at the station where the blast happened, told Reuters by phone. “Many were crying.”The National Anti-Terrorist Committee said an explosive device had been found at another station, hidden in a fire extinguisher, but had been defused.The blast raised security fears beyond Russian frontiers. France, which has itself suffered a series of attacks, announced additional security measures in Paris.Video from the scene showed injured people lying bleeding on a platform, some being treated by emergency services and fellow passengers. Others ran away from the platform amid clouds of smoke, some screaming or holding their hands to their faces.A huge hole was blasted in the side of a carriage and the door blown off, with metal wreckage strewn across the platform. Passengers were seen hammering at the windows of one closed carriage after the train had pulled into the station.Russian TV said many had suffered lacerations from glass shards and metal, the force of the explosion amplified by the confines of the carriage and the tunnel.Anna Sventik, a St Petersburg resident, was traveling on a metro train that passed through the same station moments after the blast.“Our train slowed down a bit, and one woman started having hysterics when she saw the people lying on the platform, blackened, in some places with no clothes, burned,” she told Reuters. “It was very scary.”ALL STATIONS CLOSEDOfficials had earlier on Monday put the death toll from the explosion at 10 people, but the National Anti-Terrorist Committee, a state agency, later said 11 people were killed and 45 were being treated for their injuries in hospital.Authorities closed all St. Petersburg metro stations.

Reuters was among a small group of reporters traveling with the U.S. delegation.Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, did not speak with reporters during the flight to Iraq.Dunford’s spokesman, Navy Captain Greg Hicks, said Kushner was traveling on behalf of Trump to express the president’s support and commitment to Iraq’s government and U.S. personnel helping combat Islamic State.Trump, who campaigned on defeating Islamic State, has yet to announce any dramatic shift in war strategy.U.S. ROLE AFTER MOSUL FIGHTThe trip to Iraq comes as Iraqi security forces engage in fierce, house-to-house fighting to retake Mosul, Islamic State’s last major stronghold in Iraq and the city where leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate nearly three years ago.Nearly 290,000 people have fled the city to escape the fighting, according to the United Nations.Although the loss of Mosul would deal a major defeat to Islamic State, U.S. and Iraqi officials are preparing for smaller battles even after the city is recaptured and expect the group to go underground to fight as a traditional insurgency.What happens to the U.S. military role in Iraq after Mosul is recaptured remain unclear.Influential Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has previously called on Iraq’s government to order the withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces after the battle of Mosul is over.Dunford said Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi understood the need for continued U.S. military support.“It’s not our judgment that the Iraqis will be self sustaining and self sufficient in the wake of Mosul. More importantly, it’s not Prime Minister Abadi’s assessment,” Dunford said.Across the border in Syria, a U.S.-backed campaign to isolate Islamic State’s de facto capital of Raqqa is advancing ahead of an eventual assault on the city.U.S.-backed Syrian forces repelled a major counter-attack by Islamic State militants holding out at the country’s largest dam and in the nearby town of Tabqa, the group and activists said on Sunday. The dam is a strategic target in the military campaign, located about 40 km (25 miles) to the east of Raqqa.(Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Giles Elgood)"

Authorities spotted the raft after an official on board the 1,020-foot freighter known as the Stellar Daisy texted the vessel’s South Korean owner, Polaris Shipping, that it was taking on water. At the time, the freighter was about 1,500 miles off the coast of Uruguay, Reuters reported.Other life boats were seen in the water as well, but they were empty, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported on Sunday. Searchers also spotted fuel and debris in the water.“A ship observed an oil sheen and debris in addition to smelling a strong petroleum odor, which indicates that the stricken vessel has sunk,” the Uruguayan navy said in a statement.“The more hours pass, the less the chances are of finding” survivors, a spokesman for the navy told Reuters.According to the Fleetmon maritime news site, one of the rescued crewmen said he went to the starboard deck wearing a life vest when the freighter began listing about 15 degrees. Several other seamen, also in life vests, were gathered on the deck when the crewman spotted several cracks in the ship. He watched as at least one crew member jumped into the water and swam away from the ship. The vessel reportedly capsized very quickly, broke apart and sank.The Uruguayan navy alerted merchant ships in the area about the incident, and a search for the missing freighter was launched. “A search operation is continuing for the 22 people,” said a South Korean foreign ministry official. Eight of the missing crew members were South Korean nationals, and 14 were Filipino.South Korea has asked for additional help from the Brazilian navy. A Brazilian destroyer with a rescue helicopter is steaming to the scene, and is expected to arrive on Tuesday.The cause of the capsize was not known; however, the weather was calm and likely didn’t play a role.When it disappeared, the freighter was hauling iron ore from Brazil to China."

Then, in March, the factory closed and Bean lost his job, along with 200 other people. Citing the increased popularity of cremation, Batesville Casket’s parent company said it needed to shift production of wooden caskets to Mexico in order to remain competitive. Bean said that he grew up in Batesville and that locals cherished their association with the company, which is one of the funeral service industry’s most iconic brands. “Everyone was proud of it,” Bean said. “But now it’s different.”Last year, Batesville’s mayor went on local television and reached out to Republican Party officials in hopes of drawing Donald Trump’s attention to the shutdown. Trump had made saving factory jobs a major campaign issue and even pushed Carrier Corporation not to close a furnace factory in Indianapolis. But Bean said he never expected Trump to intervene in Batesville. “I believe in God and he’s the one that takes care of me, not the president,” he said. One reason that Batesville’s factory shutdown might not have received as much attention as Carrier’s plan, which received a lot, was that Bean and his colleagues lacked the protection of a union. Unlike Carrier workers, who denounced their employer to anyone who would listen, Batesville workers kept quiet.“We didn’t want to jeopardize anything,” Bean said, referring to a severance package that he’d hoped would be hefty but that turned out to be rather disappointing. He had expected six months’ pay, but after taxes he said he wound up with two or three months’ worth. Bean said he has two other part-time jobs. He considers himself better off than many of his former colleagues. “People in Batesville are not pleased with what happened and we’re not pleased with the package we got,” Bean said. Batesville Casket’s parent company, Hillenbrand Inc., is headquartered in Batesville, Indiana. The firm operates three other plants in the U.S. and one in Mexico. A spokesperson declined to comment for this story.The town of Batesville, Mississippi, is located in Panola County, the southwestern-most corner of the Appalachia region that has long symbolized America’s working class woes. Speaking to West Virginia Public Broadcasting and West Virginia University for a project called 100 Days in Appalachia, Bean said he had taken great pride in his work, even initialing finished caskets.“That pride is no longer there, because they will not be made in Batesville, Mississippi,” Bean said in a story on 100DaysInAppalachia.com. “They will not be made in America, but be made in another country. I don’t take pride in that at all.”Arthur Delaney co-hosts “So That Happened,” the HuffPost Politics internet radio show:"
