It’s the life in your years.”Problem is, there’s no evidence that Lincoln ever used that expression, according to Quote Investigator.The site, which is run by quote sleuth Garson O’Toole, says the line was probably first used in the 1940s to advertise a book on aging by Dr. Edward J. Stieglitz.“The important thing to you is not how many years in your life, but how much life in your years!” the ad read.Adlai Stevenson II, a former governor of Illinois and Democratic presidential nominee, reportedly used a similar version of the quote in speeches a few years later. Twitter users were quick to point out this gaffe, as well as suggest some other lines Lincoln could have said — but we can all but guarantee he didn’t."

The Oscar-winning actress delivered powerful remarks about politics at the Golden Globes in January, prompting Donald Trump, then the president-elect, to describe her in a tweet as “over-rated.” And on Saturday night, she responded to the president’s post-Globes Twitter comments during yet another rousing speech ― this time addressing LGBTQ freedoms and equal rights. Though she didn’t mention Trump by name, Streep did joke about his tweet blasting her Globes speech, and called out his “catastrophic instinct to retaliate.”“Yes, I am the most overrated, over-decorated, and currently, over-berated actress … of my generation,” she joked on Saturday, while accepting the Ally for Equality Award from the Human Rights Campaign, according to Entertainment Weekly. “But that is why you invited me here! Right?”Things turned serious when Streep spoke about politics. “If you think people got mad when they thought the government was coming after their guns, wait until they come and try to take away our happiness,” she told the audience, which gave her multiple standing ovations.“‘Evil prospers when good men do nothing’… ain’t that the truth,” Streep added, per EW. “We shouldn’t be surprised that fundamentalists, of all stripes, everywhere, are exercised and fuming. We shouldn’t be surprised that these profound changes come at a much steeper cost than it seems would lie true in the 20th century. We shouldn’t be surprised if not everyone is totally down with it. But if we live through this precarious moment … if his catastrophic instinct to retaliate doesn’t lead us to nuclear winter, we will have much to thank this president for because he will have woken us up to how fragile freedom really is.” Streep also took the opportunity to clear up controversial comments she made during her Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award speech, during which she said football and martial arts were “not the arts.” Streep says it was her failed attempt to crack a joke.“I do like football … I have watched more football in 60 years than anybody here,” she explained on Saturday. “But if you hear a woman in a restaurant say, ‘My son is very interested in the arts,’ she’s not talking about football or mixed martial arts because they’re just not the same thing.

She fell over the side of the escalator as she grabbed for a hat her twin sister had dropped, officials said.Jennifer Santos, 29, was declared dead at Bellevue Hospital, ABC6-TV reported. Her twin, Jessica, was treated for trauma but was otherwise uninjured, officials said.The accident occurred early Saturday morning as the sisters were traveling home to Kearny after a night on the town, according to the New York Post.It was the first death in the soaring white-marble Oculus building. It’s the centerpiece of a $3.9 billion transportation hub in the World Trade Center complex, which opened last year to replace the New Jersey PATH terminal that was destroyed in the 9/11 terror attacks.The hub, which includes a shopping mall with some 100 stores, stretches four blocks beneath three office towers and connects to several subway systems, as well as ferries. One person on the scene after the accident complained that the barriers along the escalator should be higher in the Oculus atrium.Port Authority officials were continuing to investigate the accident. The escalator was shut down for several hours Saturday. "
4,POLITICS,Trump’s '72%' Number From Banned Nations Misstates What’s Going On,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-banned-nations_us_58a0baa7e4b03df370d758e2,"The refugees from the seven nations had long been in the pipeline, and almost none entered in the week after he signed his order.",2017-02-12,President Donald Trump signs an executive order he said would impose tighter vetting to prevent foreign terrorists from entering the United States at the Pentagon on Jan. 27. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a0bbcf25000034080b87c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Ever since the judiciary blocked President Donald Trump’s travel ban, his favorite statistic has become that “72 percent” of refugees are now coming from the seven predominately Muslim nations the ban specifically names.It is also misleading to the point of being flat-out wrong.Trump on Sunday morning tweeted: “72% of refugees admitted into U.S. (2/3 -2/11) during COURT BREAKDOWN are from 7 countries: SYRIA, IRAQ, SOMALIA, IRAN, SUDAN, LIBYA & YEMEN.”On Saturday morning, he’d used an even higher figure: “Our legal system is broken! ‘77% of refugees allowed into U.S. since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries.’ (WT) SO DANGEROUS!”The reason such a high percentage of refugees came from the banned countries in the week following U.S. District Court Judge James Robart’s Feb. 3 ruling is because almost none had come during the week after Trump signed his executive order, before Robart blocked it.In that week, only 2 of the 843 refugees admitted came from the seven countries listed in Trump’s Jan. 27 order, according to State Department figures.In the week following the judge’s ruling, approximately 1,000 of the 1,450 refugees who entered came from the seven nations, which appears to be the basis of Trump’s 72 percent figure. This occurred because many refugees who would have arrived the previous week from those nations arrived that second week instead.Combined over that two-week period, about 1,000 of the nearly 2,300 refugees who came in were from the seven nations, or about 44 percent. Refugees from the seven countries made up 49 percent of the total number of refugees allowed into the country since Oct. 1 ― just slightly more than that two-week figure.“Taken together and averaged, refugee admissions from the seven countries over the past two weeks are consistent with previous admissions numbers this fiscal year,” a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Sunday defended Trump’s numbers. “What he said was accurate,” Spicer said.Trump’s argument also ignores the reason people become refugees in the first place. Of the seven nations on the list, six are wracked by warfare and violence. Only Iran is not. The United States has accepted zero refugees, for example, from Great Britain, New Zealand or Japan.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld Robart’s order last week. Trump’s White House has not yet made clear its intended path forward, offering a variety of sometimes contradictory possibilities from a number of different officials, including Trump himself. Those include writing a brand new executive order with the goal of avoiding the legal problems of the last one, arguing the existing case on its merits, and appealing the appellate court decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.Trump’s original executive order suspended all refugees for 120 days, blocked refugees from Syria indefinitely, and imposed a 90-day ban from entering the United States on most nationals of those seven countries."
5,POLITICS,"DNC Chair Candidates Want Party Divisions To Go Away, But It’s Not Happening",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dnc-race-party-divisions_us_589faf67e4b0ab2d2b15aefc,The race is haunted by the specter of the 2016 presidential primary.,2017-02-12,"Former Secretary of Labor Tom Perez (center) speaks to Jaime Harrison (L) and Jehmu Greene during a forum in Baltimore, Maryland, on Feb. 11, 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589fb0d1290000f616f25d03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BALTIMORE ― Despite the candidates’ best efforts, the race to chair the Democratic National Committee remains dogged by divisions between backers of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Hillary Clinton supporters ― progressive outsiders and more mainstream Democrats.The moment at Saturday’s DNC regional forum in Baltimore that most encapsulated that tension and the unwillingness of top DNC contenders to acknowledge it was when protesters interrupted the remarks of former Labor Secretary Tom Perez with shouts that were quickly quieted. Perez, who has strong progressive credentials, has been all but endorsed by former President Barack Obama and is viewed as an establishment favorite.Yvette Lewis, a voting DNC member from Maryland who is backing Perez, asked the 10 chair candidates on stage to present their “formula for getting us past” the intra-party tension that the outburst represented.But rather than share their proposals, Perez and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), his Sanders-backed rival to head the main party body, responded by downplaying Democrats’ divisions.“The way we move forward as a party is to remind ourselves what our values are. When we lead with our values, we win,” Perez said. Ellison sounded a similar note, insisting that “we are all friends up here.”“I want everybody supporting me to know I respect [Perez], I like him, he’s my friend,” he added.Discussions with the voting DNC members and activists in attendance, however, revealed that the divisions remain real. While not all of Ellison’s supporters backed Sanders in the presidential primary, those who did view his candidacy as a test of whether the party is willing to welcome them in and show respect for their priorities. Clinton’s devastating loss to President Donald Trump in the general election has affirmed their conviction that the party should be taking its cues from the more populist Sanders wing. Ben Jealous, a former NAACP president who backed Sanders, implied at a rally for Ellison in the early afternoon that rejecting Ellison would mean repeating the mistake party members made by failing to nominate Sanders. “All these good people in this room ― we know a good brother when we see him, we know a good leader when we see him. We tried to tell y’all before what a good leader looks like,” Jealous told the hundreds-strong audience, drawing loud applause.Many Sanders supporters believe the DNC favored Clinton’s candidacy during the primary. Their suspicion is based in part on leaked emails that intelligence agencies believe were hacked at Russia’s behest, which showed DNC officials musing about publicly attacking him. Although there is no evidence these officials acted on their discussions, the contents of some of the emails solidified an impression in Sanders’ camp that the DNC had denied the Vermont senator a fair shot at the nomination. Another source of tension was the DNC’s decision to start its presidential primary debates well after the Republicans began theirs, and to schedule some on Saturday nights when fewer people were likely to tune in.Ed Fischman and Wala Blegay, Maryland-based members of Our Revolution, an organization Sanders founded to promote the priorities of his campaign, said that if Ellison loses it would, at the very least, fail to bring into the party many independent progressives inspired by Sanders. Blegay suggested it could also alienate some people already active in the party.“There is a small group that I know of ... that are very frustrated with the Democratic campaign because of the Bernie stuff,” Blegay said, referring to the DNC’s alleged intervention in the presidential primary. “The loss of Keith Ellison might move those people from wanting to work within the party.”Clinton supporters, by contrast, mostly insisted that the chairmanship should not be used to settle scores from the primary.“I want someone who is going to unify our party from day one and I see some of last year’s primary playing out a little bit here, which is unfortunate. I think we need to get past that,” said David O’Brien, a voting DNC member from Massachusetts. O’Brien backed Clinton in the primary and remains uncommitted in the DNC chair race.With exactly two weeks to go in the contest, the number of contenders for the chairmanship has grown to 10. In addition to Perez and Ellison, candidates for the top spot include South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Idaho Democratic Party executive director Sally Boynton Brown; New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley; South Carolina Democratic Party chair Jaime Harrison; media strategist Jehmu Greene; Robert Vinson Brannum, Veterans Committee chair of the NACCP’s Washington D.C. branch; Milwaukee attorney Peter Peckarsky and Ohio activist Sam Ronan.The 447 voting DNC members will gather in Atlanta on Feb. 25 to elect the next chair, vice chairs and other top positions.Ellison and Perez remain the top contenders, but there is no clear front-runner. Buttigieg, an openly gay Afghanistan veteran, has also attracted attention for his mayoral record, unique life story and articulate speaking style.This story has been updated to reflect that Yvette Lewis has endorsed Perez, and to provide additional details about the some of the reasons for Sanders’ supporters’ skepticism of the DNC."

8,RELIGION,Pope Francis Targeted In Fake News Attack At The Vatican,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/francis-fake-news_us_589fa9a7e4b03df370d6dc13,The ersatz interview is the latest stratagem in conservatives’ battle with the progressive pontiff.,2017-02-12,"This fake front page mimics the official Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589fcd9c2800001f00998508.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even Pope Francis isn’t immune from fake news. He was mocked last week in a spoof interview printed on a fake front page that looked like it came from the Vatican’s official publication, L’Osservatore Romano.The ersatz news page was sent anonymously to several cardinals, bishops and monsignors as part of a strategy in the mounting opposition against the liberal pontiff by conservative Catholics, the Italian press reported. The front-page “interview” mocks the pope over his liberal stances and is marked with headline jokes like “cherchez la femme.”When he is asked in the article if divorced and remarried Catholics can still receive the sacrament of Communion — which has not been allowed in the past — fake Francis answers both yes and no. The piece is headlined “Ha risposto!” or “He answers!”The gibe is apparently a reference to a written challenge on the issue last year from four conservative cardinals, including American Raymond Burke, the National Catholic Reporter noted. The pope in that case let his paper on “The Joy of the Family” — Amoris Laetitia — stand without further explanation.Italian newspaper Il Messaggero first reported on the spoof Friday.The fake news incident followed the appearance of several posters plastered to walls in Rome earlier this month attacking the Pope’s recent positions against conservative Catholics.Catholic conservatives have been emboldened to take on Francis in part by the Trump administration and advisor Steve Bannon, the New Times reported last week. When Bannon, who is Catholic, led the ultraconservative website Breitbart, he cultivated relationships with conservative leaders of the church, including Cardinal Burke, according to the Times.Francis is known for his kinder, gentler Vatican administration, more welcoming to divorced and gay Catholics. He has also lashed out at inaction on climate change, and has been quick to criticize national policies he sees as harsh — including not-so-veiled criticisms of Donald Trump’s call for a wall on the border between Mexico and America.“I appeal not to create walls but to build bridges,” he said — again — last week during one of his weekly catechism lessons, though he was careful never to use Trump’s name. He added: “A Christian would never say, ‘You will pay for that.’ Never.”As for the fake front page, not everyone was upset by it. Some found it funny or made fun of it.According to The Associated Press, the real editor-in-chief of L’Osservatore Romano, Giovanni Maria Vian, shrugged off the spoof front page, quipping: “We were only sad because the layout wasn’t as nice as ours.”"

We are merely custodians of it during our lifetime.” — Jim Irsay, owner of the Indianapolis ColtsTwenty years ago, I asked a mutual friend a question that would change my life forever.“Football… what is it about football?” I wanted to know. “It bonds some men every Sunday for life — when they may have nothing else in common but watching the game.”“I have a friend who can answer that question for you. He’s a sports writer.”Don’t ask me how Hunter S. Thompson’s books managed to evade my radar until I met him in 1997 — to have my question answered while we watched a game on his TV.We bonded as football friends.Two years later he asked me to work as his research assistant, and I moved to Owl Farm in 2000. Shortly after that, he started writing a weekly column for ESPN. When he wrote a political column in the ‘80s, he weaved in sports. In the ESPN sports column, he weaved in politics. The botched election of 2000 – and the subsequent wars brought about by George W. Bush — inspired Hunter to write more in the last five years of his life than he had during the previous 15. And “we” was the prominent thread in his political sensibilities.As Trump’s “win” of the election shocked a nation, people began turning to Hunter’s work more than ever. And, oddly, the last game of the season felt like a repeat of November 8th. There will be no more elections or football games for a while. But off-season is only temporary, just as the Trump presidency is just temporary…and may even be shorter than four years.Hunter’s death in 2005 was tragic for all of us who loved him; serious darkness that came in waves and continues to this day. Trumps “win” meant another pang of Hunter’s absence. But one thing that brought comfort was the fact that he left 40-plus years of writing to be discovered by each new generation. And rediscovered when the rest of us need it most — like now.Recently I received a death rattle email and call from one of the trustees of the Trust that Hunter set up, announcing that money was still so tight that they intended to sell Owl Farm, despite Hunter’s written wishes for this to remain my home. They gave me 45 days to come up with money to save the Farm.With the greatest fear I’ve felt since Hunter’s death, and instead of heading to court, I reached out to the thing that has brought millions of people together. Not politics, but football. Hunter’s good friend Jim Irsay, owner of the NFL Indianapolis Colts franchise, loaned me the money to buy Owl Farm from the Trust and save it from being sold. This means I will be able to continue with my plans to make our home a private museum, and to preserve the land adjacent to the valley’s wilderness from development. The threat of losing my home was only temporary.Thanks to “we,” and thanks to football.Hunter’s suicide note to me (12 years ago), that somehow was published in Rolling Stone Magazine, was titled “Football Season is Over.” But I have a new attitude. Millions of us were not defeated but are instead empowered by Trump’s temporary coup of the presidency — and Hunter’s friend saved Owl Farm. Now I believe football season is NEVER over.So I do own Owl Farm. But I’m reminded that I am merely a custodian, during my lifetime, of this beautiful land.Hunter echoed in every bit of his work that WE is the most important word in politics. Millions of people came together and are watching and supporting the Democrats and also the observant Republicans who see that WE is working.So don’t be sad that there is no football this Sunday. It’s temporary… in reality, football season is never over."

Living at the intersection of being first-generation Haitian and Black, I have learned to bring my culture into my activism and organizing as a first act of choosing freedom and loving myself. This has not always been easy for me, with a family that has been stripped over generations of a lot of our cultural practices. But what the Haitian Revolution means to me and what it means for Black liberation is a long and powerful story of resilience.I was raised by my mother, an immigrant woman who moved to the United States from Haiti almost 12 years ago. She spent at least three months in a detention camp in Florida and only recently shared that part of her personal history with me. My mother grew up in Haiti during a time of serious political conflict and rivalries and in a time when joining a political party could get you killed, sometimes publicly. My mother learned to be protective at a young age and her early experiences impacted what she later shared with me. We never talked politics. She did not share openly with me about what liberation meant to her. I was not taught the history of Haiti when I was little, and no one explained to me the importance of the Haitian Revolution. Even though I was born in America and my mother never talked about politics with me, I was raised with a Haitian identity. I learned to speak, read and write Haitian Kreyol, we ate and cooked Haitian food and I grew up learning the values of being Haitian. My mother taught me nearly everything that I know about being Haitian. I think because I had this strong Haitian identity and at the same time my mother kept Haitian politics from me, I ended up growing thirsty to know more. Later I learned on my own about the rasin (roots) movement, the culture of Haitian Voodoo, and other aspects of African-based spiritual practices and values that Haitian people followed. What exploration of my Black-Haitian American heritage has taught me is that the fight for Black lives must include deepening our understanding of concrete historical examples when Black liberation was real and we won! We must remember Haiti; we must celebrate and hold Haiti up. Haiti was the first place in the western hemisphere where Black people successfully fought back and then became the first Black nation. The Haitian Revolution has a rich and layered history, but the key action of the Bwa Kayiman, a Voodoo ceremony, would also prove to be the spark of the Haitian Revolution in 1791. Enslaved Africans living on the island of Hispaniola, originating from all different parts of Africa and speaking many different languages, came together nonetheless to evoke the spirits of their ancestors and to fight against the French, eventually winning their independence from France in 1804.Although in a way my mother kept a lot from me, the blood of liberation was already boiling inside my body. And when I was ready, I chose the side of seeing and telling the truth. I chose to learn more about the role of the Haitian Revolution in my own life. And I am still choosing to find the bits and pieces I need to weave into my current organizing, through cultural sharing, by including Haitian folklore dancing and drumming in my work, through political education workshops and by story sharing with the Black youth who I organize with. The future is full of Black people, from all across the diaspora of Africa, living in all different parts of the country, with different religions and cultural practices. Just as we did in 1791, we can all commit to dreaming big today and every day, recreating Bwa Kayiman in places all around us, through jete-glo-pour libations, invoking our ancestors and inviting them to join us at our actions, strategy sessions, rallies, protests, outreach events and canvasses in this battle for liberation. The truth is that there is no Black future without honoring the Haitian Revolution, too. We will learn again how to embrace the traditions of our African ancestors and truly acknowledge and uplift the values the Haitian Revolution: self-determination and Black-love. We will hold strong to these values. After all, our ancestors were fearless, they’ve been here before and they are with us now, and we have got to lean on them to have our backs, our fronts and our sides.

11,POLITICS,Grab Them By The… Hand: Donald Trump’s Disturbing Nonverbal Behavior,"Seth Davin Norrholm, PhD, ContributorTranslational Neuroscientist/Psychologist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grab-them-by-thehand-donald-trumps-disturbing-nonverbal_us_589fa54ae4b0cd37efcfe970,President Trump has shown his malignant narcissism to the world in the time leading up to his ascension to the Oval Office,2017-02-12,<p>The 19-second handshake between Japanese PM Abe and current U.S. President Trump</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589fa56328000029009984d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Trump has shown his malignant narcissism to the world in the time leading up to his ascension to the Oval Office and during the first three weeks of his term. His (mis?) communication with words, whether in front of a microphone or on Twitter, has been well documented.But his non-verbal behavior speaks volumes… specifically his strange, often violent, style of shaking hands. Remember, the narcissist views the world as a personal playing field in which he controls the players and the gameplan.People are treated as a means to an end and their value is determined by the benefits he or she may bring the egocentric narcissist. Trump’s handshaking technique strongly supports that this is the President’s approach with others – no matter their station in (real) life.In the past several months, we have seen Mr. Trump execute a “grab and yank” handshake designed to literally and figuratively knock the recipient off balance. In addition, it is a thinly veiled, manipulative method of informing his “opponent” that he is in control. When he shook hands with Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, for example, Mr. Trump pulled the judge three times (almost knocking him over) and repeatedly slapped the top of the judge’s hand; a combination of moves that has been suggested to be a power play in some situations.In a recent article on Yahoo.com, Trump is documented to have “grabbed and yanked” Vice President Pence, FBI Director Comey (a man who towers over Trump), Secretary of State Tillerson, and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The extensive video library available on Mr. Trump shows this as far back as his early days as host of “The Apprentice.”One can’t help but wonder what a handshake between Trump and Putin might look like?Most recently, Donald Trump shared a 19-second handshake with Japanese Prime Minister Abe in another illustration of the narcissistic power grab, but what was intriguing about this particular shake was the behavior of both men during the nearly 20-second clasp. The two appeared to be playing an awkward game of tug-of-war and Trump again pulls off three yanks and slaps the top of PM Abe’s hand several times.It does not take a very deep analysis of this behavior to see that the president (who admires dictators) believes that he can forcefully grab what he wants: power, money, women, individual rights, or authoritarian rule.My point is this, much like the president’s use of capital letters and exclamation points in his tweets and his reliance on “alternative facts,” the “grab and yank” is nothing more than a bully move. More often than not, there is nothing to back it up.Prime Minister Abe knew this and showed it when he turned and rolled his eyes after extracting himself with a forced smile. Paul Ryan and many in the GOP have also turned and rolled their eyes with forced grins during the first 22 days of the Trump presidency.I hope we can follow the lead of the marchers and the 9th Circuit Court and continue to resist in the face of these jarring power grabs."
12,POLITICS,The Dangers of a New World Order,"William Witenberg , ContributorContemporary Artist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-dangers-of-a-new-world-order_us_58a0a3cfe4b0e172783a9dc2,"It is difficult to not be concerned with the new world order that is being shaped by Brexit, “Make America Great Again”, and",2017-02-12,"<p>A journalist holds a poster with portraits Vladimir Putin, Marine Le Pen and <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"">Donald Trump</a>, prior to Putin's annual news conference in Moscow. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a0a50e28000029009985ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is difficult to not be concerned with the new world order that is being shaped by Brexit, “Make America Great Again”, and in general the rise of populism, whether in the United States, France, Italy or the Philippines. It is not an exaggeration to say that President Trump, Marie Le Penn, and Theresa May’s political views are trying to shape a new world order. The history books are filled with events that unexpectedly result in catastrophic loss of human life. These catastrophic events might in retrospect look inevitable, but at the time of the triggering events, few saw their mass destructive consequences. I worry that we may be at one of those moments in the world. When Arch Duke Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo few could have imagined that 20 million people would die as a direct result of the assassination. It is unlikely that when World War I ended that many could have guessed World War II was around the corner. Few even speculated when Hitler was elected that mass genocide would occur and a world war would draw in Japan.The goal of the European Union is stated to be to establish “common economic, foreign, security, and justice polices.” When Britain withdrew from the European Union the message was that the future of Britain was better as an independent country than as part of a United Europe. As elements among French, Italian and Spanish politicians now follow the same line of logic and suggest it would be better to leave the European Union, the worry is that these politicians are setting up a situation in which European nations are no longer working as equals who share common standards, but instead as self centered nations whose interactions could result in confrontation instead of cooperation. While no one can predict a break up of the EU, but it might be that the breaking up of the EU will add to an increase world tensions with unintended serious consequences.When President Trump uses the term “ America First” he is using language that existed right before America went into World War II. The America First movement pre-world war II clearly was an isolationist and anti-Semitic movement that literally suggested appeasing Hitler. While President Trump is not anti-Semitic his critics are amazed at the language he uses in discussing Putin. Where does this lead? Again no one knows but in the context of using “America First” there is the historical echo of the appeasement of Hitler.When President Trump surprisingly spoke with the leader of Taiwan, he indicated that he was skeptical of the One China policy that has so long been part of America and Mainland China relations. He has now reversed himself and said he favors the traditional One China policy. China is gloating at Trump’s reversal and is calling America a paper tiger. In the same way America First has past negative echoes so does Paper Tiger. The term Paper Tiger was used by Mao to negatively describe its enemy the United States. Within 24 hours of America being labeled as a Paper Tiger and as President Trump is meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan; North Korea launches a missile test that violates the United Nations Charter. Will China help the United States curtail North Korea or will there be a confrontation ? I do not know the answer but America and China are at odds in the South Sea ;and what is China’s incentive to help the United States and its Asian Allies? There is no doubt the North Korean leader could incite a catastrophic event.The problems in the middle east and Syria in particular could lead to unpredictable ,even greater catastrophic loss of human life ,than it has so far. In October, the former Soviet leader Gorbachev warned that the world was at a “dangerous place” because of Syria and there have been calls for war crimes trials as a result of the mass murder in Aleppo. Iran is clearly on a war footing.With all these events happening I feel as if a red flag is being raised. The world appears to be on a course that could end with catastrophic consequences. Of course it doesn’t have to happen but history shows that catastrophic events often look inevitable in the rear view mirror but in the present they seem not as tragic. Only time will tell."

One of my first predictions was in high school: I declared that my entire class would pass the mathematics exam, and, sure enough, we did. Of course, this was only after I used nearly all of my free time to make sure my classmates understood the calculations and formulas.I learned that you can predict the future if you do the hard work.I also learned that I really love numbers; I love how definite they are, how one plus one is always two and how two plus two adds up to four. I think I may have inherited this love of numbers from my father. He was an accountant and some of my first memories are of sitting on his lap, watching as he studied for his Chartered accountancy exams.I planned to study numbers in university and I was excited when I heard about the subject of actuarial science. It is a mathematical discipline that uses units — like probability, calculus and statistics — to assess and calculate risk. Insurance companies use it to calculate premiums, other types of companies use it to forecast trends and government agencies utilize it as they plan their budgets. In short, it is the perfect subject for me for combining my passion for numbers with an opportunity to predict the future.I looked forward to one day earning a living doing what I loved and being among the first Africans in the field and breaking barriers by being pioneering as a young African woman this field. Armed with clarity about my future, I asserted myself in my final year of high school with both eyes focused on the road ahead.Then one evening something happened that I hadn’t predicted; my teeth started gnashing. It was difficult for me to eat my dinner. The school nurse couldn’t figure out what was happening and advised me to rest. After a nap in the nurse’s room, the gnashing stopped and she suggested I rest in the dorms instead of attending night reading class. But I thought I knew best and I figured I could rest when I’d finished high school in a few months’ time.So I went to class. I was reading about Kenyan history when my left hand started jerking, which attracted the attention of the whole class. The movements became aggressive and fast. I tried my best to hold it still with my right hand but the force was out of my control. I started crying because I didn’t know what to do and my classmates, who didn’t know how to help, just stared and whispered. I had my first full-blown seizure, marking the beginning of fourteen years of falling down in convulsions every week.I cannot recall what happened next, but when I finally came around, people say I was frozen like a statue — my whole body was stiff and my leg locked on the chair seat. The nurse and teacher-on-duty had to carry me on the chair to the school van. I was taken to a nearby clinic before being transferred to a hospital. Eventually doctors told me it was epilepsy; a neurological disorder characterized by seizures. Its causes include stress, trauma to the head, complications at birth, brain tumors, stroke or illnesses like meningitis and TB.By the time the doctors decided I could leave my bed, I had missed most of my final term. My parents suggested I skip exams and repeat my final year. I wouldn’t have any of it.Back at school, I was constantly tired from the medication I’d been prescribed and everyone around me walked on eggshells, scared I might fall on them. Those who once came to me for mathematics sessions opted to struggle on their own rather than seek my help. The surety and confidence I had predicted about my future was slowly being replaced by fear and uncertainty.Despite having seizures before and during some of the exam papers, my grades were good enough to secure me a spot at University. In September, I attended the University of Nairobi to pursue my dream. I could already see myself in a corner office punching numbers and predicting the future.My doctor gave me strict instructions on how to take care of myself and reduce the seizures. All l had to do was make sure I took my medication, got enough sleep and ate well. But as the days went by and the university workload increased, these coping mechanisms proved ineffective and, reluctantly, I had to drop out in my second year. Those around me did not have sufficient information and skills to support me and I found myself in a space where I was scared, with my dreams shattered.After a few months, fate intervened. A family friend introduced me to a man who ran an insurance company. He knew about my epilepsy, but he agreed to give me a job. I had to start from the bottom, but I did not mind. With hard work, I believed eventually I could achieve my dream job.I spent the weekend before I started my new job ironing my suit. It was mismatched, the prints and patterns were all over the place but it was a suit nevertheless. As I made sure each pleat was in line, I couldn’t wait to seize this new opportunity and show myself worthy of it.On Monday morning, I reported to the office and soaked in the blue decor as the director’s assistant, who was almost my age, took me through the ropes. We immediately clicked and soon we began a routine of meeting early at the office to exchange notes and color each other’s dreams to make them look like a reality.It didn’t take me long to learn the corporate way of life, the company’s system and my place in it. I was able to work with clients, first under supervision then directly, fueling my drive to make it as one of the first female actuaries in Africa. I soon saw a chance to shine when the company acquired a major client and had to meet a big contract deadline. Everyone in the office was expected to chip in with the preparation process and to work over the weekend. We spent Friday afternoon learning how to use a new fancy photocopier to prepare for the grand meeting on Monday.Having worked with clients directly, I was prepared to play a big role in this contract, but instead I received the “honorable” duty of making all the photocopies and preparing the paperwork. But I did not complain. Instead I reported to the office on Saturday and took my position. I loaded the copier as we’d been instructed and I placed the first paper on it and pressed start. I cannot remember exactly what happened next — I came round to find myself in the hospital after having had an epilepsy seizure.The doctor informed me that I had photosensitive epilepsy, a type of epilepsy unknown to me. He explained that people with this condition can have seizures triggered by direct contact with flashing lights sources such as from cameras, some TV or video content or, like me, the repeated flash from the photocopier. So in addition to taking my medication, getting enough sleep and maintaining a healthy diet, I also must never smile at a flashing camera or use a photocopy machine as either could flash me into unconsciousness.The doctor discharged me and at home, I looked forward to Monday morning. I planned to arrive early at the office and redeem myself by getting the paperwork in order before the meeting. As I walked in at 7 a.m., the receptionist told me that the director had given me two weeks to rest. Naively, I was pleased by this news, not because I did not like my job, but because I thought the director understood how hard it gets at times when you have epilepsy. It was a relief to feel supported after having dropped out of school because of lack of a supportive community.During my time off I rested and caught up with friends, but I couldn’t wait to go back to work. After 14 days, I arrived to work early with an eagerness to catch up and prove that I could produce results despite my health status, but the receptionist informed me that the director had added two more weeks to my leave. This time I did not feel so supported. In my head, this two plus two more weeks was definitely not adding up to four. In the evening, I called my friend, the director’s assistant, and asked her if she had heard anything.After a moment of silence, she reluctantly replied that the director had said they could not work with “someone like me,” meaning someone with a health condition like mine. She added that the director did not yet know how to let me go. After we hung up, I cried and cried my all.Epilepsy is not widely understood in Kenya. A lot people attribute it to witchcraft or punishment from God and those with the diagnosis are discriminated against and excluded from participating in activities as most people think it is contagious. Statistics indicate the prevalence of epilepsy is 18.6 per 100,000.I planned to defy expectations. I told myself that I would never again want to be in a position where people did not take the time to see the person beyond the illness.I wrote down my feelings, raw as they were, first in my journal and later started publishing them online. Soon, I was sharing good, bad and ugly days almost every week and people were finding my words and reading them. It was therapeutic to share my work and get feedback over email as a lot of people shy away from responding on the comments section mostly due to stigma.After four years, an incredible thing happened. Google Africa approached me with funding for my blog because I was speaking about issues people in Africa consider taboo. In 2014, I used that funding to set up and run Kenya’s first, free mental health and epilepsy support line. To date, it’s helped 11,000 Kenyans by linking them up with mental health service providers like counsellors and psychiatrists who see them pro bono or at a subsidized fee, attaching them to support groups, providing basic mental health and epilepsy information like first aid and sign and symptoms to look out for.Although I was no longer directly punching numbers, the number of people who reached out through the support line gave me a new lease on life and clarity on what my next step would be; an advocate for those who, because of their health status, go through some of the same things I had been through; like dropping out of school and facing workplace discrimination.I took pride in the fact that despite being placed in an “unemployable” group because of my health status, I defied the odds and was able to create a job for myself as well as employ five people to staff the hotline.Now I know I can still predict the future. Not with numbers but with words and through experiences. I predict an Africa where people like me, living with epilepsy, will have access to proper information about the causes of their condition, which symptoms to look out for and where to go to receive appropriate medical support and how to reduce the number of seizures.I predict an Africa where people who meet people with epilepsy will replace ignorance, fear and discrimination with correct information. They will be knowledgeable about how to give basic first aid; they’ll learn that this condition is not contagious — we can touch you, we can eat with you, we can work with you. They’ll know that a seizure and recovery period may last for 20 minutes but then the person with epilepsy will be back and ready to continue to play their part in the development of this great continent.I predict an Africa that isn’t divided up into people like you and people like me but just people looking out for each other, sharing knowledge about conditions like epilepsy and working together for the good of the continent.I’m willing to do the hard work to make these predictions come true by constantly sharing my journey and using the lessons I have picked along the way to help those coming behind me and make a contribution having a conducive society with systems and structures for people living with epilepsy. Will you join me?"

Chris Christie said Flynn still owes the president an explanation for conflicting reports.,2017-02-12,"Chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, left, sits with White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn before a news conference at the White House on Jan. 27.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a07e672900002200f25d87.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) and White House policy director Stephen Miller both sought to insulate the White House on Sunday from revelations that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russian ambassador late last year. Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Christie said Flynn owes President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence a “candid conversation” to “make sure that everybody gets the accurate story on this matter and that it’s cleared up.”“I think that’s the obligation of Gen. Flynn as National Security Adviser to have a candid conversation with the president and vice president, and they will act as they see fit given all the circumstances,” Christie said.Christie, a longtime friend and confidant of the president, is the first Trump surrogate to publicly suggest that Flynn still hasn’t given the White House a satisfactory explanation for why multiple news outlets reported that Flynn discussed the sanctions.  “Gen. Flynn has said up to this point that he had not said anything like that to the Russian ambassador,” Christie told host Jake Tapper. “I think now he’s saying that he doesn’t remember whether he did or not.”“So that’s a conversation he’ll need to have with the president and vice president, so the White House can make sure they are completely accurate about what’s going on,” he added. “I’ve always been a person that believes you have one president at a time and that’s the way things should be done.”Miller was also asked about Flynn on Sunday, but referred all questions to Pence or to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. “I understand it’s an important matter; I understand it’s a sensitive matter, and I’m sure you’ll have an opportunity in the near future to interview someone from the vice president’s office or interview the chief of staff, who can elucidate further on this very sensitive issue,” Miller said. Miller appeared on four different news shows Sunday. The fact that he did not have a prepared answer from the White House for the inevitable questions about Flynn only underscored the precariousness of Flynn’s position within the Trump administration.The FBI is currently investigating the conversations between Flynn and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which coincided with the Obama administration’s announcement of new sanctions in retaliation for Russia’s cyber campaign to influence the U.S. presidential election in Trump’s favor. Flynn has long claimed that the sanctions did not come up.  "

Clinton campaign general counsel Marc Elias and CrowdStrike president Shawn Henry, whose firm investigated the DNC hacks, were also on the panel. “They didn’t even bother to send an agent to the DNC,” Podesta said. “They left a couple of messages at the IT help desk saying, ‘You might want to be careful.’”“There are at least forces within the FBI that wanted her to lose,” he added.Some FBI employees were reportedly incensed when Director James Comey decided not to recommend an indictment over the former secretary of state’s private email server. A current agent told The Guardian in November that the agency was “Trumpland.”The FBI didn’t notify the DNC in person about the hack until months after it had occurred, according to a deeply reported story from The New York Times last year. Agents contacted a low-level staffer at the DNC’s IT desk who initially believed the phone call was a prank, according to the Times.Hackers gained access to Podesta’s email account via a phishing scheme that was precipitated due to an aide’s unfortunate typo, the Times reports. The aide had meant to warn Podesta about the “illegitimate email” but instead wrote “legitimate email.”Podesta disputed the notion that he fell victim to a phishing scheme in an interview with TechCrunch following the panel, however.“Woulda, coulda, shoulda,” he said. “I don’t think it was an issue of what the strength of my password was. Although I now have stronger passwords.”Podesta also said the American public deserved to know more about Russia’s meddling in the election, and its motivation for doing so.“It wasn’t just that they didn’t like Hillary Clinton’s pantsuit, it was that Putin had a vendetta about her and her tenure as secretary of state,” he told TechCrunch. “But mostly it was about Trump having adopted positions that were extraordinarily friendly to Putin and strongly at odds with a bipartisan collection of national security officials and people overseas.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589fb6a4280000c63a9984f2.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump is not shy about his scathing hate for NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” or the golden-wigged Alec Baldwin. And one veterans advocacy group is using that famous feud to send POTUS a very serious message.VoteVets, a political action committee that claims the backing of more than 500,000 veterans, troops and supporters, announced Friday that it will be airing an ad during this weekend’s “SNL” telling Trump to act like a “legitimate president.”The 30-second spot features a veteran, who lost his leg during the Afghanistan War, doing weighted squats as his voiceover addresses the commander in chief.President Trump, I hear you watch the morning shows. Here’s what I do every morning. Look, you lost the popular vote, you’re having trouble drawing a crowd, and your approval rating keeps sinking.Watch the full ad below:The commercial first aired during MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” another show that, like “SNL,” Trump obsesses over.Peter Kauffmann, a Navy veteran and vice chair of VoteVets, said in a Monday press release that the organization chose to air the message on TV because “the White House comment line is down and Donald Trump hasn’t set up that veterans hotline he promised.” The point of the ad, the release explains, was “to get in front of [Trump’s] face.”If VoteVets wanted to get Trump’s attention, “SNL” might be its best bet. POTUS has tweeted about the variety show three times in the past three months, mostly recently whining over Baldwin’s pursed-lip impression of him. Even if Trump doesn’t watch Saturday’s episode, rest assured that a lot of America will be watching. The viewership of “SNL” is now up 22 percent, compared to this time last season, and the show is seeing its highest ratings in more than 20 years, according to NBC.So when the rest of the country tunes in on Saturday night, one question remains: Will Trump?"
19,POLITICS,Trump Adviser Stephen Miller Disastrously Tries To Defend Trump,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-miller-donald-trump-adviser_us_58a0a067e4b0ab2d2b16119c,"Yet he also said, ""It’s not for me to speak what’s in the president’s mind.""",2017-02-12,White House senior adviser Stephen Miller made the rounds on Sunday's political shows.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a0a1882900002200f25dbb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s senior policy adviser, made the rounds on Sunday’s political talk shows to defend the administration’s stance on several major issues. It did not go well.On ABC’s “This Week,” he vigorously defended ― but provided no evidence to support ― Trump’s lie that “millions” of people had voted illegally.“I’m prepared to go on any show, anywhere, any time and repeat it and say the president of the United States is correct, 100 percent,” he said.After pressing Miller several times to no avail, host George Stephanopoulos ended the segment.“You have provided zero evidence of the president’s claim that he would have won the popular vote if 3 to 5 million illegal immigrants hadn’t voted, zero evidence for either one of those claims,” Stephanopoulos said. “Thanks a lot for joining us this morning.”And like the president, Miller undermined the legitimacy of the judicial branch. He slammed the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals for ruling unanimously on Thursday to reject the Trump administration’s appeal on its executive order banning refugees and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries.Miller, who was influential in drafting the ban, told CBS News’ John Dickerson that it was “crazy” for judges to rule on the constitutionality of laws. He also reiterated criticism of Judge James Robart, the Seattle-based federal judge who halted the ban earlier this month.“One unelected judge in Seattle cannot make laws for the entire country,” he said. “I mean, this is just crazy, John. The idea that you’re going to have a judge in Seattle say that a foreign national living in Libya has an effective right to enter the United States is beyond anything we’ve ever seen before.”On “Fox News Sunday,” Miller accused the three judges on the 9th Circuit Court of “having a long history of overreaching” and characterized their decision as “a judicial usurpation of the power.” Several courts have ruled against the Trump administration over the ban.Miller also tried to do damage control regarding revelations that national security adviser Mike Flynn reportedly communicated with and may have met the Russian ambassador in December to discuss sanctions.Yet Miller claimed that, on this issue, the White House “did not give me anything to say,” and said that he could not speak for Trump ― even though he had represented Trump on a variety of other issues throughout the morning.“It’s not for me to speak what’s in the president’s mind,” he told NBC’s Chuck Todd.Trump seemed to indicate otherwise while praising Miller.This article has been clarified to note conflicting reports on the extent to which Flynn communicated with the Russian ambassador.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

As we wait to see how that debate plays out in the weeks and months ahead, there is a sense among some that we may be closing the proverbial barn door after the horse has run.Some argue that there are people already in the US, whose words and deeds on behalf of foreign powers critically threaten America and its allies. Iran is one of the countries named in the President's Executive Action. It goes without saying that the Islamic Republic of Iran remains the number one state sponsor of terrorism according to the State Department.However, more fundamentally, some think that the focus should also be on the threat coming from a well-knit group and gilded circle of the Islamic Republic of Iran's operatives or lobbyists, who are determined to satisfy their paymaster by cajoling, prodding and persuading US policy-makers into believing that appeasement, lifting of sanctions on IRGC, and a soft touch is the only way to contain the top state sponsor of terrorism. But appeasement policies have not worked, any reasonable observer will interject. As Michael Flynn wrote ""Every day we see evidence of Iranian espionage in the United States..."". Some believe that some of Iran's lobbyists and operatives work or lobby illegally without registration in plain sights while other act less conspicuously in every critical sector of the American society.Some believe that they can ill-afford to allow their presence among them, and in particular their access to our politicians and officials. And finally, they believe that Iranian agents pose a real and present danger and they should be dealt with swiftly and decisively._____________________For more details and nuances, you can read full version on Here.You can sign up for Dr. Rafizadeh's newsletter for the latest news and analyses on Here.

The first holdalls were discovered on Thursday afternoon and more were found nearby on Friday.In all, around 360 kg of cocaine has been washed ashore in what the NCA called “a major blow to the organized criminals involved.”“We are now ... trying to establish how the bags ended up where they did,” said Matthew Rivers, from the NCA’s border investigation team. “It is extremely unlikely that this was their intended destination.”Police Superintendent Dave Buckley said he believed all the packages had now been recovered but appealed for anyone finding more to contact police immediately.“We will have extra officers in the area to monitor the situation,” he cautioned.(Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison)"

Mark Pody (R-Lebanon) and in the state’s Senate via Sen. Mae Beavers (R-Mt. Juliet) on Wednesday. If passed, the legislation would “defend natural marriage between one man and one woman regardless of any court decision to the contrary.”Beavers and Pody introduced a similar bill last year that included a fiscal note that pointed out the state could forfeit up to $8.5 billion dollars if passed due to loss of federal funding. A House panel subsequently squashed that bill.Pody has not yet commented on the bill. But in 2015 he said, “I believe I’m supposed to be speaking to the unsaved, to the people that are performing same-sex marriages, to the people involved in same-sex marriage, it is wicked, it is wrong and I am doing the best I can to warn them.”Another Tennessee bill that Pody and Beavers also introduced this week aims to limit the rights of transgender students in the state. Similar to North Carolina’s infamous HB 2 bill, the as yet untitled legislation instructs public schools to “require that a student use student restroom and locker room facilities that are assigned for use by persons of the same sex as the sex indicated on the student’s original birth certificate.”A version of the measure that Sen. Susan Lynn introduced last year was “ultimately shelved by the lawmaker amid intense controversy,” The Tennessean notes.“Obviously the personal impact on trans students is devastating,” Chris Sanders, executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project, told the newspaper in response to the bill. “What it will result in is them going to the wrong restroom or going to a special restroom that will out them as trans and stigmatize them or put a target on them for bullying.”Public outcry is already mounting against the bills. In December, Tennessee Thrives, a coalition of roughly 200 businesses in the state, formed to act as a watchdog to combat this kind discriminatory legislation. Pody and Beavers will reportedly hold a press conference next week to address the introduction of their legislation.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Richmond, who recently relocated to Monterey, California from his native Ohio, created the series in 2013 with the idea of putting a gay male twist on mid-20th century pin-up art. Now, fans of Richmond’s cheeky work will be able to make those illustrations their own with a “Cheesecake Boys” adult coloring book that’s due out on Valentine’s Day. (Watch the artist speak about the new project in the video above.) “Classic pinup art wasn’t made to be hung in prestigious museums, even though the artists were exceptional,” Richmond said. “Instead, it was printed on calendars and posters, destined to be tacked to the walls of bedrooms, lockers and garages... A pinup painting was successful if it elicited a chuckle or teased the naughty side of the viewer’s imagination.” Would-be artists who’ve gotten their hands on the new book already seem to be taken with the chance to add their own colors to Richmond’s work. “It’s such a thrill to see how people around the world are building upon the simple lines to create imaginative, colorful, and totally unique pieces of art,” he said. “And they’re having a blast doing it ― because who wouldn’t enjoy coloring adorable hunks losing their clothes all over the place?”We won’t argue with that!

At some of those clinics, the counter-demonstrators outnumbered those demanding an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood.All told, rallies and marches were called in 45 states in cities large and small, from Washington and Philadelphia to St. Paul, Minnesota, and Orange, CaliforniaAs many as 6,000 people turned up for competing demonstrations in St. Paul, Minnesota, police said, but at other places, only a few dozen demonstrators turned out.“We expected that tens of thousands of pro-lifers will be out today sending a message that we want Planned Parenthood to be defunded,” Monica Miller, director of Citizens for a Pro-Life Society and one of the national organizers of the anti-abortion rallies, said in a telephone interview.“As long as they are going stay in the abortion business, that is an organization that shouldn’t be getting one red cent of federal tax money,” Miller said.The 100-year-old organization of about 650 health centers provides birth control and other women’s health services in addition to abortion, according to its website.The U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in the 1973 Roe v.

Anti-abortion activists say funding for other purposes acts to subsidize abortions.In some cities, the two sides in the long-simmering issue positioned themselves along the same street. Initial reports indicate the rallies were vocal and peaceful.In the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, anti-abortion and abortion-rights groups took opposite sides of a four-lane highway, waving signs at traffic and shouting slogans.“Trump is going to hear our trumpet call,” said anti-abortion activist Sandy Prescott, 61, a homemaker from Roswell, Georgia, who was part of a group of about 100 people demanding an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood.At the competing abortion-rights demonstration, about 50 people gathered and held signs that included: “Women’s rights are human rights.” Many wore the pink “pussy hats” that have became an anti-Trump symbol since the Republican’s inauguration on Jan. 20.David Daleiden, an anti-abortion activist who in 2015 targeted Planned Parenthood with surreptitiously filmed videos to try and show it was profiting from the sale of aborted fetal tissue, addressed a rally of nearly 500 people in rain-soaked Orange, a Los Angeles suburb.“I’m confident that together, if we keep the faith, take the next right step, at the end of the day we will soon see a day when there will no longer be a price tag put on human life,” said Daleiden, founder of the Center of Medical Progress.Daleiden and fellow activist Sandra Merritt were indicted in January 2016 for using illegal government identifications to secretly film a Planned Parenthood facility in Texas, but the charges were later dropped. A grand jury cleared Planned Parenthood of wrongdoing.ALLIES IN WASHINGTONAnti-abortion activists have said they are energized by the election of Trump, who has promised to restrict abortions. He selected their long-time ally, Mike Pence, and nominated conservative jurist Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court.Two weeks ago, tens of thousands converged on Washington for the 44th March for Life, where Pence became the most senior government official to speak in person at the annual anti-abortion rally, organizers said.“We finally have someone in the White House who has the power and authority to save and defend lives,” said Margie Sznajder, one of 300 anti-abortion protesters at a rally in her hometown of Aurora, Illinois, outside Chicago.Planned Parenthood leaders say abortions rights supporters also have been energized by Trump’s election, as exemplified by the hundreds of thousands who flooded Washington a day after Trump’s inauguration in favor of women’s rights, including abortion rights.The pro-Planned Parenthood events on Saturday were organized spontaneously, without the group’s initiative, a spokeswoman said.“Saturday, and every day, Planned Parenthood advocates and activists show that they refuse to be intimidated and they won’t back down,” Kelley Robinson, a leader of Planned Parenthood Action Fund Support, said in a statement.Planned Parenthood receives federal funds from Medicaid reimbursements and Title X, a federal program that supports family planning and preventive health services. Planned Parenthood says cutting off those funds would make it more difficult for women to get birth control, Pap smears or testing for sexually transmitted diseases.At some points in Washington, Planned Parenthood supporters formed lines to block about 50 people marching from the Supreme Court to a Planned Parenthood clinic but police officers moved them aside.“Abortion, to me, is the greatest evil of our time,” said Delia Tyagi, 36, an accountant who lives in Arlington, Virginia. “Planned Parenthood has wronged women in a lot of ways.

27,POLITICS,Self-Described 'So-Called Judge' Rips Orange County Sheriff Who Trump Called 'Legendary',Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/orange-county-jailhouse-informant-program-judge_us_589e2f6be4b094a129eb1e17,"A jailhouse informant program exists in Orange County -- the ""debate is over,"" Judge Thomas Goethals said.",2017-02-11,Internal OCSD memo released by Judge Thomas Goethals.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589e5ef02800001f00998364.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES ― An appalled Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals on Friday strongly rebuked Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens for continuing to deny that she and her deputies were involved in running the county’s now notorious jailhouse informant program, despite mountains of evidence to the contrary.Thousands of pages of internal memos, documents and a newly discovered policy manual clearly describe the existence of an informant program inside county jails, but Hutchens and her deputies still maintain that it doesn’t exist.Goethals also announced that he will open new evidentiary hearings in the case against Scott Dekraai, who pleaded guilty to killing his ex-wife and seven other people at a Seal Beach hair salon in 2011. Dekraai awaits the start of the penalty phase of his trial, but the case has been derailed for years as the scope, secrecy and alleged malfeasance by county law enforcement and prosecutors in the informant program has become a centerpiece of the Dekraai case and unraveled numerous others.From the bench on Friday, Goethals read a series of newly unsealed official memos from the sheriff’s department ― stretching back to 2003 ― wherein OCSD deputies describe sophisticated “missions” and “plans” inside the jail to gather evidence against other inmates.In memos printed on OCSD stationery and sent to top command staff at the sheriff’s department, deputies explain how informants should be placed next to other inmates, their conversations will be recorded and sheriff’s deputies in a branch called “special handling” will help local police departments use the informant program to build cases against other inmates. After reading each memo, Goethals recited remarks Hutchens made in an interview with ABC7 denying the existence of a jail informant program.“The deputies in the jail are not conducting investigations ... we don’t have our folks working informants,” Goethals said, quoting Hutchens repeatedly after each memo that seemed to refute her claim. Goethals also referenced the decision a California appeals court made last year that affirmed the removal of the county’s entire district attorney’s office from the Dekraai case due to misconduct involving the informant program.The court found that the evidence “demonstrates that the OCSD ... created and maintained a [confidential informant] program” that violated the rights of defendants.“The train has left the station on this, folks,” Goethals said Friday. “The debate is over.” The memos aren’t the only evidence a jailhouse program exists. In a blistering motion filed this week, Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders, Dekraai’s attorney, independently obtained a previously unknown official OCSD internal document on using informants.While the OCSD does not admit to having a “Custodial Informant Program, Jail Informant Program, or a Jailhouse Informant Program,” it does appear to operate what it calls a “Custody Informant Program,” Sanders writes. The undated six-page handbook, also obtained by The Huffington Post, provides bullet points about developing informants, record keeping, past practices and guidance on updated policies around the use of informants. Moreover, Goethals made public 242 pages of notes last year, known as the “special handling log,” revealing the inner workings of the county’s informant program that appear to contradict testimony given by multiple deputies who had previously denied knowledge of working with informants. The pages represent just a fraction of the total 1,157-page database, still largely under seal, which was in use between 2008 and 2013 and maintained by sheriff’s special handling deputies. In June 2016, after years of its own denials, the D.A.’s office unequivocally acknowledged that a jail informant program does exist and that sheriff’s deputies actively “recruited and utilized” informants and rewarded them for information. After revisiting the facts of the case, an incredulous Goethals made an impassioned statement from the bench about the importance of due process, protection of rights, and judges’ duty to uphold the law. He referred to himself ironically as a “so-called judge,” a not-so-subtle reference to President Donald Trump’s dismissive remarks about a federal judge who issued a nationwide temporary injunction last week against the president’s executive order on immigration and refugee resettlement.“It strikes me that our free republic depends on a system of justice grounded in the rule of law,” Goethals said. “So-called judges like me are required to uphold the rule of law. I care about due process. Some might describe this as a ‘discovery dispute,’ but that demeans it. This is about due process.”The reference to Trump was likely also a nod to Hutchens, who Trump praised earlier in the week during a sheriff’s conference in Washington, calling her “legendary” and thanking her for her “leadership and ... service.”Goethals concluded with a call for new evidentiary hearings in the case, in part due to the appearance of intentional manipulation and/or destruction of many entries in the special handling log and allegations that the sheriff has still not turned over all documents related to the informant program.The call for new hearings arrives amid a wave of new allegations Sanders surfaced in recent weeks.According to recent court documents from the last several weeks, Sanders says he received a previously undisclosed document from an unnamed source that appears to be the current retention policies for the OCSD that were authorized in 2014. Called “Orange County Sheriff’s Department Retention and Disposition Schedules,” and also obtained by The Huffington Post, the document shows the department’s policy allows for the destruction of informant and special handling-related records after just three years. Sanders argues the OCSD secretly obtained the authorization to destroy informant evidence and hid this from the court for years, instead providing the court with record retention policies that were outdated and did not address destruction of informant-related evidence. OCSD has denied the department is destroying documents. However, in the more than 200 pages of special handling notes released last year, there were multiple entries made by sheriff’s deputies that appear to describe the destruction of documents. Two separate entries describe the “shredding” of “old” documents related to the special handling unit. In another entry, an entry describes a “purge” that deputies did of old files in a desk drawer.Sanders also alleges the OCSD made significant changes to its policy manuals to make it appear that deputies who testified in 2014 hearings were truthful in their denial of a jailhouse informant program.Law enforcement authorities use informants to help bolster a case — a tactic that’s perfectly legal, even when the snitch receives something in exchange. But Sanders alleges that in some Orange County cases, informants held recorded and unrecorded conversations with inmates who were already represented by lawyers, which violates an inmate’s right to counsel. Prosecutors then allegedly took damning evidence gathered by the informants and presented it in court, while withholding evidence that could have been beneficial to the defense — which is a violation of a defendant’s right to due process. In December, the Justice Department announced that it opened an investigation into the allegations that the sheriff’s and D.A.’s offices violated defendants’ rights through the use of the jail informant program. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas has maintained that no one in his office intentionally behaved inappropriately in relation to the jailhouse informant program. OCSD argues similarly and that it has taken steps to create more robust ways of documenting and managing inmates."
28,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Supreme Court Pick Came Of Age In A Very Different Republican Party,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neil-gorsuch-columbia-federalist-paper_us_589e2be4e4b0ab2d2b152dc5,It's easy to imagine an alternate universe where Neil Gorsuch became a Never Trumper.,2017-02-11,"But in this world, on Jan. 31, President Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589e2fb32800001f009982fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Arguments for boycotting the Soviet Union and funding the Star Wars missile defense program, screeds against the Sandinista constitution ― these are among the late ‘80s conservative talking points featured in The Federalist Paper, the campus publication that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch co-founded and edited as a Columbia University undergraduate.Gorsuch’s paper now seems like a relic of a Republican Party that no longer exists ― the party of politicians like Ronald Reagan and commentators like George Will and William F. Buckley Jr. The telecom ads featuring Charlton Heston extolling the wonders of satellites don’t help that time-warp impression.Listen to the paper’s former writers talk, and it’s easy to imagine that in another universe, Gorsuch would have been a Never Trumper. Instead, the president poised to kill off the Republican Party that Gorsuch grew up in has chosen him for the Supreme Court.The Federalist Paper, which Gorsuch co-founded in 1986, was meant to counter the overwhelming predominance of liberal views on Columbia’s campus. The paper was certainly conservative, but it was also accepting of students who saw themselves as centrists or even simply Reagan fans with no real attachment to the GOP or the conservative movement. Its former writers and editors describe the paper using many of the same adjectives they apply to Gorsuch himself: thoughtful, intellectual, mature, fair, open, personable.“He’s not a Breitbart type. He’s not a Rush Limbaugh type,” a former writer, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal in his current job, told The Huffington Post. “I think Neil would view those guys as uncouth.”The paper was legitimately committed to debate, former writers say. “We didn’t want it to be an alternative voice; we wanted it to be a bunch of alternative voices,” co-founder Andy Levy said on Fox News’ late-night show “Red Eye,” where he is now a co-host. (A Fox News representative declined HuffPost’s request to speak with Levy.)“I thought of it as a paper that was having a conversation about issues in a way that the [Columbia] Spectator didn’t,” said Eric Prager, a former Federalist writer who is now a partner at the law firm K&L Gates and an adjunct professor at Fordham Law School. Prager said he thought of the Federalist as centrist, even if there were plenty of conservative pieces in it.For instance, the cover story for the inaugural October 1986 issue, which Levy and third co-founder P.T. Waters wrote, argued that student activists calling for full divestment and boycott of apartheid South Africa were hypocritical because they weren’t also calling for similar policies against communist countries like the Soviet Union. The same issue argued in favor of U.S. military recruitment on campus and discrimination against gays (the latter military policy would remain in effect until 2011).A short, unbylined February 1987 piece criticized Nicaragua’s Sandinista government for including rights to food, housing and education in its constitution. The item argued that those rights “are not, and cannot be, ‘individual rights’” because individual rights “cannot extend to those things which are dependent on others for fulfillment”:The only way to achieve those ends is through use of force ― have teachers teach at gunpoint, have farmers farm with knives to their throats, and have architects design by taking their families hostage.The piece concluded that “it’s a good thing the US constitution is ‘vague’ about individual rights.”Under Gorsuch, the paper featured dueling pro-and-con columns on political and campus issues, such as a measure that would have mandated co-ed fraternities. (Gorsuch wrote in opposition in that example.)These pro-and-con pieces were particularly important to Gorsuch, who worked hard to ensure that both sides of the arguments were as strong as possible, said M. Adel Aslani-Far, who became a top editor after Gorsuch.“That was something Neil drove very passionately,” said Aslani-Far, now a partner at the law firm Latham & Watkins. Gorsuch “was not into the idea that the person who prevails in the marketplace of ideas is the person who shouts the loudest or bangs the table,” he said.The Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers’ group unrelated to Gorsuch’s paper, is notable for hosting similar left-right debates featuring prominent legal minds. Gorsuch, a Federalist Society member, is a big draw when he attends the group’s annual convention and has spoken at the gathering.The Federalist Paper’s writing was, like its editor, polished and precociously proficient. Its admiration of National Review wasn’t just political – its tone similarly combined proto-snark with a lilting young-fogey style. “Stop writing like your 50 years old,” reads a note to the editor that the paper published and mocked for its spelling error in the Oct. 26, 1987, issue.Gorsuch was aware that “having people debate Reagan versus not Reagan only went so far,” Aslani-Far said. The Federalist would also home in on campus issues, like the co-ed fraternities measure or the high on-campus fees for bounced checks, as it did in its January 1987 issue.On the latter issue, the staff editorial hit at the administration for charging a $25 fee for returned checks when the maximum value that students could write a check for was $30. “Can’t the university provide an alternative to the 80% penalty on a bounced check?” the editors asked. The piece went on to rail against the $10 fee to replace lost student ID cards. It wasn’t just an issue of economics, the editors said, though both cases seemed like pure price-gouging. The fees were tangible annoyances that hindered students from developing a positive emotional bond with the university.Along with political debates and campus controversies, The Federalist wrote about culture, such as a gushing review of a Polaroid collage exhibit from English artist David Hockney ― the kind of article aimed at that particular breed of college student who likes to discuss how the artist is pushing the boundaries of photorealism and cubism over dinner in the cafeteria.The Federalist Paper is also notable in that it received funding from the Collegiate Network, which was part of an organization founded by former Treasury Secretary William Simon and conservative writer Irving Kristol. The network directed money from corporations and conservative groups, like the John M. Olin Foundation and the Scaife family foundations, to conservative college publications. Charlie Copeland, president of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, which took over the Collegiate Network in the mid-1990s, confirmed the Federalist funding to HuffPost.The Collegiate Network has a lot of prominent alumni to brag about. Its website lists New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, National Review editor Rich Lowry, commentators Ann Coulter, Dinesh D’Souza, Laura Ingraham and Fareed Zakaria, and billionaire investor Peter Thiel. Longtime conservative columnist R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., the founder and editor-in-chief of The American Spectator who went after the Clintons in the 1990s, advised Gorsuch and the Federalist, along with “several similar off-campus college publications,” Tyrrell told HuffPost. The Federalist was “among the most sophisticated” of the papers he advised, Tyrrell said.Indeed, if the Trump administration had dug into the Federalist archives, the famously thin-skinned president, who has reportedly sunk at least one other nomination due to past criticism, might never have nominated Gorsuch.A short item in the October 26, 1987, issue featured brief notes from readers and dry, unsigned responses from the staff.“Trump should run for pres,” one reader wrote.“With Zeckendorf as VP, perhaps?” the staff sarcastically replied, referring to William Zeckendorf, a famous New York real estate developer who went bankrupt in 1965 and by 1987 had been dead for over a decade.Andy Campbell contributed reporting."

Outsiders find that odd because there is so much wealth here—the prejudice runs that rich people are conservative. In fact, my county holds a complicated mix of old money, working stiffs, and fair-weather retirees like me. We come in many sizes and colors but we mostly vote blue.Palm Beach itself is one of those Florida cities dreamed up by Henry Flagler. He founded it at the turn of the twentieth century, building two luxury hotels, including the famous Breakers, as well as mansions for himself and others. The city soon became a winter playground for the very rich and very white, with an established “season” of endless parties and social events. This was the Gilded Age, the years before the First World War—imagine Downton Abbey, Season One, with Yankee accents and fewer money worries.Marjorie Merriweather Post (“Post” as in she was the owner of General Foods) had the sumptuous Mar-a-Lago built in the 1920s and filled it with glitterati. She and her daughters married and divorced a few of the notables from time to time, ranging from E.F. Hutton to Cary Grant and Cliff Robertson.Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985 and the culture-clash began. He was different—brash, needy, and not quite rich enough. He had tiffs with the City over various zoning issues, including his giant American flag (he wanted to fly the biggest), his plans for an inappropriate division of the property and, after he made Mar-a-Lago into a private club, concerts that violated noise ordinance.Trump did manage to achieve some positive changes in a backhanded way. Anyone could join Mar-a-Lago, regardless of race, as long as they had the money. By Palm Beach standards, this was wildly democratic and it obliged places like the WASPS-only Bath and Tennis Club to re-think their admissions policies. But he also knew how to use his multi-cultural membership as a weapon in lawsuits against the city, charging discrimination. He was definitely an irritant but, inadvertently, he’s been good for Palm Beach, like spinach. He helped bring it into the modern world, “Youthenizing” it as one resident commented. But he doesn’t go for classy—the club’s parties were often flagrantly louche, sprinkled with beauty pageant winners and other special guests, salting the ambiance.No matter what, Palm Beachers despise him personally. There are a lot of New Yorkers here and they know too much about him. They despise his cruel divorces, serialized by the tabloids, and they deem his casino connections decidedly shady.Upper-crust Palm Beachers loathe him for his bankruptcies—many were on the boards of the banks that lost their investments. Middle class Palm Beachers loathe him for not paying his bills and daring them to sue. Or we just hate his policies, his dalliance with the KKK, his misogyny, bragging, bullying, and everything else.We assembled at Trump Plaza on Flagler Drive at around five o’clock. Hundreds were expected. We numbered three thousand.The march began at sunset—it’s hot in Florida, so we march in the evening. People got very creative about this, recycling Christmas lights to wrap hand-lettered signs. “Resist” was spelled out in blue LEDs. There were a few pussy hats, but it was too hot. We preferred headbands with ears, lighted Liberty crowns, and princess tiaras. We chanted, “Tell me what America looks like? This is what America looks like!” “Hands too small to build a wall!” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.”The immigration ban had emboldened new people to march. There were a relatively high percentage of Latinos and particularly Muslims in our crowd. One tired woman in a hijab sat on the wall of the Intracoastal with a friend and their children, holding a sign that read, “Thank you Mr. Trump for finally bringing us together.” She got a lot of cheers and thumbs up, as well as regretful acknowledgements that we need to do a better job standing up for all our sisters. A short woman walking behind me carried a large piece of foamcore that read, “THIS Jewish grandmother is not afraid of Muslim immigrants! LOVE TRUMPS HATE.”People who did not feel up to the walk stood along the road waving their signs. One held up “Humanity is on trial in America.” Cars drove by and honked their support. Bicyclists waved. Glow sticks were given out freely by marchers who cautioned others to “Stay safe.” It all had a sweet feeling as though Mom was nearby, challenging your efforts but urging prudence. And you were Mom. Marchers looked out for marchers.There were a few Trump people booing as we walked. A shiny black pickup with young men in the back holding a large American flag circled us a couple of times before giving up. We had our own American flags—if anyone’s, it’s our country. We voted with the majority. The only discouraging thing was that some residents along the route were afraid of us. Unexpected! Disturbing! And the sheriff’s department was ready for violence. Who did they think we were? Some property owners felt the need to stand guard on their lawns across the street, their arms folded, four traffic lanes away. One man held a shotgun in his hands. We laughed and called out “Love trumps hate,” but it was weird. After a while, some of the defenders looked abashed. Random people offered us bottles of cold water. Others—Trump voters? Trump-regretters?—invited their neighbors over for a “march-watching” party and fired up the blender. We strode on.My companion and I did not make it over the bridge to Palm Beach Island, where Mar-a-Lago is situated. We had both heard that marchers would not be allowed across and, when we got to what we thought was the end of the march, the crowd seemed to be dissipating. We watched for a while until the sheriff’s department, whose members had just been standing around, suddenly moved in and appeared to be taking on a burly role. We could hear bullhorns on the bridge. I feel weak for not having challenged all this. Another friend, whom I had not seen but spoke to later, did push on. She told me that the bullhorns turned out to be manned by Trump supporters and the sheriffs were just nervous that there would be a confrontation. To some extent there was. As my friend, who is white, walked over the bridge, Trumpsters shouted rude and racist slurs at any non-white people around her, yelling “Go home.” They quailed slightly. My friend, who is in her fifties and describes herself as a “big girl with broad shoulders,” decided to accompany anyone across who wanted to go. She made several trips. The Trumpsters noticed her doing this and one guy spotted that she (as is her habit) was braless. “Get a bra!” he shouted. She laughed at him. “Is that the best shot you have for me?”About three hundred people made it over the bridge, where not just sheriffs but a SWAT team guarded Mar-a-Lago, complete with a portable gun turret. It seemed like overkill but my bridge-crossing friend was not surprised. Trump is the President after all, and Palm Beach is new territory for security forces. She was told that there were a hundred Trump supporters there during the day but, by the time she got there, she saw only about thirty, mostly men.Mostly men. Somehow we all seemed to know that, yet again, ours was a women’s protest. Frankly, this strikes me as odd, sad even, but it’s highly significant. My friend who walked the bridge told me that her husband dropped her off and picked her up afterwards. There would be room for me in their car next time, she offered. Like many men, her husband sees himself in a supporters’ role. It was the same thing I saw in D.C. a month ago, where someone told me that her niece and a group of pals drove from Maine to march while their menfolk got together and babysat. It’s not that men aren’t just as mad as anyone else, it’s that an important dynamic has shifted.Thank you, Mr. Trump, for bringing us together? I’m sorry, I can’t call him President Trump. I just can’t."
30,THE WORLDPOST,The U.S.-Arab Relationship In The 'Age Of Trump',"James Zogby, ContributorPresident, Arab American Institute; Author, ""Arab Voices""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-us-arab-relationship-in-the-age-of-trump_us_589f155be4b0e172783a9ca4,"As Trump and Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei trade barbs, a nervous Arab world is caught in the middle.",2017-02-11,"U.S. President Barack Obama hosts a working session of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council at Camp David in Maryland May 14, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589f35982900002200f25c68.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this week Iran’s Supreme Leader made headlines thanking President Trump for “revealing the true face of America.” While much of Ayatollah Khamenei’s criticism was directed at the administration’s hardline policy and threat to “put Iran on notice,” he zeroed in on the disastrous White House executive order and its impact on refugees and immigrants and visitors from seven majority Muslim countries. At one point in his remarks Khamenei, speaking of Trump, said “Now with everything he is doing—handcuffing a child as young as five at an airport—he is showing the reality of American human rights” (note: a child of five was detained in the wake of President Trump’s Executive Order, but he was not handcuffed). This news item and the nasty and childish Twitter exchange and war of words between Iran’s religious leader and the president of the United States brought home the intimate connection between U.S. domestic and foreign policies and encapsulated the dilemma that will be faced by America’s Arab allies in the “Age of Trump.” It reminded me of two stories from the first George W. Bush administration—both involving Saudi Arabia’s then Crown Prince Abdullah.Bush’s callous disregard for the rights of the Palestinians, his administration’s policies which trampled on the rights of Arabs and Muslims in the U.S., and his disastrous invasion of Iraq—all severely strained U.S.-Saudi relations. The Kingdom, ever cognizant of the important role the U.S. played in providing a security umbrella protecting the Gulf Arab states from the threat of the revolutionary Islamic Republic of Iran, was at its wit’s end. At one point Abdullah told Bush that if the U.S. persisted in ignoring Arab concerns, Saudi Arabia might feel compelled to go its own way. It was not a step he was eager to take, but it was one born of frustration with U.S. policies and the increasingly high cost they incurred at home.To make his point, Crown Prince Abdullah liked to tell a story about a sheep herder who was losing a sheep a night to aggressive wolves. To protect his flock, the herder hired guards. They kept the wolves at bay, but the herder had to kill two sheep daily to feed his newly acquire protectors. The price he was forced to pay, he noted, was becoming greater than the benefit received. Then on election night 2004, I received a call from a friend of mine who served as an advisor to the Crown Prince. He asked me excitedly whether the news stories he was hearing were correct—that Democratic challenger John Kerry was in a position to beat incumbent George Bush. I was surprised and asked why he would be supportive of Kerry. I said, “Kerry has been very critical of Saudi Arabia, while Bush claims to be your friend.” He responded (and he made clear that he was speaking for himself, not his boss) “I think it is better for us to have a U.S. president who hates us, than to have a U.S. president hated by our people.”During the last 16 years, U.S.-Gulf relations have been on a dizzying roller coaster ride. First there was the adventurism of the Bush administration—which went from neglect, to destabilizing war, to misguided democracy promotion based more on ideology than reality. The Obama administration only compounded Arab frustration. It began with great promise but the failure to deliver coupled with multiple miscues led to it being judged as an enormous disappointment.By 2016, the Arab region was in disarray and the U.S.-Arab relationship was in tatters. Thanks to the foolish Iraq war, and its seriously bungled aftermath: that country is in the midst of a long civil war; Iran has been unleashed and emboldened as a threatening regional power; the U.S. military and public are war weary and wary of new conflict; Russia has extended itself into the Middle East; violent extremist movements have found safe-havens and metastasized spreading across the region; and because U.S. allies have felt abandoned they have felt compelled to act on their own, sometimes rashly, to defend their interests vis a vis Iran’s designs. To some extent, Arabs felt like they were caught up in the tale of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears.” With Bush they had “too much,” with Obama “too little.” With the 2016 election, they were hoping for “just right.” They wanted a relationship with a partner that would work with them to insure regional security and stability. And a partner that was both respected by and respectful of their people.From its performance, to date, the Trump administration does not appear to be such a partner. Trump has spoken forcefully about wiping out extremism and reining in Iran, but he and too many of his advisers have coupled this with ham-fisted anti-Muslim rhetoric and policies that have caused ISIS and al Qaeda, and now the Iranian leader to thank him. It would be a grave error for this administration to fail to understand the connection between how they treat and are perceived to treat Arab and Muslim peoples and their ability to achieve their broader policy objectives in the Middle East. The scenes at U.S. airports and the heart-breaking stories that filled Arab media in the wake of the executive order and the shocking anti-Muslim rhetoric associated with some White House officials has outraged Arab and Muslim public opinion. It has also, as we now see, heartened our adversaries and put relations with our allies at risk.While a dramatic course correction is required, it remains to seen whether this administration is capable of that. If they don’t change or if they take more provocative measures against Arabs and Muslims (or do something else to aggravate tensions like moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem), the destabilizing roller coaster ride will continue with severe consequences that will be felt for years to come.Follow @jjz1600 for more."

Whilst introversion and extroversion are, perhaps, more accurately described as lying on a continuum rather than existing as two separate entities, most of us identify with being more one than the others (even those of us who identify as being middle-of-the-scale ambiverts).So, are extroverts likely to be happier ― or introverts likely to be any more unhappy?If we look at the definitions of “introvert” and “extrovert” against the context in which “extraversion” tends to be used in psychology (and in the case of the “Big 5”) we can begin to see where the disconnect is.Introverts simply need to spend time alone to re-charge. As with all humans, social relationships are a crucial part of their wellbeing; however, it is after prolonged time spent interacting, and especially in more active/noisier/larger group settings, that their downtime afterwards is a necessity. In other words, introverts gain and replenish their energy from being alone.Extroverts, on the other hand, gain their energy from being around and interacting with others. Whilst most extroverts do, eventually, need some rest – this is long after introverts to, and their alone time tends not to be prolonged. In short, if they can help it, they would much rather interact in some way.With widespread agreement that social relationships contribute significantly to our mental wellbeing, it is easy to see why some deduce that extraversion -> interaction -> social relationships -> better wellbeing. However, this is failing to acknowledge the fact that introverts value their social relationships, too. In fact, they often prefer fewer and higher quality social relationships. I know plenty of introverts who have very healthy social relationships.Equally, I also know extroverts who, perhaps, aren’t as “outgoing” as we tend to expect them to be.Whether you’re an introvert or an extrovert or ambivert, the most important thing is that you recognize the importance of having strong social relationships in your life and so make a conscious effort to cultivate these. Just one or two high quality relationships can be all that is needed. Social relationships can take the form of quality time spent with our family and friends, or being active in a community- or team-based environment.See also: Why you need to join a communityOver to you…Are you an introvert or an extrovert?

As a motion and not a bill, it calls on the government to “condemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination.” It also suggests tactics for reducing bigotry.It doesn’t outlaw anything. Nevertheless, conservative websites have condemned it as a “war against free speech” and a “modern day blasphemy law.”Some sites have falsely reported the motion will make it illegal to criticize Islam. The Daily Wire, founded by former Breitbart editor-at-large Ben Shapiro, called the motion a “draconian” measure that would consider “any and all” instances of Islamophobia as hate crimes. Jihad Watch, LifeSiteNews and The Rebel ran stories claiming the motion would be a “first step” toward imposing Islamic law, or Sharia.The Toronto Sun compared Islamophobia with “fake news” and “alternative facts” and said it was a “catch-all phrase to silence anyone critical of the religion.” The Gateway Pundit attacked Khalid, who was born in Pakistan, as a “radical Muslim immigrant.” The website for Pamela Geller, a political commentator known for anti-Muslim views, blasted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, claiming he “has diabolically employed psychological warfare tactics created by the Muslim Brotherhood, and has smeared the entire Canadian population with the lie that they are Islamophobic.”Trudeau responded to the freedom of speech argument at a recent town hall. “You’re not allowed to call ‘Fire!’ in a crowded movie theater and call that free speech,” he said, according to CBC News.Khalid, who represents Mississauga-Erin Mills in the House of Commons, rejected the idea that her motion would hinder free speech.“It is the ultimate show of freedom of speech when MPs, the representatives of the people, publicly debate these issues,” Khalid told The Huffington Post.She pointed out that many Canadians favor finding ways to combat Islamophobia. In November, Canada’s House of Commons unanimously passed a motion to condemn all forms of Islamophobia after an online petition generated nearly 70,000 signatures.Though Khalid’s motion specifically names Islamophobia, its aims are broad. “All forms of racism are interconnected, they are not separate,” Khalid said. “People who are targeted by Islamophobia include Sikhs, Arabs, and Black Canadians and many other minority groups.”The heated rhetoric reflects anti-Muslim sentiment Canadians like Khalid say they face. “When I moved to Canada in the 1990s ― a young girl trying to make this nation my home ― some kids in school would yell as they pushed me, ‘Go home, you Muslim’ — but I was home,” Khalid said when she introduced the motion in Parliament. “I am among thousands of Muslims who have been victimized because of hate and fear.”Last month, a mass shooting at a mosque in Quebec City left six worshippers dead and many Muslim Canadians fearful. More than 70 Muslim organizations, individuals and community allies signed a letter after the shooting urging the government to take action to reduce anti-Muslim bigotry. They asked Parliament to support Khalid’s motion.“Now is the time to take meaningful steps forward in order to combat Islamophobia collectively,” the letter said.The House of Commons is scheduled to begin debate on the motion on Feb. 15."

The rapper claims that the woman he was talking to was wearing a “jacket and a winter scarf” ― not a hijab, as some fans had assumed. “I make a point every night to end my shows on tones of unity and love,” Drake wrote Friday evening. “So, to find out that I am being utilized in a fake media story about me disrespecting Muslims is devastating to me.”“I am well aware of what a hijab is and I would never make a disrespectful comment like that in my life towards someone who is wearing one,” Drake explained.“I am proud that my closest friends and fans come from all different religions and races. Perhaps whoever made up this story should spend more time learning about other cultures and less time trying to divide us.”Only people standing near the stage would know for sure whether the woman Drake was talking to was wearing a hijab, but the anti-Muslim comments Drake is being dragged for certainly don’t reflect the words of wisdom he imparted on his fans at another concert.Drake, not known for being politically engaged, had previously stopped mid-show to share his thoughts on the current state of America and its new commander in chief, according to Paper Magazine.“So tonight, my proudest moment isn’t selling tickets or having people sing my songs. My proudest moment ... if you take a look around in this room, you’ll see people of all races and all places,” the Canadian said to his fans during a show.“If you think one man can tear this world apart, you’re out of your motherfucking mind,” he added. “It’s on us to keep this shit together. Fuck that man.”Watch that full speech below:"

36,WORLDPOST,Brexit And Northern Ireland: Fact vs. Fiction,"Alastair Hamilton, ContributorChief Executive of Invest Northern Ireland",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brexit-northern-ireland_b_14632320.html,"Since the Brexit referendum last summer, there has been no shortage of pundits pedaling an image of a Northern Ireland on the brink of economic calamity.",2017-02-11,2017-02-07-1486468846-1627417-Belfast_Cityscape_Night8.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2017-02-07-1486468846-1627417-Belfast_Cityscape_Night8-thumb.jpg," Belfast at night.Since the Brexit referendum last summer, there has been no shortage of pundits pedaling an image of a Northern Ireland on the brink of economic calamity. It's time to dispel some popular fiction with actual facts.Northern Ireland has evolved dramatically over the past two decades into a modern, thriving region. Far from being the poor cousin of the UK, Northern Ireland is actually outperforming the other UK countries, including England, in many key performance indicators. Take exports - over the past 12 months Northern Ireland was the best-performing region in the UK with 6 percent growth versus overall UK export growth of just 0.2 percent. Since the EU referendum result, the softening of the sterling pound in relation to the USD and Euro has given a further boost to Northern Ireland with exports from the region surging in October at their fastest rate in 12 years. Jobs data for Northern Ireland this year has also been very positive, with wages rising for the second consecutive year and the number of people in work finally returning to pre-financial crisis levels. With local jobs growth of 3.3 percent in the 12 months to September 2016, Northern Ireland paces well ahead of the UK average of just 1.3 percent over the same time period. Then there's the fact that Belfast is experiencing a renaissance. The recent holiday season was the most lucrative ever for the local hotel trade with all weekend hotel occupancy being around 90 percent in Belfast in the months leading up to and right through Christmas. This boost was, in part, fuelled by the surge in visitors from the Republic of Ireland with one in three shoppers heading north to make their Christmas purchases. And there will be an additional 30 percent increase in hotel rooms available in Belfast by 2018.Foreign direct investmentContrary to popular belief, the Brexit vote has not stopped the flow of foreign direct investment into the region either. Invest Northern Ireland has made an inward investment announcement every month since the referendum and the pipeline remains strong. In fact, in 2016 there were 25 percent more investment announcements from international companies compared to 2015. This past year there were 18 new international companies that set up in Northern Ireland, nearly 40 percent increase from 2015. Of these half are U.S. headquartered. Most tellingly however, 12 of those announcements came after the referendum was held in June.That growth can also be seen in office rentals with top-end office letting in Belfast increasing by 40 per cent during 2016. The latest end-of-year figures show some 435,000 sq ft of office space rented during the course of 2016 - up 36 per cent based on a five-year average. And 573,527 square feet of new office space will be completed by 2018.The reason companies choose Northern Ireland is primarily for its highly skilled workforce and cost competitiveness. Skill sets at a value are the main drivers of investment in the region, not European market access. This has been a deliberate tactic. Invest Northern Ireland has predominantly targeted cost center opportunities for high knowledge service sectors - mainly offshore service centers for U.S. or Great Britain-based parent operations - so for our foreign investors market access is generally not an issue.Northern Ireland is a global leader in the knowledge economyToday, one in 11 people in Northern Ireland are currently employed in the knowledge economy. We are the number one global location for cyber security inward investment - and the top international location for U.S. companies with the UK's national innovation and knowledge centre for cyber security, the Centre for Secure IT, based at Queen's University, Belfast.Belfast is also the number one destination city globally for financial services technology projects. This is no surprise given Northern Ireland has the highest percentage of qualified IT professionals in the UK and Ireland with more than 77 percent holding a degree level qualification - well ahead of the rest of the UK and Republic of Ireland.This has led to the region emerging as a Legal Tech center with the UK's First Legal Innovation Centre to be launched at Ulster University later this month.U.S. legal firms and companies are here conducting cutting-edge work. For example, Allen & Overy's global IT hub is located in Belfast and Baker & McKenzie's Global Merger Analysis Platform (GMAP) - a new antitrust and merger data control tool - is delivered from Belfast and used by the firm's team of anti-trust and competition lawyers world-wide. Axiom's Belfast Centre of Excellence leverages the company's IRIS™ technology to deliver commercial, derivatives and regulatory projects for Fortune 500 clients, while Herbert Smith Freehills' tech-enabled Belfast operation is the central pillar in the firm's global alternative legal services offer.Northern Ireland has been successful in these high knowledge sectors in part as a result of the region's approach to marrying education and innovation and Invest Northern Ireland's modus operandi of partnering with companies investing in the region for the entire duration of their project. It is no accident.U.S. companies who come to Northern Ireland stay in Northern Ireland with some 75 per cent of new investors reinvesting in the region over the past decade.New lower corporate tax rate We believe the business environment in Northern Ireland is poised to get better as we gear up for the introduction of a new lower corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent - a commitment made by the Northern Ireland Executive - which, when combined with the region's other tax incentives, will make it the lowest anywhere in the G20.This move serves to enhance an already very attractive tax environment which includes Patent Box Corporation Tax of 10 per cent, low personal taxation, low social welfare contributions, generous tax allowances, no local taxes on profits or surplus, R&D Tax relief up to 230 per cent and an extensive tax treaty network of over 135 treaties.Crucially, this new rate of corporate tax is designed to create jobs in the local economy and therefore business must be conducted in the region in order to avail of the 12.5 percent rate. This new rate does not allow profit shifting, is fully BEPS-proof, and is only applicable to genuine economic activity.Importantly, what it also means is that Northern Ireland can more aggressively target other sectors such as advanced engineering and manufacturing, health and life sciences where the region is already world leaders in niche areas. And, it also allows Invest Northern Ireland to target profit centers for the first time.So, while the Bank of England has just sharply upgraded its economic growth forecasts, we acknowledge what happens in the coming months and years remains to be seen. Clearly, Brexit will pose challenges for all of UK and Europe, but it is high time people's opinion of Northern Ireland was based on facts and not fiction."
37,EDUCATION,Rethinking the College Mental Health Crisis: Do Bubble Wrap and Special Snowflake Myths Prevent a Vision for Needed Change?,"Kristen Lee , ContributorBehavioral Science Therapist and Professor, Recovering Perfect...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rethinking-the-college-me_b_14683448.html,,2017-02-11,2017-02-11-1486774491-206900-library1400312_640.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2017-02-11-1486774491-206900-library1400312_640-thumb.jpg,"This is Part One of a three-part series about Mitigating the College Mental Health Crisis. Every generation has its' own martyrdom anthems. Boomers (born 1945-1960): I had to walk ten miles in the snow to get to school.  Generation X (born 1961-1980): I had to wait at the bus stop in the cold. Millennials (born 1981-1995): I didn't always get a turn in the heated front seat on the way to school. Gen 2020 (born after 1995): They keep calling me special snowflake.As a first generation college student turned college professor, daughter, and mother of a college junior and a high school junior, both sides of the debate on who had it the ""worst"" are very familiar to me. Boomers: I never dreamt of going to college. It just wasn't an option. I went straight to work.  Generation X: I didn't have that many choices for college. I had to work my way through.  Millennials: I applied to 12 schools, took my SAT's five times. And those essays...  Gen 2020: I had homework in Kindergarten; my life mapped out by 8. Even with a perfect 4.0, test scores, and having founded a non-profit when I was 12, I won't get in anywhere, and if I do, it will cost me more than a Range Rover.I've been in higher education for almost eight years, and in the mental health field for twenty-two. I arrived to University life because of my grave concerns about the escalating mental health crisis in education. Between admissions pressures, costs, and perils of actually finding a job after all that's invested, anxieties are widespread, to say the least. A recent survey by STAT reveals that colleges are scrambling to keep up with the demands for mental health services, with average wait times of two weeks. The cry for adequate services is receiving national attention. In the wake of seven student deaths at Columbia, a petition urging leaders there, and at top-tier institutions including Yale, MIT, and Harvard to allocate more resources is circulating.As with any crisis, there are lots of theories about who's to blame. Fingers are pointed at parents, students, and administrators. Rarely do we take a look through a generational lens to understand what we've gotten wrong in the past, ways we're off mark now, and where we can go from here. Boomers: Therapy? That's for crazy people. Generation X: I saw my first therapist when I was an adult. Millennials: Embarrassed about therapy? No. My friends are all in therapy too.  Gen 2020: I have a whole team of coaches and therapists.Too many myths about what's really happening on and off campuses distract us from having conversations that can help students cultivate the agility and resilience they need in and outside the classroom. Myth # 1: Students of today are all bubble-wrapped. They're coddled special snowflakes; that's why they need their safe spaces and therapists.While the bubble wrap theories attacking Millennials have become popular sport, with people suggesting the generation is not only lactose intolerant, but life intolerant, there's much more to the story. Here's how to dig deeper:  1. Check their ID's. Remember that students aren't just 18-22. Among the college students of today reporting high stress are ""non-traditional"" students. They've become the new ""traditional"" student--those who are adult working professionals, veterans, and parents returning to the classroom as undergraduate and graduate students. The Anxiety and Depression Society of America cites that 65% of adult working students experience significant anxiety, as they work to juggle the demands of career, family, and academics. 2. Be like Bill Nye. Know your science. Advances in science and medicine have overturned Freud and his couch, helping us move from a deficit, blaming approach to recognizing that mental health disruptions are functions of our physiology. We now have a dearth of brain science that helps us understand how chemistry affects mood and cognition. Depression can be just as debilitating and life threating as other medical conditions like cancer, but have historically been chalked up as signs of weakness, moral failings, and now, allegedly, too much bubble wrap. We can barely keep up with the constant breakthroughs in science, but if we overlook the functions of the frontal lobe, dopamine, endorphins and serotonin, among others, we won't be able to have honest and accurate conversation about mental health.3. Do the math. Mental illness isn't simply a result of thin skin, but a complex interplay of what's known as biopsychosocial factors: biological, psychological and social. The socio-political climate, lack of sleep, time pressure, academic rigor, financial worries, technostress, and eroding social support adds up, with disastrous cumulative effects. Over the last few decades, we've gone from having 2.94 close confidants to 2.08, but college students most commonly report having 0. This is a formula that equals disaster. Social isolation amplifies biological dispositions to anxiety and depression. Unfortunately, access to timely help is proving to be a defining challenge of the college mental health crisis.Stayed tune for Part Two of this series, focusing on the number one barrier to getting help: stigma. Dr. Kristen Lee, known as ""Dr. Kris"", is an award-winning behavioral science professor, clinician and author from Boston, Massachusetts. Dr. Kris is a licensed independent clinical social worker known for her advocacy in promoting increased mental health integration in social policies and institutions to facilitate access and improved health outcomes in the U.S. and across the globe. She regularly works with students and faculty and consults with universities and colleges to mitigate the college mental health crisis.

38,HEALTHY LIVING,10 Things Truly Confident People Do Differently,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-things-truly-confident_b_14660700.html,Their focused pursuit is driven by these habits that you can emulate and absorb.,2017-02-11,Portrait of confident businesswoman with hands in pockets,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ba5d5240000310052e9ec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"True confidence -- as opposed to the false confidence people project to mask their insecurities -- has a look all its own. One thing is certain: truly confident people always have the upper hand over the doubtful and the skittish because they inspire others and they make things happen. ""Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right.""  - Henry Ford Ford's notion that your mentality has a powerful effect on your ability to succeed is seen in the results of a recent study at the University of Melbourne that showed that confident people earn higher wages and get promoted more quickly than anyone else.Indeed, confident people have a profound impact on everyone they encounter. Yet, they achieve this only because they exert so much influence inside, on themselves.We see only their outside. We see them innovate, speak their mind, and propel themselves forward toward bigger and better things.And, yet, we're missing the best part.We don't see the habits they develop to become so confident. It's a labor of love that they pursue behind the scenes, every single day.And while what people are influenced by changes with the season, the unique habits of truly confident people remain constant. Their focused pursuit is driven by these habits that you can emulate and absorb:1. They speak with certainty. It's rare to hear the truly confident utter phrases such as ""Um,"" ""I'm not sure,"" and ""I think."" Confident people speak assertively because they know that it's difficult to get people to listen to you if you can't deliver your ideas with conviction.2. They seek out small victories. Confident people like to challenge themselves and compete, even when their efforts yield small victories. Small victories build new androgen receptors in the areas of the brain responsible for reward and motivation. The increase in androgen receptors increases the influence of testosterone, which further increases their confidence and eagerness to tackle future challenges. When you have a series of small victories, the boost in your confidence can last for months.3. They exercise. A study conducted at the Eastern Ontario Research Institute found that people who exercised twice a week for 10 weeks felt more competent socially, academically, and athletically. They also rated their body image and self-esteem higher. Best of all, rather than the physical changes in their bodies being responsible for the uptick in confidence, it was the immediate, endorphin-fueled positivity from exercise that made all the difference.4. They don't seek attention. People are turned off by those who are desperate for attention. Confident people know that being yourself is much more effective than trying to prove that you're important. People catch on to your attitude quickly and are more attracted to the right attitude than what, or how many, people you know. Confident people always seem to bring the right attitude.Confident people are masters of attention diffusion. When they're receiving attention for an accomplishment, they quickly shift the focus to all the people who worked hard to help get them there. They don't crave approval or praise because they draw their self-worth from within.  5. They don't pass judgment. Confident people don't pass judgment on others because they know that everyone has something to offer, and they don't need to take other people down a notch in order to feel good about themselves. Comparing yourself to other people is limiting. Confident people don't waste time sizing people up and worrying about whether or not they measure up to everyone they meet.6. They get their happiness from within. Happiness is a critical element of confidence, because in order to be confident in what you do, you have to be happy with who you are. People who brim with confidence derive their sense of pleasure and satisfaction from their own accomplishments, as opposed to what other people think of their accomplishments.  7. They listen more than they speak. People with confidence listen more than they speak because they don't feel as though they have anything to prove. Confident people know that by actively listening and paying attention to others, they are much more likely to learn and grow. Instead of seeing interactions as opportunities to prove themselves to others, they focus on the interaction itself, because they know that this is a far more enjoyable and productive approach to people. If you struggle with this, emotional intelligence training can help.8. They take risks. When confident people see an opportunity, they take it. Instead of worrying about what could go wrong, they ask themselves, ""What's stopping me? Why can't I do that?"" and they go for it. Fear doesn't hold them back because they know that if they never try, they will never succeed.9. They aren't afraid to be wrong. Confident people aren't afraid to be proven wrong. They like putting their opinions out there to see if they hold up because they learn a lot from the times they are wrong and other people learn from them when they're right. Self-assured people know what they are capable of and don't treat being wrong as a personal slight.  10. They celebrate other people's successes. Insecure people constantly doubt their relevance, and because of this, they try to steal the spotlight and criticize others in order to prove their worth. Confident people, on the other hand, aren't worried about their relevance because they draw their self-worth from within. Instead of insecurely focusing inward, confident people focus outward, which allows them to see all the wonderful things that other people bring to the table. Praising people for their contributions is a natural result of this.Bringing It All TogetherBuilding confidence is a journey, not a destination. To become more confident you must be passionate in your pursuit of a greater future.Please share your thoughts on confidence in the comments section below, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

The two seem to go hand in hand, as the actor dedicated his time and energy to answering thoughtfully each and every question posed by a roomful of journalists who simply couldn't get enough of his wisdom. Kateb gave of himself, on a sunny but frigid afternoon, when one could tell he'd been doing press all day for Étienne Comar's Django -- this year's opening film at the Berlinale. Coming back from a break just outside, on the balcony of the suite in the Scandic Hotel, he excused himself by saying ""if I give twice the same answer you'll forgive me,"" clearly tired from the day-long junket he'd been a part of. Yet once the questions started, Kateb was there, in the moment, present and giving, never holding back, always being sincere. And he never repeated himself. Watching Django, I realized Kateb's Django Reinhardt redefined courage for me. His languid, truthful way of embodying the legendary Gypsy guitarist redefines an iconic figure and from now on, I'll never be able to listen to Django's music again without seeing Kateb's face. That face, so understatedly yet powerfully handsome, the way he smiles, also lacking any sign of self-importance, Kateb embodies true beauty. His sultry gaze and quiet passion, the kind you feel bubbling just below the surface, make Django irresistible and from a character in a film and a musical figure in our collective imagination, Kateb turns him into a real man right in front of our eyes. There is also a playfulness to Kateb that sneaked out a couple of times during the interview, a break from his otherwise disciplined persona. At the start, he pulled a bright red guitar pick out of his pocket and started twirling it around in his fingers. When he accidentally dropped it, while his translator turned his French answers into English, he reached down to the floor and searched for it under the table. It made me giggle while I transcribed his thoughts later, giggle out loud at the thought of him searching for his red guitar pick, with the help of a journalist sitting to his left. Interviewing Kateb made me wish my work for the day could end there. You know, when you've experienced the best and nothing could possibly top it? That's how I felt and I don't remember actually walking back to my hotel from the Scandic. But I remember crossing gaze with a few of my fellow human beings and finding new beauty in them. When a film, a star, a meeting can do that, I say it's cinematic magic.What is it like to do press all day? Does it get to be very surreal at this level?Reda Kateb: Not surreal, but one tends to get tired. How do you approach a genius that actually lived and still make the part your own?Kateb: Right from the moment I read the script, and I knew very little about Django, I felt that I will have to look for a character that was much bigger than me, and almost bigger than life. Exactly like the great characters that you get in theater who are in a way some concentration of humanity. They are very full and very complex. And this is how I felt with Django. So it really was a challenge for me to understand who this character was that I will have to play. It was like having to go up a mountain really. The preparation work lasted for a year and when Etienne Comar was about to start shooting I required a little more time in order to prepare better because I didn't feel I was ready. When the shoot started lets say maybe the first week, I was trying to adjust and find out how I was going to do, but then after a week it was perfectly OK and I was ready to let go. When I put on my costume, I was Django.Was it difficult to communicate in a different language in this film? Your language is acting whereas in this film you are using music so much to communicate what you are feeling, and who you are. Kateb: I have a musical relationship with acting. And this for each part, I really find it has to do with the rhythm you give and it's some kind of music, and I absolutely love acting in another language. Last year I shot a film with Wim Wenders where I spoke in Somali and obviously I absolutely ignore the Somalian language so every morning and every night I was learning my lines, phonetically. My approach of the language was not any more something that had to do with the meaning of language, it was an approach that had to do with the vibrations, with the way the voice can actually be an instrument. I felt that when you are liberated from the meaning, you are as close as possible to the animal vibration that you feel when you speak. In a way we actors we do some kind of interpretation with an instrument, which is the voice, and my real preparation for Django was the musical preparation that lasted a year and this really was my gateway to the character. How well did you learn to play and how much of it is in the film?Kateb: The preparation lasted for one year so I played every day and during that year I shot two other films but I always had my guitar with me in my dressing room and I was playing, I was doing my scales. I started with simple tunes like some Bob Dylan music and then little by little I started playing with this three-fingers technique and I did exercises with rhythm. This is what I worked on for the film. What was most important for me was that other musicians watching the film should believe that I was the one playing. As I also wanted audiences of Gypsy origin to really believe that I was a Gypsy when they would watch the film. This was my challenge and what I concentrated on. When we see guitar playing, is it always you doing it or is it a double?Kateb: For the close-ups they are the hands of someone called Christophe Lartilleux but for any kind of wider shot it's really me.Are you interested in the obvious political resonance of the film?Kateb: Anytime I do a film I need to agree with the viewpoint, the stance of the film. To me the film was a way of paying homage to the grand icon of Gypsy music and also to the Gypsy community. It was also speaking of a specific period and it was in 2016 in France that the genocide of the Gypsy people was recognized so in a way it was my opportunity to take part in telling a history that was not necessarily in the textbooks. You can also see the film as the story of a family of refugees who would need to cross a lake in order to survive and obviously if were to see what this lake could be nowadays it's quite obviously the Mediterranean. It was for me important that the film not be merely some kind of historical postcard but to resonate with the bigger picture in our days. The film is not a statement, it does not deliver any kind of message. It is more a work of art that actually puts forth emotions and could enable the viewer to feel and maybe then start thinking.It's inevitable to watch the film and draw comparisons with what is happening around the world, in the USA and specifically in France. Would you like to share your opinion about what happen in France if Marine Le Pen wins?Kateb: How can I say this. First of all, I feel more like a citizen of the world, and I don't want to come here and deliver some kind of view on French politics. I think it's a global movement. In a way we are sort of going backwards. The world is becoming more right-wing orientated and it seems that people are in some sort of need for strong or dictatorial political figures. This is something that I can see, like many of us, and something that I find rather worrying -- as many of us do. But I don't think the question is whether it will be Marine Le Pen or François Fillon, I think the question is more about -- and this is something that has lingered in my mind for a long time -- is it a particular time that creates the great political figures or do great political figures exist and then are they going to shape the times, the era? I think it's the first that actually happens. There are moments in history that call for a certain type of figure and I think our times call for the type of more right-wing dictatorial figures. But having said that I think it's important to have a film that actually pays homage to a people without borders, who know no frontier, people who in a way are not money-oriented, who live their lives almost poetically and artistically, and I think this kind of film in our days is extremely necessary. I think it's a strong symbol to have it open the Berlinale.Django, first refusing to play for the Nazis, then accepting. How do you relate?Kateb: I imagine that some right-wing people may have bought some tickets to my films and as such, contributed to the funding of the films. Actually I doubt they are very numerous because the films I've made are not likely to interest these kind of people, but anyway I think like Django, if I were performing in a theater I certainly wouldn't ask the people what are their political views. Anybody can actually decide to buy a ticket to see a show or a film or to buy a record. You can't prevent people from coming to see you. But as an artist you can decide to align with, or to support some politician or some political party, and then you have to realize that this may have some consequences. This is where the line is drawn. As a citizen I would certainly like people like Marine Le Pen not to exist, but the question about political commitment of artists is a question that you should really ask yourself. I did a lot of research about how artists behaved during the Nazi occupation in France, and some of them like Django just carried on, kept doing their jobs, as did bus drivers, because they needed to survive. Others were actually far more involved with the Nazis. They went and shared dinners or lunches with them or did publicity, like Fernandel did on Radio Paris. This is where you can draw the line between what it is to carry on doing your job and collaborating. But it's always difficult to judge people, to imagine what you could have been doing in this difficult period. I know for myself I certainly would not have been able to -- even if it was something that could help my career -- collaborate with this kind of regime.Photos by © Roger Arpajou courtesy of Berlinale, used with permission."
40,ARTS & CULTURE,How The Grammys Gloss Over Great Indigenous Music Being Made Today,Maddie Crum,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grammys-new-age-music_us_589d03c1e4b03df370d4dcb6,"The New Age category, with its history of appropriation, outlives those dedicated to cultural traditions.",2017-02-10,"R. Carlos Nakai during the American Indian College Fund's ""Flame of Hope"" gala at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City in 2005.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589d046c250000b54d0b81ef.jpeg?ops=crop_43_386_1950_2091%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale,"Chimes like raindrops ripple across a soundscape of vaguely spiritual chanting, made ethereal by digital remastering. The sound is inoffensive ― calming, even. A cedar flute, a traditionally Native American instrument, introduces itself and flits off.Recorded in 2000, “If I Could Tell You” is one of Yanni’s many contributions to New Age, a musical genre that was given an official Grammy category in 1987 and is still around today. The label ― like so many others in the ever-evolving world of music ― is hard to define. Since its inception it’s been wedded to the New Age spiritual movement, a Western mashup of non-Western cultural practices. And while there are exceptions ― Native American musicians who work within the genre, and others who do their best not to override the cultures their work draws from ― artists like Yanni, who lightly brush over a wide swath of indigenous musical traditions, are regularly rewarded for their efforts.On the cover of his live album “The Dream Concert,” an image of Yanni holding up an index finger in a “number one” sign is transposed over Egypt’s ancient pyramids, where the project was recorded. Blue and red fireworks burst in the background, in an all-too-literal image of colonization and Western triumph. Yanni ― a Greek musician who’s been combining keys and synth with older instruments like the bouzouki since his 1984 album “Optimystique” ― doesn’t set out to appropriate, but to blend different traditions under an overarching philosophy of “one world, one people.” His efforts have raised funds for NASA and PBS. It’s an artistic approach that subjects itself to parody. The bad exes in rom-coms such as “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and “Serendipity” rock long locks and well-meaning, earth-loving ethos. But it’s also an extant reality in the music industry. In 2012, when a number of Grammy categories including Native American, Tejano and Regional Mexican were axed, New Age remained.This year’s New Age nominees include White Sun, a group that performs yogic mantras, lead by Santa Monica-based vocalist Gurujas; Vangelis, the composer whose work falls under the more orchestral side of New Age, and who’s scored films including “Blade Runner” and “Chariots of Fire”; John Burke, a pianist whose latest album emulates the formation of mountains by tectonic shifts; Enya, who draws on Celtic traditions; and Peter Kater and Tina Guo, who recorded an improvised album, harmonizing piano and cello.In previous years, the New Age umbrella also often covered artists using traditionally Native American instruments in inventive ways. Since then, those musicians have been siloed into a separate category called Regional Roots, one that is meant to honor North American indigenous music, including Polka, Hawaiian, Mexican and Cajun. The culturally crowded category is one of the few avenues for these artists to get recognition; although other genres like pop and rock may draw from their influences much in the way New Age does, nominations in those categories are typically awarded to more mainstream artists. So, how can we make sense of New Age — its beginnings and what the genre has become? In a 1988 article about the genre, the Los Angeles Times wrote, “rock and avant-garde enthusiasts who are generally learning that whatever their musical interests may be ― from Third World music to John Cage ― there is something about the adaptability of new-age music to different sensibilities that makes it a force to be reckoned with.”It’s a potent description, one that recognizes that genres serve a marketing purpose but don’t always align with artists’ intentions. New Age appealed to listeners who wanted to relax and to immerse themselves in cultures different from their own. As New York Times music critic Jon Pareles wrote in 1985, as the genre was emerging, “New Age music shows up at restaurants because it doesn’t distract anyone from the food; it’s just there, oozing along.”The production of such music often comes at a cost, though: by blending and softening sounds like the Tibetan drum or the cedar flute, band leaders, often white men, can distort the original meaning or intention rather than honoring it. Although his records are sold in its bins, Yanni has spoken out against the New Age label, which he says implies placidness, whereas he hopes his music encourages more active engagement. He’s not alone in shunning the classification. Several artists who’ve won or been nominated for New Age Grammys describe their work in different terms. Paul Winter, a saxophonist and band leader who’s won Grammys in Traditional Folk, World Music and New Age, categorizes his work as “Earth Music.” His discography includes such album titles as “Wolf Eyes” and “Spanish Angel.” Other artists reject the New Age label because their work rigorously builds on their own cultural traditions, rather than merely slipping another culture’s influence in, regardless of its history or relevancy to the project. R. Carlos Nakai, a musician of Navajo-Ute heritage whose accomplishments with the Native American flute earned him an honorary doctorate from the University of Arizona, prefers the label of Contemporary Indigenous to New Age. That didn’t keep him from earning 11 Grammy nominations across four genres, including eight in New Age. Of his placement in the genre, Nakai told The Huffington Post, “I was more technically involved than just making melodies and putting them out there. There was a whole teaching philosophy that came with it. Of course the Grammy situation’s not involved very much in that.”A producer at Nakai’s long-time record label Canyon Records, Stephen Butler, elaborated. “It was when the Native American flute came along, and it was perceived to be a very relaxing sound, something that was conducive to meditation, yoga, massage. These were things that were embraced by the New Age community, and that’s how Native American flute music then became embraced,” he told HuffPost. “There’s this fascination with Native Americans as being an ancient tribal people. So from the side of some of our Native American musicians, who of course don’t create music with that motivation ― they’re creating it as an expression of their culture ― it’s painful.”Another musician who’s worked with Canyon Records, John-Carlos Perea, who self-identifies as Mescalero Apache, German, Irish and Chicano, voiced his criticisms of the New Age genre as employed by the Grammys. Although Perea’s won a New Age Grammy for the work he did as part of Paul Winter’s consort, he regarded the project not as a New Age album, but as a tribute to Native American saxophonist Jim Pepper, whom he was writing his dissertation on at the time.About his fellow bandmates, Perea told HuffPost, “they were all jazz musicians, they were all working musicians, they were trying to play. The genre label didn’t come into it until after, so I guess that’s why I say I wouldn’t necessarily support [the genre]. From my experience, it’s at that level of commodification that the appropriation does become problematic.”“New Age doesn’t cut it,” he continued. “The associations people have with that are justifiably problematic, and we should be critical of them [...] If you’re not seeing diversity in terms of the band leaders, then there’s a problem.” And indeed, most of the New Age Grammy winners who draw upon Native American, South American, African and Eastern influences are not members of these communities. But, Butler, Nakai and Perea agree that cross-cultural collaborations needn’t always take the form of appropriation. “I know of some New Age musicians who’ve made at minimum a reasonable effort to connect with the communities of the music that they’re drawing upon,” Butler said. “But those people are in a minority. And I think it’s because it’s so easy to [appropriate]. There’s a precedent for musicians to do that.”The precedent is already showing signs of impacting the future of the genre, which has seen a recent resurgence. Artists such as Matthewdavid ― a musician from Atlanta, Georgia, whose work blends hip-hop with ambient and even spiritual electronic sounds ― regard “the new new-age community as a refuge for people who once might’ve identified as punk.” “Weird desert hippie mamas,” he continued in an interview with Pitchfork.Nakai, who considers himself an outlier in terms of his opinions on the matter, doesn’t take issue with cultural mashups. In fact, he’s headed a few up himself, leading bands that incorporate Tibetan and Hawaiian instruments. But, he emphasizes that his projects are about harmonizing, rather than diluting disparate sounds. “Much of why I do that is to engage the people that I meet in a kind of dialogue vocally about how connected they are to their own cultural community. And then try to gain an understanding of how they do what they do in this moment of time in music,” Nakai said. “Rather than looking back, I’m more interested in looking forward into the future and seeing what the possibilities are, especially with instrumentation and electronics.” Perea agrees that collaboration has the potential to be constructive. In addition to making music, he’s an educator ― an associate professor at the College of Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University. At the beginning of each semester, he encourages his students to consider stereotyping and appropriation afresh. They discuss the Washington Redskins; they consider cowboy-and-indian movies. “I think a lot more students are interested in American Indian music right now because they’ve seen the Standing Rock protests in the news, and so they’re trying to increase their soundscape. I think as tragic as it is that that protest is still ongoing ― if left unaddressed ― as bad as it is that people are still having to fight that fight, it’s bringing people to ask questions,” Perea said. And this, he says, is a positive development. “When it’s objectified, when it’s cold and separate, then you can do whatever you want with it,” Perea said. “But when you try to get people to understand how these symbols circulate in their world, all of a sudden there’s that closeness that gets people to be a little more willing to have a conversation and to think about changing.”"

43,THE WORLDPOST,Donald Trump Suggests He May Not Move U.S. Embassy To Jerusalem,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-israel-embassy-jerusalem_us_589dd3cfe4b094a129ea518b,"The president also said he is ""not someone who believes that advancing settlements is good for peace.""",2017-02-10,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (R) stands next to then-candidate Donald Trump during their meeting in New York, Sept. 25, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589de1c4280000c63a998197.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump said that he is still deciding whether to move the Embassy of the United States in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, suggesting he is open to abandoning a controversial campaign promise.“I’m thinking about it. I’m learning the issue and we’ll see what happens,” Trump told the Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom, Haaretz reported. “It’s not an easy decision. It’s been discussed for so many years. No one wants to make this decision, and I’m thinking about it seriously.”As a candidate, Trump repeatedly promised to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the U.S. embassy, including in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September. Since his inauguration, however, Trump has been more equivocal on the matter. Referring to the embassy move in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity last month, Trump said, “I don’t want to talk about it yet. It’s too early.”There is ample precedent for American presidents reneging on campaign promises to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush both vowed to make the move, but decided in office that it would undermine peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.The international community largely views the Palestinian areas of East Jerusalem as occupied territory. Few countries recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Although Israel maintains that Jerusalem is its capital, Palestinians living under Israeli occupation have long sought to make Jerusalem their capital as well, making it a key sticking point in Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has warned Trump that moving the embassy would be “disastrous.” And Jordan’s King Abdullah told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that even Israeli intelligence officials are concerned about the implications of the decision, BuzzFeed News reported.In the interview with Israel Hayom, Trump also indicated that he is critical of Israeli expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank.“I want Israel to act reasonably in the peace process − and that it will finally happen after so many years. And maybe there will even be a possibility of a bigger peace than just Israel and the Palestinians. I want both sides to act reasonably, and we have a good chance at that,” Trump said.“There is limited remaining territory. Every time you take land for a settlement, less territory remains,” he added. “I’m not someone who believes that advancing settlements is good for peace. But we are examining a number of options.”Trump’s comments are the strongest suggestion to date that he will adhere to the decades-long U.S. policy of pushing for a two-state solution that involves land concessions by Israel. Last week, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement that “the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving” peace.On Monday, however, the Israeli parliament passed a law retroactively legalizing major settlement blocs built on private Palestinian land. The enactment suggests that many right-wing Israeli politicians feel emboldened by Trump’s election.Some of those same lawmakers expressed alarm at Trump’s Israel Hayom interview on Friday. Bezalel Smotrich, a member of parliament from the right-wing Jewish Home party, which is in the governing coalition, called the interview “very disturbing.”Israel HaYom is a free daily newspaper bankrolled by American billionaire and Republican donor Sheldon Adelson. It is so well known for its pro-Netanyahu slant that it has earned the nickname “Bibi-ton,” a Hebrew portmanteau meaning “Bibi-paper.” (Netanyahu is commonly known as “Bibi,” a diminutive for Benjamin.)There is evidence that Trump’s interview had Adelson’s official blessing. Trump dined with Adelson on Thursday evening at the White House.On the campaign trail, Trump pleased Adelson and other right-wing supporters of Israel with his strong rhetoric praising the Middle Eastern nation and promises to undo Obama administration policies that were tougher on the Israeli government. Trump notably indicated that the U.S. would be more protective of Israel at the United Nations after former President Barack Obama effectively allowed the U.N .Security Council to pass a resolution in December condemning Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories.Trump has nominated as U.S. Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, a supporter of Israeli settlements in the West Bank who has compared those who are part of the liberal Israel advocacy group J Street to Jewish concentration camp guards, implying members of the organization are equivalent to Nazi collaborators.

On Jan. 27, Trump signed an executive order that indefinitely bans Syrian refugees from coming to the U.S., shuts down the whole refugee program for 120 days and bars all immigrants and visitors from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen ― all Muslim-majority countries ― from entering the U.S. From Jan. 30 through Feb. 3 ― while heartbreaking stories surfaced of border officials detaining and deporting people or stranding them at airports overseas ― CNN, Fox News and MSNBC invited just 12 Muslims as on-air guests during primetime hours, according to the report from the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters. CNN hosted seven Muslim guests, MSNBC hosted two, and Fox News hosted five (all during a single episode of “The First 100 Days”). Two of the guests appeared on programs twice, meaning there were 14 total guest appearances by 12 Muslims. Those 14 guest appearances represented a small fraction of the 176 guest appearances on the news networks from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. on those five nights, when Trump’s Muslim ban dominated the national conversation. “This failure fits into a larger media pattern of ignoring Muslims when discussing issues that are particularly impactful to them, while at the same time painting false portraits based on stereotypes,” Media Matters wrote in its report. “Given how few Americans actually know a Muslim person ― and that the religion is already incredibly vilified ― cable news would do better to follow the precedent set by print media and highlight personal stories from Muslims who have been impacted by the ban.” While the White House has denied that Trump’s order amounts to a “Muslim ban,” Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani told Fox News that Trump asked him to find “the right way” to “legally” implement a “Muslim ban.”During his campaign, Trump called for a “complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.” On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit cited Trump’s previous remarks in its decision to uphold a lower court’s temporarily halt to his order. The unanimous three-judge panel said lawsuits against the ban raised “significant constitutional questions” as to whether Trump’s order intentionally discriminated against Muslims. While Trump claims he signed the order in the name of national security, there have been no fatal terror attacks on U.S. soil by immigrants from the seven banned countries.Yet in the days after the order was issued, CNN featured guest Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies ― listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, as part of “the nativist lobby” ― who made the unsubstantiated claim that “there are plenty of people with Iraqi nationality who want to commit terrorist acts in the United States.”This, Media Matters said, was an example of a segment “that could have used a Muslim guest to add perspective and personal experience to the conversation.”MSNBC declined to comment on the Media Matters report. CNN and Fox News did not respond to a request for comment. The report is the latest study of how the media ― and cable news, in particular ― negatively portrays Muslims while excluding their voices. A report this week from the media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting noted how the media reserves the label of “terrorism” almost exclusively for acts of violence perpetrated by Muslims, while often ignoring acts of violence committed by non-Muslims: “White supremacist Alexandre Bissonnette’s January 30 attack on a Quebec mosque was not generally described as “terrorism” by the press, and despite killing six times more people than the October 2014 attack on Ottawa’s Parliament Hill by Muslim Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, it received only one-sixth as much coverage by US media.”Such negative coverage has real consequences. Nearly 40 percent of Americans don’t have a favorable view of Muslims, according to a University of Maryland poll. Fifty-six percent think Islam isn’t compatible with American values, according to a survey from the Public Religion Research Institute ― a sentiment also embraced by Trump’s aides and top advisers.Though the U.S. Constitution clearly says otherwise, 26 percent of Americans think it should be illegal to practice Islam in the U.S., according to a 2015 survey from Public Policy Polling. Another 21 percent said they weren’t sure if the religion should be illegal here. “We are pre-programmed evolutionarily to focus on negative information,” Bobby Duffy, the managing director at Ipsos Mori’s Social Research Institute, told The Huffington Post recently. “Negative information is more urgent information. Negative discussions take up more of our mental space and lead us to overestimate things.”"

Her boyfriend, Hugo, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Feb. 10, 2017, and now faces deportation.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589e2f542800001f009982f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas ― President Donald Trump’s promised crackdown on undocumented immigrants is in full force this week, with increased deportation efforts around the country, activists and elected officials said Friday.Immigrant rights advocates reported an uptick in Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests ― including the detention of people who were considered low priority for removal until Trump signed an order last month making nearly every undocumented immigrant an important target for deportation.ICE officials initially said that this week’s actions were “routine” and nothing outside the ordinary. But in a conference call with reporters Friday evening, an ICE official appeared to contradict that statement, saying that the agencies targeted several cities in an “enforcement surge.” Rep. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) said ICE’s San Antonio field office told him that South and Central Texas were also targeted as part of an operation called “Cross Check.”The idea that these operations will become the new normal is exactly what undocumented immigrants are afraid of.In Austin, Angel Velazquez kissed her boyfriend Hugo before he went to work on Friday morning. He said he’d text her when he got to his job site, like he normally does.Instead, she got a text a few minutes later in Spanish saying he’d been stopped by immigration authorities. “I was like, ‘Babe, don’t hang up, I’ll be there right away,’” Velazquez told The Huffington Post.Velazquez, who is a U.S. citizen of Native American descent, rushed with her sister to the place where her boyfriend had been stopped, telling him on the phone as they drove not to answer questions, especially about his immigration status. When they found him, Velazquez said, she asked ICE agents for a warrant, but they responded that they didn’t need one.Hugo was one of more than a dozen people in the area hauled off to immigrant detention over the last two days. Activists and elected officials in Austin said ICE had stopped undocumented immigrants in traffic, attempted to arrest them in their homes and patrolled the area around an HEB grocery store in the northwestern part of the city. A Texas-based spokeswoman for ICE declined to specify why the agency had detained any of these immigrants, but Velazquez said Hugo had a DWI ticket on his record.“The level of ICE enforcement that we’ve seen in the past few weeks is unprecedented,” Stephanie Gharakhanian, an attorney with the Workers Defense Project, told reporters. Grassroots Leadership, an immigrant rights group, has meanwhile received calls from about 20 different people’s families on its hotline. “I’m connecting them with attorneys,” Alejandro Cáceres, one of the activists fielding the calls, told HuffPost. “I’m telling them not to open their doors.” One caller told Cáceres that a police officer had accompanied ICE agents to make an arrest ― a seeming contradiction of the “sanctuary” policy that Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez announced last month. Austin Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ICE’s national office pushed back against the idea that anything was out of the ordinary. “The rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous, and irresponsible,” the agency wrote in a statement about detentions in the Los Angeles area. “These reports create panic and put communities and law enforcement personnel in unnecessary danger. Individuals who falsely report such activities are doing a disservice to those they claim to support. “Still, the agency acknowledged the “enforcement surge” in the Los Angeles area. During the five-day operation, ICE agents detained 160 people, all but 10 with “criminal histories,” according to a statement.Immigrant rights advocates who keep a close eye on deportations said they’ve seen a clear uptick in arrests in multiple cities, including the deportation of Guadalupe “Lupita” García de Rayos, a mother of two U.S. citizens who came to the country at the age of 14, in Phoenix on Thursday.In the metro area of Savannah, Georgia, ICE agents picked up 26 people, according to news reports. In Atlanta, an advocate said agents had been knocking on doors in an apartment complex and a trailer park. At least nine men who worked as construction workers were detained at a trailer park in Apple Valley, Minnesota, an activist there said.United We Dream, an undocumented youth activist group, also received calls about increased deportation activity in Virginia, New York, Oklahoma and Florida, Cristina Jimenez, the group’s executive director, said on a call with reporters. “This is clearly the first wave of attacks under the Trump administration, and we know that this is not going to be the only one,” Jimenez said.Some of the arrests are happening in so-called “sanctuary cities,” jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with ICE in some way. Trump said he would pressure these jurisdictions into collaborating with deportation efforts.Austin City Council member Greg Casar, a progressive Democrat, said he believed the vigorous enforcement efforts are an act of retaliation against local leaders for trying to protect undocumented immigrants.“This is a drastic shift in ICE actions in our community,” Casar said at a press conference, adding that the city council would respond by considering an emergency appropriation to provide legal services to undocumented immigrants.Immigrant rights groups and their allies in public office plan to increase their efforts to protect undocumented immigrants by holding more “know your rights” presentations and raising funds for legal representation, among other things. Democratic members of Congress condemned the reported ICE raids and said they would do what they could to fight them. Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) told HuffPost he doesn’t think it’s a coincidence the crackdown happened this week, as the Trump administration struggled with a roadblock in the courts over its executive order banning refugees and travel from certain Muslim-majority countries. “This is retaliatory and it is a way to provide political cover ― ‘Look what we’re doing, we’re out there being tough on criminals’ ― when in reality, they’re breaking up families,” Grijalva said. “It’s callous and it’s very, very dangerous.” Velazquez spent the afternoon in jail herself. When she tried to defend her boyfriend, authorities asked to see her ID. They arrested her on a warrant for an unpaid speeding ticket, she said. When she left the downtown courthouse on Friday afternoon, she said she felt guilty. She didn’t have to work on Friday. Normally on her days off, she drives Hugo to work. But on Friday, she felt sleepy and asked to stay home and rest. “I just want him out of jail and just home already,” Velazquez told HuffPost. “I don’t think it’s fair what they’re doing. I don’t see the reason for it.” "

Visitors included celebrities like Jaden Smith, who was first to participate in the project. The site, however, soon became a hotbed of confrontation between protesters and presumed Trump supporters. In January, a video of LaBeouf engaging in a shouting match with a white supremacist quickly went viral. That same week, the actor was arrested during an altercation with a 25-year-old man after LaBeouf allegedly grabbed the man by the scarf and scratched his face. Ever since, police have been patrolling the installation day and night to prevent future incidents.“While the installation began constructively, it deteriorated markedly after one of the artists was arrested on the site of the installation and ultimately necessitated this action,” the museum’s statement continues. “Over the course of the installation, there have been dozens of threats of violence and numerous arrests, such that police felt compelled to be stationed outside the installation 24 hours a day, seven days a week.”LaBeouf took to Twitter to express his disapproval about the closure with a screenshot from the former installation’s website: “THE MUSEUM HAS ABANDONED US.”Despite the negative public attention, the museum maintains it was “proud” to host the digital art installation, which was watched by millions of viewers around the world. “HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US generated an important conversation allowing interaction among people from many backgrounds and with different viewpoints,” the statement concludes. “However, ending our engagement with the installation is the most prudent path forward to restore public safety to the Museum, its visitors, staff, and the community.”"

She asks if they’d like to appear on her website and then conducts an interview and photo shoot at their homes. “I love for them to be in their element, doing the things that they love.

Ashley Glass is the creator of “Beloved,” a project focused on empowering moms through photography, interviews and inspirational products.“I want to take women from every walk of life and show how loved they are by those around them,” Glass told The Huffington Post. “My dream is for these posts to inspire women to see their own worth, their own beauty, and truly know how beloved they are!”Glass reaches out to women she’s come across in her local community or even on social media platforms like Instagram. She asks if they’d like to appear on her website and then conducts an interview and photo shoot at their homes. “I love for them to be in their element, doing the things that they love. The shoots are casual, laid back, and as care-free as possible,” Glass said, adding, “All of them so far have been excited to be a part of this movement.”The mom said she hopes to interview and photograph one or two women each month and has even traveled to Nashville to meet with a few subjects. So far, she’s featured four different women on her site. Glass lives in Louisville with her husband, 4-year-old son Pierson, and 3-year-old daughter Reese. She came up with the the idea for “Beloved” after writing a viral blog post about body shaming as a “skinny” mom. Glass said many women emailed her after that blog post to share their experiences. “There was a common thread among them all and it was that they appreciated the post and were very much so trying to love the woman that they are, regardless of their body,” she recalled. “I am a photographer and have shot quite a few boudoir sessions over the last year. It dawned on me that what I saw was beautiful in them, they did NOT, and all day, we could go back and forth comparing one another, wishing we were more curvy or skinnier, or had longer hair or less wrinkles ― but what resonates with me is this: When are we going to love ourselves?”Thus, she decided to focus on celebrating women and making them understand how many people truly love them ― from their partners and children to their co-workers and friends. “I want women ― especially moms! ― to feel and know that they are beloved,” Glass said. “It is no small feat to be a woman. Our bodies go through SO many trials, so many unique challenges; some of us work hard to get pregnant, others don’t necessarily have to try so hard. But something we all have in common no matter HOW many babies we’ve had: We are a different woman. Our hair is different, our skin, our emotions, the way that we look at ourselves.”Reflecting on her own sense of self-worth, she added, “It’s been three years since I’ve birthed a baby, and I’m still learning to love the ‘new me.’”In addition to photographing and interviewing women, Glass also developed a line of motivational quote prints, shirts and other products with her friend Chelcey Tate.The line includes a 12-month calendar filled with Glass’ photography. They also selected quotes for each month, which appear in Tate’s lettering on the images.“One of my very favorite quotes is, ‘You are esteemed, chosen, valued, pursued, loved,’” Glass said. It’s one I really hold near and dear to my heart. It really does hurt my heart the many insecurities we all have ... and I pray this is something we as a generation can somehow improve and overcome.”Since sharing her interviews, photo shoots and products, the mom says she’s received a lot of emails from mothers thanking her for starting the “Beloved” project. She hopes her series will impact more women in the year to come.Ultimately, Glass wants viewers and participants to know that wanting to feel celebrated does not indicate self-absorption.“You were born, you are talented, you are unique, and you deserve to be celebrated and empowered, no matter who you are.”The HuffPost Parents newsletter offers a daily dose of personal stories, helpful advice and comedic takes on what it’s like to raise kids today.

54,POLITICS,House Dems Are Sounding More And More Like They Won't Work With Trump On Anything,Jennifer Bendery and Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-democrats-trump_us_589cca00e4b04061313c4ea8,The president isn't focused on infrastructure or trade. What's left for them to support?,2017-02-10,"Rep. Joe Crowley (N.Y.), a member of House Democratic leadership, says his hopes are fading for working with President Donald Trump on anything.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589cd6892900002200f25784.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BALTIMORE ― House Democratic leaders have said they’ll work with President Donald Trump when they can find common ground. But a few weeks into his presidency, they’re united against him, and Trump is to thank for that.For months, Democrats have talked about the prospect of passing an infrastructure investment bill with Trump. It’s one of few issues they could point to where the president has signaled support for something they like. If they could collaborate with him on a $1 trillion spending package that creates jobs and fixes the nation’s crumbling roads, they could actually get something done that they care about instead of just opposing him at every turn.But there is no bill. In fact, Trump isn’t even talking about infrastructure anymore. That’s left House Democrats with even less to work with, as they game out their strategy for the next four years, and even more reason to fight.“A number of us were hopeful initially that there might be some things ― given the fact that he would be president for four years ― that we might be able to work on with him,” Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) told The Huffington Post on Thursday. “The actions that he’s taken so far have not spoken to that hope or aspiration that that could take place. And I think in many respects, that has begun to outweigh maybe the ability to work with him.”Crowley, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, was among dozens of lawmakers at their party’s annual retreat this week. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was there too, and her tone was markedly less optimistic about the prospect of working with Trump on another issue he and Democrats like: better trade deals for American workers.“So far, we haven’t seen anything from the administration that would justify any kind of cooperation,” she told reporters. “The president said he’s going to renegotiate [the North American Free Trade Agreement]. Take action, we can work with you on that. We have seen nothing from them.”To be sure, Democrats don’t have much power in Congress these days, particularly in the House. Trump doesn’t necessarily need their votes to pass bills in that chamber, and they’re going to have to get used to disappointments. But if the president is already backing away from the few Democrat-backed ideas he’s floated, he’s creating an environment where Democrats won’t work with him on anything, regardless of what it is.That’s exactly what progressive voters want to happen, too. The Democratic base is the most energized it’s been in years, with millions of people fired up from last month’s women’s marches and newly engaging in the political process. Many have been clamoring for their elected officials to wage war on Trump.Until now, party leaders like Pelosi have resisted that call. She and others have said they want to leave the door open to collaborating. But if there’s nothing for them to collaborate on, Democrats have little choice but to fight everything. That puts them on the same page with a base of voters that has arguably been out in front of Democratic leaders in driving the party forward.The strategy is a bit different in the Senate, where Democrats have some power over Trump’s agenda and where they’ve already been voting on his cabinet picks. They’ve voted for some, and unanimously opposed others. Democrats there say they definitely feel pressure from voters back home to vote against everything, but they say it’s better to be pragmatic.“Oh I hear it constantly,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), a member of party leadership, told reporters this week. “Our base is very intense. Very emotional. Very committed. I love ‘em. But sometimes I have to tell them, ‘Please take a deep breath. This a marathon, it’s not a sprint.’ We need to make sure that we only oppose when we have to, support when we must, and have a clear message about what we stand for.”But even Democrats turned off by the idea of opposing everything Trump does are starting to realize they’re already doing it.Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) said he’s been ready to work with Trump on things like a bill ratifying that the United States is pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But there is no bill, and in the meantime he’s horrified by the actions Trump has been taking, like signing an executive order temporarily banning U.S. entry to refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries. That’s tied up in court at the moment.“It’s turning out that everything coming out of the White House is either unconstitutional or harmful to America,” Lieu said. “So, for me, it’s easy to oppose.”He said he doesn’t expect to be able to support any of Trump’s proposals going forward either, so long as a certain White House aide has the president’s ear.“I think it will remain that way as long as Steve Bannon is where he is,” Lieu said, referring to Trump’s strategy adviser who formerly led a website that promotes white nationalism. “It’s possible that Donald Trump could change. I hope he does for the good of the republic.”Of course, some Democrats never had hope for working with Trump in the first place. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), for one, has vowed to do everything he can to gum up Trump’s agenda. And Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said while he’s all for investments in infrastructure, he doesn’t think this president is capable of advancing any kind of concrete policy proposal.“The man was tweeting at Nordstrom about his daughter while he was supposed to be in an intelligence briefing,” Swalwell said. “I don’t believe there is even an infrastructure bill there.”“He’s not a serious president,” he added.Clarification: A previous version of this article suggested that Trump had proposed a $1 billion infrastructure plan; several proposals have been floated, but the more often-cited figure is $1 trillion."
55,BUSINESS,Exxon Adviser Resigns Over Oil Giant's 'Targeted Attacks' On NGOs,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sarah-labowitz-resignation-exxon-mobil_us_589c7c47e4b09bd304c03faf,"In the face of public criticism, the oil giant has chosen to shoot the messenger, says Sarah Labowitz, a human rights scholar at NYU.",2017-02-10,"Sarah Labowitz, a co-director of New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, served on Exxon Mobil’s External Citizenship Advisory Panel since 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589cdd272900002200f257a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A research scholar at New York University has resigned from Exxon Mobil Corp.’s External Citizenship Advisory Panel, citing what she calls the oil giant’s “targeted attacks” on environmental groups under former CEO Rex Tillerson’s watch.In a letter this week to Exxon Mobil Foundation president Ben Soraci, Sarah Labowitz expressed her disgust with the company’s continued assault on organizations investigating whether Exxon covered up the risks of climate change.Labowitz, a co-founder and co-director of New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, told The Huffington Post that she has studied many companies facing serious public criticism, often in her field of human rights. For the most part, she said, “they don’t shoot the messenger ― which is what Exxon is doing.”Exxon’s current strain of legal trouble dates back to November 2015, when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed the oil giant to obtain documents related to allegations that it had lied to the public and its investors about the risks of climate change. In March, a coalition of state attorneys general, including Maura Healey of Massachusetts, pledged to crack down on corporate climate fraud, after InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times reported that Exxon executives were aware of the climate risks associated with carbon dioxide emissions but had funded research to cover up those risks and block solutions.In June, Exxon hit back, filing a lawsuit against Healey in the company’s home state of Texas in an effort to bar a civil investigative demand from her office. Shortly thereafter, Labowitz told HuffPost, the company began advancing a conspiracy argument that she finds particularly troubling.In October, Exxon filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, Texas, that sought to invalidate Schneiderman’s subpoena, arguing the investigations by the New York and Massachusetts AGs were “biased attempts to further a political agenda for financial gain.” The company claimed that “revelations from third-party disclosures about secret and deliberately concealed collaboration with anti-oil and gas activists and a private law firm” had shown the AGs were “incapable of impartial investigations” and were “attempting to silence political opponents.”Exxon Mobil then turned its attention to non-governmental organizations, including the Union of Concerned Scientists, warning them in a series of letters not to destroy or delete communications related to their probes of Exxon ― including communications with the press. The move hinted at future subpoenas. At that time, a company spokesman told HuffPost that Exxon had been left with no choice but to “vigorously defend” itself. To show what Exxon was up against, the spokesman shared a link to a draft agenda for a January meeting of environmental group leaders at the Rockefeller Family Fund. First covered by The Wall Street Journal in April and later published at The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative site, the letter appears to list several of the meeting participants’ common goals, including “to establish in the public’s mind that Exxon is a corrupt institution that has pushed humanity (and all creation) toward climate chaos and grave harm.”Created in 2009, Exxon Mobil’s External Citizenship Advisory Panel consists of five independent experts and is tasked with reviewing the company’s corporate citizenship activities, including its effects on human rights and the environment. Labowitz, who had served on the panel since 2014, told HuffPost that she began to notice a pattern. She raised her concerns, both privately and during formal advisory meetings, and encouraged company leaders to find alternative approaches. Then last week, Exxon “doubled down,” as Labowitz put it. In court papers filed Feb. 1, Exxon wrote that the Massachusetts and New York AGs were “at the forefront of a conspiracy to violate ExxonMobil’s constitutional rights,” as E&E News reported. “I think that’s the wrong way to go,” Labowitz said. “I don’t think it’s helpful to them and I don’t think it’s helpful to society at large.”In her scathing resignation letter, Labowitz argues that Exxon Mobil’s approach undermines democratic principles. “I am disappointed that instead of examining its own record and seeking to restore a respected place for itself in the public debate, Exxon has chosen to turn up the temperature on civil society groups,” the letter reads.Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers told HuffPost that while the company regrets Labowitz’s decision to resign, it takes issue with some of her conclusions.“We have never characterized any action by civil society representatives as illegal,” he said in an email. “What we have done is defend the company, on behalf of all shareholders, from politically motivated investigations that are biased, in bad faith and without legal merit.”“We did not start this,” Jeffers went on, “but will vigorously defend ourselves against false allegations and mischaracterizations of our climate research and investor communications.”Labowitz’s departure comes just days after Tillerson, the former Exxon head, took over as President Donald Trump’s secretary of state. During his confirmation process, Tillerson faced serious questions about his ties to Russia and the company’s decades-long, well-documented climate change cover-up. He refused to discuss what the company knew about climate change and when it knew it, saying, “Since I’m no longer with Exxon Mobil, I can’t speak on their behalf.”Kathy Mulvey, climate accountability campaign manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that Labowitz’s departure “speaks volumes” about the kind of corporate citizen Exxon is. “All companies try to protect themselves, but Exxon’s recent attacks have crossed a line,” Mulvey said in a statement. “Going after nonprofits and interfering with independent state investigations shows that ExxonMobil will stop at nothing to protect its bottom line. Ms. Labowitz took a bold stand against ExxonMobil’s climate deception and bullying.”Mulvey urged other panel members to likewise call out the company’s behavior.Ultimately, Labowitz says it will be important for Exxon to restore itself as a credible participant in the climate change discussion. If it continues down its current path, Labowitz believes it will do so at its own peril.“I hope they find a way out of this. I don’t think that this kind of attack strategy is the way forward,” she said. “What happens if they win in arguing this is an illegal conspiracy? I think that it erodes their credibility in a way that is so unhelpful to them, and to the broader debate about the response to climate change.” "

The survey found 29 percent of Republicans feel favorably about President Donald Trump’s chief strategist and only 6 percent unfavorably. Among all registered voters,14 percent view him favorably, 41 percent unfavorably and 44 percent haven’t heard enough about him. Public Policy Polling released a poll on Friday that also asked about Bannon, highlighting how many Republicans were unsure how they felt about him. More Republicans, 45 percent, weren’t sure about him than felt favorably toward him, 40 percent. Among all voters, only 33 percent were not sure how they felt. When charted over time, polls show that more people have formed opinions about Bannon, but Republicans remain most widely undecided. Among all respondents, voters who were undecided about Bannon outnumbered those who felt favorably and unfavorably until this month’s polls, which show unfavorable leading. This is also true of independents, of which the majority were undecided until the latest PPP poll, when they were surpassed by those who feel unfavorably. Predictably, the majority of Democrats have felt unfavorably of Bannon since the beginning. A recent YouGov/Economist poll asked whether it was a good or bad idea for Trump to place Bannon on the National Security Council. This reflected similar numbers to the favorability question, showing Democrats strongly against Bannon, independents somewhat against and somewhat unsure, and Republicans split between a “good idea” and “unsure.” "

The chart below compares the latest polls, as of Wednesday afternoon, with the earliest from eight pollsters who’ve released at least two surveys on Trump’s job performance since his inauguration. There’s a substantial amount of variance here, as well, for potential reasons that may range from methodology to when each poll was conducted. But most pollsters, regardless of where they think Trump started, now find his net approval rating ― the difference between his approval and disapproval numbers ― to be at least somewhat lower than when he became president….What’s also notable is where the biggest change comes from in most of these polls….Trump’s overall ratings seem to be falling because some people who started off with a neutral impression on Inauguration Day have since soured on the president. Each of the eight surveys shows disapproval increasing, with the change ranging from 2 points to 13 points.” [HuffPost]-Kathy Frankovic finds Republicans “very happy” with Trump’s first weeks as president. [YouGov]-Patrick J. Egan examines whether “shy” Trump supporters could be hurting his ratings. [WashPost]AMERICANS SIDE WITH TRUMP ON TRADE, BUT NOT OTHER POLICIES - HuffPollster: “Americans support President Donald Trump’s stance on renegotiating major trade deals by an unmistakable margin. But when it comes to other items on Trump’s agenda, such as building a border wall and repealing the Affordable Care Act, voters are considerably more skeptical, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday. Sixty percent of voters said they were in favor of Trump ‘renegotiating major trade deals with other countries, even if it means paying more for the products you buy,’ according to the poll. Meanwhile, 31 percent said they opposed the idea. Elsewhere, though, support for the president’s proposals was less robust. Fifty-nine percent of voters said they oppose building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, compared with only 38 percent who said they support it….When asked if Trump should support efforts to repeal the ACA, voters were split, with exactly half saying he shouldn’t support repeal and 46 percent saying he should.” [HuffPost] NEGATIVE VIEWS OF ISLAM HAVE DECLINED - HuffPollster: “Americans’ view of Islam are, by and large, hostile. But negative opinions of the religion have dropped significantly during the past year, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, despite ― or perhaps in response to ― the anti-Islam rhetoric often espoused by President Donald Trump and his advisers. Last March, Americans were 42 points more likely to view the religion negatively than they were to view it positively. That gap dropped to 33 points by June, and to 20 points in the most recent survey, the lowest it’s been since HuffPost/YouGov surveys first asked the question nearly two years ago….In June 2016, Democrats, Republicans and independents all held net negative views of Islam, although the gap was most pronounced among Republicans. Since then, Democrats’ opinions of the religion have improved significantly ― favorable opinions have risen by 11 points, while unfavorable opinions have fallen by 13 points. Independents’ negativity toward Islam has also noticeably lessened, although that primarily reflects opinions shifting from ‘unfavorable’ to ‘not sure,’ rather than an increase in positive opinions….Republican views seem to have stayed the same, or even moderated slightly.” [HuffPost]NOT EVERYONE REALIZES THE ACA IS THE SAME AS OBAMACARE - Kyle Dropp and Brendan Nyhan: “A sizable minority of Americans don’t understand that Obamacare is just another name for the Affordable Care Act. This finding, from a poll by Morning Consult, illustrates the extent of public confusion over a health law that President Trump and Republicans in Congress hope to repeal. In the survey, 35 percent of respondents said either they thought Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act were different policies (17 percent) or didn’t know if they were the same or different (18 percent). This confusion was more pronounced among people 18 to 29 and those who earn less than $50,000 — two groups that could be significantly affected by repeal.” [NYT]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

61,POLITICS,Two Weeks After Donald Trump’s Promised Voter Fraud Probe -- Crickets,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-voter-fraud-probe_us_589ce834e4b03df370d4be34,The White House says it has no update on a planned investigation of “millions” of illegal votes Trump claims denied him a popular vote victory.,2017-02-10,"President Donald Trump speaks to Democratic and Republican senators about his Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch in the Roosevelt Room of the White House February 9, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589ceb31250000b54d0b8169.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Two weeks after President Donald Trump said he wanted an investigation into millions of “illegal” votes, the promised executive order remains somewhere in the ether.Trump appeared obsessed with the issue in his first days in office, telling a group of senators ― without any evidence to support the claim ― that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s victory in November’s popular vote tally by a margin of 2.9 million was entirely due to 3 million to 5 million illegally cast ballots.He then expanded on his theory in an ABC News interview, claiming that each and every one of those illegal votes was cast for Clinton ― without explaining how he could possibly know that.Trump promised the probe in a pair of tweets sent the morning of Jan. 25: “I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and....” and “even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!”That investigation was to be started with an executive order to be signed the following day, Thursday, Jan. 26, which then became Friday or Saturday.Since then, the issue has disappeared entirely.“At this time, we don’t have an update,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said.Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor and voting rights expert, said the order’s disappearance is not terribly unexpected. “I wouldn’t be surprised if this falls by the wayside for a whole lot longer,” he said.Levitt wrote a 2007 report titled “The Truth About Voter Fraud” when he worked at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law. It found that the amount of actual in-person voter fraud was so small as to not present a significant threat of altering elections.“It would be one thing if they did an actual study,” Levitt said. “There’s nothing like the tone of the proposal set up in the tweets. I’m enormously skeptical of any quote-unquote investigation that announces its conclusions ahead of the actual investigation.”There is zero evidence of widespread voter fraud in the presidential election ― a point made by Trump’s own lawyers when they were trying to shut down recounts in three key states that Trump won unexpectedly.During last year’s campaign, Trump and his aides pointed to a roundly discredited political science blog post hypothesizing about potential illegal voting, as well as a 2012 Pew Center on the States report about voter registration rolls. Trump again cited that study in the Jan. 25 ABC News interview.But Trump did not appear to understand the substance of the report he was citing. He claimed erroneously that it dealt with voter fraud, rather than out-of-date registration rolls that contain voters who have died or have moved to other states. Both Trump’s daughter Tiffany and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, were registered in two states during the last election, for example.Trump, however, claimed that being registered in more than one jurisdiction proved the existence of illegal voting: “You have people registered in two states. They’re registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice,” Trump said.In his meeting with congressional leaders on Jan. 23, Trump reportedly cited a story he claimed was told to him by a pro golfer and German immigrant in Florida who was not allowed to vote while others in line who appeared to be from Latin America were permitted to cast ballots. Trump’s story, though, was subsequently debunked by the golfer himself, and it appears Trump only heard about it third-hand.Trump, nevertheless, has not backed away from his claims, despite his White House’s inaction. In an interview with Fox News host Bill O’Reilly released Tuesday, Trump repeated his views ― again without any evidence.“Look, Bill, we can be babies, but you take a look at the registration, you have illegals, you have dead people, you have this ― it is really a bad situation. It is really bad,” Trump said. “I’m going to set up a commission to be headed by Vice President Mike Pence and we are going to look at it very, very carefully.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

62,POLITICS,Top Wall Street Regulator's Resignation Spooks Bank Critics,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daniel-tarullo-federal-reserve-resignation_us_589e0fc3e4b03df370d62d15,Another sign that bank deregulation is coming.,2017-02-10,"Daniel Tarullo, governor of the Federal Reserve and the central bank's acting vice chair for supervision, announced his resignation on Friday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589e258825000034080b849d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Daniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor charged with overseeing the central bank’s oversight of the financial industry, announced his resignation on Friday, alarming financial reform proponents who view Tarullo’s departure as a sign of his lack of confidence in President Donald Trump’s approach to Wall Street oversight.Tarullo, an Obama appointee who has served on the board since January 2009, will leave the top post by April 5. The former Georgetown law professor was widely seen as a tough enforcer of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. “Dan led the Fed’s work to craft a new framework for ensuring the safety and soundness of our financial system following the financial crisis and made invaluable contributions across the entire range of the Fed’s responsibilities,” Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said in a statement. “My colleagues and I will truly miss his deep expertise, impeccable judgment, wise insight, and strategic counsel.”Tarullo’s announcement comes just days after news of another important departure from the Fed. Scott Alvarez, the Fed’s general counsel and an influential voice in its regulation of banks, revealed on Wednesday that he would retire later this year.Observers interpreted Tarullo’s decision to step down as a sign that the era of tougher financial regulation prompted by the 2008 financial crisis was waning.“It is a scary moment,” said Jordan Haedtler, campaign manager for the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of progressive groups advocating for progressive Fed policies. “I don’t think it is lost on anybody that this announcement is coming a week after the Trump administration made an executive order laying the groundwork for repealing Dodd-Frank.”Trump issued an executive order last Friday limiting the reach of certain aspects of the financial reform law. To repeal major provisions of the law, however, as many Republican lawmakers have advocated, Trump will need congressional authorization. That may prove difficult, given Republicans’ lack of a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Fed has broad authority to regulate the nation’s largest banks. One of its most powerful tools includes setting and enforcing capital requirements. The law requires the Fed to conduct “stress tests” assessing big banks’ contingency plans for withstanding a significant economic shock. The goal of the practice is to avoid repeating the bailouts of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath.In June, the Fed gave the American branches of multinational megabanks Deutsche Bank and Santander failing grades in their stress tests, which some attributed to the Fed’s willingness, under Tarullo’s leadership, to diligently monitor major financial institutions.“Tarullo was a shrewd regulator,” Haedtler said. “He was very good at building consensus and applying things like stress tests.” Tarullo served as the Fed’s acting vice chair for supervision after the Dodd-Frank Act created the oversight position. Former President Barack Obama refused to nominate someone to fill the post permanently, apparently fearing that Senate Republicans would reject his nominee.Trump now has the opportunity to appoint a permanent vice chair for supervision, which would have reduced Tarullo’s role in regulating big banks had he opted to remain in his position. Crucially, Tarullo’s absence will now also allow Trump to fill three governors’ seats, rather than the two seats that are currently empty.“Tarullo reflects someone who was tough, strict, fair, [had] deep expertise and who, I think, made smart, tough calls about how to handle these very difficult situations,” said Mike Konczal, a Roosevelt Institute fellow and former financial industry professional. “I hope whoever is appointed takes that project seriously.” In addition to overseeing key banking regulations, members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, a public entity based in Washington, D.C., sit on the Federal Open Market Committee, the panel responsible for adjusting the benchmark interest.Until Trump confirms a replacement for the governor’s seat vacated by Tarullo, the regional Federal Reserve bank presidents that occupy five seats on the panel will have a majority of votes. The regional Fed presidents are appointed by the boards of the privately owned banks, and thus, are viewed as less accountable to the public than presidentially-appointed Fed governors. Tarullo’s term was set to expire on Jan. 31, 2022, ensuring him a say in the central bank’s affairs for years to come. Even as he voiced “appreciation” for Tarullo’s work, Haedtler expressed regret that he won’t stick around in a diminished role to try influencing the central bank’s policies from within.“Even if the person Trump appoints [as vice chair] is an extremist, Tarullo could have provided a good counterweight,” Haedtler said.Konczal echoed that sentiment. “It’s important for Tarullo and Yellen to serve out their full terms,” he said. “They owe it to the project of full recovery from the great recession and ensuring that our financial markets work for everyday people.”This story has been updated with reactions to Daniel Tarullo’s departure and additional information about his responsibilities."
63,POLITICS,Obamacare Advocates Set Their Sights On Republican Senators Out West,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-dean-heller-jeff-flake_us_589de5f5e4b094a129ea7e08,"It feels good, and rare, for them to be on the offensive.",2017-02-10,"Sens. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), left, and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) are the next targets of Obamacare advocates.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589de74d2800001f009981c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democrats are confidently selling Obamacare for perhaps the first time since the law was passed.Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have rallied behind the case that the Affordable Care Act needs to be amended and not repealed, using the prospects of coverage disappearing as a cudgel against Republicans, including newly installed Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. But the real action has been in the districts, where constituents and activists alike have overwhelmed phone lines and town halls demanding that Republicans put the brakes on their repeal efforts.The latest bit of disruption took place Thursday night, when constituents practically upended Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz’s town hall over concerns about an Obamacare repeal and the Republican lawmaker’s handling of congressional oversight with respect to the Trump administration. Other representatives have had similar experiences, with some fleeing their events, others being forced to leave with police protection and a select few (maybe just one: Justin Amash) forcefully pushing back against the crowd.Feeling buoyed by what they’ve seen, groups tasked with defending the law are ramping up their efforts. Save My Care, which is in the middle of a two-month bus tour, is planning a new demonstration targeting Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) outside his appearance at a Republican Party dinner this weekend. And from there, it’s going to Arizona to target GOP Sen. Jeff Flake.What Obamacare defenders need in the Senate are three Republican votes unwilling to support repeal legislation so long as there isn’t a replacement to accompany it. And for that, Heller and Flake are prime targets, as both have had some moderate streaks in the past, both come from states that expanded Medicaid coverage under Obamacare and both are up for re-election in 2018.But even if groups like Save My Care are able to sow enough doubt of the efficacy of repeal among elected officials ― and the evidence is mounting that serious doubt exists ― the law remains under obvious threat. Price has vast administrative control at HHS over Obamacare’s implementation. And he could try to reduce and upend the legislation through its administration. For now, the hope is that enough localized pressure will force members to legislate around the law (as opposed to killing it) and make even Price think twice about letting Obamacare simply crater to death.

64,POLITICS,There's No Silver Bullet For Solving School Lunch,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/school-lunch-jamie-oliver-huntington_us_589cf796e4b0ab2d2b13ab89,"Jamie Oliver tried to bring a ""food revolution"" to middle America. But the real revolution happened after he left.",2017-02-10,"Some school cafeterias are falling short in their efforts to provide healthy, appealing, affordable food. The reason is more complicated than you might think.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589cf9b3280000c63a997ff8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some seven years ago, British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver traveled to Huntington, West Virginia, on a mission: To save the residents of the so-called “fattest and unhealthiest” U.S. city from themselves.As Oliver’s ABC reality show, “Jamie Oliver’s Food Revolution,” told the story, the residents of Huntington were slowly being killed by the fatty, fried foods dominating the menus of their city’s school cafeterias. And as the cameras rolled, he was going to put a stop to it.Of course, it didn’t work out that way. Students were unhappy with the changes Oliver made to their schools’ cafeteria offerings — which didn’t even meet the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s nutrition standards — and meal participation began to drop. Rhonda McCoy, the county’s schools food-service director, was left to pick up the pieces.What happened next is the subject of a story published this week on The Huffington Post Highline.In the piece, titled “Revenge of the Lunch Lady,” food writer Jane Black, who has been closely following Huntington’s school lunch trouble since 2010, describes how McCoy, depicted as a villain by Oliver’s TV cameras, has succeeded in improving the meals in her county’s school cafeterias — an effort that actually began before Oliver even set foot in Huntington. HuffPost recently spoke with Black about McCoy’s success in West Virginia and what that success says about the challenges — and opportunities — facing school cafeterias nationwide.I know that you have reported on Jamie Oliver and school lunches in Huntington before. What inspired you to jump back into the fray at this particular time?I’ve been watching [the people in Huntington] for years and years and staying in touch with them, and had been so impressed with what they had achieved. It seemed like a story that really needed to be told.I think there are great concerns right now that the Republicans who control both houses of Congress could take an ax to the [school lunch] programs. On the other hand, I’m also hearing that they have a lot of other things on their list, so it’s a question of if and when they will get to it.What did you hope your reporting would highlight for readers?I think this story is a demonstration of how precarious the work that people like Rhonda McCoy and others are doing can be. They’re always at the mercy of this larger and very politicized conversation about what school food should look like. I wanted to demonstrate how the food service directors and the school cooks who are often vilified are working hard in an absolutely crazy system that is a result of years of political debates and disagreements.One thing I hope that people will take away from the story is that we as a country need to decide or make some decisions about how important this is to us. Do we think the government should be responsible for feeding kids or not? In some ways, if we could in some way agree on what we want our kids to be eating, it would be easier for people like Rhonda to do their jobs.Was there anything that came as a surprise to you as you reported this story out?I think a lot of the conversation about school food focuses on the foods that go on the tray and the nutrition guidelines. The debates about whether pizza is healthy or fries are healthy. That’s what I was focused on originally, because that is my background. But over the last couple of years talking to Rhonda, it became clear to me how important the program called CEP [community eligibility provision] was, and how it allowed her to feed more kids and give them better food at the same time.How successful that program is, and how it is still a political target, is really shocking to me. If you look at the data, it has worked brilliantly. It made me realize that I and a lot of people are focused on something that makes a good story and a good headline, but that it may not be the thing making the difference between feeding kids well and not.Your story also seems to me to be an example of how fixing a problem like school lunch can’t be achieved through an outsider like Jamie Oliver trying to force change. Change like this has to come from within.To a certain degree, it does make the case for giving flexibility and freedom to states and communities to do what’s right for them. An example I’ll give is that maybe in Westport, Connecticut, a wealthy, progressive place, having all local food is the most important thing and they should be able to make that decision. In a place like Huntington, local food is important, but what’s more important is making sure hungry children are eating something, whether or not it’s entirely cooked from scratch.As far as Jamie is concerned, I’m a big fan of his and I had no intention of saying that he didn’t do good work here. I think he’s right that it’s his job to raise awareness and spur change. Sure, it would have been nice if he said, “Here’s $10 million, I’ll fund your food system,” but that wouldn’t fix the system anyway. I think he’s very impressive in that he uses his celebrity to push for change on important issues.What do you think is the lesson that can be applied from Huntington to school cafeterias throughout the nation?I think a key takeaway ― sadly, because nobody likes to hear this ― is that there’s no silver bullet. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer. It’s a lot of different things: It’s having a really smart person running a very important program. It’s being able to manage a complex operation. There is no one rule or bill or law we can pass that will fix this.But one thing I think is really key is really prioritizing and valuing the position of food-service director. I think it’s a hard job. For so long, it’s been this underpaid, undervalued position. You have to start thinking about it as a position that really matters. And I think if that happens, you’ll get people really mobilized. Ambitious, smart people in these positions are what it’s really going to take.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Earlier this month, the brand announced its Little Snugglers Nano Preemie Diaper, which was created for extremely preterm babies who weigh less than 2 pounds. The company sought the expertise of nurses working in Neonatal Intensive Care Units and neonatal therapists to create a product that promotes growth while protecting premature babies’ fragile skin.“The diaper features gentle, specially-sized fasteners and a narrow, absorbent pad to provide a flexible fit so that baby can be comfortably positioned in a fetal tuck, with arms and legs close to the body,” the company said in a press release. “The soft, smooth liner and gentle leg gathers offer leakage protection without irritating fragile, underdeveloped skin.”About 10 percent of babies born in the U.S. in 2015 were born preterm, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Earlier this month, the brand announced its Little Snugglers Nano Preemie Diaper, which was created for extremely preterm babies who weigh less than 2 pounds. The company sought the expertise of nurses working in Neonatal Intensive Care Units and neonatal therapists to create a product that promotes growth while protecting premature babies’ fragile skin.“The diaper features gentle, specially-sized fasteners and a narrow, absorbent pad to provide a flexible fit so that baby can be comfortably positioned in a fetal tuck, with arms and legs close to the body,” the company said in a press release. “The soft, smooth liner and gentle leg gathers offer leakage protection without irritating fragile, underdeveloped skin.”About 10 percent of babies born in the U.S. in 2015 were born preterm, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of preterm births decreased from 2007 to 2014, but the CDC found the rate increased slightly from 2014 to 2015. Preterm birth is defined as a baby born before 37 full weeks of pregnancy.

68,ENTERTAINMENT,Alec Baldwin Says What We're All Thinking About His Trump Impression,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alec-baldwin-trump-impression_us_589dc72ae4b094a129ea4003,"""We’re just repeating back what he says.""",2017-02-10,"There's no shortage of material at ""SNL"" this season when it comes to Donald Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589dc9dd290000f616f25971.jpeg?cache=bcnvnU60LI&ops=crop_1143_515_811_915%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Alec Baldwin is all set to host “Saturday Night Live” for a record 17th time this weekend, which means he’s inevitably cueing up his much-talked-about Donald Trump impersonation once more.In the lead-up to the show, Baldwin spoke with his wife, “Extra” correspondent Hilaria Baldwin, about what it’s been like playing the president, who has been none too pleased with Baldwin’s repeated mockery of him. But in Baldwin’s view, what’s strange about it is how little mocking he actually has to do. “[One] thing I find that’s so weird about the stuff we’re doing: We’re just repeating back what he says,” he said. “Doing this is strange, but what is even more strange is [that] this is real.”Baldwin’s view falls in line with many of the show’s viewers, who have noted that the show has simply been able to use the president’s scenes and lines from the week before as the basis for several cold opens.After the third presidential debate, for example, “SNL” writers only had to make sure they included the night’s Trump-isms ― lines like “bad hombres,” “nasty woman” and “nobody has more respect for women than I do” ― and they could be assured a good sketch would come out of it. The bizarre scenes set up by the president at times have also helped, as when the president held a press conference that involved one of his lawyers standing in front of an enormous pile of manila envelopes. The sketch really wrote itself. While Baldwin said he’s enjoyed being a part of the “SNL” family this year, there have been parts of he’s less-than enjoyed. Namely, trying to get inside the president’s head. “Playing him is not a lot of fun,” Baldwin said. “He’s tense, he’s angry, he’s pissed off, and that’s not fun to play.”Regardless, the so-called “Trump bump” has certainly helped “SNL” during Season 42. NBC told The Huffington Post earlier this week that this has been the most-watched season of the show in 22 years. "

But you can’t understand how it feels to suddenly lose your loved ones until it actually happens. In one moment, the foundations of Hassan’s life had been shattered, leaving behind only one inescapable reality: Her future was not in Baghdad. She went to a United Nations office and pleaded with them to help her leave, to send her to a place where opportunities were plentiful and tragedies remote. She went to Lebanon first. Five months later, she was on a plane to the United States, penniless, with no family to help her assimilate and barely any English in her vocabulary. She was 28 years old. She landed first in Michigan, but her final destination was Austin, Texas. She’d heard about Texas ― from the movies, naturally ― and envisioned it filled with cowboy hats and desert. When she landed, a man from the International Organization for Migration met her and drove her to her new apartment. It had a mattress, bed frame, table and refrigerator, but not much else.The man didn’t stay long. It wasn’t his job to be her friend or translator or confidant. That first night in a new country, Hassan was alone and unable to sleep.“I spent all of the night on the balcony just looking,” she said. “Just looking.” Nine years and various chapters of her life have passed since then. Hassan found work and made friends. She fell in and out of love. She traveled the country, developing a soft spot for city life, and recently settled in Phoenix. She now works for the Arizona Allnation Refugee Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps assimilate newly arrived refugees. Some of them remind her of the petrified young woman she was when she first set foot in Austin. Others are more religious or from different parts of the world or have more resources at their disposal.The more recent ones have arrived in a fundamentally different America than the country Hassan confronted on that balcony in January 2008. It is a place more scared and skeptical than back then, more willing to close its doors to those eager to come in.It’s a place where the newly elected president, just days after taking office, signed an executive order to block resettlement of all refugees for 120 days, ban Syrian refugees indefinitely and bar more than 200 million people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for at least 90 days.“It has affected the refugees emotionally,” Hassan said of that ban, which is currently under a temporary restraining order. “A lot of people think they will be sent back home. I get phone calls almost every day from people saying: ‘Hey, are we going to be OK here? I don’t want to be sent back home because if they did, they will kill me there.’”  When politicians and lawyers and cable prognosticators debate Donald Trump’s plan to temporarily suspend immigration, they speak in broad terms about constitutional constraints, political ripple effects and the nuance of counter-terrorism policy. But the real-world impact of the ban is felt in remote corners of America’s towns and cities, by people you won’t see on TV or arguing in front of a judge or casting votes in Congress. Hassan’s office is in a downtrodden strip mall in downtown Phoenix, obscured from the road by JB’s Restaurant, a 1-800-Flowers retail store and an abandoned building. If you don’t know where to look, you’ll have a hard time finding it. There is no sign on the street. The only hint is the Arabic script dotting the windows of storefronts in the strip mall: a “Baghdidi Hookah Lounge and Coffee Shop” that is in the process of being built, a Mediterranean grocery store that is also coming soon, and the words “Refugee Center” written faintly on a nearby glass door. But refugees in Phoenix know where to look. Word of mouth leads them here, as do social media posts about the various services the center provides: language classes, drivers education, legal help and community events. On any given day, Hassan says, dozens of new immigrants come seeking help to pay rent or fill out citizenship or green card forms. Others come to learn English, cramming around plastic tables in a windowless room with badly stained carpet lining the floor. The room is not the most conducive to learning, but it’s what they have. Many, however, come just to talk with people who can empathize. In recent weeks, those talks have grown darker and more panicked. People wonder whether the current ban is just a starting point, whether their lives will soon be uprooted, whether they made a horrible mistake in coming to America.Florida Al Amery teaches citizenship classes in that makeshift classroom. She says she got a legal degree in Iraq and worked with a U.S. company as an adviser. In 2006, her son was kidnapped. She suspected it was because of her ties to the American company. She paid a $30,000 ransom and sent him to Jordan, joining him there later after an envelope appeared in her car warning her she had to leave Iraq within three days. By 2008, Amery had made her way to Phoenix. Now 60, she jokes that she chose the city because its climate is about as close an approximation to Baghdad as one could find in the United States. In reality, her sister was already here. That made her assimilation easier, but it wasn’t without its psychological toll. She left behind her legal career, figuring it would be too hard to earn another degree at that point in her life. There is a sense of longing in how she discusses her old life too ― the friends left behind and those no longer alive.She’s also now haunted by the notion that she’s helping usher the students in her citizenship classes into an unwelcoming world. “I am a teacher of citizenship,” she said. “And I am thinking of stopping because I can’t teach students or clients to follow the Constitution when the president breaks the Constitution.” Over the past decade, Arizona has become, somewhat unexpectedly, a popular landing place for refugees. According to state data, 4,138 refugees settled in the state from the fall of 2014 through the fall of 2015. The subsequent year, more Syrian refugees came to Arizona than all but three other states. And, according to the State Department, in the past four months, another 1,539 refugees from around the globe have arrived there ― including 223 from Iraq, 208 from Syria, 24 from Iran, 12 from Sudan and 250 from Somalia (all states on Trump’s banned list). Only six states have welcomed more refugees in that time period. There are various theories about why Arizona is such a magnet for refugees ― the hot climate being one, the cheap real estate being another. None of those theories involves the generosity of the state’s politicians. Arizona is a haven for anti-immigrant political sentiment. Lawmakers there have called for a suspension of refugee resettlement programs, while some have gone so far as to propose fining charities $1,000 a day for each refugee they help resettle. Catholic Charities of Arizona, an organization that helps with resettlement in the state, declined to put me in touch with a refugee it had helped, citing the possibility that the person could become a target in the current political climate.This, among other things, has caused the refugees already settled in Arizona to wonder just how public they should be in pushing back on Trump’s executive order, or whether it is worth fighting at all.Mustafa, the proprietor of Moonlight, an Iraqi restaurant down the road from the refugee center, is one of those torn by the politics. From the outside, his restaurant doesn’t look like much, tucked away as in a small storefront in another nondescript strip mall. But inside, he has nobly tried to conjure up scenes of old Baghdad. Arabic music videos play on the TV, and the walls are covered in paintings of Arab street murals. Middle Eastern artifacts and antique plates are scattered throughout. Unlit lamps hang from the ceiling, and trays of glass teacups and kettles sit on a table in the entryway. Mustafa, who declined to give his last name, opened Moonlight when he came to Phoenix in 2014. Like Hassan, he left behind tragedy in Iraq. He and a brother both worked as interpreters for the U.S. Army. When his brother was murdered for that work, Mustafa fled, fearing he was next. A green card holder, he now spends his days cooking up shawarma, lamb shanks and kebabs, as well as giant platters of fresh cut vegetables, baba ghanoush and oily hummus.The restaurant has become a hub for fellow Iraqis and, at least on a recent Wednesday, some non-Middle Easterners too. “It’s good,” he said of business. “When you start a new life, everything is new here. We have nice people here.” Gregarious and playful, Mustafa took the tape recorder from my hand and placed it directly under his mouth to make sure his every word was properly recorded. But when I pointed out he could still be stuck in Iraq had Trump’s travel ban been in place three years ago, he grew recalcitrant and handed the recorder back. He said he supported the ban, but refused to elaborate. “I don’t have time now,” he said, darting back to his kitchen. Hassan, who sat nearby, couldn’t quite explain why Mustafa felt this way, other than to note that every refugee has his or her own stories, fears, hopes and experiences. Some are content with their corner of a Phoenix strip mall. Others fret over the possibility that their new lives might be ripped away from them. Still others feel that the only way to find stability is by showing those around them that they’re human, too. Hassan is firmly in the latter category. She is a whirlwind of activity and adopted American tastes. She wrote an ebook on healthy living, goes to rock concerts ― Nine Inch Nails is a favorite ― and dreams of one day working at a fashion magazine in New York City. She is also proudly Muslim ― though not particularly observant ― and operates under the belief ― naive, perhaps ― that the more the rest of America sees people like her, the harder it will be for them to ban people like her.“I’m lucky,” she said, an odd description for someone who’s lost so much. “Some people, when they lose family they will end up with mental issues or homeless or doing bad things. With me, that made me stronger. It made me appreciate life.”Want more updates from Sam Stein? Sign up for his newsletter, Spam Stein, here.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

71,TASTE,11 Seemingly Good-For-You Foods That Aren't As Healthy As You Think,Julie R. Thomson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/not-so-healthy-foods_us_589c757ee4b04061313bc873,Sugar shows up in the most surprising places.,2017-02-10,This big bowl of granola is too much to eat in one sitting.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589c85232900002100f2558c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The concept of eating healthy is a simple one: eat lots whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and stay clear of sweets. But successfully making that happen these days ― when so much of our food is packaged ― is a lot trickier than you might expect. Many go-to health food options are actually not as good for you as they seem. Are you being fooled by some?Chances are, there are one or two items in the list below that are derailing your healthy-eating efforts. Check out what they might be and steer clear. 1. Granola: A serving size of granola is a lot smaller than you think. If you’re filling a cereal bowl of the stuff with milk, chances are you’re taking in a lot more sugar than you want. Granola is better eaten sprinkled on top of yogurt than used in place of cereal. If you don’t want to give up your beloved granola entirely, try making your own. Homemade is better than store-bought because you know what ingredients are being put into it. Try a couple of these recipes, and you’ll soon be converted.2. Agave: Whether or not agave is healthy is up for debate. But at the end of the day, it’s still added sugar to your diet. And too much sugar in any form is not recommended.3. Bran muffins: We know it sounds healthy. What could be so bad about a food with bran in it? Sadly, the truth is that a muffin is still a muffin no matter what ingredients have been added to it. And that means it’s basically a cupcake with no frosting on it ― in other words, its loaded with added sugar and fat. Plus, most bran muffins contain more wheat flour than actual bran. The best way to make sure that your muffin is actually made with whole grains is to make it yourself. 4. Juice cleanses: Think about it ― those store-bought juice cleanses mean you’re drinking a lot of juice. It’s better to eat the fruit or vegetable rather than a juiced version of it because you lose the fiber when you juice. Actually, most healthy eating sources will tell you to steer clear of juice altogether. So-called “detox” juices offer more nutrition than your run-of-the-mill store-bought juice, but drinking them in place of a meal means you’re missing out on protein and taking in way too much sugar.5. Dried fruit: Yes, eating dried fruit is probably a healthier choice than the cookie you actually wish you were eating. But you should know that dried fruit is still a sugary treat. The sugar that’s usually added to dried fruit make it more like candy than fruit at all. But not all store-bought dried fruit has added sugar, just be sure to check the label and choose wisely.6. Flavored yogurt: They flavor it with sugar. Lots of it, too. Sure, yogurt is a good choice, but you’ve got to eat it plain (or with fresh fruit on top). 7. Energy and protein bars: These options sound healthy, but most of them are basically just candy bars. Many are loaded with sugar and have more calories than you’d expect. Consider making your own, then you’ll know exactly what’s in them. 8. Frozen yogurt: Just eat the ice cream. Sure, frozen yogurt has less saturated fat than ice cream, but once you load it up with toppings that are sugar and fat-loaded it can often times wind up as unhealthy a choice as ice cream.9. Peanut butter (and other nut butters): These are a healthy, protein-rich option when eaten in moderation, but only if you buy natural varieties that have no more than two ingredients. Some nut butters ― like the reduced fat kind ― have sugar added in the form of high fructose corn syrup, making this seemingly “smart” snack option not so smart after all.10. Smoothies: Smoothies aren’t necessarily bad for you if made with fresh fruits and vegetables. But be careful of serving size and where you get one. Pre-made smoothies and store-bought ones can be loaded with sugar and calories. It’s safer to just make your own.11. Canned soups: Soup is often a healthy meal choice, but when it’s canned it comes with more sodium than is good for you. Excess sodium can make you feel bloated and sluggish. Soup is easy to make; too easy, actually, to not go the homemade route. "

Bran muffins: We know it sounds healthy. What could be so bad about a food with bran in it? Sadly, the truth is that a muffin is still a muffin no matter what ingredients have been added to it. And that means it’s basically a cupcake with no frosting on it ― in other words, its loaded with added sugar and fat. Plus, most bran muffins contain more wheat flour than actual bran. The best way to make sure that your muffin is actually made with whole grains is to make it yourself. 4. Juice cleanses: Think about it ― those store-bought juice cleanses mean you’re drinking a lot of juice. It’s better to eat the fruit or vegetable rather than a juiced version of it because you lose the fiber when you juice. Actually, most healthy eating sources will tell you to steer clear of juice altogether. So-called “detox” juices offer more nutrition than your run-of-the-mill store-bought juice, but drinking them in place of a meal means you’re missing out on protein and taking in way too much sugar.5. Dried fruit: Yes, eating dried fruit is probably a healthier choice than the cookie you actually wish you were eating. But you should know that dried fruit is still a sugary treat. The sugar that’s usually added to dried fruit make it more like candy than fruit at all. But not all store-bought dried fruit has added sugar, just be sure to check the label and choose wisely.6. Flavored yogurt: They flavor it with sugar. Lots of it, too. Sure, yogurt is a good choice, but you’ve got to eat it plain (or with fresh fruit on top). 7. Energy and protein bars: These options sound healthy, but most of them are basically just candy bars. Many are loaded with sugar and have more calories than you’d expect. Consider making your own, then you’ll know exactly what’s in them. 8. Frozen yogurt: Just eat the ice cream. Sure, frozen yogurt has less saturated fat than ice cream, but once you load it up with toppings that are sugar and fat-loaded it can often times wind up as unhealthy a choice as ice cream.9. Peanut butter (and other nut butters): These are a healthy, protein-rich option when eaten in moderation, but only if you buy natural varieties that have no more than two ingredients. Some nut butters ― like the reduced fat kind ― have sugar added in the form of high fructose corn syrup, making this seemingly “smart” snack option not so smart after all.10. Smoothies: Smoothies aren’t necessarily bad for you if made with fresh fruits and vegetables. But be careful of serving size and where you get one. Pre-made smoothies and store-bought ones can be loaded with sugar and calories. It’s safer to just make your own.11. Canned soups: Soup is often a healthy meal choice, but when it’s canned it comes with more sodium than is good for you. Excess sodium can make you feel bloated and sluggish. Soup is easy to make; too easy, actually, to not go the homemade route. "

76,THE WORLDPOST,Health Clinics Already Hit By ‘Catastrophic’ Global Gag Rule,"Hannah McNeish, Women & Girls Hub",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-clinics-global-gag-rule_us_589cc021e4b04061313c3c6e,The story of one family planning clinic in Nairobi shows how President Trump’s decision to cut U.S. funding to any organization,2017-02-09,"Obstetrician and gynaecologist Carolyne Nduhiu speaks to a new mother at the Marie Stopes clinic in Eastleigh, one of Nairobi's poorest neighborhoods.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589cc0d525000032080b8029.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The story of one family planning clinic in Nairobi shows how President Trump’s decision to cut U.S. funding to any organization that so much as discusses abortion with its patients could threaten everything from HIV prevention to GBV counseling.NAIROBI – As the U.S. presidential election campaign was unfolding on the other side of the world, one of the many markets selling cheap suitcases and clothing in the Eastleigh neighborhood of Little Somalia, in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, decided to rebrand itself The Donald Trump Business Centre.Now, days into its namesake’s presidency, the aspirational marketplace finds itself next to a health clinic that will lose vital funding as a result of a recent Trump policy on family planning. Due to the reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy – or the Global Gag Rule – which cuts U.S. aid funding to charities that provide, support or discuss abortion, the Marie Stopes International (MSI) Eastleigh clinic can no longer accept the U.S. government money it was going to use to extend its free contraceptive services to thousands of women in rural areas.“What happens now, with all the pregnant women? I think it’s going to be catastrophic,” says Carolyne Nduhiu, an obstetrician the MSI Eastleigh clinic.In a country where access to contraceptives is low but the need is high, Nduhiu knows that women who want to terminate their pregnancies will do so by any means, usually because they can’t afford to care for another child. As a former obstetrician who has worked at Nairobi’s largest hospitals, she has seen women, and especially girls, arrive butchered by backstreet abortions and then leave in body bags.“I saw a young girl, a 16-year-old, who came in with her intestines hanging out of her vagina,” says Nduhiu. The girl died before surgeons could save her. Perforations to the uterus and the accidental extraction of intestines are not uncommon occurrences with abortions performed by untrained personnel, says Nduhiu, and doctors often see women with severe bleeding, trauma and infections after botched attempts to terminate a pregnancy. Unsafe abortion is a leading cause of maternal death in Kenya.Nduhiu now performs abortions for MSI within the context of Kenyan law, which allows for the procedure if the woman’s life or health is at risk – other donors, mainly from Europe, will continue to fund MSI’s abortion services. But because of the gag rule, MSI operations in Kenya will lose out on a $3 million deal the organization was about to sign with USAID to provide contraceptives to around 75,000 more women in rural areas and to train public healthcare workers on how to provide longer-term family planning methods.Other organizations that rely heavily on U.S. funding – which last year totalled over $600 million for international family planning and reproductive health services – will have to choose between shutting up about abortion or shutting down some of their other aid-funded programs.The last time the Global Gag Rule was enacted, in 2001, the loss of U.S. funding was devastating to many family planning programs around the world. According to the Guttmacher Institute, organizations in Kenya that were providing vital healthcare to impoverished communities were forced to cut some of their activities and community-outreach programs, while government-run clinics – which were exempt from the policy – “were never able to pick up the slack nor regain the trust of women turned away by the NGOs.” A 2014 report shows how reliant Kenya is on U.S. donors: USAID’s budget for health and HIV/AIDS in the country was equal to half of the Ministry of Health’s entire budget.“If we’re not able to offer a safe option, we’ll have the backstreet abortions mushrooming, and we’ll have complications. I’m foreseeing a lot of mortality and morbidity for women,” says Nduhiu.In Nairobi’s slums, “quacks” running private clinics or doing home visits charge between $10 and $30 to terminate pregnancies that often send their patients to hospital requiring urgent treatment or surgery, including, sometimes, hysterectomies.“A study in 2012 showed that nearly half a million induced abortions occurred in Kenya and about 75 percent of these cases were unsafe abortions,” says Chimaraoke Izugbara, an expert at the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC).According to Dana Tilson, MSI Kenya’s country director, more than 1,200 women die every year in Kenya because of complications due to unsafe abortion. “That’s the equivalent of a busload of women every day, driving off a cliff,” she says.At the MSI Eastleigh clinic, one patient, a single mother with one baby, spoke about why she had come to the clinic to get the drug misoprostol to induce abortion.“Otherwise, I’d be dying,” if forced to resort to a backstreet abortion, she says. “They [women] end up with their internal organs damaged and they die due to excess bleeding.”In another room, a woman seeking contraceptive care spoke about two women she knew who died after botched abortions.First introduced in 1984 under President Ronald Reagan, the Mexico City Policy returned under George W. Bush. According to the World Health Organization, over the course of the Bush presidency, the abortion rate in 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa increased from 10.4 per 10,000 woman–years (the number of reproductive years in the life of a sexually active woman) to 14.5 per 10,000 woman–years.Global health experts fear the reinstatement of the Gag Rule could undo gains made in other healthcare sectors, since clinics and family planning organizations often use their abortion services as a gateway to providing other treatments such as HIV/Aids prevention and treatment.“It’s no longer a question of just providing a safe termination of pregnancies,” says Izugbara of the APHRC. “We’ve got lots of things that go together with those services, like HIV prevention, GBV prevention, even issues around family planning like childcare and child nutrition counseling.”MSI obstetrician Nduhiu shakes her head as she thinks about going back to the way it was eight years ago, when unsafe abortion “was rampant.” She says she has a message for Donald Trump.“Look beyond America. I think I would say that he should look beyond his nose,” she says. “In Africa, Kenya, women will suffer. And there will be blood on his hands.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589ba06c2900002200f25429.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A growing share of the public disapproves of President Donald Trump’s handling of his job, new surveys show.There’s a fair amount of discrepancy between individual pollsters on where Trump’s job-approval numbers stand, although a majority give him negative ratings. A few weeks into Trump’s presidency, however, there’s enough data to look at how each of those pollsters think Trump’s ratings have changed since he took office.The chart below compares the latest polls, as of Wednesday afternoon, with the earliest from eight pollsters who’ve released at least two surveys on Trump’s job performance since his inauguration.There’s a substantial amount of variance here, as well, for potential reasons that may range from methodology to when each poll was conducted. But most pollsters, regardless of where they think Trump started, now find his net approval rating ― the difference between his approval and disapproval numbers ― to be at least somewhat lower than when he became president.What’s also notable is where the biggest change comes from in most of these polls.On average, the percentage of people who say they approve of Trump’s performance remains relatively stable ― a finding that fits with Republicans’ overall enthusiasm for most of the president’s actions. While Rasmussen, Gallup and SurveyMonkey find Trump’s approval down by 2 points to 4 points ― within the range of normal variance ― YouGov/Economist polling shows it unchanged, and five other pollsters find his approval has risen from 1 point to 6 points.But Trump’s overall ratings seem to be falling because some people who started off with a neutral impression on Inauguration Day have since soured on the president. Each of the eight surveys shows disapproval increasing, with the change ranging from 2 points to 13 points.As The Washington Post’s Philip Bump notes, this phenomenon isn’t unique to Trump. Former President Barack Obama also rapidly lost support in his first few weeks as president, although he started from a substantially more comfortable position. Trump’s average net job approval currently stands at around -5 or -6. Obama’s was +40 in February 2009.Trump’s ratings are also significantly more polarized than Obama’s were at this point in his presidency. On average, polls find that 87 percent of Democrats, but just 10 percent of Republicans, disapprove of Trump’s job performance. "

There was also Duke’s Brandon Ingram ― unfairly compared to Kevin Durant ― and the Lakers’ choice with the second pick. Naturally, Kentucky was actively involved in this process, too. In fact, there were five freshmen drafted in the lottery and 10 in the first round last year.The 2017 freshmen class is once again brimming with potential, perhaps even more than last year. Duke, for example, has a wealth of talent: Power forward Harry Giles, while small forward Jayson Tatum and combo guard Frank Jackson have also flashed tremendous ability, albeit not in consistent doses.John Calipari’s quartet of ESPN Top 100 recruits in Lexington isn’t too shabby either. Malik Monk stole all the headlines when he dropped a school-record 47 points ― including the eventual game-winning triple ― against highly touted North Carolina in Las Vegas. But his backcourt mate, De’Aaron Fox, is a lightning quick point guard with splendid creative abilities and exceptional on-ball defensive characteristics.Maybe the best freshman of all, however, is Washington’s Markelle Fultz, an enticing playmaker with few flaws. The 6-foot-4 guard hailing from the basketball-rich Washington, D.C., area averages over 23 points per game, which ranks sixth in the country. And he could very well be the No. 1 pick in June, should he turn pro.With that in mind, here are my top 25 freshmen ― not ranked in order ― for this college hoops season.All stats are through Feb. 8.

Kahlo is but one in a long line of artists who have used their bodies and their work as sites to exaggerate, manipulate and topple conventional associations of masculinity and femininity. An exhibition currently on view at Creative Growth, titled “Gender Bender,” features contemporary artists who complicate the gender binary through observation, creativity and play ― both on and off the canvas. Creative Growth is a gallery in Oakland, California, that represents adult artists with developmental disabilities. The gallery is attached to a studio where approximately 160 artists make work alongside a team of staff and volunteers. Not all of the artists have made work before coming to Creative Growth, but once inside the space, they are considered working contemporary artists ― no disclaimers or caveats ― and are encouraged to pursue whatever creative directions they desire.The space was established in 1974 by artist and educator Florence Ludins-Katz and her husband Elias Katz, a psychologist. Appalled by the rapid closure of psychiatric hospitals in California during Gov. Ronald Reagan’s tenure, they opened a space in their garage for former state-hospital patients to make art. In a 1990 book recounting their experience, they explain: “Even though a human being may be handicapped or disabled, this does not change his need to fulfill himself to the greatest of his capacity.’’Over the past 40 plus years, Creative Growth has earned acclaim not only for its philanthropic mission, but for the exceptional caliber of work its artists consistently produce. One of the most renowned in the gallery’s history is Judith Scott, a woman with Down syndrome and deafness who never learned to speak. She learned to communicate while at Creative Growth in 1987 through weaving wild fiber cocoons that wrapped household objects in their tentacle-like grasp. The sculptures have since been shown around the world, including at the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the American Folk Art Museum. Creative Growth holds approximately seven exhibitions a year, thematically organized around work the artists are already creating. “Our exhibitions result from a dialogue with the artists’ work,” Jessica Daniel, Creative Growth’s community development manager told The Huffington Post. The current exhibition, exploring the ways gender can be expressed and unsettled, is no exception. “We review work from the studio almost daily and it’s the work itself that inspires the exhibitions,” Daniel said. “We follow the artists’ leads. In fact, a huge component of the Creative Growth process is to never direct the artists, but allow them to discover their own voice, point of view and creative practice.”The current political climate ― formed in part by policies espoused by President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch that threaten the freedom and equality of LGBTQ Americans ― made the topic all the more necessary. “It felt timely and important to engage in the larger conversations of LGBTQ rights,” Daniel said, “especially as the Creative Growth community intersects so often with the LGBTQ community.” Two Creative Growth artists in particular often return to the imagery of gender in flux.One is Aurie Ramirez, a Filipino artist whose watercolors depict androgynous, Victorian-era, punk-rock royalty, floating atop clouds and drowning in snacks. Her paintings are instantly identifiable in that they depict a recurring visual fantasy, where rocker queens don fishnet tights, garter belts and harlequin face paint, and their clock-faced compatriots dress in snappy, pinstriped suits. Ramirez, born in 1962, was diagnosed with autism and has difficulty communicating through speech. When she began working at Creative Growth, she fostered obsessions with the band Kiss and the Addams Family, traces of which are sprinkled throughout her images. Ramirez enacts her interest in makeup, masks and performative identities off the canvas as well. She often sports dramatic makeup, with shapes painted Bowie-style across her face. Casey Byrnes also helped shape the show with his work. He makes ceramic sculptures of the male nude with various body parts stretched out or shrunken. The figures literally treat the human body like a clay sculpture, visualizing just how easy it is to render certain parts alien, absurd and unrecognizable. Byrnes, like Ramirez, explores the slippery terrain between genders in his daily life, as well. The artist often wears dresses for the annual Creative Growth fashion show fundraiser. “He’s creating a gorgeous woven panel gown that he will wear on the runway this year,” Daniel said. The remainder of the featured artists employ equally distinct and playful languages to address the more uncanny manifestations of gender expression. In Carrie Oyama’s fragile watercolor-and-ink paintings, drawn with her non-dominant hand, the lines that separate human forms wiggle and shift, a testament to the unfixed nature of being in a body. “Oyama’s delicate figures certainly relate to her awareness of the human body,” gallery associate Chloe Bensahel added, “having been a dancer in New York in the 1970s.” Artist Terri Bowden lives with legal blindness, and befriended many people with albinism who also have sight impairments. In her work, Bowden often saps both pop culture icons and wild animals of their usual hair and skin tones, imagining what other creatures would look like if they, too, had albinism. In her featured piece, Bowden alters Michael Jackson, endowing him with white tresses and ‘80s-style makeup, making the King of Pop resemble a relative of Debbie Harry. In “Gender Bender,” the artists of Creative Growth freely express their creative visions and ornate fantasies in a language uniquely theirs. In the safe space of the art center, they can make what they want to make and, more importantly, be who they want to be. “Creative Growth Art Center is a place where these artists can be themselves and fully have a voice of their own, outside of whatever norms exist beyond these walls,” Bensahel said. “The artists are given the space to investigate and work with whatever fascinates them, and even if it isn’t always explicit, the work is often a result of their direct experience.”The timely show is one amongst a string of recent and upcoming exhibitions similarly grappling with questions of gender, sexuality and identity in the modern world. For Daniel, the significance is clear. “It speaks, we hope, to how artists with disabilities are also just simply artists and individuals in the world.”“Gender Bender” is on view until Feb. 24 at Creative Growth in Oakland, California.

Long tweeted Thursday morning that he would not make the trip, in response to a New York Daily News column that urged him to skip it.Later Thursday afternoon, Blount told “The Rich Eisen Show” that he too would skip the visit.“I just don’t feel welcome into that house,” Blount said. “I’m just gonna leave it at that.”Bennett and McCourty also said Trump was the reason they won’t visit the White House with their teammates. Hightower, who visited the White House after winning a national championship at Alabama but skipped the Patriots visit in 2015 ― when Barack Obama was still president ― said his decision had nothing to do with politics, but that he had “been there, done that.” Long didn’t give a reason for his decision and didn’t respond to an interview request made through the Patriots.Patriots quarterback Tom Brady previously skipped the team’s trip to the White House in 2015. Brady cited a family commitment as his reason for missing the ceremony. The Boston Herald, however, reported that Brady was unhappy with White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who had cracked a joke about the quarterback’s public response to the Deflategate scandal.Other players could still decide against visiting the White House. Running back James White, for instance, was noncommittal on Wednesday, when he told radio host Alex Marvez that he would “wait till the time comes and decide then.” "

But He Has Good Reason To Think Twice About Sharing It.,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-email-list_us_589c9862e4b0c1284f2b0285,Sanders has his hands on a coveted form of political currency.,2017-02-09,"Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), left, enjoys the endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in his bid to head the Democratic National Committee.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589c9c6925000034080b7f6f.jpeg?cache=T27j0Usrlm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In the course of his unexpectedly popular run for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) amassed a huge network of supporters ― along with their email addresses and other personal information. Now Democrats are gunning for access to that list, which is estimated to include millions of people.An email list may sound like an arcane item to become the focus of a battle for the party’s future. But access to a large list of enthusiastic liberals would allow candidates and campaigns to mobilize thousands of activists and donors at a moment’s notice. In short, the “list” has become a coveted form of political currency in the digital era.The question for Sanders is whether he should share his data, and if so, how he should go about doing it, according to experts in the list-building systems that have become a cornerstone of contemporary political organizing.If the goal is for Sanders to provide the party greater access to his base, the most logical entity with which to share his list is the Democratic National Committee, the party’s main national organ. And right now the DNC is in the midst of a seven-way competition between the major candidates who would like to become its next chair.The Sanders campaign’s email list is now housed at Our Revolution, a political action committee Sanders set up to continue the work of his presidential campaign. And Shannon Jackson, Our Revolution’s executive director, said he doesn’t want to just hand that list over to the Democratic National Committee, since Our Revolution is committed to remaining independent from the party. For his part, Sanders told The Washington Post that he would “cross that bridge” when the DNC race is settled.Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who is Sanders’ preferred candidate to chair the DNC and the owner of his own large email list, suggested Sanders should grant party leadership access to the list. If elected chair, Ellison would “absolutely” ask the Vermont senator to share his powerful campaign list, Ellison said at a HuffPost-sponsored DNC candidate debate on Jan. 18.Our Revolution’s Jackson declined to comment on Ellison’s statement, but reiterated that his organization supports Ellison’s candidacy. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement that “there has been no discussion with the DNC about use of the list.”Some diehard Sanders backers aren’t so into the idea. “If they wanted the Democratic Party to have their information, they would have given it to them by now,” one such fan wrote in a scathing criticism of Ellison’s remarks. List sharing always poses risks. And in this case, the matter is especially sensitive.Many Sanders supporters are still angry with the DNC for what they saw as unfair intervention on behalf of Hillary Clinton in the primary. Those supporters would likely only support the most progressive political candidates and causes, and would not want to hear from the DNC as it tries to raise money or turn out activists for anything that doesn’t meet their standards.Jackson said Our Revolution has already had to reassure many active members that it is not sharing data or otherwise colluding with the DNC. People have contacted the organization with accusations of unwanted collaboration on several occasions, typically when Our Revolution has mobilized members to take action for Ellison or other candidates it has endorsed in battles for control of local Democratic parties, he said.There is not a particularly long tradition of individual candidates with large email lists sharing them with the party. Organizing for America, a 501(c)(4) former President Barack Obama created out of his 2008 presidential campaign, and its post-2012 successor, Organizing for Action, inherited the Obama campaign’s successful email list. OFA only shared the list, which numbers in the millions, with the DNC in August 2015.Once the 2016 Democratic primary ended, top Democrats ― including former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) ― began talking to Sanders about sharing his list or its data with Clinton’s campaign or the DNC. Speculation about the fate of Sanders’ list has only escalated since November, with some more establishment-friendly Democrats seemingly hoping that putting Ellison in charge of the DNC would ensure access to Sanders’ base.One Democratic operative, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak on the matter, said this is “uncharted territory” in many ways: “Bernie was an independent who became a Democrat and built a unique campaign that we haven’t seen in a very long time.”Legally, political organizations or candidates can sell or donate their email lists. It’s how you do it that presents the challenge. Donating a list is generally called a “list swap”; an organization can trade lists with a like-minded candidate or organization. They can also just sell their list to another organization, which can bring in a lot of money if the list is large or particularly useful. In each example, the organizations decide whether to allow list members to opt in to the new list, or directly add their emails and then let them opt out.Direct adding email addresses and then forcing people to opt out comes with a higher risk of an organization’s emails ending up in a spam folder. Internet service providers try to help their customers by sniffing out unwanted email, thereby creating a high barrier to entry for unwanted political solicitations.“Signing people up for email lists without telling them is a very typical way to get marked as spam,” said Emily Schwartz, vice president of organizing at NationBuilder, a nonpartisan digital firm that specializes in political campaigns.Jason Rosenbaum, a veteran progressive digital guru and technology director for the Action Network, a nonprofit that builds online organizing tools, recalled excessive spam rates dooming campaigns he has worked on.“I have seen programs go to zero because they have screwed up with this kind of stuff,” he said.Other risks include the prospect of activists disengaging or unsubscribing from an email list, which could lead to attrition ― for both the DNC and the original Our Revolution list.If Our Revolution chooses to share its list with the DNC, there are ways for the group to leverage its following to benefit the Democratic Party without compromising the trust it enjoys with its members, said Rosenbaum, who previously led online campaigns for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Health Care for America Now.One way to do that is to start with joint actions between the two organizations ― inviting list members to sign a petition, donate money or mobilize around a cause. That would make it abundantly clear to list members that their contact information is being shared with a new organization, rather than forcing it on them.One can envision Our Revolution asking its list members to join an action against Republican cuts to Planned Parenthood funding or attempts to privatize Medicare, for instance. The challenge, however, is ensuring that the DNC does not try to mobilize Our Revolution list members for a candidate or cause they don’t like.The best insurance against that kind of a mistake ― and the inevitable blowback ― is the election of a DNC chair that progressives trust, Rosenbaum suggested.“The Sanders folks ― though I think they overstate their case ― they do have a point about the corruption in the DNC around the primary process,” he said. “If we see a new DNC chair who takes the party in a new direction and is able to make a clean break with the past there in a way that Democratic activists understand, then maybe this type of sharing makes a lot of sense.”But Nomiki Konst, a former Sanders campaign surrogate who now works for The Young Turks, a progressive YouTube network, warned Democrats against viewing an email list as a panacea for the party’s shortcomings.“The Democratic Party has to reinvent itself. No Bernie list, no Keith Ellison list, is going to solve that problem,” she said. “The Democratic Party has raised more money than ever, spent more money than ever, and lost more than ever.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

The engine on her black Hummer was still running and bags of clothes were scattered near the bin. A coroner’s report said she died from blunt force trauma and hypothermia. Her injuries included a broken arm and wrist.She was reaching into the bin when the step ladder she was standing on collapsed, according to PennLive.com. Permar’s son told WNEP that she always wanted to help the less fortunate and constantly donated to those clothing bins.But investigators believe Permar was actually taking items from the bin ― and it may not have been the first time.“She was fishing bags out and the ladder she was standing on gave way, and she couldn’t get her hand loose,” Mount Carmel Police Chief Brian Hollenbush told Philly.com.Back in November, police received a call about a woman in a black Hummer who was taking items from the bin, according to the New York Daily News.Hollenbush said he knew Permar and told the Associated Press she was a very nice woman. He admits being surprised when he heard she may have removed items from clothing bin.“It wasn’t something that I would expect to be seeing,” he said, according to the Associated Press.Funeral services for Permar are scheduled for Friday.Permar’s family did not respond to HuffPost about the allegations she was taking donated items from the bin."

Now, they’ve made a comeback, Parks Canada announced Monday.Video captured the historic homecoming. Helicopters held aloft shipping containers to lower them into a remote valley in Banff on Feb. 1. The doors were opened and the 16 bison thundered out, running fast through the snow.“This is a great day for Banff National Park. It’s a great day for Canada and frankly, it’s one of the great days for wildlife conservation in the history of North America,” Canadian conservationist Harvey Locke told CBC.Parks Canada said the reintroduction of wild bison to Banff was meticulously planned.Authorities first selected the animals — most of them pregnant 2-year-olds — at Canada’s Elk Island National Park. They then quarantined the bison and screened them for disease.In late January, the bison were loaded into shipping containers, modified specially to accommodate the animals. They were first transported by truck to a ranch near Banff before helicopters hoisted them into an enclosed pasture in the park itself.The bison will be kept in the pasture for 16 months and will be closely monitored, Parks Canada said. The animals are expected to be released to roam freely in the park in the summer of 2018.The reintroduction effort was part of a five-year pilot project to restore wild bison in Banff. Parks Canada called the project a “historic and cultural triumph.”“The restoration of bison to Banff will return a keystone species to the landscape, foster cultural reconnection, inspire discovery, and provide stewardship and learning opportunities,” the agency said on its website. “In the long-term, by re-establishing a new wild population within its historical range in Banff National Park, this will be a key contribution to national and international bison conservation efforts.”The American bison, North America’s largest mammal, had once been abundant across the continent.Just 200 years ago, there were an estimated 30 to 60 million of them in the wild from Mexico to northern Canada.But hunting in the 19th century drove the animal to the precipice of extinction.In Canada, the plains bison ― one of two American bison subspecies ― became extinct in the wild in the 1880s.The other subspecies, the wood bison, came dangerously close to also being wiped out. The extinction crisis prompted the Canadian government, together with ranchers and conservationists, to implement various measures in an attempt to save the country’s wild bison. They introduced protective regulations including enacting hunting restrictions and establishing reintroduction programs like the recent Banff effort.In 1906, a Montana rancher named Michel Pablo sold his sizeable plains bison herd to the Canadian government. The following year, his 400 or so bison were transported by rail to newly established Elk Island National Park. Most of the plains bison in Canada today are descendants of Pablo’s herd. Canada is now home to about 2,200 plains bison (the Banff animals are plains bison) and about 11,000 wood bison in the wild. according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. These numbers do not include domestic or commercial herds, which have far larger numbers. Both subspecies are still considered threatened in the wild in Canada. One of their greatest threats is insufficient population size to sustain long-term genetic integrity, the WCS said. Loss of habitat and disease are also areas of concern. "

Now, they’ve made a comeback, Parks Canada announced Monday.Video captured the historic homecoming. Helicopters held aloft shipping containers to lower them into a remote valley in Banff on Feb. 1. The doors were opened and the 16 bison thundered out, running fast through the snow.“This is a great day for Banff National Park. It’s a great day for Canada and frankly, it’s one of the great days for wildlife conservation in the history of North America,” Canadian conservationist Harvey Locke told CBC.Parks Canada said the reintroduction of wild bison to Banff was meticulously planned.Authorities first selected the animals — most of them pregnant 2-year-olds — at Canada’s Elk Island National Park. They then quarantined the bison and screened them for disease.In late January, the bison were loaded into shipping containers, modified specially to accommodate the animals.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589501e9280000f314996c9c.jpeg?cache=TN14ttTWck&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hot on the heels of his off-Broadway triumph, Drew Droege will try a queer cult classic on for size. The actor-comedian returns to the stage Friday as the star of Charles Busch’s 1999 comedy, “Die, Mommie, Die!,” at the Celebration Theatre in Los Angeles. Billed as a “Greek tragedy on acid” and a campy tribute to midcentury Hollywood melodramas, “Die, Mommie, Die!” follows Angela Arden (Droege), an aging Hollywood star who murders her husband and attempts to find happiness in the arms of a young lover. As is the case with most of Busch’s satirical work, however, not everything is what it seems, and gender-bending, bed-hopping and pill-popping abound. Droege, who was last seen in the hit solo comedy “Bright Colors and Bold Patterns,” in New York and Los Angeles, told The Huffington Post that the “batshit crazy” play tackles issues like homophobia and ageism in Hollywood that still feel relevant today. Best known for his viral YouTube impersonations of actress Chloë Sevigny, Droege said he felt an instant kinship with Busch, citing the actor, playwright and drag icon as a personal influence. “Before ever seeing him perform, I felt like I knew him,” he said. “I, too, have always identified with leading ladies in films, but have never considered myself a drag queen... He also created his own career instead of waiting for someone else to figure out what to do with him, which certainly inspired me to do the same.”In an effort to put his own stamp on the character of Angela Arden, however, Droege has avoided watching the 2003 film version of “Die, Mommie, Die!,” in which Busch starred alongside Natasha Lyonne and “Beverly Hills, 92010” hunk Jason Priestley. “I don’t think it’s possible ― or wise ― to be completely different from Charles in a Charles Busch show, but I do want to put my spin on it at the same time,” he said. “I definitely play around with some word pronunciations because, like Joan Crawford, she is glamorous yet uneducated. But his script is so funny that I don’t want or need to do that too much.” “Die, Mommie, Die!” begins previews at the Celebration Theatre in Los Angeles on Feb. 10, with an opening night set for Feb. 17.

Later during the Civil War, Tubman went on to serve as a nurse, a cook, and a spy for the Union army.Despite her London-bred roots, in 2015 Erivo told The New York Times that she shares a lot of the same experiences as the American characters she plays. “I don’t think it’s different to be a black girl in England than it is to be a black girl from America,” she said. “We all collectively share in a pain of displacement, and not feeling like we quite belong in places.”Erivo’s forthcoming role follows her 2016 Tony win for Best Lead Actress in a Musical for Broadway’s revival of “The Color Purple.” Next year she will star opposite of Viola Davis in Steve McQueen’s developing big screen thriller, “Widow.”Production for “Harriet” is set to begin later this year."
