Police said three of the dead were women.Police identified the truck driver as a Palestinian from Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem and said he was shot dead. His uncle, Abu Ali, named him as Fadi Ahmad Hamdan Qunbor, 28, a father of four from the Jabel Mukabar neighborhood.Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said that nine Jabel Mukabar residents, including five members of the attacker’s family, were arrested on suspicion of aiding the attacker.The Israeli military regularly takes soldiers on educational tours of Jerusalem, including the Armon Hanatziv vantage point.Netanyahu visited the scene and convened his security cabinet, a forum of senior ministers, to discuss Israel’s response. He said that security forces were controlling access in and out of the neighborhood.“We know the identity of the attacker. According to all the signs he is a supporter of Islamic State,” the prime minister said.A government source said that ministers had called for the demolition of the attacker’s home and for his body not to be returned to the family for burial. It also decided to detain without trial persons expressing sympathy for Islamic State.Roni Alsheich, the national police chief, told reporters he could not rule out that the driver had been motivated by a truck ramming attack in a Berlin Christmas market that killed 12 people last month.“It is difficult to get into the head of every individual to determine what prompted him, but there is no doubt that these things do have an effect,” Alsheich told reporters.In another attack claimed by Islamic State and involving a truck driven into a crowd, nearly 90 people were killed in the French city of Nice in July.STREET ATTACKS SLOWEDActions inspired by Islamic State in Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem have been rare and only a few dozen Arab Israelis and Palestinians are known to have declared their sympathy with the group.A wave of Palestinian street attacks, including vehicle rammings, has largely slowed but not stopped completely since it began in October 2015, with 37 Israelis and two visiting Americans having been killed in these assaults.At least 231 Palestinians have been killed in violence in Israel, the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the same period. Israel says that at least 157 of them were assailants while others died during clashes and protests, blaming the violence on incitement by the Palestinian leadership.The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, denies that allegation, and says assailants have acted out of frustration over Israeli occupation of land sought by Palestinians in peace talks that have stalled since 2014.Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip, routinely praises those who carry out street attacks, and did so on Sunday.“We bless this heroic operation resisting the Israeli occupation to force it to stop its crimes and violations against our people,” Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told Reuters.Security camera footage showed the truck racing towards the soldiers and then reversing into them.A security guard identified only as “A” told Channel 10 how he shot at the truck and its driver.“I shot at a tire but realized there was no point as he has many wheels, so I ran in front of the cabin and at an angle, I shot at him and emptied my magazine,” he said.“When I finished shooting, some of the officer cadets also took aim and also started firing.”The footage showed many of the soldiers fleeing the scene as the attack took place, their rifles slung on their shoulders.As a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem, the truck driver would carry an Israeli identity card and be able to move freely through all of the city. Israel considers all of Jerusalem its united capital, a stance not supported by the international community."

He labeled it “The Trumpster quote #1,” suggesting there may be more to come.The chilling clip was apparently inspired by comedy writer Matt Oswalt, who had suggested that Trump’s New Year’s Eve tweet sounded like something the Joker might say “before releasing a swarm of killer bees into Gotham.” Just before Hamill uploaded his recording, Oswalt pitched what he called a “billion dollar” app that would play back Trump’s tweets in the Joker’s voice.Hamill readily jumped onboard.“Nobody writes better super-villain dialogue than Trumputin!” he declared, using a mashup of the president-elect’s name with that of Russia’s Vladimir Putin.Twitter users seemed to agree while also pointing to a similar effort by “Futurama” actor Billy West, who voices the cartoon character Zapp Brannigan.Brannigan, as it happens, is an egotistical and sexist senior member of the show’s interplanetary military who considers himself a hero, but is actually a brainless coward.Back in August, West recorded a series of Trump quotes in Brannigan’s voice that you can check out here."

He died “surrounded by family listening to Billie Holiday,” Nick wrote.Hentoff started in New York journalism as a jazz critic in the the 1950s for Down Beat magazine, but his body of work would eventually encompass 35 books, 50 years at The Village Voice — where he railed against the Vietnam War, racism and the media itself, among other targets — and stories in The Washington Post, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal and Esquire, along with dozens of other publications.Above all else, Hentoff was a crusader for free speech, a cause that brought him into clashes with conservatives and progressives alike. He staunchly opposed abortion and capital punishment, supported pornography as a form of free expression, and was willing to attack gay people and feminists if he believed they were trying to stifle dialogue in the name of “political correctness.”Hentoff told Clyde Haberman of The New York Times after he was laid off by the Voice in 2009 that Duke Ellington himself taught Hentoff the perils of being pigeonholed. “He said, ‘Never get caught up in categories. That’ll imprison you,’ ” Hentoff recalled.He relished his role as a troublemaker, and reportedly embraced this description of him by a colleague: “He puts on his skunk suit and heads off to the garden party, week after week, again and again.”Hentoff was born in Boston’s Roxbury neighborhood in 1925 to Russian-Jewish immigrants Simon and Lena Katzenberg Hentoff. His early loves included Bessie Smith, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, Louis Armstrong, Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker, affairs that would last his lifetime. He became the editor of his student newspaper at Northeastern University, and moved to New York after a stint with a Boston radio station. By 1958 he was writing for The Village Voice.His jazz pieces evolved into eclectic columns on civil liberties, politics, education and ― again and again ― free speech. His books ranged from jazz studies to young adult novels to profiles to social commentary. A classic Hentoff work was his 1992 book Free Speech for Me ― But Not for Thee: How the American Left and Right Relentlessly Censor Each Other, in which he excoriated just about everybody.After he was finally forced out at the Voice, Hentoff continued to hammer away at his keyboard. He spoke to Haberman of a “perilous time” for media, with fact-checking vanishing and readers gravitating toward websites that only reinforced their beliefs.Hentoff then said that the jazz musician Ben Webster once told him: “Listen, kid, when the rhythm section ain’t making it, go for yourself.”“I’ve tried that with editors all the time,” Hentoff went on. “That’s the fun of all this. You keep surprising people. And angering them, I might say.”"
3,POLITICS,Netanyahu Should Not Attend Trump's Inauguration,"Gil Troy, ContributorAmerican presidential historian, McGill professor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-trump-bibi-love-fest-needs-management_us_58720f7ce4b0a5e600a78bcf,The temptation to attend is understandable. Who wouldn’t want to highlight Trump’s warmth after eight years of Obama’s frostiness,2017-01-08,"<p><a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"">Donald Trump</a> and Benjamin Netanyahu meet at the Trump tower. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58720f9b1700002100928c36.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The temptation to attend is understandable. Who wouldn’t want to highlight Trump’s warmth after eight years of Obama’s frostiness, while enjoying some ego-stroking from adoring.The New York Post reported this week that President- elect Donald Trump has invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attend his inauguration. Netanyahu should politely, respectfully, decline. Even though the Prime Minister’s Office has denied receiving an invitation, thinking through why Netanyahu should say no if invited can clarify Israel’s strategy for the Age of Trump.The temptation to attend is understandable. Who wouldn’t want to highlight Trump’s warmth after eight years of Obama’s frostiness, while enjoying some ego-stroking from adoring, self-satisfied Trump supporters abroad, especially after hours of police interrogations at home? Still, the inauguration is a domestic event, which ambassadors usually attend. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is staying home. British Prime Minister Theresa May is staying home. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is certainly staying home (and no doubt dreading the first meeting between Canada’s “prime hipster” and America’s “chief huckster”).Netanyahu should too.Beyond protocol, as the Jewish people’s leader, Israel’s prime minister should respect American Jewish sensibilities. More than two-thirds of American Jews didn’t just oppose Trump but loathe him. An Israeli-American Trumpian love fest after eight years of Obama’s brittleness will be hard enough to take.Netanyahu should ease into the relationship, wary of having the lingering anger about Trump’s demagogic, often bigoted campaign transferred to him – and Israel.Hit pieces are already accumulating blasting “Liberal Zionism in the age of Trump,” falsely accusing Zionists of justifying right-wing pro-Trump antisemitism because Trump is pro-Israel. Tone counts, while the Talmud teaches that intoxication leads to sin. Just as President Barack Obama’s settlement obsession caused a snippiness toward Israel that trumped his gestures of support, if Netanyahu is too giddy about the new regime, if he expands settlements aggressively, he, too, could stumble. The America-Israel friendship is rock-solid yet often rocky. Building up any president too much when things are going well risks exaggerating his power over Israel when tensions arise.Beyond all the distracting theatrics, Israel needs substantive bipartisan support from the U.S., which even under Obama remained Israel’s strongest friend.A brouhaha over Netanyahu’s overstepping by attending the inauguration will alienate Democrats and liberal Jews. Rather than sacrifice credibility for an inaugural playdate or another illegal outpost, Netanyahu and Trump should concentrate on reframing the issue of Israel’s sovereign right to determine its own capital city.Both should reject the status quo. Place the burden of proof on those disrespecting Israel’s right to choose its own capital not those demanding a move to Jerusalem. As America’s Jerusalem Act of 1995 proclaims: “Each sovereign nation, under international law and custom, may designate its own capital” and the “United States maintains its embassy in the functioning capital of every country except” Israel’s.If Germany can pick its capital city and essentially decide where the American embassy should be, and England can pick its capital city and essentially decide where the American embassy should be, why can’t Israel pick its capital city? Moving the embassy to Jerusalem is just undoing an unprecedented insult to the Jewish state. If he makes the move, President Trump would be fulfilling a promise the Democratic dove George McGovern made in 1972. McGovern’s Democratic Party platform promised to “Recognize and support the established status of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,” and proclaimed: “As a symbol of this stand, the US Embassy should be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.”Most other presidents and nominees since echoed that vow – mandated by Congress in 1995’s Jerusalem Embassy Act. Trump will also enjoy defying Palestinian threats and threats of riots in Muslim cities – real presidents don’t succumb to bullying.Having framed the argument more effectively, both should think carefully before actually making the move – and here lies the essential lesson Trump must learn and Netanyahu often forgets. It is easy to lash out, as Netanyahu did after the UN Resolution, recalling ambassadors to Senegal and New Zealand, blocking the Ukrainian prime minister’s visit and antagonizing other diplomats. But what did his tantrum accomplish? The Independent sneered that Netanyahu reacted “to an international community deemed intent on isolating Israel,” by isolating Israel voluntarily. Trump also often reacts impulsively, tweeting madly at 3 a.m.Restraint is an art, especially after you’ve established the power to act. Just like we don’t consume double fudge chocolate cakes daily even if we can afford them, leaders don’t make every move they could make either. Mature statesmen wield power cautiously, strategically, more like Jedi knights using the Force rather than drunken gunslingers shooting up the Wild West. If Obama failed because he never learned how to deploy America’s Force and retires looking wimpy, both Netanyahu and Trump risk unleashing the Force willy-nilly – especially, if they start playing off each other.Even a principled move like undoing the insult of ignoring Israel’s choice of a capital city should be used carefully, deployed for maximal effect, at the right time, depending on the dynamics with the Palestinians and the rest of the world. Palestinian politics demonstrates how useless symbolic victories can be – they still lack the state they claim to desire and are no closer to destroying the Jewish state they hate.If I were Netanyahu, I would mollify liberal American Jews by leading immediately on a different important Jerusalem issue – restoring the Western Wall compromise to respect egalitarian Jews.Trump and Netanyahu must carefully weigh America’s goals, Israel’s goals – strategizing about how these two great democracies, working together thoughtfully after eight years of misfires, can maximize both.Read original article on The Jerusalem Post.

He announced his election in a joint statement with committee Vice Chairman Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.).The committee’s purpose is to “study the unique problems of American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaska Native peoples and to propose legislation to alleviate these difficulties,” its website states.But Hoeven has condemned protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline, a movement led by members of the Standing Rock Sioux and joined by other Native Americans and allies from across the country. Protesters say a leak would be catastrophic for the drinking water of the Standing Rock Sioux and others, and argue that the construction violates an 1851 treaty with the U.S. government.In November, Hoeven characterized the protests as sometimes “violent” and called for President Barack Obama to approve the pipeline’s final easement and put an end to the demonstrations.Of course, there are Native Americans, including some members of the Standing Rock Sioux, who do not agree with the protesters. But the fight against the pipeline is arguably the most prominent Native American-led social movement in recent history, and the protests have become emblematic of the fight for Native American rights.Hoeven’s views on the issue are also at odds with Udall’s. After federal authorities announced a halt to the pipeline’s construction in December, Udall applauded the decision.“Over the last seven months, thousands of people, including Indian nations from New Mexico and across North America, have demonstrated their deep concern about the lack of consultation by the federal government and the potential environmental hazard this pipeline poses for the water,” Udall said in a statement.While many people celebrated the decision to halt construction as a major victory, it’s not totally clear what the future holds for the project, especially with incoming president-elect Donald Trump. Last month, Trump’s transition team said he supported the pipeline and would review options when he takes office.H/T Mic"

Using your phone at inappropriate times annoys your boss and colleagues according to research from USC's Marshall School of Business, and if you work with women and people over forty they're even more perturbed by it than everyone else.The researchers conducted a nationwide survey of 554 full-time working professionals earning above $30K and working in companies with at least 50 employees. They asked a variety of questions about smartphone use during meetings and found:- 86% think it's inappropriate to answer phone calls during meetings - 84% think it's inappropriate to write texts or emails during meetings - 66% think it's inappropriate to write texts or emails even during lunches offsite - The more money people make the less they approve of smartphone use.The study also found that millennials are three times more likely than those over 40 to think that smartphone use during meetings is okay, which is ironic considering Millennials are highly dependent upon the opinions of their older colleagues for career advancement.TalentSmart has tested the emotional intelligence (EQ) of more than a million people worldwide and found that Millennials have the lowest self-awareness in the workplace, making them unlikely to see that their smartphone use in meetings is harming their careers.Why do so many people find smartphone use in meetings to be inappropriate? When you take out your phone it shows a:- Lack of respect: You consider the information on your phone to be more important than the conversation at hand, and you view people outside of the meeting to be more important than those sitting right in front of you. - Lack of attention: You are unable to stay focused on one thing at a time. - Lack of listening: You aren't practicing active listening, so no one around you feels heard. - Lack of power: You are like a modern-day Pavlovian dog who responds to the whims of others through the buzz of your phone. - Lack of self-awareness: You don't understand how ridiculous your behavior looks to other people. - Lack of social awareness: You don't understand how your behavior affects those around you.I can't say I'm surprised by the USC study's findings.

Every year, millions of Americans visit the coast to enjoy our nation's beautiful beaches and nearshore waters. Ocean tourism and recreation are the top economic drivers in our coastal communities, worth an estimated $100 billion in GDP annually nationwide and $40 billion in GDP in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states per year. Our coasts are also very busy and continue to get busier every year with competing interests that include increased coastal development, offshore energy projects and increased shipping. How do we allow for these new uses while protecting important habitats and existing uses such as ocean recreation, fishing and tourism? The solution is better planning. Regional ocean planning is a new approach to balance the many competing uses of the ocean. The planning process is essential to ensure continued growth and protection of coastal tourism and recreation, which depend on a clean and healthy ocean ecosystem to thrive. After years of hard work, collaboration and input from thousands of ocean and coastal stakeholders, the first regional ocean plans in the nation have been approved. This marks a major achievement in the protection of our ocean and coasts. The Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regional ocean plans will guide the management of our valuable coastlines and ocean resources for future generations. Based on the bipartisan recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, regional ocean planning addresses issues such as water quality, ocean pollution, coastal flooding, and offshore renewable energy. Each regional strategy is implemented through an Ocean Planning Body that is comprised of state representatives, federal agencies, and tribal nations, to advance stewardship of our coasts through improved collaboration across all levels of government. In regions such as the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, West Coast, and Pacific Islands, significant progress is being made through ocean planning to protect the coastal ecosystems we all use and enjoy.Organizations, such as the Surfrider Foundation, have led studies to map recreational activities and collect economic data on coastal tourism and recreation to ensure this vital industry is incorporated into the official decision-making processes for the ocean plans. Including the information in official data portals provides a rare opportunity to contribute to the proactive regional planning process and ensure that the economics of coastal recreation are integrated into the protection of the nation's coastlines. With the approval of the ocean plans in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the next wave of ocean management will establish best practices, new ways of collaborating and communicating, and ensure that the interests of all ocean users are holistically included. The ocean planning process gives beachgoers, surfers and ocean users a voice in the decision-making process, which enables each of us to share our vision for coastal communities and for the future of our ocean.So next time you hit the surf, relax on the beach, or take a walk with your family, know that coastal recreation is critical to protecting our coasts and ocean."

Matt Bevin (R), who is expected to sign it. The ban came less than a week after Republicans took control over all three branches of Kentucky government. Before the November election, Republicans had not controlled the Kentucky House since 1921.Anti-abortion advocates argue that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks, but that claim isn’t supported by medical evidence. Reproductive rights advocates worry that 20-week bans could be used as a vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that protects a woman’s right to have an abortion. Nearly 20 states have passed 20-week abortion bans.The Kentucky legislature also passed a separate bill Saturday that requires a woman to have an ultrasound before she receives an abortion. Bevin is also expected to sign that bill.ACLU-KY Advocacy Director Kate Miller condemned both bills.“The passage today of 20 week abortion ban, Senate Bill 5 and mandated ultrasound bill, House Bill 2, were the culmination of a week where many members of the General Assembly worked at breakneck speed to severely restrict women’s reproductive rights,” she said in a statement. “In floor speech after floor speech Saturday, lawmakers discussed the true intention of their support of the bills, which was simply banning abortion. Senate Bill 5 and House Bill 2 are not about women’s health. They represent nothing more than political intrusion in the most personal, private decisions.”Neither the 20-week abortion ban nor the ultrasound bill contains exceptions for cases of rape and incest.Both measures moved remarkably quickly through the Kentucky legislature, which opened its session on Tuesday. The laws contain emergency language that will make them effective immediately once they are signed, the Lexington Herald Leader reported earlier this week.The ACLU of Kentucky and Planned Parenthood have criticized how quickly the 20-week ban moved through the legislature. Demonstrators took to the state capitol building in Frankfort this week to protest the bill. “Things are moving so quickly, members of the public and press were unable to obtain copies of the 20-week abortion ban and ultrasound bills before they received a reading and were headed to committee for a vote.”Lawmakers are also considering a different measure that would block state and local funds from going towards funding any organization that provides abortion services.This story has been updated with comment from the ACLU."

Ironically, she was credited in 2015 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for helping to find flaws in energy management software. Shevchenko told the Guardian she has been approached several times by people she believed were working for the Russian government — but has always spurned them.Shevchenko’s company was included on the U.S. sanctions list released last month, along with officers in Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency and two notorious criminal hackers. Her company “provided the GRU with technical research and development,” according to the White House, though no other details are provided.Shevchenko said on Twitter that her company isn’t even operating any longer.Shevchenko helps companies find vulnerabilities in their systems. She told the Guardian that “hysteria” in the U.S. over the Russian hacking story has led to her being framed by a competitor or someone hoping to protect the real culprits — or that American intelligence “misinterpreted” some information.“A young female hacker and her helpless company seems like a perfect pick for that goal. I don’t try to hide, I travel a lot, and am a friendly communicative person,” she said.“Most importantly,” she added. “I don’t have any big money, power or connections behind me to shrug off the blame.”"

Matt Bevin (R) is expected to sign the anti-union bills.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58701e121b00008d016e607a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Organized labor suffered its first major legislative setback due to the 2016 elections on Saturday, when Kentucky Republicans gave final approval to right-to-work legislation and repealed the state’s prevailing wage law. Both bills are expected to be signed into law by the governor, and will take effect immediately.Kentucky is the last holdout in the South without an anti-union right-to-work law on the books. For decades, labor unions and Democrats fended off such measures, which diminish union membership and weaken the labor movement. But when Republicans captured the state House in November, they paved the way for passage of the legislation. The law will apply to all new labor contracts, but will not affect current agreements.Unions and Democrats mounted a last-ditch effort to stop the legislation this week, holding protests at the state capitol building in Frankfort saying the bills would drive down wages. But Republicans now have overwhelming control of both the state Senate and the House. Kentucky’s governor, Matt Bevin, is a Republican who won office in 2015.“They’re cutting workers’ pay,” Bill Finn, state director of the Kentucky State Building and Construction Trades Council, told The Huffington Post this week. “People voted for a change in this election, but they didn’t vote for this. They didn’t vote for pay cuts.”Right-to-work laws forbid contracts that require all workers in a particular bargaining unit to pay fees to a union. Under U.S. labor law, a union must represent all employees in a unionized workplace, even those who may not want representation. Unions argue it’s only fair that all workers share the costs of bargaining and maintaining the union contract.By allowing individual workers to opt out of paying union fees while benefiting from representation ― an arrangement unions call “free riding” ― right-to-work laws can drive down membership and weaken unions financially and politically. The conservatives who push right-to-work laws argue that they assure workers’ individual freedoms by not compelling anyone to support a union. Labor leaders were equally troubled by the legislature’s move to gut the state’s prevailing wage law. Such laws require that employers pay certain minimum wages on work funded by public money. Backers of the laws say they help make sure companies accepting taxpayer dollars don’t drive down wages and working conditions. Opponents argue they inflate the cost of public works projects.The repeal means prevailing wages will no longer apply to construction workers building schools and government buildings. Charlie Essex, the financial secretary for Local 369 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Louisville, called the measure “an attack on union people.” He estimated that the prevailing wage law applied to more than 30 percent of union construction work in Kentucky.Backed by business lobbies, Republican lawmakers around the country have been aggressive in pushing right-to-work bills and prevailing wage repeals in recent years. When Democrats lose control of a statehouse chamber or the governor’s mansion, they are often powerless to stop them. Long confined to the South and West, right-to-work proponents have recently made inroads elsewhere in the country, including even the industrial Midwest. Since 2012, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and West Virginia have all gone right-to-work. Kentucky will be the 27th such state, making it more the norm than the exception around the country."

The reservoirs hold a combined 410,000 acre-feet of water, and dam failure could put half the city underwater. “They are releasing the water and it is gradual, and they are indicating that if they don’t do it, the water builds up and it will go around the dams and be exponentially worse,” Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in a press conference Monday morning. Some people who live in the affluent neighborhood between the reservoirs were confused about the decision to release water from the dams, and upset an evacuation plan hadn’t been in place before doing so. By the time they’d heard about it late Sunday, it was already dark and too late to get out.Most streets in the area had not been flooded before the release, despite the more than two feet of rain that has already fallen on the city. But the release pushed flood waters as high as 4 feet into parts of the neighborhood, and residents were scrambling to get people out on anything that floats – inflatable rafts, kayaks, jet skis and even a giant blow-up duck.“They didn’t tell us anything about evacuating,” said Charlie Holt, 60.His wife, Laura Holt, 41, said they were preparing their first floor for potential flooding. While their part of the neighborhood hadn’t yet flooded, they expected it was only a matter of time before it did. “We contemplated evacuating, but there’s really nowhere to go,” she said.

She’d just helped an elderly man in a wheelchair, his care provider, and his wife get out of their house and into her truck.“We’ve been bringing people to our house, because we have a generator,” said Swanson. “My husband’s out here somewhere with our boat, somebody else has our kayak.”Nolen Shumaker, 72, and her grandchildren Bobbie, 15, and Gracie, 12, climbed in a HuffPost reporter’s boat, along with their dog, Coco.“The water came up so fast,” said Schumaker. “We never thought it would get this bad.”"

The death toll rose on Monday to at least nine, after Texas officials reported to The Washington Post that six people died in Harris County and authorities in Montgomery County stated that a falling tree killed a woman after landing on her home. Two other victims were confirmed over the weekend.Many highways and streets throughout the region are flooded, making normal travel impossible and forcing first responders to rescue more than 2,000 people over the weekend, with more expected throughout the week. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said the department’s first priority was to complete 185 critical rescues with help from the 4,000 National and State Guard members activated for storm aid. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) announced on Monday that he had activated the state’s entire National Guard to help with disaster relief, increasing the total number of guardsman deployed to about 12,000.Abbott said during a press conference later on Monday that the process of responding to the storm is only just beginning.“This is a place that Texas and FEMA will be involved for a long, long time. We will be here until we can restore this region as back to normal as possible,” Abbott said.“We need to recognize that it’s going to be a new normal ― a new and different normal for this entire region.”The government also issued a mandatory evacuation order on Monday for several areas of Fort Bend County, southwest of Houston.More flooding is ahead for the Houston region, forecasters warn, and an already dire situation could soon become desperate: An area the size of Connecticut is expected to receive at least another 20 inches of rain through Friday, though the rain is expected to let up intermittently through the week. Officials said that by the time the storm ends, Harvey could dump up to 50 inches of water on some parts of the affected area, which includes 54 counties.Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long said he anticipates that at least 30,000 people in Texas will be displaced to temporary shelters.“This is a landmark event for Texas,” Long said. “Texas has never seen an event like this.”President Donald Trump on Monday declared a state of emergency for Louisiana, a year after floods devastated the region last August and 12 years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans. Up to 15 inches of rain were set to bear down on southwest and central Louisiana, with flash floods expected through Thursday.“I want to stress that we are not out of the woods yet,” Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke said. “Harvey is still a dangerous and historic storm.” Trump plans to travel to Corpus Christi, Texas, on Tuesday with first lady Melania Trump to visit some of the places most affected by the storm. Trump declared a state of emergency for many areas of Texas on Friday night, adding more counties on Sunday.“I’ll be going to Texas tomorrow, I look very much forward to it,” Trump said on Monday. “Things are being handled really well. The spirit is incredible of the people.”Houston resident Leidys Shull and 10 others, including children, remained trapped in her home Monday morning.“Nobody has come to help us,” Shull said. “It’s just taking too long.”Shull said she has seen only one boat come by in the hours since they’ve been stuck in the house.“We tried to be a little bit calm, but we worry about the children,” Shull said. “I wish our local [officials] told us to evacuate. ... We had the possibility to leave, and now we are trapped inside our houses without food and running out of water.”Over 1,200 people were rescued in Harris County alone, Francisco Sanchez of the county’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management told HuffPost.Rescues and evacuations are ongoing, but Sanchez said most of the rescues relating to life-threatening situations have been completed. Volunteer civilian boats are also being dispatched to rescue people who are not in life-threatening situations and are requesting assistance.“We cannot thank those people enough … it’s been phenomenal,” Sanchez said. “We were just taken aback by the sheer generosity by folks who stepped up.”After initially being overwhelmed by the scale of emergencies, Sanchez said, the county currently has enough resources to meet its rescue needs.As highway underpasses and feeder roads across Houston became lakes, first responders spent Sunday pulling people stranded from submerged cars into boats and plucking others from the rooftops of their homes by helicopter. Police also blocked roads to surrounding rural areas, where ranches and farms were under several feet of water.Electric signs on Interstate 10 traveling east into the city read “High water” and urged drivers to “Turn around, don’t drown.”Harvey is now stationary, and close enough to the water that it has an unlimited source of fuel, National Weather Service meteorologist Patrick Burke told HuffPost. The weather event will affect the area for “days, if not weeks,” he warned.“If you’re sitting in the Houston area and you see a break and the rain lets up, don’t let your guard down. It’s gonna come right back in,” Burke said. “Rainfall predictions are as high as we’ve ever made for a storm.” Officials urged residents trapped in their homes to avoid sheltering in their attics and to get on their roofs instead. “[H]ave reports of people getting into attic to escape floodwater,” Acevedo warned warned Sunday morning. “[D]o not do so unless you have an ax or means to break through onto your roof.”Michael Wadler, 55, and his 17-year-old daughter watched with terror as their Houston home filled with water early Sunday morning.“It bubbled up from the doors,” Maya Wadler told The New York Times. “Everywhere you turned there would just be a new flowing puddle. It just kept filling. It passed the outlets. I was so scared, we didn’t know what would happen.”The pair were rescued around 4 a.m. Sunday and brought to a fire station, where Michael was able to get in touch with his wife and another daughter who were trapped at a neighbor’s house.“This is truly apocalyptic,” Michael Wadler said.Members of the Houston Fire Department were searching the interstate for both trapped drivers and bodies on Sunday afternoon. They commandeered a HuffPost reporter’s boat to look for a woman trapped in her car. When a rookie fireman asked if they would be recovering bodies, another explained they were only picking up survivors on that pass.Long, FEMA’s administrator, appealed to the public for help in assisting federal rescue workers and requested volunteers to visit nvoad.org for more information on how to get involved.“We need the whole community, not only the federal government forces,” Long said. “This is a full community effort from all levels of government and it’s going to require the citizens getting involved.”Upstream and west of Houston, two giant reservoirs, built in the 1940s to protect the city from flooding, are already nearing capacity. The Addicks and Barker dams hold back the reservoirs’ collective 410,000 acre-feet of water and if the dams fail, half the city could be underwater. To prevent the structures from failing, the Army Corps of Engineers, which runs the dams, began releasing water from both the Addicks and Barker reservoirs before 2 a.m. on Monday, pouring even more water into the city. According to Houston city officials, more than 75,000 emergency calls have been made as of 9 a.m. Monday morning. On a normal day, 911 operators receive around 8,000 calls.The city’s emergency services tweeted that they were at capacity and asked residents to only call if they faced imminent danger. The mayor advised people to give preference to life-threatening situations when calling 911. Officials said the city’s public hospital, Ben Taub, was evacuated Sunday due to flooding and power outages. Later in the day, Bayshore Medical Center, another Houston metropolitan area hospital, decided to suspend operations and evacuate its 196 patients.  Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner has urged residents to prepare for days of heavy rains and flooding. During a news conference on Sunday morning, Turner advised residents to stay in place and said the city would be opening more shelters to cope with the storm’s effects. The city is opening its George R. Brown Convention Center as one such shelter, and Dallas will open a convention center that can host up to 5,000 evacuees on Tuesday morning.“Just stay put,” Turner pleaded. “We need you to help us.” Turner also told residents to refrain from driving and to “stay off the streets unless it’s an emergency.” Still, many chose to ignore city officials’ recommendations to stay put, at times driving the wrong way up interstate exists in order to snake around flooded underpasses. Rosanna Moreno, 55, had tried to reach the condominium building in the city where she lives after a family visit to the capital of Austin, only to find the expressway closed. She parked her car on Interstate 610, still several miles from the city, unsure of what to do next. “People are crazy trying to go through,” Moreno told HuffPost. “Basically, we’re all underwater. We’re stuck.” Lydia O’Connor, Nick Robins-Early, Dominique Mosbergen and Hayley Miller contributed reporting.  This is a developing story. Check back for updates."

It’s gonna come right back in,” Burke said. “Rainfall predictions are as high as we’ve ever made for a storm.” Officials urged residents trapped in their homes to avoid sheltering in their attics and to get on their roofs instead. “[H]ave reports of people getting into attic to escape floodwater,” Acevedo warned warned Sunday morning. “[D]o not do so unless you have an ax or means to break through onto your roof.”Michael Wadler, 55, and his 17-year-old daughter watched with terror as their Houston home filled with water early Sunday morning.“It bubbled up from the doors,” Maya Wadler told The New York Times. “Everywhere you turned there would just be a new flowing puddle. It just kept filling. It passed the outlets. I was so scared, we didn’t know what would happen.”The pair were rescued around 4 a.m. Sunday and brought to a fire station, where Michael was able to get in touch with his wife and another daughter who were trapped at a neighbor’s house.“This is truly apocalyptic,” Michael Wadler said.Members of the Houston Fire Department were searching the interstate for both trapped drivers and bodies on Sunday afternoon. They commandeered a HuffPost reporter’s boat to look for a woman trapped in her car. When a rookie fireman asked if they would be recovering bodies, another explained they were only picking up survivors on that pass.Long, FEMA’s administrator, appealed to the public for help in assisting federal rescue workers and requested volunteers to visit nvoad.org for more information on how to get involved.“We need the whole community, not only the federal government forces,” Long said. “This is a full community effort from all levels of government and it’s going to require the citizens getting involved.”Upstream and west of Houston, two giant reservoirs, built in the 1940s to protect the city from flooding, are already nearing capacity. The Addicks and Barker dams hold back the reservoirs’ collective 410,000 acre-feet of water and if the dams fail, half the city could be underwater. To prevent the structures from failing, the Army Corps of Engineers, which runs the dams, began releasing water from both the Addicks and Barker reservoirs before 2 a.m. on Monday, pouring even more water into the city. According to Houston city officials, more than 75,000 emergency calls have been made as of 9 a.m. Monday morning. On a normal day, 911 operators receive around 8,000 calls.The city’s emergency services tweeted that they were at capacity and asked residents to only call if they faced imminent danger. The mayor advised people to give preference to life-threatening situations when calling 911. Officials said the city’s public hospital, Ben Taub, was evacuated Sunday due to flooding and power outages. Later in the day, Bayshore Medical Center, another Houston metropolitan area hospital, decided to suspend operations and evacuate its 196 patients.  Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner has urged residents to prepare for days of heavy rains and flooding. During a news conference on Sunday morning, Turner advised residents to stay in place and said the city would be opening more shelters to cope with the storm’s effects. The city is opening its George R. Brown Convention Center as one such shelter, and Dallas will open a convention center that can host up to 5,000 evacuees on Tuesday morning.“Just stay put,” Turner pleaded. “We need you to help us.” Turner also told residents to refrain from driving and to “stay off the streets unless it’s an emergency.” Still, many chose to ignore city officials’ recommendations to stay put, at times driving the wrong way up interstate exists in order to snake around flooded underpasses. Rosanna Moreno, 55, had tried to reach the condominium building in the city where she lives after a family visit to the capital of Austin, only to find the expressway closed. She parked her car on Interstate 610, still several miles from the city, unsure of what to do next. “People are crazy trying to go through,” Moreno told HuffPost. “Basically, we’re all underwater. We’re stuck.” Lydia O’Connor, Nick Robins-Early, Dominique Mosbergen and Hayley Miller contributed reporting.  This is a developing story. Check back for updates."

The death toll rose on Monday to at least nine, after Texas officials reported to The Washington Post that six people died in Harris County and authorities in Montgomery County stated that a falling tree killed a woman after landing on her home. Two other victims were confirmed over the weekend.Many highways and streets throughout the region are flooded, making normal travel impossible and forcing first responders to rescue more than 2,000 people over the weekend, with more expected throughout the week. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said the department’s first priority was to complete 185 critical rescues with help from the 4,000 National and State Guard members activated for storm aid. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) announced on Monday that he had activated the state’s entire National Guard to help with disaster relief, increasing the total number of guardsman deployed to about 12,000.Abbott said during a press conference later on Monday that the process of responding to the storm is only just beginning.“This is a place that Texas and FEMA will be involved for a long, long time. We will be here until we can restore this region as back to normal as possible,” Abbott said.“We need to recognize that it’s going to be a new normal ― a new and different normal for this entire region.”The government also issued a mandatory evacuation order on Monday for several areas of Fort Bend County, southwest of Houston.More flooding is ahead for the Houston region, forecasters warn, and an already dire situation could soon become desperate: An area the size of Connecticut is expected to receive at least another 20 inches of rain through Friday, though the rain is expected to let up intermittently through the week. Officials said that by the time the storm ends, Harvey could dump up to 50 inches of water on some parts of the affected area, which includes 54 counties.Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long said he anticipates that at least 30,000 people in Texas will be displaced to temporary shelters.“This is a landmark event for Texas,” Long said. “Texas has never seen an event like this.”President Donald Trump on Monday declared a state of emergency for Louisiana, a year after floods devastated the region last August and 12 years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans. Up to 15 inches of rain were set to bear down on southwest and central Louisiana, with flash floods expected through Thursday.“I want to stress that we are not out of the woods yet,” Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke said. “Harvey is still a dangerous and historic storm.” Trump plans to travel to Corpus Christi, Texas, on Tuesday with first lady Melania Trump to visit some of the places most affected by the storm. Trump declared a state of emergency for many areas of Texas on Friday night, adding more counties on Sunday.“I’ll be going to Texas tomorrow, I look very much forward to it,” Trump said on Monday. “Things are being handled really well. The spirit is incredible of the people.”Houston resident Leidys Shull and 10 others, including children, remained trapped in her home Monday morning.“Nobody has come to help us,” Shull said. “It’s just taking too long.”Shull said she has seen only one boat come by in the hours since they’ve been stuck in the house.“We tried to be a little bit calm, but we worry about the children,” Shull said. “I wish our local [officials] told us to evacuate. ... We had the possibility to leave, and now we are trapped inside our houses without food and running out of water.”Over 1,200 people were rescued in Harris County alone, Francisco Sanchez of the county’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management told HuffPost.Rescues and evacuations are ongoing, but Sanchez said most of the rescues relating to life-threatening situations have been completed. Volunteer civilian boats are also being dispatched to rescue people who are not in life-threatening situations and are requesting assistance.“We cannot thank those people enough … it’s been phenomenal,” Sanchez said. “We were just taken aback by the sheer generosity by folks who stepped up.”After initially being overwhelmed by the scale of emergencies, Sanchez said, the county currently has enough resources to meet its rescue needs.As highway underpasses and feeder roads across Houston became lakes, first responders spent Sunday pulling people stranded from submerged cars into boats and plucking others from the rooftops of their homes by helicopter. Police also blocked roads to surrounding rural areas, where ranches and farms were under several feet of water.Electric signs on Interstate 10 traveling east into the city read “High water” and urged drivers to “Turn around, don’t drown.”Harvey is now stationary, and close enough to the water that it has an unlimited source of fuel, National Weather Service meteorologist Patrick Burke told HuffPost.

Up to 2,000 militants were believed to be defending the city against around 50,000 attackers, according to Iraqi and western military sources.Such a quick collapse of Islamic State in the city, which has been a breeding ground for jihadist groups, would confirm Iraqi military reports that the militants lack command and control structures west of Mosul.Residents who fled Tal Afar days before the start of the offensive told Reuters some of the militants looked “exhausted” and “depleted.”Elite forces liberated the heart of the city on Saturday, and raised the national flag on top of the citadel building, the military said. Much of the Ottoman-era structure was destroyed by the militants in 2014.A Reuters visual team visited the citadel on Sunday and saw signs of heavy damage to much of the structure.“We tried to push out the militants without doing too much damage,” said a Shi’ite militia soldier fighting with the Iraqi forces who asked not to be named. “We only used light weaponry.”Iraqi soldiers were seen celebrating Tal Afar’s recapture on Sunday, taking down IS flags from their perches in the city center and taking pictures mocking the militants.Fighting had almost ground to a halt on Saturday, with just occasional artillery rounds heard. There was no sign of civilians in the neighborhoods Reuters visited on Saturday and Sunday.Tens of thousands of people are believed to have fled in the weeks before the battle started. Remaining civilians were threatened with death by the militants, according to aid organizations and residents who managed to leave.Tal Afar has experienced cycles of sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shi’ites after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and has produced some of Islamic State’s most senior commanders.(Writing by Raya Jalabi.

The planned demonstration morphed into a “No Hate Rally” that spilled over into other parks in the area. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that some participants carried “signs reading ‘Berkeley stands united against hate,’ ‘Queers against hate,’ and ‘End white supremacy,’” while others handed out “no hate” shields. The counterprotesters ended up dwarfing pockets of demonstrators wearing “Make America Great Again” hats or flying flags touting President Donald Trump.Jeff Conant, 50, of Berkeley, who helped organize the counterprotest, told the Chronicle it was “important for people to show up and make it unacceptable for right-wing white supremacists to spew hate and incite violence.”But while the gathering started off mostly peaceful, chaos later erupted as “hundreds of black-clad demonstrators ran from the park screaming in various directions down city streets. Moments before, they had jumped barriers and entered the police-guarded park,” per the Chronicle. Fights between the two sides led to a handful of arrests in and around Berkeley’s Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Lt. Kevin Schofield of the Berkeley Police Department said officers used smoke to break up a fight, but had not used tear gas, Berkeleyside notes. Berkeley police arrested at least 10 people. On Saturday, thousands flooded the streets of San Francisco to protest another far-right rally that was ultimately canceled. These counterprotesters joined MC Hammer and utilized the power of dance to run white supremacists out of town.Since the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, earlier this month that sparked deadly violence, cities have been grappling with hate-fueled rallies on their turf. Boston dealt with a “free speech” rally last weekend, with tens of thousands of people showing up to protest an emboldened white supremacy movement in America.This story has been updated with additional information about the Berkeley rally."

He knew that other shops would be closed, and he wanted to be open to serve those who needed help with their flooded cars. I learned this lesson of standing up for others in the late 1960s, and it has stayed with me even as I run my own small business today.So, as the remnants of hurricane Harvey continues to drench and flood many areas of the Texas Gulf Coast, below are 20 tips to help small businesses bounce back and begin again after being impacted by the storm.1. Be grateful that you and your family are safe and for the opportunity to begin in.2. Check on your employees.3. Safety first. When safe to be on the roads, heed the necessary precautions before entering any damaged building structures. Contact a licensed and trustworthy professional to conduct any building assessments.4. Visit the Small Business Administration website for information on disaster recovery.5. Contact your insurance agent for your business and company vehicles.6. Contact FEMA for disaster assistance and loans. Also, depending on your area, the Department of Agriculture has loans available to help you rebuild.7. Contact your vendors and suppliers to rearrange orders and make plans for payments.8. Call your banker to review your line of credit, limits on credit card and waiver of any bank fees.9. Contact your congressperson, state representative or local city councilperson for the appropriate jurisdiction support. For example, if FEMA is not responding, call your congressperson.10. Forward your business telephone to a phone number that will be answered or change your voice message to note how customers can be best served while you are rebuilding.11. Draft an out-of-office email response if unable to respond to emails in a timely manner.12. Use social media to add value and keep in touch with customers.13. Stay positive – positive energy creates a positive environment. Keep your head up and focus on being able to serve your customers.14. Avoid “yeah but” people – this is negative energy that will slow or stop you completely from resuming operations.15. Refrain from using any unlicensed trade contractors such as electricians, plumbers, etc. You can contact the appropriate State of Texas agencies if have any concerns.16. Before rebuilding structures, make sure contractor obtains a city building permit.17. Be transparent with customers ― let your customer know your situation; how you can serve them while rebuilding and when you expect to be reopened.18. Stay tuned to official web sites such as www.houstonremergency.org for helpful information.19. Use mass transit or other transportation modes if your company vehicle has been flooded and you need to get around. If not use technology!20. Take a deep breath, clear your head and make sure to say, “thank you” to those providing assistance for you to rebuild.In ConclusionAccording to the SBA, “25 percent of small businesses do not reopen after a disaster.” To avoid becoming a part of this small business statistic, identify at least three of the tips mentioned above that you can implement as soon as the flood waters recede. Taking this step not only places you on the path to restore your business and dreams, but it also helps to retain jobs and keep the Texas Gulf Coast economy strong.Do you have suggestions for small businesses have been or are being affected by hurricane Harvey?

On Saturday night, Falcons fans finally got to find out. Matt Ryan, the MVP and all-everything",2017-08-27,<p>The virtual reality driving experience inside Mercedes Benz Stadium</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a228172400001d004b9eac.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What does $1.5 billion look like? On Saturday night, Falcons fans finally got to find out. Matt Ryan, the MVP and all-everything quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons threw an interception on his team’s very first play – but that didn’t matter very much – the star of the show Saturday night was the sparkly new Mercedes Benz Stadium. After more than five years of preparation, the Falcons opened the door to their hugely anticipated stadium for the first time and the spectacle of the building buoyed any disappointment in what was happening on the field. In the next few years, this building will host a Super Bowl, a College Football National Championship, and a Final Four. But tonight was just a pre-season game, a chance for fans, players and staff to fully bask in the ooohs and ahhhs before anything really counts. Walking into the main gate of Mercedes Benz Stadium, you’re greeted with an expansive view of the field, surrounded by the one-of-a-kind Halo Board, 58ft tall and 360-degrees around. The three seating levels all offer something unique, whether it’s a 100-yard bar on the top level, a high-tech internet-friendly lounge on the second, or even a virtual reality racing experience on the bottom. In the background of it all is a glass-pane view of the Atlanta skyline. In short, it’s not a bad place to watch a game. The cheap dining options, which made all sorts of news months before the stadium even opened, were all there, along with some local Atlanta favorites. And if you think Mercedes Benz Stadium wouldn’t also feature the world’s largest bird sculpture, you might want to think again. For the Atlanta sports fan though, this whole new stadium thing is an old hat. The Braves opened their new Sun Trust Park just four months ago, and the Hawks are in the middle of the second largest arena renovation in NBA history. But there’s something different about Mercedes Benz Stadium. When the Braves packed up and moved from downtown Atlanta to a different county in the suburbs, it was a tough lesson in the fickle nature of sports business. So the joint investment between the city and its premiere team towards a billion dollar downtown stadium represents a future for Atlanta that includes the people who live in the heart of it. Atlanta, of course, is not alone in the stadium wars. Starting with the famous Jerry World in Dallas a few years ago, it’s the norm for a new pro-stadium to cross the billion dollar threshold. And unfortunately, more often than not, it’s the taxpayer that has to take on an inordinate share of the burden. Mercedes-Benz Stadium is no different, $200 million of the building funds came from city money. But for the 70,000 fans that packed into the building on Saturday, most wearing huge grins and pointing camera phones in every direction, this one was worth it.There’s a lot to marvel at, but its impact is just beginning to be felt. Mercedes Benz Stadium will bring Atlanta into the world stage in a way it hasn’t since the Olympics over twenty years ago. The city is apparently a finalist to be a host site for the 2026 World Cup, and it’s hard to imagine this stadium being turned down. So whether you watch Falcons games this year from your couch, or inside the building in the shadow of the world’s largest bird sculpture, you might want to get used to the stadium they’re playing. You’ll be seeing a lot of it."

This one, however, is not only stationary, but it’s starting to backtrack toward the coast. It will likely drop dozens of inches of rain in the coming days. Isolated areas will see 30, 40 and 50 inches of rainfall over its course, the experts say.“If you’re sitting in the Houston area and you see a break and the rain lets up, don’t let your guard down. It’s gonna come right back in,” Burke said. “With the storm so stationary, we’re expecting off and on rainfall through at least Wednesday ... Rainfall predictions are as high as we’ve ever made for a storm.”Five people have already died in the Houston area, according to the NWS. Authorities urge citizens to stay off the streets and to climb to rooftops if trapped.Flood maps of the area show a city surrounded by floodwater:“What’s making it so catastrophic for Houston have been the ways the rain bands have just been lining up,” Daniel Cohan, an atmospheric scientist and professor at Rice University in Houston, told HuffPost. “People need to realize this is still an ongoing event.”Meanwhile, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is preparing to occupy Texas for years to come. When asked how long FEMA relief efforts will be ongoing in the Houston area and elsewhere, agency administrator Brock Long told CNN, “FEMA is going to be there for years.”“This disaster is going to be a landmark event,” he said.Alexander Kaufman contributed reporting.This story has been updated with comment from Daniel Cohan."

Conor, you are a hell of a champion.” McGregor, who had never fought in a professional boxing match until Saturday, had surprised — and impressed — fans and pundits with his strong showing early on in the fight. The mixed martial arts fighter, however, started to languish as the bout drew on.Mayweather won by technical knockout in the 10th round. The win means the boxer, who earned at least $100 million from Saturday’s fight, will retire with a 50-0 professional record.As SB Nation notes, this isn’t the first time Mayweather has retired, having done so twice before — first in 2007 and then in 2015.Mayweather insists this time’s the real deal, but some fans aren’t quite so convinced.

24,POLITICS,Trump Has Essentially Abdicated The Basic Responsibilities Of A President,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-presidential-harvey-charlottesville-tillerson_us_59a2e889e4b06d67e33846e1,And people within his own administration are starting to notice.,2017-08-27,"President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Phoenix on Aug. 22, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a321831e00002700c5f806.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was a stunning moment. On Sunday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggested that the president of the United States does not speak for American values.After deflecting questions from Fox News’ Chris Wallace about President Donald Trump’s failure to condemn white supremacist groups who incited deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, by saying that he and the State Department “represent America’s values,” Tillerson said that “the president speaks for himself.”Tillerson’s statement caps a tumultuous two weeks in which Trump demonstrated that he has abandoned essential duties of the office, failing to provide basic, measured responses to violence and natural disasters.Throughout last week, he continued to defend his widely condemned response to the violence in Charlottesville — in which he delayed and then backtracked on a denunciation of white nationalist, KKK and neo-Nazi groups — including during a campaign-style rally in Phoenix.Trump’s failure to provide the most elementary leadership earned criticism from lawmakers and leaders around the world — even from a United Nations panel on combating racial discrimination, which expressed deep concern about “the example this failure could set for the rest of the world.”The night Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas, unleashing potentially historic rainfall, Trump announced he was pardoning former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who illegally targeted Latinos and was convicted of criminal contempt for violating a court order. In doing so, he bypassed the Department of Justice’s normal pardon procedures. (Trump reportedly asked his attorney general about closing the criminal case against Arpaio months earlier.)On Sunday, as residents of Texas began evaluating the flooding and damage from the storm, Trump issued a stream of tweets congratulating authorities and himself for the recovery effort, which he bragged was “going well!” The tweets about Hurricane Harvey were sandwiched between posts on unrelated topics, including the president’s personal grievances.For example, Trump immediately followed the announcement that he would visit Texas with a tweet boasting about his election victory in a different state, while suggesting that he would help unseat the state’s Democratic senator.Tillerson is not the only administration official attempting to distance himself from the president in recent days.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis can be heard telling U.S. troops in Jordan to “hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other,” in a video posted Thursday on Facebook. Mattis also said the U.S. will “get the power of inspiration back,” which many interpreted as criticism of Trump’s leadership. It’s unclear exactly when Mattis made the impromptu remarks, though he stopped in Jordan during his overseas trip last week.“You’re a great example for our country right now, and it has got problems,” Mattis said in the video. “You know it and I know it. It’s got problems we don’t have in the military. And you just hold the line, my fine soldiers and sailors and airmen and Marines.”The president’s economic adviser, Gary Cohn, told the Financial Times that he contemplated resigning after Trump’s Charlottesville remarks, saying the administration “can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups.”Of course, many in the Trump administration still unambiguously defend the president. After Trump delivered a scripted but conspicuously vague speech on his Afghanistan war strategy, Vice President Mike Pence insisted Trump’s primetime address signaled “American resolve.” Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the speech demonstrated “the signs of a president.”The next day, Trump reverted to form at his no-holds-barred Arizona rally, making it next to impossible to believe that he will treat the presidency with the gravity the office is meant to hold."

He doesn’t know what’s going on,” Bruso narrates in one of 10 YouTube videos documenting the bird’s surprise visit. “He just kind of hopped on in and doesn’t want to leave. I’m not sure what to make of it.”Bruso said he tried to shoo the hawk away, to no avail. Videos later showed the animal perched on the door of his parked car, still refusing to fly away. Bruso eventually took the bird inside and gave it chicken hearts to snack on.It didn’t take long for the feathered refugee to earn the name “Harvey the Hurricane Hawk” from Bruso ― as well as a flock of concerned and curious fans.Harvey stayed in Bruso’s home overnight, but a worker with the Texas Wildlife Rehab Coalition was seen scooping the bird up on Saturday and taking it to a shelter for professional care.“He’s been free to go, any time now, but they’re going to take him,” Bruso said as a woman with TWRC retrieved Harvey. “He may need to be rehabilitated so everyone knows he’s in good hands.” A TWRC spokeswoman confirmed to HuffPost in an email on Sunday that the bird is “safe with a licensed rehabilitator.” She also shared a video of the hawk in a cage.“He has an injury that is preventing him from flying, so would not have survived the storm if he was not picked up,” an unidentified woman is heard saying in the video.The woman also notes that road flooding is preventing rescuers from reaching the wildlife center to perform an X-ray on the bird. Once the roads clear up, the hawk and other animals will undergo full checkups, she says.TWRC accepts donations to care for the animals it rescues through its website.This story has been updated to include comment from TWRC.

26,GREEN,Why Houston Is So Prone To Devastating Floods,Lydia O'Connor and Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/houston-flood-history-reason_us_59a2f0e3e4b05710aa5ce9ad,Houston has a problem.,2017-08-27,"Floodwaters caused by Hurricane Harvey, seen from a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter on Aug. 26, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a3132d1e00002700c5f7f7.jpeg?cache=U3wsbi34Yp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The storm unfolding in Houston is “beyond anything experienced,” the National Weather Service said Sunday afternoon. While the rainfall and floods soaking the region are poised to shatter records, the Houston area has become well-acquainted with this type of weather in recent years.Hurricane Harvey, which has been downgraded to a tropical storm since making landfall in Texas on Friday, is the latest in a series of wet weather events to devastate the Houston region, though past rainfall and flooding will assuredly pale in comparison to that brought on by Harvey.The National Weather Service expects “catastrophic and life-threatening” rainfall in some areas to total 50 inches, the highest ever recorded in Texas. While rain is expected to continue for several days, flooding records have already been shattered throughout Harris County, in at least one spot by more than five feet. As of Sunday, this August is the wettest month ever recorded in Houston.The Houston metro area has seen a major rise in rainfall in recent decades, more so than most places in the U.S. Since the 1950s, the region has seen a 167 percent increase in heavy downpours, Climate Central found in 2015. And some of the worst events have occurred in recent memory. In April 2016, the area was soaked by abnormally intense rainfall as 15 inches fell in some areas in just 24 hours. The local flood control district declared it a one-in-10,000 year rainfall event.In May 2015, at least six people died and more than a thousand vehicles were submerged when 12 inches of rain fell in the area in just 10 hours. Similar rainfall totals were documented in July 2012.Harvey has prompted many comparisons to Tropical Storm Allison, which in 2001 claimed 23 lives in the Houston metro area. But it was “a measly little storm” compared to this week’s event, CNN meteorologist Jennifer Varian said Sunday. Several factors ― both natural and manmade ― have made Houston, the fourth-largest city in the U.S., a hotbed for severe rain and floods.Houston is just 40 miles from the Gulf Coast, making it especially susceptible to storms that tend to linger in the area from late spring through early fall, The Weather Channel explained. Additionally, the city is exceptionally flat and sits about 50 feet above sea level, making it prone to flooding when heavy rainfall is coupled with already-rising sea levels. The Houston metro area sits beside multiple waterways and sprawls out in every direction. This has long put the city at risk of a natural disaster.“Houston has basically just grown outwards,” Andrew Dessler, a climatologist and professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, told HuffPost by phone on Sunday. “As Houston grows out, you’re paving over more and more space and you’re collecting rain over a larger area that’s just hitting cement. It’s got to go somewhere, so it gets concentrated where the elevation is low.”Houston has suffered more deaths and property loss from flooding than any other locality in the country since 1960, according to data Texas A&M collected. Worse yet, Texas ranks second only to Louisiana in dollars paid in flood claims, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. Plus, the state does not require municipalities to enroll in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s National Flood Insurance Program.The last major storm to hit Houston, 2008′s Hurricane Ike, came as what The Atlantic described as a wake-up call. But it failed to rouse urban planners ahead of the storm now ravaging the city. “Since Ike, people have known this is a looming problem, and they haven’t done anything about it,” Dessler said. “We’re doomed to repeat this every so many years, and it’s just going to keep getting worse because climate change is clearly exacerbating the impact.” He added: “This is a taste of the future.” Climate change is expected to amplify all of these factors as rising global temperatures give storm systems an extra push. That was evident during Texas’ 2015 floods, Michael Mann, a climate scientist and director of Penn State’s Earth System Science Center, told HuffPost at the time.“Human-caused climate change is in many cases the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Mann said. “That extra fuel that takes what would have been a really bad flood and turns [it] into a catastrophic flood.”But a warming planet is just part of the problem, said Daniel Cohan, a professor of environmental engineering at Rice University in Houston. Storms can take unpredictable paths and, by sheer misfortune, Harvey appeared to gather over particularly warm waters, further intensifying the hurricane, he said. Climate change makes clear the need for better planning, but the element of chance, which was always a factor, underscores policymakers’ lack of preparedness. “You have a guy who’s smoking, overeating and has bad luck, and he has a heart attack,” Cohan told HuffPost. “For an event to be at the scale that Harvey’s at, you need to have a lot of things go wrong.” This story has been updated with comment from Andrew Dessler and Daniel Cohan."

The first man appears to yell a racial slur at the black man, then fires the gun toward the ground in the direction of the counterprotesters. The shooter then leaves the scene by joining a line of white supremacist protesters and walking past law enforcement officers, who were standing behind metal barricades about 10 feet away. Police arrested Richard Wilson Preston, 52, in connection with the incident in the video above, the Daily Progress reported on Saturday. Wilson was charged with discharging a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school during the so-called “Unite The Right” rally on Aug. 12. He is in custody in Towson, Maryland.Rosia Parker, a Charlottesville activist who was there when the man fired his gun, told the New York Times that police did nothing when the shooting occurred.“We all heard it and ran ― I know damn well they heard it,” Parker told the Times, referencing the police who were standing behind the barricades. “They never moved.”Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police, told the newspaper that troopers did not react to the shooting because they couldn’t hear the gun being fired over “the loud volume of the crowd yelling and chanting, drums and music.” “Had any one of our troopers witnessed that incident they would have immediately acted just as they did for the other four arrests made during the weekend,” Geller told the Times.In the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville, the ACLU of Virginia has called on Charlottesville police to release body camera footage from the rally showing any civil rights violations similar to the one in the video.According to the ACLU’s official statement, the video of the shooting is “consistent with our regular calls” for law enforcement agencies to release footage from the protests “that depicts any incident of public concern.”The video was discovered while ACLU staffers were reviewing footage that staff and volunteers documented at the Charlottesville rally. The group turned in the video to the FBI on Aug. 17 and sent copies to the Virginia State Police and Charlottesville Police Department on Aug. 20. A person familiar with the video told HuffPost the ACLU refrained from making the video public until an arrest was made.The Charlottesville Police Department and the Charlottesville communications director did not return HuffPost’s request for comment.Only eight people were arrested on the day that violence broke out between white supremacists, fringe groups and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, according to the Times. Among those arrested was James Fields, a 20-year-old white supremacist who killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injured dozens of others when he rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters. Two other arrests were made in connection with another violent crime caught on video that took place during the rally. Police arrested Daniel Patrick Borden, 18, and Alex Michael Ramos, 33, in connection with the beating of Deandre Harris, a black 20-year-old who was protesting the white supremacy rally.A mob of white supremacists beat Harris with metal poles in a parking lot near police headquarters during the rally, leaving Harris bloodied, with a broken wrist, deep gashes to the head and a chipped tooth. The assault on Harris was filmed and shared widely on social media."

Rimalower, 41, will return to the stage Aug. 28 at The Art House in Provincetown, Massachusetts with his acclaimed one-man show, “Patti Issues.” The show, which The New York Times praised for its “sharp, observational comedy,” uses Rimalower’s obsession with Broadway diva Patti LuPone as the foil to a deeper narrative about his fractured relationship with his father, who eventually came out as gay. (Catch a sneak peek of the show in the video above.) Rimalower’s Provincetown performance will be a unique milestone, as he’ll perform on a stage on which LuPone has performed several times. “It’s where I saw Patti in 2012,” he recalled. “She sang ‘Rainbow High’ [from ‘Evita’] for the first time in 30 years and took me out to dinner and to watch the 4th of July Fireworks with Ryan Murphy and his husband,” he recalled. “Then she got my friends drunk on Prosecco and hand fed me oysters ’til we closed down the joint.”In 2012, Rimalower told HuffPost that he “wanted to write a show about my experiences with Patti because she’s been so important to me, and I love to talk about that and think about that.” Ultimately, he opted for a more personal narrative. “I realized that while I could go on and on about Patti in a way that would only be interesting to people who care,” he said, “that’s not the project I ultimately wanted to write here.”It’s the first in a series of upcoming engagements for Rimalower, who has directed performances by Cole Escola, Leslie Kritzer and Molly Pope, among others. He’ll bring “Patti Issues” back to The Duplex in New York Sept. 11 and Nov. 13. His other one-man Off-Broadway show, “Bad with Money,” plays The Duplex Oct. 9 and Dec. 11.Audio recordings of both “Patti Issues” and “Bad With Money” are slated to be released by Roven Records Nov. 26.

The filmmakers speak to the systemic neglect that ravages African-American communities around the country, how St. Louis functions simultaneously as a remnant of the old South and as a modern city, and how to find hope in a bleak climate of hate.“I really want for those of us who are on the receiving end of systemic oppression to understand that we can find dignity in resistance,” Foyalan says.Listen to the full podcast and to past editions of Scheer Intelligence at KCRW.com"

This is an opportunity for moderate Americans to come in with opposing views. We will not allow the extremists to tear apart this country.”But there’s a reason why the city and its mayor, Ed Lee, attempted to block permits for the rally; why House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called it a “white supremacist rally at Crissy Field”; and why counterprotests were planned in opposition throughout the city: These rallies just keep attracting white supremacists, weapons and violence.The Freedom Rally’s main organizer, Joey Gibson, is no stranger to how this works. The far-right icon has acknowledged that his rallies ― including one held in Portland, Oregon, in June ― attract white nationalists and other far-right extremists, many of whom bring along makeshift weaponry and spew forth hate speech. But Gibson has repeatedly claimed he’s not one of them.“I’m brown, so I’m definitely not a white supremacist, definitely not a white nationalist, definitely not a Nazi because I want limited government, Hitler was all about big government,” he told KOIN shortly after the violence in Charlottesville.And though Gibson claimed this rally was set up to “spread a message of love,” you needed only to look at the planned keynote speakers to see an entirely different picture. One of them, Kyle “Based Stickman” Chapman, is an unquestionably violent far-right “celebrity” who has spent nearly a decade behind bars on three felony convictions. He earned his “Stickman” moniker after beating a protester with a stick at a violent pro-Trump rally in Berkeley.That said, police had San Francisco handled. Police Chief Bill Scott said “violence isn’t going to be tolerated” and promised a large police presence. Streets around Crissy Field were expected to be on lockdown, and the park service announced a ban on items regularly seen at these rallies: guns and weapons, helmets and shields, balloons, selfie sticks and pepper spray among them.After the event was canceled, Gibson and Chapman gave their press conference from inside the darkened home, complaining that they weren’t given a fair chance.“Everywhere we go, the police, the city, they wanna shut it down,” Gibson said.In the afternoon, crowds gathered at Ocean Beach in the shape of a heart and sang even more:"

However, the member of three-time Grammy-winning Pentatonix’s debut solo EP L•O•V•E is filled with lessons discovered when that naïveté was stripped away. “A bully is going to be a bully, and you have to stand up for yourself,” the singer told Podomatic's No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast. “You can't expect everyone else is going to come and run to your aid. You have to stand your ground; that's very important.”Maldonado formed Pentatonix with openly gay high school best friends Mitch Grassi and Scott Hoying in 2011. They were later joined by Avi Kaplan and Kevin Olusola, with whom they went on to win the third season of popular NBC competition series The Sing-Off. Since that time, the multi-platinum a capella quintet has released seven albums, two of which debuted at atop Billboard album charts. The group’s televised holiday specials have proven ratings blockbusters, earning Emmy nominations to join three Grammy Awards.The rise to success has had its rough patches, Maldonado intimated. Not one to enjoy conflict, the star’s response was often “Well, I'll just keep being nice and maybe they won't be mean to me or won't say those things.” That doesn’t always work, she admitted. ""I learned from experience you've got to take action,"" she said. ""Not violent action, by any means, but you've got to take action in taking care of yourself and standing up for yourself.""According to Maldonado — cutesie “Kirstie” on The Sing-Off, now rebranded as sultry “Kirstin” — her new attitude is strongly reflected on the album. “See It,” for example, describes her moment of clarity. “You can't just hope for the best” in times of conflict, she stated. “I want to really empower my listeners to feel that. It takes more than just wishful thinking sometimes.”WATCH: Kirstin’s Debut Single “Break a Little”Likewise, “Bad Weather” packs a similar message in dealing with haters. She says “the anthem for everyone” reflects both her own life experiences and perspective gained from watching how others treat her friends. “I always see people being really shitty on social media and just hate on each other whether it's because of who they love or who they identify as or people being just so dumb or mean or hateful for no reason,” said Maldonado.“It's important to accept yourself and believe in who you are and not let all that hateful talk bring you down and ruin how special each person is,” continued the Mexican-American, whose childhood friendship with Hoying and Grassi has made her a long-time LGBTQ ally.For Maldonado, her first musical project outside Pentatonix proved “exciting and freeing.” Whereas “the group umbrella” is often “daunting” — as songs must be both a cappella and pop, she pointed out — L•O•V•E came with none of those confines.“I love being able to fulfill such a huge and special part of myself with Pentatonix,” she related, “But there is still so much more to me that, honestly, people don't get to see because we're in a group.”Working from a wide array of influences, Maldonado says she first expected the album to have a more electronic edge. Instead, the six songs on L•O•V•E cover pop and R&B with elements of dance, each infused with the singer’s own lyrical views.“It was really lovely and really therapeutic to be writing about my own experiences or about things I'm passionate about,” she said. “It was really awesome to discover myself without limitations and see that person and what that was.”It was a revelation she might not have had without her own Prince Charming, Jeremy Michael Lewis, Maldonado admits. In very Disney fashion, the couple became engaged May 2017 in Paris.“I’d never met someone who challenges me so much, and we are so different in so many ways,” Maldonado said of her fiancé, who interestingly enough also competed on The Sing-Off two years after Pentatonix. “He challenges me every day to be better. I owe pretty much all of the start of this album to him.”WATCH: Kirstin’s “Naked,” Dedicated to Her FiancéAfter helping arrange the team who ultimately produced L•O•V•E, Lewis even drove Maldonado to her first recording session — then stayed to make sure she “wasn’t freaked out.” The first song penned for the record, not by accident, was single “Naked.” She admits it is something of a love letter to her future husband.“He's just been so crucial in my journey, honestly, of finding myself as a person and an artist,” she said.With Maldonado’s solo release, and Hoying and Grassi doing their own side-project as Superfruit, fans started to worry about Pentatonix’s future. When Kaplan announced his departure over the summer, speculation that the collective was finished reached fever pitch. Maldonado is quick to squash such concern. “No, Pentatonix is not done,” she stated emphatically. RCA Records, the group’s home, agrees. On Aug. 22, the label announced the act will close 2017 with a dozen concert dates, kicking off Dec. 3 in Chicago.Also on the slate is the Oct. 20 release of A Pentatonix Christmas Deluxe, an extended version of the chart-topping 2016 holiday set. After last year’s A Pentatonix Christmas Special drew in excess of 10 million viewers for NBC, a second TV special is coming to The Peacock as well.By then, Maldonado indicates, Pentatonix will have replaced its departed bass. In many ways, those shows could prove as much a reinvention of Pentatonix as this solo set was for Kirstin. “It'll be different,” Maldonado concluded about the group’s new line-up. “It should be different -- one of our members is leaving -- but we'll continue on.”With L•O•V•E now out for the world to hear, and more from Pentatonix to come, it seems a new chapter in Kirstin’s fairytale is only just beginning.LISTEN: Kirstin discusses L•O•V•E, online bullies, working with Dolly Parton on Party Foul Radio."
35,POLITICS,Controversial Trump Adviser Sebastian Gorka Leaves White House,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-adviser-sebastian-gorka-fired_us_599dc73ee4b0d97c4000f59e,He has long faced questions about his ties to Nazi sympathizers and far-right Hungarian political groups.,2017-08-26,Sebastian Gorka participates in a discussion during the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 24.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599dc9321900002500dd50fd.jpeg?cache=C3EJDdfa7F&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sebastian Gorka, a controversial adviser to President Donald Trump, is leaving the White House after months of criticism about his ties to far-right foreign political groups and his description of Islam as an inherently violent religion.The Federalist published a copy of his resignation letter Friday. But after the letter was made public, a White House official implied that Gorka was forced to step down. “Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House,” the official said late Friday. In the letter, Gorka appears to allude to the recent departure of several of his allies in the White House, most notably Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon.“[G]iven recent events, it is clear to me that forces that do not support the MAGA promise are ― for now ― ascendant within the White House,” Gorka wrote in the letter obtained by the Federalist. “As a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the People’s House.”Gorka singled out Trump’s recently announced Afghanistan policy for criticism. He was particularly concerned that Trump’s speech did not include the phrases “radical Islam” or “radical Islamic terrorism,” he wrote in the letter. Gorka’s official title at the White House was deputy assistant to the president, but it was never clear what his actual duties entailed. He regularly appeared on television as a vociferous defender of Trump’s national security agenda and worldview. But he reportedly wasn’t able to get security clearance that would have allowed him to sit in on the most high-level national security meetings or read classified information.Gorka was closely aligned with Bannon, who left the administration earlier this month. Bannon has since returned to the far-right media outlet Breitbart News, which Gorka wrote for before joining the administration. Like Bannon, Gorka expressed a dark view of Islam. The FBI used to employ Gorka to teach courses on terrorism, but the Daily Beast reported that the agency stopped working with him after he told students that all Muslims adhere to Sharia law and will eventually be radicalized.“Regrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will ‘Make America Great Again,’ have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months. This was made patently obvious as I read the text of your speech on Afghanistan this week,” Gorka continued in his resignation letter. “The fact that those who drafted and approved the speech removed any mention of Radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism proves that a crucial element of your presidential campaign has been lost.”Before joining the White House, Gorka was an obscure far-right fringe character. He promoted himself as an authority on counterterrorism, but national security experts mocked his credentials and refuted his characterization of Islam as a path toward violent radicalism. Most terrorism experts and academic say terrorists become radicalized through a combination of factors ― poverty, poor governance, lack of opportunity, foreign intervention and religious ideology, for example ― but Gorka argues that Islam is the driving force. He does not speak Arabic and has spent little time in the Middle East. Gorka joined the Trump campaign in 2015 as a paid adviser. Since then, he has celebrated Trump’s frequent warnings about the threat of “radical Islamic terrorism” and accused the Obama administration of being hamstrung by political correctness. When Trump won the election last year, Gorka told Fox News that “the alpha males are back.”Gorka wore a medal signifying membership in the Vitezi Rend, a Hungarian group that collaborated with the Nazis in World War II, when he attended Trump’s inaugural ball in January, LobeLog reported. Members of the group told the Forward that Gorka is a member of the Vitezi Rend, but Gorka has said the medal belonged to his father and that he wears it in memory of his father’s anti-communist efforts in Hungary. The Vitezi Rend debacle prompted reporters to dive into Gorka’s past. Gorka, who was born in Britain to Hungarian parents, founded a political party in Hungary in 2007. The party’s members were politicians who had previously belonged to Jobbik, a party that has espoused anti-immigration, anti-Semitic and homophobic positions, the Forward reported. Gorka expressed support for an anti-Semitic Hungarian militia called the Magyar Garda in August 2007, the Forward found. The European Court of Human Rights accused the group of working to create “an essentially racist legal order.” People who worked with Gorka at the National Defense University and Marine Corps University over the past decade say they don’t recall him making negative comments about Jewish people. But some remember Gorka hinting at an anti-Islam worldview. He once told David Ucko, who worked at the NDU at the time, that devout Muslims are more inclined to celebrate violence than Christian because the religion was founded by a warrior, Ucko told HuffPost.Talk of Gorka stepping down began as early as May, after news reports surfaced that detailed his ties to Nazi sympathizers and far-right Hungarian political groups. But Trump and Bannon personally intervened to save his job, the Daily Beast reported. In the following weeks, national security adviser H.R. McMaster pushed out several White House staffers who shared Gorka’s extremist ideology. But even as Gorka’s like-minded allies left the White House, he appeared on television, offering bombastic defenses of his boss and berating the media for criticizing the president. When Trump failed to condemn the bombing of a mosque in Minnesota, Gorka suggested the incident could be a false flag attack perpetrated by the president’s political opponents. When Trump went off script and warned of “fire and fury” against North Korea, Gorka praised the president’s show of strength ― even as the secretary of state and secretary of defense took a more restrained approach. Days before a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Gorka reprimanded the media for reporting on the violent extremism threat posed by white nationalists.Nick Visser contributed to this report."

37,POLITICS,"Trump Pardons Former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Who Illegally Targeted Latinos",Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-pardon-joe-arpaio_us_599da366e4b0a296083b9758,"The self-declared ""law and order"" president backs a man who defied a court order.",2017-08-26,"As sheriff, Arpaio established -- and showed off to the media -- a ""tent city"" prison camp.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599db09b1e00003c00c5efdb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Friday pardoned a notorious former Arizona sheriff who willfully violated a federal judge’s order by unlawfully detaining individuals his officers claimed might be in the country illegally.Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had previously proclaimed himself “America’s toughest sheriff,” was convicted of criminal contempt last month for violating a 2011 order that barred Arpaio and his office from detaining individuals solely based on suspicions about their legal status. Arpaio, 85, was scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 5.“Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life’s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration,” the White House said in a statement late Friday. “Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now eighty-five years old, and after more than fifty years of admirable service to our Nation, he is a worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon.”Trump’s pardon of Arpaio, the first of his presidency, amounts to a tacit endorsement of Arpaio’s discriminatory tactics and reads as a favor to a political ally. The media-savvy former sheriff, known for parading inmates around in pink underwear, supported the former reality TV star’s presidential campaign and spoke at the Republican National Convention last summer. Both men were prominent promoters of the racist conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the United States.Arpaio, who served as sheriff from 1993 through 2016, had long been accused of discriminatory practices against Latinos. A 2011 report by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division concluded there was reasonable cause to believe that Arpaio and his office engaged in a pattern or practice of unlawful policing and racial profiling. Arpaio’s officers called Latinos “wetbacks,” “Mexican bitches,” “fucking Mexicans” and “stupid Mexicans,” the Justice Department found, and Latino drivers were four to nine times as likely to be stopped by his officers as non-Latino drivers were. A lawsuit filed by the Justice Department was settled in 2015.“With his pardon of Arpaio, Trump has chosen lawlessness over justice, division over unity, hurt over healing,” Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement Friday. “Once again, the president has acted in support of illegal, failed immigration enforcement practices that target people of color and have been struck down by the courts. His pardon of Arpaio is a presidential endorsement of racism.”Arpaio took a break from dinner with his wife on Friday night to call into Sean Hannity’s program on Fox News. Hannity said Arpaio was “convicted ... only of criminal contempt” and said he was “very relieved” for Arpaio.Arpaio said that it was “great” to hear about the pardon and that he loves the president.Hannity, who apparently thought that a former sheriff charged with a federal crime would have somehow landed in his former county jail, joked with Arpaio about the conditions in Arpaio’s former facility, referencing pink underwear and the bologna sandwiches served there.But Arpaio said incarceration wouldn’t have been that big of a deal.“Sean, it’s federal, I could play bocce. ... It would’ve been alright,” he said.At a Tuesday evening rally in Phoenix, Trump had signaled that the pardon was coming. The president claimed Arpaio had been “convicted for doing his job.” But Trump said, “I’ll make a prediction: I think he’s going to be just fine, OK?”Ahead of his trial, the Justice Department had argued that Arpaio “viewed his defiance of the federal government’s directives on immigration as a badge of honor” and “bragged about his deputies’ contemptuous immigration enforcement practices to the press.”In finding Arpaio guilty of criminal contempt, U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton said in July that the former sheriff had shown “flagrant disregard” for the 2011 order banning him from detaining people because he thought they were in the country illegally.“Not only did Defendant abdicate responsibility, he announced to the world and to his subordinates that he was going to continue business as usual no matter who said otherwise,” Bolton ruled on July 31. “The evidence at trial proves beyond a reasonable doubt and the Court finds that Judge Snow issued a clear and definite order enjoining Defendant from detaining persons for further investigation without reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed; that Defendant knew of the order; and that Defendant willfully violated the order by failing to do anything to ensure his subordinates’ compliance and by directing them to continue to detain persons for whom no criminal charges could be filed.”Arpaio’s lawyers have since moved for an acquittal, arguing that the government’s handling of the case reeked of “unconstitutional selective prosecution.” They questioned the court’s “motivations” in not allowing a jury trial. They also claimed that the verdict was driven by the desire “to vindicate the authority of a fellow judge.” And they argued that Arpaio had a right to be present for the issuing of the verdict, which was in fact emailed to his lawyers. The prosecution has not yet responded to the defense’s motion.Trump’s pardon of Arpaio skipped over the typical review process for pardons, which are usually routed through the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney.The pardon came less than two weeks after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned deadly when a neo-Nazi sympathizer crashed his vehicle into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators. Trump faced criticism for what was seen as his lackluster condemnation of white supremacists and his attempt to equate the racists in Charlottesville with those who turned out to oppose them. Civil rights advocates like Vanita Gupta, the former chief of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, warned that pardoning Arpaio ― who she said “personifies the same bigotry and intolerance we witnessed in Charlottesville” ― would sow hate and division. “If President Trump uses his power to pardon a discredited law enforcement official who persistently engaged in illegal racial profiling of the Latino community, it will not be a dog whistle to the so-called ‘alt right’ and white supremacists, but a bull horn,” Gupta said.This is a developing story.

Greg Abbott said “dramatic flooding” became his primary concern after Harvey was downgraded to a tropical storm Saturday.VICTORIA, Texas ― After Hurricane Harvey was downgraded to a tropical storm on Saturday, meteorologists issued warnings about the potential for “catastrophic and life-threatening flooding,” as many areas between San Antonio and Houston are expected to get massive amounts of rainfall.Meteorologist Ryan Maue said 20 trillion gallons of water could fall on Texas in the next week. Michael Lowry of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research said that more than 60,000 square miles are under high or moderate risk for excessive rainfall through Sunday morning. At least two storm-related deaths have been confirmed, and imminent floods mean many more Texans could face danger in the next week.During a press conference Saturday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said “dramatic flooding” was his primary worry about the tropical storm, which barely moved throughout Saturday evening.“Our biggest concern is between 20 and 30 more inches of rain in areas ranging from Corpus Christi over to Houston,” Abbott said. “We want to do everything we possibly can to keep people out of rising water.”On Saturday, flooding caused the death of one motorist in Houston, according to Gary Norman, spokesman for the city’s emergency operations center. He told the AP late Saturday that the person, identified as a woman, had been driving along flooded streets when she “got out of her vehicle in high water.” The cause of death has yet to be confirmed.Earlier Saturday, C. J. Wax, the mayor of Rockport in Aransas County, confirmed the death of a man who died while trapped in his burning house, unable to be reached by rescuers during the height of the hurricane. Wax said at least 12 other people sustained injuries.Rockport, where the storm made landfall Friday night, appears to be the hardest-hit area so far. The town of 10,000 is about 30 miles north of Corpus Christi, and has reported major damage to homes and businesses. Officials there told The Weather Channel that the loss of cellular coverage was hindering rescue work. The rain came down hard Saturday afternoon, and while the wind remained strong, it was nothing like Friday night’s, which brought down trees and electric poles. Along a stretch of road just south of Victoria, 30 miles from the coast, most of the buildings were boarded up and evacuated. The wind and rain made travel conditions through Victoria hazardous Saturday. The city had widespread power outages, with most of the stop lights in the area not working throughout the day. The Texas National Guard was assessing the damage in the area Saturday afternoon.Debris and power lines covered many of the streets. Several huge trees, pulled up by their roots, had fallen on top of houses and across roads, making some of them impassable. The majority of broken windows were in large buildings. Storm-wise residents had boarded up their windows and taped their plate glass.As of Saturday afternoon, there appeared to be no major flooding in Victoria, though some low-lying streets were under water. Natural gas could be smelled in some areas, suggesting some lines had been broken.No gas stations, stores or restaurants in Victoria appeared to be open. Despite the damage, lots of people were driving around the area Saturday afternoon.About an hour and a half away in Rosenberg, a city in the Houston metropolitan area, mandatory evacuations were ordered after forecasts predicted a record crest of the Brazos River, which could lead to major flooding.The massive, slow-moving storm dumped almost 15 inches of rain in some parts of Texas, and is expected to stay over the state for up to eight days.Abbott said Saturday a disaster declaration has been issued for 50 of Texas’ 254 counties.There was a tornado watch in effect in parts of the state ― and reports of a potential tornado strike in Katy, just outside of Houston.The National Weather Service began issuing flash flood warnings for Houston Saturday morning. The National Hurricane Center warned that the coast should expect 15 to 30 inches of rain, but possibly as much as 40 inches in some areas. Houston, the country’s fourth most populous city, is included in the high-end of those rainfall projections.“This prolonged pattern continues to favor rounds after rounds after rounds of very heavy rainfall that will lead to catastrophic and life-threatening flooding,” warned the National Weather Service’s Houston/Galveston division in a message Saturday morning.

Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) has assessed the problem with President Donald Trump’s ban on transgender servicemen and women in a sharply clarifying way.“When I was bleeding to death in my Black Hawk helicopter after I was shot down, I didn’t care if the American troops risking their lives to help save me were gay, straight, transgender, black, white or brown,” Duckworth said in a statement shared Thursday on Twitter.The senator is an Iraq War veteran who lost both legs after her helicopter was shot down in 2004. She offered her judgment on Twitter after new reports suggested that the White House is giving the Pentagon six months to implement the new transgender policy.Duckworth called the military ban “discriminatory,” “disruptive” and “counterproductive” to national security.“If you are willing to risk your life for our country and you can do the job, you should be able to serve ― no matter your gender identity or sexual orientation,” she said.Trump unexpectedly announced that he was pulling transgender troops from the military in a late July tweet. He had made the decision after consulting with “Generals and military experts,” the president said at the time.“Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory,” Trump said, “and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.”The “tremendous medical costs” that Trump cited in his reasoning actually amount to a 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in the Defense Department’s total health care spending, according to the Rand Corporation, a nonprofit research institution that offers analyses to the U.S. armed forces. Rand estimates that 30 to 140 transgender service members would seek hormone treatments per year and that 25 to 130 individuals would opt for surgery related to gender confirmation.The Pentagon lifted the previous ban on transgender service members in 2016 after reviewing the implications for military readiness.Rand, which studied the matter, wrote in a statement at that time: “If the U.S. military decides to let transgender people serve openly, the number would likely be a small fraction of the total force and have minimal impact on readiness and health care costs.”"
46,POLITICS,Republicans Aren't Moderates Just Because They Don't Like Donald Trump,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kasich-2020-presidential-bid-moderate_us_59a05a32e4b06d67e3375b0c,"Ohio Gov. John Kasich is reportedly plotting a ""moderate"" challenge to Trump's presidency. There's only one problem.",2017-08-25,"Ohio Gov. John Kasich may have sounded moderate during the 2016 GOP primary, but his record suggests otherwise.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a060e11e00003c00c5f520.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) seems to be plotting a potential 2020 challenge to President Donald Trump, with Axios reporting Friday that he could team up with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) to launch a cross-party independent presidential campaign.Kasich has repeatedly distanced himself from Trump since losing to him in the 2016 GOP primary, and he has floated a potential 2020 challenge to the president in an attempt to appeal to the sort of “Never Trump” Republicans in his mold who have increasingly criticized the president as being not quite one of them ― as former U.S. Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.) did in a Washington Post editorial this week.Hickenlooper’s presence on the ticket would seem to give the prospective bid moderate credibility. Kasich has in the past supported a pathway to legal status (though not citizenship) for undocumented immigrants, and he notably expanded Medicaid under Obamacare in Ohio. He and Hickenlooper now want to add “job creation” to their bipartisan agenda, according to Axios.Democrats, however, don’t appear sold: One strategist told Axios that the plan “sounds like a No Labels fantasy, but moderate Dems would hate it.” They are right to be skeptical. Aside from his apparent friendship with Hickenlooper, there’s little evidence that Kasich is actually “moderate” in any realistic sense of the word. Instead, his governorship of Ohio and his ill-fated 2016 presidential bid make it abundantly clear that Kasich is a standard conservative Republican who looks moderate thanks only to Trump’s unique ability to drastically lower our standards for what qualifies as moderation. As governor, for instance, Kasich targeted unions and their workers, and he cut voting access in a way that disproportionately affected African Americans. He has repeatedly attempted to defund Planned Parenthood, and he made doing so a national goal during his presidential campaign. Kasich has campaigned for a federal balanced budget amendment, a conservative policy goal that ― while economically unsound and unnecessary ― would force deep cuts to federal poverty and assistance programs and hamstring the government’s ability to combat economic downturns. He favors using block grants for social assistance programs, which would give more control over spending to the states, and supports cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.Kasich said during the campaign that he would seek a one-year moratorium on new federal regulations, and he proposed reductions in the size and scope of federal agencies such as the Transportation and Education departments. Like Trump, he supports expanded defense spending and called for a pause on the acceptance of Syrian refugees. As Ohio’s governor, Kasich attempted to cut the state’s capital gains tax rate and eliminated its estate tax. He later slashed top income tax rates while raising sales and other more regressive taxes ― an approach that resulted in a tax increase for the bottom 40 percent of Ohio’s taxpayers, according to a think tank in the state. Kasich, as a candidate, criticized the GOP’s history of “fantasy tax plans.” And yet, he also called for broad tax cuts that would reduce the top marginal rate from 39 percent to 28 percent, would eliminate the estate tax, and slash the capital gains tax rate to 15 percent ― all of which amount to massive tax cuts for the wealthy. He favors lowering tax rates on repatriated foreign profits and cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. If all that looks like House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) dream approach to tax and budget policy, it sounds like it too: Kasich, in his campaign platform, refers to the estate tax as the “death tax” and says his cuts are aimed not at the rich but at “job creators.” A lot of those policies are in line with what Trump has talked about, but Kasich has also tried to distance himself from the president. Like many of his fellow Republicans, Kasich criticized the president for refusing to condemn white supremacists after they rallied in Charlottesville, Virginia. He has also said that “Black Lives Matter, especially now,” acknowledged that some African Americans feel as if “the system is working against them,” and supported some criminal justice reforms. And though Kasich has supported repealing most of Obamacare’s key elements, Kasich opposed Trump and Senate Republicans’ version of a replacement bill. Kasich also differs from Trump stylistically: He has called the “coarseness” of Trump’s Twitter-based rhetoric on any number of issues “unacceptable” and “unfortunate.”But opposing white supremacy is not the standard for political centrism. And a preference for moderation in rhetoric does not make a politician moderate. The latter merely points to the main source of discomfort among Republicans like Danforth with their party’s current standard-bearer. They don’t so much oppose his core policy preferences as they dislike his approach toward achieving them.Kasich may differ at points with his party and the president. But if he challenges Trump in 2020, it won’t be evidence of a resurgent political center taking on the right as much as a battle between two Republicans who share largely similar views on the broad strokes of GOP orthodoxy. That Kasich doesn’t talk like Trump ― and that he’s preliminarily attached himself to a Democrat to appeal to the sort of No Labels-loving Washington elites who swoon for “moderates” ― shouldn’t obscure that.

He is just one of the roughly 500 people who have reportedly been killed by coalition airstrikes on ISIS’s former Syrian stronghold since June.ISTANBUL – On July 27, Ali went to a water purification plant in Raqqa city to collect drinking water. As the 16-year-old Raqqa resident waited in line, a U.S.-led coalition jet was somewhere overhead, preparing to launch one of the eight strikes targeting the so-called Islamic State that it would carry out near the militants’ former Syrian stronghold that day.The coalition said it targeted ISIS tactical units and destroyed six fighting positions, a supply cache, an ISIS communication headquarters and an anti-air artillery system that day. What the report failed to mention, however, was that one strike hit the water plant, killing Ali, an aspiring calligrapher and the youngest of Umm Omar’s six children.“Death has become a mercy for people in this tragic situation,” Umm Omar told Syria Deeply. The 50-year-old mother from Damascus is divorced and lives in Turkey, but all her children live in Raqqa with their father.At least 48 other people were also reportedly killed and 40 others injured in Raqqa that day, due to artillery shelling and aerial bombardment in densely populated areas, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).They are among the 480 people, including 119 children, who have been killed by coalition air raids on Raqqa during June and July, according to Airwars, an organization that tracks civilian casualties from international airstrikes in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Earlier this month, the United Nations expressed concern over the safety and protection of the 10,000 to 25,000 people who remain trapped in the city.Syria Deeply spoke with Umm Omar about her youngest son, one of the hundreds of children who have been caught up in the battle over the city.Syria Deeply: How did you hear the news of your son’s death? And when was the last time you saw him?Umm Omar: I did not learn about his death right away. My children hid the news from me for six days, but they eventually had to tell me. My middle son told me that Ali was standing in line, waiting for his turn to collect drinking water from a water purification plant in Wadi Street in the center of Raqqa city, when an international coalition aircraft bombed the neighborhood, and he was killed. The building collapsed on top of those who were there.The last time I saw him was three years ago, during my last visit to the city of Raqqa. I never imagined that it would be the last time I saw him. I went back to Damascus, and in 2016, I left for Turkey.Syria Deeply: Where were you when you heard the news, and how did you feel?Umm Omar: It was Tuesday, August 1. I was at work when I received a notification on WhatsApp. It was a voice message from my [other] son. I first thought he was checking in on me as he usually did, but when I listened to it, I was shocked by the news. He had tried to call me many times, but could not reach me because the internet was very bad.I was in shock and could not talk to anybody. I went back to my sister’s house in the Fateh neighborhood of Istanbul. I still do not know how I got home, but I was calm. I had always expected bad news, because of the terrible conditions in Raqqa, and because I knew that my children were under constant bombardment. I told my sister and her husband about what had happened. I did not fall apart. I was able to hold myself together. I prayed and read the Qur’an for him and for his pure soul. [The day he died] I had a very strange feeling. I had just left work, when I suddenly felt my heart crashing in my chest, and that the world around me was all gray and gloomy. That day, a rainstorm hit Istanbul. It was a very heavy rain loaded with heavy hail.Syria Deeply: When was the last time he spoke to you, and what did he say?Umm Omar: He sent me a voice message through WhatsApp about a week before his death. He told me he was fine and asked me to pray for them. We could not make voice calls, except in rare cases, because of the ban on communication and on the internet in Raqqa.Syria Deeply: Would you tell us a little about Ali?Umm Omar: He was my youngest son, 16 years old. We share the same birthday – he was born on January 1, 2001. He was loved by all of his five siblings. I have three girls, and two other boys; the oldest of them is named Omar. [Ali] was a loving young man. Despite his young age, he was always very mature. He wanted to become a calligrapher or an artist. Ever since he was in the second grade, he had very beautiful handwriting. He was very talented. He had a crush on my niece, Sabah. He always called her by her nickname, Sabbouha, and bought her chocolate with his allowance. He used to say that he wanted to marry her when he grew up.Syria Deeply: Did you want to be in Raqqa to bid him farewell?Umm Omar: I wish I had seen him after he was killed, but God deprived me of that moment. His death will continue to hurt my heart and my soul until I die.Syria Deeply: Did you have a memorial service for him?Umm Omar: Yes, we had one in my sister’s house. Death has become a mercy for people in this tragic situation. I cooked rice pudding and distributed it in his memory. I bought a bag of wheat and fed it to the birds, because he loved birds and had raised a bird named Abu Hamdi.Syria Deeply: When you lived in Damascus, which is relatively safe, did you try to bring your children to live with you?Umm Omar: I tried again and again, but their father refused to get out of Raqqa. He also prevented the kids from leaving. One time, in 2013, after long negotiations, I convinced their father to allow Ali to come to Damascus for treatment, because he suffered from stunted growth. He stayed with me for nine months, but then his father insisted on having him back in Raqqa.On the other hand, I could not travel frequently to Raqqa, because women are not allowed to travel alone. They are required to have a male, blood relative to travel with.Syria Deeply: How do you manage your grief?Umm Omar: I believe that all is God’s plan, and it happens for a reason. God takes care of us and finds ways to help us through our losses and grief. Two days ago, my older daughter, Yasmin, had a boy. We called him Ali. The news made me smile, despite all my sadness.This interview has been edited for length and clarity. It originally appeared on Syria Deeply, and you can find the original here.

49,WORLD NEWS,NASA Puts A Laser Focus On The Melting Arctic Ocean,"Gloria Dickie, Arctic Deeply",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nasa-puts-a-laser-focus-on-the-melting-arctic-ocean_us_59a070f5e4b0821444c31280,Scientists with NASA’s Operation IceBridge are shooting green lasers into the Arctic Ocean’s melt ponds to better understand,2017-08-25,Melt ponds sit atop the Arctic Ocean’s ice. Scientists with NASA are trying to better understand how these ponds contribute to the melting of Arctic sea ice.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a071a31900002500dd5643.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Scientists with NASA’s Operation IceBridge are shooting green lasers into the Arctic Ocean’s melt ponds to better understand the dramatic thawing that’s well underway.HOW THE ALBEDO effect works in the Arctic Ocean has been the subject of intense research for decades, and, at this point, is pretty well understood by both scientists and fifth-graders. As sea ice melts, the newly open and dark ocean absorbs solar radiation, rather than reflecting it. That heats up the Arctic and exacerbates the effects of climate change. But in recent years scientists have come to believe they may be overestimating the reflectivity of the remaining white sea ice.Indeed, as sea ice melts, it forms dark melt ponds on the surface of the ice, which act as their own microcosm of the albedo effect, possibly speeding up sea ice loss. However, few studies have been done on these ponds in the Arctic, given the danger of using watercraft on the ponds’ surface when lakes can drain suddenly and without warning.That’s why, on July 17, scientists departed Thule Air Base in Greenland on board NASA’s Guardian Falcon aircraft for a summer campaign of Operation IceBridge in hopes of figuring out how deep these melt ponds are and how they’re forming, as well as examining changes in the multiyear ice pack during the summer months for the first time. Over a two-week period, they conducted six flights over the Arctic Ocean, assessing sea ice health and experimenting with lasers to see if it’s possible to chart the depth of aquamarine melt ponds, which are often visible from space but impossible to study through satellite imagery.Arctic Deeply recently spoke with Operation IceBridge’s project scientist and NASA sea ice researcher Nathan Kurtz about the mission and how this new information could be used.Arctic Deeply: Can you provide a brief background of Operation IceBridge?Nathan Kurtz: Operation IceBridge started as a gap-filling mission between NASA’s IceSat-1 satellite, which launched in 2003 and ended in 2009, and the successor satellite, IceSat-2, which is not scheduled to launch until next year. IceSat-1 took laser altimetry measurements to get the height of the Earth’s surface for when we’re measuring changes in ice thickness and volume. IceBridge is an airborne mission to get similar kinds of measurements between those two missions, but additional ones as well.Arctic Deeply: What do you use to obtain these measurements?Kurtz: We use a variety of different measurement techniques – laser altimetry, radar, telemetry – to look at changes in ice thickness and what’s causing those changes. The laser altimetry will look at how the surface is changing so we can get a sense of how ice thickness is changing; the radars will look at the shallow layers, like snow accumulation on the ice sheet, which warm and can shrink the ice. Essentially, we use a set of measurements to see how the ice is changing.Arctic Deeply: What’s different about the latest air campaign?Kurtz: The summer campaign is very different from winter campaigns – we have much fewer instruments; we only have cameras on board and the laser altimeter. And specifically we’re measuring the Arctic sea ice when it’s melting; there’s a lot of meltwater on the surface. We’re not necessarily looking at how thick sea ice gets when it’s at its maximum thickness, but we’re looking at quantifying what happens during melt season. Especially we were looking at melt ponds – seeing if the laser can sense how deep these pools of water collected on the surface are.This campaign was also flown out of Thule, Greenland, and so we can only access the multiyear ice up there. I flew over some of the oldest ice in the Arctic. We’ve never done it in the summer before – our summer campaign last year was based out of Barrow, Alaska, where we mostly flew over seasonal ice.Arctic Deeply: Why is it important to look at multiyear compared to first-year seasonal ice? What are some of the differences you might observe in a mission?Kurtz: The multiyear ice is much thicker and it tends to be more rough and ridged. The multiyear ice is what survives throughout the summer and that’s what’s been decreasing a lot in the past few decades. We’ve seen a strong decrease in areas that used to be covered by ice. It used to be that about 70 percent of ice in the Arctic Ocean was multiyear ice – now it’s down to somewhere around 20 percent. That change has a pretty big impact on the climate.When the ocean is covered with ice year round – especially during the summer when the sun is above the Arctic Circle all the time – a lot of the sun’s energy is reflected back out to space but when that ice starts to decrease the open water absorbs a lot of the sun’s energy, which basically leads to heating of the Arctic. Temperatures in the Arctic have increased two to three times the global average temperature increase and it’s due, in large part, to this albedo effect.Arctic Deeply: How might melt ponds contribute to sea ice loss?Kurtz: A recent paper explored how melt pond formation, especially early on in the melt season, was a strong predictor of how much sea ice would be left at the end of the summer. These melt ponds and their formation impact how much energy is absorbed by the surface, as well. How these melt ponds are structured, how deep they are, and how spread out they are are important parts of determining how much energy is going to be absorbed and how that factors into the melting of the ice. Measuring that is something that’s been very difficult to do until now.Arctic Deeply: How do you measure the depths of the melt ponds?Kurtz: We have a green laser – a green light will go through water when you shoot it at the surface. You’ll get a reflection from the pool surface and then it will go through the water and you’ll get a reflection of the bottom surface. That shows up as peaks. By looking at the difference in time between the two peaks, we’re able to convert that time to distance so we know how deep the melt ponds are. The goal would be to quantify their depth and volume of water. Right now, we don’t have information for a baseline for change because this hasn’t been done before. These measurements could potentially be used for a baseline later, but we’re also looking at whether models that incorporate melt ponds in them are interpreting what’s actually happening correctly on the ground. If they aren’t, we need to refine how the models are done. If they are, that means that component of the model is correct. I suspect it will probably be somewhere in between. We want to see how we can make the models a bit better.This article originally appeared on Arctic Deeply, and you can find the original here.

He was accused of raping two women at the sect’s headquarters back in 2002 after an anonymous letter detailing the sexual assaults was reportedly sent to former Indian Prime Minister Atal Vajpayee.Singh’s followers, who believe in his innocence, took to the streets across Haryana as well as in Delhi, the capital, clashing with law enforcement and setting fire to police stations, offices, trains and buses, according to HuffPost India. Security forces responded with water cannons and tear gas.At least 29 people died during Friday’s clashes and hundreds more were injured in the town of Panchkula, where the trial took place, Reuters reported.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the unrest and violence “deeply distressing.”Singh is expected to be convicted on Aug. 28. The minimum jail time for this type of case is seven years but can extend to life imprisonment.Referring to himself as “Saint Dr. MSG” on social media, Singh boasts a massive cult following. He also claims to have written, directed and starred in several films, according to the Hindustan Times.The reporting of sexual assaults has risen in India in the last few years following several high-profile gang rape incidents that have demonstrated the severity of the problem of sexual violence in the country.“There is no magic formula to deal with the problem of rape,” Indira Jaising, a former national additional solicitor general, told the BBC in 2013. “There’s a bias that operates in the mind of decision makers — stereotyping women, blaming the victim, trying to find out if she invited the rape.”"

We live in West Berlin, which is still covered in parks, water, playgrounds, and public space, as part of its legacy as a self-contained island during the Cold War.I live on a street that was once the heart of a predominately Jewish neighborhood. Seven thousand people on my street alone were murdered and deported to concentration camps during the Nazi era. Each block has golden Stolpersteine embedded in the sidewalk — metal cobblestones that bear the name and fate of the building’s (usually Jewish) occupants, who died at the hands of Nazis. Perhaps after another year of living here, these reminders will become invisible and fade into the scenery. For now, it feels like a moral imperative to keep seeing them.This summer, my days are even longer. My newborn daughter sleeps until 2:00 or 3:00 am, when she awakes to nurse voraciously. With an overflowing belly, she must remain upright for an hour to digest all that milk comfortably. While I hold my baby and take in her newborn smell, with my other hand I hold my phone and catch up on the news from the U.S. It is jarring, and keeps me from falling back asleep.In November last year, I wrote about my awakening to the truth of America’s bigotry. Each day since has been worse, with Trump’s presidency casting a dark shadow on my family’s otherwise light, happy days. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, members of the Ku Klux Klan, and the self-defined “alt-right” have held a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. I am outraged and more than a little annoyed by the people who expressed surprise. Trump’s hateful rhetoric has stayed consistent since his candidacy, and before, with his bigoted supporters becoming increasingly vocal. Although I treasure my own childhood in Appalachia, I am reminded again why we are raising our (Jewish) children in Berlin instead of the United States.One of the best aspects of growing up in rural Ohio was the long conversations in the car with my father. Our farm was about 30 minutes away from the nearest small town, giving us ample time together. Probably more often than not, we simply sang along to The Beatles and chatted about the day’s nothingness, but my memory holds only the deeper conversations.Once, when I was about 6 or 7 years old, I remember him trying to explain the word “prejudice” to me, and my inability to understand. Not even a week later, again in the car, I reported to my father that a little boy had said to a friend, “Anyway, my family doesn’t even like your family. Your dad’s Jewish.”“That’s prejudice,” my own Jewish father explained to me. I don’t remember the rest of the conversation, but will never forget this epiphany, or the incident that spurred it. The confusion and odd sensation in my stomach, and the creeping tingle all over my body. And my silence. I remember my child’s mind trying to decide whether to ask, “So what? My dad’s Jewish,” or to keep that information, which had now suddenly become a secret, quiet.I chose silence. I chose it again, when my middle school friend told me she wouldn’t come to my pool party, a separate event to celebrate my Bat Mitzvah, because her parents told her “that’s a Jew thing.” She, and some other popular kids, attended the Catholic church across the street from the local Hillel, where I went to Hebrew school on Sunday mornings. Both let out at noon, and I would position myself behind posts or find reasons to go back inside, so no one would see me coming out.I stayed silent when my softball coach told me she got a new car and “Jew-ed the dealer down.” I stayed silent when my traveling tennis team started exchanging Jew jokes. I stayed silent when my high school boyfriend’s father chastised me for not reciting the family’s dinner prayer, thanking Jesus for the meal on their table.Earlier this summer, I found myself at the Jewish Museum in a dark, cement room, with only a slivered skylight. The room is meant to elicit strong emotions and associations, and accordingly, my two-year-old was scared. As I picked him up and began singing a silly song quietly, the same old thought ran through my mind that always does at Jewish memorials. They would have killed me. This time, however, the next thought lumped in my throat, tears stinging my eyes. They would have killed our children. I sang louder and relished his giggles, ignoring side-eye glances from other visitors.In the quiet, early mornings with my baby, I think more about childhood, history, and current events. I am grateful to be in Germany, which—unlike the U.S.—seems to address the truth of its past head on, successfully. I vow to make time for difficult conversations with my children, like my father, my parents, did for me. I will encourage my children to keep seeing the Stolpersteine, but to believe in the good in people. To recognize society’s systemic failings that lead to events like Charlottesville and Trump’s election. And to speak out against prejudice, every time.Previously published as ‘Lessons From the Past’ in Annie’s LETTERS FROM BERLIN column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays:The Mental Workload of a Mother by Jami IngledueAmerica in the Shadows by Maria BehanHow To Move From A ‘Me’ To a ‘We’ Culture by Rachel KesslerHow Women Can Help Each Other By Sharing by Irena Ioannou"

He attributed this to his “multiple successful careers” and thanked Carson for his “sacrifice.” “If being called a ‘house Negro’ is what some of us must endure for succeeding in this nation and thinking for ourselves, then let all of the ‘house Negroes’ stand up and be counted,” he wrote. “Wow! There are too many to count, but there’s Dr. Ben Carson standing tall among millions, and doing something great again.”Cain, like Carson, ran an unsuccessful Republican presidential campaign. During his 2012 bid, Cain faced a series of sexual assault, harassment and adultery allegations, which he denied. In December 2011, he suspended his campaign."

Aetna sent the letter to about 12,000 people, Time reported.In addition to breaking privacy laws that give people the right to have their medical information protected, the breach also put people’s safety at risk, as HIV stigma is still strong in the U.S.Ronda B. Goldfein of the AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania said in a statement that exposure “creates a tangible risk of violence, discrimination and other trauma” for people living with HIV. The medical privacy breach was made public by Legal Action Center, a nonprofit organization that helps people fight HIV discrimination, and the AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania, a nonprofit law firm, in a letter Thursday.Writing on behalf of people in Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., it demanded that Aetna immediately stop sending mail that can reveal a person is taking HIV medications, or medications to prevent HIV, and to take steps to make sure it never happens again.Aetna responded to the breach in a statement, calling the mistake unacceptable. It also said it was conducting a full review of its mailing process to make sure this doesn’t happen again. A second letter was sent to affected clients this week outlining the timeline of the privacy violation and letting them know of their right to file a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Civil Rights. The second letter, obtained by HuffPost, said the offending mailer was sent July 28. The company first learned of the privacy violations on July 31, and on Aug. 2 it determined that the vendor who mailed the letters had used a window envelope that could have exposed personal information, the second letter said. Attorneys at the Legal Action Center and the AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania said that legal action is being considered. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman also announced he would look into Aetna’s privacy breach. Several of the affected clients said that family members and neighbors had learned that they were using HIV medication from these mailers, the letter from the nonprofit advocacy groups said.People have been denied medical and dental care on the basis of their HIV status. People have been fired or had job offers rescinded on the basis of their HIV status. Indeed, shame and fear about the infection prevents many from getting tested in the first place. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 15 percent of Americans with HIV don’t know that they have it.While federal law protects people against being fired for their HIV or AIDS status, it only applies to companies with more than 14 workers, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Depending on where you live, smaller companies may or may not be bound by the same anti-discrimination laws. "

They all voiced similar prayers of comfort. Following the visible resurgence of the most hateful emblems of racial animosity in Charlottesville, Virginia – the KKK, the neo-Nazi movement, and televised images of hordes of white men chanting “Blood and Soil!” – the country reeled. We found ourselves grappling with our most pernicious “Here we go again.”We find ourselves in a moment where the present resembles the past. The ugliest iconography in modern history returns. The language that led to tragedy in the past leads to a death in the present. Yet again.Significant numbers of Americans have seen the events, including the televised symbols of hate, and since then they have felt hurt and befuddled by imagery irreconcilable with their notions of the place their country should be.What happened in Charlottesville? In the literal sense, violence ensued when heavily armed militia, white supremacists and neo-Nazis gathered at the University of Virginia campus to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee from the campus. Counter-demonstrators met the white supremacists, leading to clashes. One of the right-wing supremacists, a man named James Alexander Fields, was arrested for murder when he allegedly drove his car into a group of peaceful counter demonstrators, resulting in the death of 32-year old Heather Heyer.Heather Heyer’s death was pointless, reinforcing the moral decay of the white supremacists in Charlottesville. Heather Heyer was a white activist who died in the cause of civil rights activism, like Viola Luizzo in 1965. Yet it is 2017 and here we are, adding new names to the lists of black and white civil rights martyrs that included the nine victims of the church massacre in South Carolina, and now, Heather Heyer..Some say the violence may have spiraled partially because Charlottesville police failed to keep the two rallies separated – but white supremacist gatherings often embrace violence.The question of why vitriolic hatemongering and violent racism sustains its grip in this country cannot be separated from the question of why the nation elected Donald Trump into the office of the Presidency – a person who fantastically attempts to placate the situation by blaming “both sides” even though the violent proclivities of the right-wing faction was self-evident.President Trump has irresponsibly downplayed, if not denied the entire history of racist violence, which has been as been inextricably linked to white supremacist ideologies like a horse and a carriage.I happened to meet a very young woman in the crowd at the rally in Santa Fe who told me she was a college student in Charlottesville (spending her summer vacation in Santa Fe.)I naturally asked her for her local impressions. She had been away from Charlottesville over the past month, but she believed that until recently “everyone got along.”She thought race relations in Charlottesville had suffered a setback following the protests and she emphasized that the leaders of the militias and other violent groups were not locals. But she was inspired that the counter demonstrators overwhelmingly outnumbered the invading hate groups.I agreed with her whole-heartedly on the last point. I grew up in the South myself – and still frequently visited home – so I challenged her emphasis on “outsiders.” Her optimism was good-willed, yet smacked of a typical white inclination to only want to see a partial picture of a major problem –whether to blame “both sides” like Trump, or to believe the entire problem lay with sinister and manipulative “outsiders.”I asked if she’d often heard the heinous and calculated racist Southern myth that “the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery?” Yes, she admitted, she had. Often.What about the immense racial economic disparities in the South? Hadn’t she noticed how many white Southerners and conservative governments took those historic disparities for granted?Today I live in a state with a very small black population. I have heard racist comments against Arabs made by people who apparently believed I would not mind because I was black, not Arab.Together, the young woman from Charlottesville, Virginia and I decided that for all the lip service given to anti-racist ideals, the reality remains that millions of Americans have not confronted America’s never-ending “Yet again.”The real work following this rally would come when she and I faced Americans who give lip service to Martin Luther King’s ideals, but prefer to “sit on the fence,” never acknowledging or discussing systemic racism, historical racism, or racism in the criminal justice system. For as long as millions of whites choose to let their voices remain muted, silence remains complicity.Darryl Lorenzo Wellington is a writing fellow for the Center for Community Change."

Since then, we’ve marked the day my son, now almost 6, came to live with us as “Family Day” each year, but it’s Adoption Day that we really celebrate. Last year there was a surprise visit to Diggerland, a construction-themed New Jersey amusement park, with a beloved cousin, and this year we spent the weekend away together as a family at a local campsite. We weren’t there when our son was born, but we’ll always remember the day he was adopted.Since adoptive families get a few extra celebrations thrown into their lives, we asked the members of the HuffPost Parents community who have adopted how they celebrate those special milestones. Below, you’ll find a few of our favorite answers. Oh, and one of our favorite responses reminds us just why all this matters so much. Jeanne Ciccone-Neal responded, “I am an adopted child. I wasn’t born in the states and came here when I was 3 months old. My mom called it airport day (I arrived by plane). We had a special dinner and when I was younger I got presents. I’m 32 and we still have a special dinner.” "

Fewer than half of those who voted for Trump last year now believe he has the support of most of the GOP.Just 47 percent of Trump voters say that most or all of the Republicans in Congress generally support the president, down from 58 percent in a mid-July survey.The poll follows a month of visible splits between the president and his party, with Trump criticizing the Senate GOP’s failure to repeal Obamacare and some Republicans expressing discomfort with his response to the white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.“The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful. And we need for him to be successful. Our nation needs for him to be successful,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), an early Trump supporter, said last week.During August, Trump has spent more time criticizing Republicans than Democrats, according to a Washington Post analysis. He has taken particular aim at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell and Trump are reportedly no longer on speaking terms. The president has also publicly feuded with Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), one of his most prominent intra-party critics.Although the loyalty of Trump’s rank-and-file supporters has also shown signs of erosion this year, most don’t appear to be following the cues of party leaders in cooling toward the president.Asked about a hypothetical spat between Trump and the congressional GOP, Trump voters are overwhelmingly more loyal to the president: 71 percent say they would side with Trump in a disagreement, while just 8 percent said they’d back the Republican lawmakers. That 63-point margin is effectively unchanged from last month.Members of the Republican Party would also back Trump over his congressional counterparts, albeit by a narrower margin of 58 percent to 19 percent.The widget below lets you further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, by using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Aug. 22-23 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

60,POLITICS,"Trump's Antitrust Nominee, Rife With Conflicts, Puts Democrats To The Test",Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/makan-delrahim-antitrust_us_599f55e1e4b06d67e336a751,Democrats have made curbing monopoly power a plank of their new “Better Deal” platform. Will that stand in the way of confirming Makan Delrahim?,2017-08-25,Justice Department nominee Makan Delrahim at his May 10 Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing to be assistant attorney general leading the antitrust division.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599f57501f00002a001aacbb.jpeg?ops=crop_0_1303_2166_1500%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Justice’s antitrust division promised in April to step aside on issues involving Anthem’s failed merger with Cigna ― a case in which he had fought the federal government on behalf of the health insurance giants and lost ― in order to avoid a conflict of interest. But that’s far from the only conflict Makan Delrahim, 47, a former corporate lawyer and lobbyist, is likely to face if confirmed. His full Senate vote has yet to be scheduled but could come as early as next month. He seems likely to be approved after only one Democrat voted against advancing his nomination in June. Yet he would become the nation’s top trustbuster at a time when corporate power is more concentrated than it has been in nearly a century and monopolies are again becoming lightning rods for populist politics. As a partner at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck law firm for 12 years, he lobbied for Google in its successful acquisition of the online advertising firm DoubleClick, helping to transform the tech giant into one-half of the duopoly sucking up 98 percent of every new ad dollar spent last year. He represented T-Mobile in its merger with MetroPCS, which was completed in 2013. He lobbied for Comcast as it sought to buy NBCUniversal, a deal panned by one critic as “the shining example of how you don’t approve a merger with conditions.” His other corporate clients included AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, Merck, Oracle, Qualcomm, Pfizer and Neiman Marcus ― all of which are facing or have recently settled antitrust litigation. Delrahim stopped working for many of those companies years ago. He ended his relationship with AT&T ― which is currently seeking regulatory approval to purchase Time Warner ― in 2008, as Recode reported. He terminated his lobbying registration with Comcast in 2010, the year before the Justice Department approved its acquisition of NBCUniversal. He curtailed lobbying for Qualcomm at the end of 2016, shortly before joining Trump’s transition team as a deputy legal counsel. Now Comcast is rumored to be considering buying a wireless network ― one analyst floated Verizon (which owns HuffPost’s parent company, Oath) as a potential takeover target. And AT&T’s plan to buy Time Warner, putting a media powerhouse in the hands of a telecom giant, echoes the Comcast-NBCUniversal merger, the last big deal to give one company control over the pipes and what flows through them. “We don’t want to see deals like that specifically in the telecom sector again,” Joshua Stager, policy counsel at the New America think tank’s Open Technology Institute, told HuffPost. “We would hope there’d be a recusal on anything related to Comcast.”That remains to be seen, but Delrahim’s views on the AT&T deal are clearer. In January, he said he hadn’t “seen any of the facts.” But last October, he said he didn’t take issue with the merger because AT&T does not directly compete with Time Warner.“The sheer size of it, and the fact that it’s media, I think will get a lot of attention,” he said in an interview with Canada’s BNN. “However, I don’t see this as a major antitrust problem.” To critics who blame weak antitrust enforcement for widening inequality and growing monopoly power, Delrahim’s nomination is troubling. “It all points very clearly to lax antitrust policy,” Marshall Steinbaum, research director at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank, told HuffPost. “We now know that lax antitrust policy has given us an economy that is very uncompetitive.”But Delrahim represents the mainstream wing of the Republican Party, the historic defender of big business. That came as a relief to many who feared that Trump, who criticized monopoly power during his campaign, would nominate a more radical thinker. One possibility was Joshua Wright, a conservative law professor described by some as an “arch libertarian” for his aggressively hands-off approach to competition. Wright headed Trump’s Federal Trade Commission transition team and was reportedly under consideration for assistant attorney general in charge of antitrust. By contrast, Delrahim comes across as a safe choice, one who would maintain the status quo. At least that’s the impression among corporate law firms. Steptoe & Johnson, which counts many Fortune 500 companies as clients, said his “nomination can fairly be read as confirming the suspicions of those who viewed populist Trump’s rhetoric about antitrust issues as just that.” Hughes Hubbard & Reed, which grossed $322 million in revenue last year, noted “Delrahim’s background suggests that the Trump administration intends to take a more laissez-faire approach to antitrust enforcement.” Delrahim got his start in government in 1994, working on intellectual property rights in the U.S. trade representative’s office. He served as chief counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee from 2000 to 2003, then as deputy assistant attorney general at the antitrust division under President George W. Bush from 2003 to 2005. “He’s not a nut case, he’s not an extremist, he’s not a lunatic,” Robert Lande, a former antitrust litigator and law professor at the University of Baltimore, told HuffPost. “He’s a reasonable person who happens to be conservative.” Indeed, Democrats who have served in the Justice Department position Delrahim is being considered for faced similar conflicts. Christine Varney, who headed the antitrust division during President Barack Obama’s first term, stepped aside in the agency’s review of Google’s merger with flight software service ITA after ITA hired her former law firm. Her successor, Bill Baer, who headed the division from 2012 to 2016, recused himself from reviewing Comcast’s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable. Baer had represented General Electric when it sold NBCUniversal to Comcast in 2011, meaning he may have dealt with confidential information that disqualified him, in the agency’s view, from fairly overseeing the regulatory assessment of the 2014 deal. “The process for me and my predecessors involved sitting down with the antitrust division’s ethics officer and the Justice Department’s ethics officer to figure out which matters posed an actual or potential conflict of interest based on my prior work as an antitrust lawyer in the private sector,” Baer, who returned to the firm Arnold & Porter this year, told HuffPost.Delrahim would likely face a similar process.Yet, by nominating someone who serves as a “poster child of Washington’s revolving-door problem,” Trump has reneged on yet another populist promise made during his campaign blitz last year, according to Murshed Zaheed, political director of the progressive organizing group CREDO Action. “He ran a fake populist campaign, talking up in key states how he was fighting for the little guy and how he was going to take on Wall Street and take on big corporations and the so-called rigged system,” Zaheed told HuffPost. “This is one of the nominations that essentially exposes Donald Trump and his regime of hucksters and Wall Street cronies as a bunch of phony populists.”On the trail, Trump assailed AT&T’s proposed merger with Time Warner as a deal that could “destroy democracy” by putting “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” He accused Comcast of using NBC as a tool “to tell voters what to think and what to do.” He said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had “a huge antitrust problem because he’s controlling so much.” On Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission gave Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods the green light, the highest-profile merger proposed since Trump became president. Yet antitrust policy, long the province of technocratic policymakers, appears to be regaining its role as a populist call to arms.For many Americans, the term monopoly harks back to the turn of the 20th century, when President Theodore Roosevelt crusaded against railroad, oil and banking trusts. His nephew, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, enshrined trust-busting policies into his New Deal, which established the Democratic Party as the champion of the working class after the Great Depression. For decades, the policies worked: There were no major financial crises, small towns thrived and average wages rose steadily for most workers. But by the mid-1970s, a new generation of Democrats concluded that strict New Deal regulation was outdated, or at least in need of less vigilant enforcement, and the party embraced wealthy donors. Antitrust policing became a case of good cop/slightly-more-straight-faced cop. Evidence of that shift abounds. Up to 25 percent of the nation’s income now goes to the top 1 percent of earners. Corporate profits regularly hit records as firms stash upward of $2.4 trillion overseas, depriving the U.S. of billions of dollars in tax revenue, according to a study last year by two progressive think tanks. A new academic paper, released this week by researchers at Princeton and University College London, found that companies charged 67 percent profit margins in 2014 compared with 18 percent in 1980, a telling sign that competition has decreased in the market. In perhaps the most explicit indictment of lax U.S. antitrust enforcement, American companies now turn to European Union regulators to crack down on anticompetitive behavior by bigger rivals in their own country.Obama flirted with antitrust reform during his first term, seriously considering Harvard law professor Einer Elhauge for the assistant attorney general position. But he ultimately decided against nominating the legal scholar, and, in a sort of ideological inverse move to Trump’s determination on Wright, chose a more conventional candidate.“Someone like Einer Elhauge might have shaken things up,” Lande said. “Someone like Einer might have made more of a difference than a Christine Varney or a Bill Baer.” Democrats, still reeling from sweeping electoral defeats in November, appear to be waking up to the problem of concentrated market power. Last month, the party rolled out a new populist-leaning agenda under the branding “A Better Deal.” The platform lacks legislative proposals but made antitrust reform a core pillar. “Right now our antitrust laws are designed to allow huge corporations to merge, padding the pockets of investors but sending costs skyrocketing for everything from cable bills and airline tickets to food and health care,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote in a New York Times op-ed announcing the platform. “We are going to fight to allow regulators to break up big companies if they’re hurting consumers and to make it harder for companies to merge if it reduces competition.”Yet Delrahim has so far faced little opposition from Democrats. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved his nomination 19 to 1 on June 8. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) cast the only dissenting vote. Earlier this month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) put a “hold” on the confirmation, delaying the full Senate vote until at least September, according to Bloomberg.Lina Khan, a legal fellow at New America’s Open Markets program, said she’s “heartened by Democrats’ seeming commitment to antitrust and recognition that anti-monopoly and competition policy are key areas for the party going forward.” But she said the way Democrats scrutinize Delrahim’s record and potential conflicts of interest at his confirmation vote will be a crucial proving ground.“We’re all waiting to see whether the Democrats’ interest in this area ends,” she told HuffPost. “Delrahim’s nomination will be one early test.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

The rock reduced one of those panels to tiny glass shards strewn across the sidewalk, later swept into dustpans by city workers. A day later, an unknown person shattered the glass doors at the K’hal Adas Yereim synagogue in Queens, New York — just hours after the nation watched in disbelief as the president of the United States described the white supremacists in Charlottesville as “fine people.” The synagogue is less than 3 miles from the president’s childhood home. A K’hal Adas Yereim member sent a photo of the shattered doors to the Documenting Hate project, a partnership between ProPublica and numerous news outlets, including HuffPost. A New York City Police Department spokesperson says the department is investigating the incident, but won’t say whether a suspect has been identified. Across the country in Alameda, California, on Aug. 17, a security camera captured another unidentified vandal throwing rocks at Temple Israel, shattering multiple windows. Since the rally in Charlottesville, the Anti-Defamation League has tracked dozens of anti-Semitic incidents across the United States. It’s the sight of shattered glass at places of Jewish remembrance and worship, though, that is fraught with a terrifying poignance.On the night of Nov. 9, 1938, and into the next day, mobs in Germany massacred nearly 100 Jews and smashed the windows of Jewish businesses and synagogues. The night became known as Kristallnacht ― “The Night of Broken Glass” ― and was a preview of the Nazi effort to exterminate Jews from the Earth. At the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville two weeks ago, HuffPost witnessed Americans celebrating this Nazi legacy, proudly waving swastika flags and wearing T-shirts quoting Adolf Hitler. They chanted “Jews will not replace us!” and the Third Reich slogan “Blood and soil!” They carried signs with messages like “The Jewish Media Is Going Down” and “The Goyim Know.”Worshippers at Charlottesville’s Congregation Beth Israel watched in terror as neo-Nazis paraded by screaming “There’s the synagogue!” and “Sieg Heil!” Online threats to burn down the synagogue forced congregants to remove Torahs, including a Holocaust scroll, from the building as a precaution. “This is 2017 in the United States of America,” the congregation’s president, Alan Zimmerman, later wrote on ReformJudaism.org. The anti-Semitic aims of the rally — which the Anti-Defamation League has called the largest of its kind in over a decade — were apparent the day before it started, when organizer and white nationalist leader Richard Spencer published his “Charlottesville statement.” This malevolent manifesto described Jews as an “ethno-religious people distinct from Europeans” who are resistant to assimilation and are hostile to non-Jews. Now, the Anti-Defamation League is concerned that the large display of hatred in Charlottesville “could inspire copycat incidents or acts of hate against Jews or Jewish institutions in other parts of the country,” the group said in a statement. The ADL provided a lengthy list to HuffPost of anti-Semitic incidents over the past two weeks. A spokesman for the group says the number of incidents is “higher than usual” when compared with other recent two-week periods. On Aug. 13, a man made an obscene gesture to a security camera outside a Philadelphia synagogue. He then urinated on the synagogue. The ADL cautions that it is impossible to directly link these anti-Semitic incidents to what happened in Charlottesville “without knowing the full motives of the perpetrators behind the attacks.” Still, the past two weeks have brought rising American anti-Semitism into focus. The ADL says anti-Semitic incidents surged by 34 percent in 2016 compared with the previous year. In the first quarter of 2017, the number of incidents jumped 86 percent compared with the same period in 2016.The FBI also maintains data on hate crimes and, while its figures are incomplete, they show that Jews were the most-targeted religious minority in the U.S. between 2010 and 2015.And Jonathan Greenblatt, head of the ADL, told HuffPost this week that his organization has also tracked a rise in recruitment and membership among white supremacist organizations. “One of the most significant things about Charlottesville is that it showed there’s a young generation of white supremacists willing to openly display their hate and anti-Semitism in public and in full view,” he said. “It’s alarming to see a younger generation that’s not aged Klansmen hiding behind white hoods,” he continued, adding that “the majority of attendees appeared to be young, in their 20s and unafraid to show their faces.”These young white supremacists, he said, have been “emboldened by this climate in the country, in an environment where the president essentially validated them and the ‘fine people’ among their ranks.”Donald Trump won the presidency despite racist comments throughout his campaign. As a candidate and now as president, he has routinely signaled his support of white nationalism and been slow to condemn terror committed by white, right-wing extremists. The Charlottesville rally also concluded with a terror attack. Twenty-year-old James Alex Fields Jr., a member of the white supremacist group Vanguard America, is accused of driving a car through a crowd of counterprotesters. The attack killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injured 19 others. In an interview with ABC News in the following days, two of Fields’ former classmates recalled visiting a Nazi concentration camp in Dachau, Germany, with him in 2015. Standing in a place where Nazis had systematically murdered at least 28,000 people, most of them Jews, Fields’ friends recalled him issuing a chilling statement: “This is where the magic happened.”America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story."

The country was at a momentous juncture in its history and an exciting spirit of a new beginning pervaded every aspect of life.I used to live in South Carolina, and recent events in the U.S. brought back memories of that time. There are similarities between the local landscapes of memory in both places, and parallels in the potential interpretation of monuments as symbols of white supremacy and racial oppression in the context of a racially mixed and often divided society. I don’t recall ever seeing a statue defaced or a monument removed during my six years in South Carolina, but the situation in South Africa was, of course, very different at the time.Here in Durban, on the Indian Ocean coast, two statues face each other in a grassy park near the city center. It wasn’t always this way — one was there before the other. The first is an imposing monument to Louis Botha, who lived from 1862 to 1919 and is remembered as a hero of the Second Boer War and the first prime minister of the Union of South Africa. The other, a statue of the Zulu King Dinuzulu (1868-1913), was erected in 2005 after a lengthy and spirited debate about the relevance of the Botha statue and the reorganization of the park. Being confronted with ever increasing European encroachment and the gradual destruction of the Zulu kingdom, Dinuzulu was eventually imprisoned for his role in the 1906 Bambatha Rebellion. But Botha ordered his release when he became prime minister because he believed Dinuzulu did not have a fair trial. This noble gesture of restoring justice and dignity underpins the symbolism of the two statues and is meant to render them historical models of reconciliation that can provide moral guidance in a post-apartheid society. Except, hardly anyone knows such details of history. For the majority of South Africans, Botha remains first and foremost a white oppressor. Then and now, radical iconoclasts in South Africa believe that colonial statues and “white monuments” should have been removed immediately at the end of apartheid, pointing to the example of post-Nazi Germany, post-communist societies and postcolonial nations all over the world. However, it is important to remember that the post-apartheid order did not emerge from revolution or military victory — it was a negotiated transition of power. Leaving statues, monuments and other identity symbols of the white minority largely untouched was one of the many compromises struck during the Nelson Mandela era, ostensibly in the name of reconciliation and nation-building, but also perhaps to gain symbolic capital in the eyes of the international community and much-needed foreign investors.The 1999 National Heritage Resources Act formally protects all monuments, but provides for the potential removal of contested symbols on a case-by-case basis after careful consideration of their significance and consultation with relevant stakeholders. In practice, this approach has resulted in few changes to the national landscape of memory. Sometimes, the government chooses to position new monuments near established ones, as was the case with Botha and Dinuzulu in Durban, thereby re-contextualizing contested history. Indeed, the Dinuzulu statue closely matches the Botha effigy in style, height and general stature. There are examples of this approach throughout the country. It appeals to international visitors, tourists and educated locals who understand the identity and historical context of both monuments and appreciate the symbolic significance of the juxtaposition.All was mostly quiet on the monument front in South Africa for many years. That changed suddenly in March 2015 at the University of Cape Town when the bronze statue of Cecil John Rhodes, a British businessman and imperialist who became the prime minister of Cape Colony in 1890, was besmirched with human excrement. In what became known as the #RhodesMustFall campaign, protesting students demanded the immediate removal of the statue and pushed to “decolonize the curriculum.” Fueled by social media, the incident reverberated across university campuses nationwide and even prompted solidarity responses overseas, notably in the United Kingdom and the United States. In fact, South African students would surely be proud if their initiative contributed to the recent flare-up of the statue debate in the American South. The #RhodesMustFall campaign sparked a wave of statue defacements throughout South Africa (the Botha statues in Durban and Cape Town included) and gave fresh impetus to the national debate about colonial and apartheid-era monuments. For people like me, who have been around long enough, the debate was an exact rerun of what happened nearly two decades earlier, but the vandalism and public displays of outrage were new elements.At first sight, the battle lines in South Africa’s fight over monuments are drawn along racial lines. Those advocating a radical removal of all symbols of white domination emanate almost exclusively from the African majority, while conservatives who defend monuments as an inalienable part of history predominantly belong to the white minority. In between the extremities are moderates from all racial groups, some of whom suggest that colonial monuments should be retained for educational reasons, to remind us where we have come from, while others recommend relocation to museums, re-contextualization or redesign.But the disagreement is not always aligned with racial affiliation. On many occasions, I have found black South Africans defending colonial monuments in private conversation, but they are not likely to broadcast their opinion for fear of marginalization and reprisals, especially in spaces like university campuses where the monument issue has become highly politicized. Understandably, extreme positions on either end of the spectrum dominate the debate and enjoy much media coverage. What remains largely concealed, and what I find most striking, is how many people appear to have no opinion about monuments – old or new ― at all.Over the years, I frequently found this in conversations with people around monument spaces and even, surprisingly, in discussions with cohorts of young black students in the Cultural and Heritage Tourism program at my university. Ultimately, it must be remembered that local African societies have no tradition of preserving symbolic artifacts as reminders of the past or erecting bronze effigies of leaders in their environment. For the majority, exposure to the “heritage discourse” strongly promoted by the post-apartheid government is still a fairly new phenomenon.After a rushed debate, the Rhodes statue at UCT was removed in April 2015, a quick and symbolic measure of appeasement, but the students’ demands for a fuller transformation will be far more slow and difficult to attain. The most influential and lasting aspect of the #RhodesMustFall campaign was arguably that the “must fall” part of the hashtag became a ubiquitous part of the nation’s colloquial vocabulary, quickly mutating into #FeesMustFall and subsequently any imaginable cause, from sports to cooking. Currently trending is #ZumaMustFall.As media attention and public debate moved on to more topical matters, most defaced statues were quietly cleaned up or repaired; very few have been removed or relocated. However, the government is currently reviewing the heritage legislation and we might see more changes in the future."

In between the extremities are moderates from all racial groups, some of whom suggest that colonial monuments should be retained for educational reasons, to remind us where we have come from, while others recommend relocation to museums, re-contextualization or redesign.But the disagreement is not always aligned with racial affiliation. On many occasions, I have found black South Africans defending colonial monuments in private conversation, but they are not likely to broadcast their opinion for fear of marginalization and reprisals, especially in spaces like university campuses where the monument issue has become highly politicized. Understandably, extreme positions on either end of the spectrum dominate the debate and enjoy much media coverage. What remains largely concealed, and what I find most striking, is how many people appear to have no opinion about monuments – old or new ― at all.Over the years, I frequently found this in conversations with people around monument spaces and even, surprisingly, in discussions with cohorts of young black students in the Cultural and Heritage Tourism program at my university. Ultimately, it must be remembered that local African societies have no tradition of preserving symbolic artifacts as reminders of the past or erecting bronze effigies of leaders in their environment. For the majority, exposure to the “heritage discourse” strongly promoted by the post-apartheid government is still a fairly new phenomenon.After a rushed debate, the Rhodes statue at UCT was removed in April 2015, a quick and symbolic measure of appeasement, but the students’ demands for a fuller transformation will be far more slow and difficult to attain. The most influential and lasting aspect of the #RhodesMustFall campaign was arguably that the “must fall” part of the hashtag became a ubiquitous part of the nation’s colloquial vocabulary, quickly mutating into #FeesMustFall and subsequently any imaginable cause, from sports to cooking. Currently trending is #ZumaMustFall.As media attention and public debate moved on to more topical matters, most defaced statues were quietly cleaned up or repaired; very few have been removed or relocated. However, the government is currently reviewing the heritage legislation and we might see more changes in the future."

She continues, “Don’t like your tilted stage. The role you made me play. Of the fool, no, I don’t like you.” I had speculated that this single, the first off her new album Reputation, dropping November 10th, would be like this; different, dark and directed at the people who she perceives to have wronged her in the past few years.What I didn’t expect, though, was how vengeful the song would be (maybe I didn’t read closely enough into the snake images posted on her Instagram). The “you” in the song seems ambiguous; it could be Kanye West, who toured on a “tilted stage,” or Kim Kardashian, who leaked a phone call between Taylor and Kanye over a dispute about a lyric in one of Kanye’s songs. It could also refer to Katy Perry, who also publicly feuded with Taylor over dancers leaving her tour. But “you” could also mean a more conglomerate group; the media in general, perhaps, or even the general public. Look what all of these people say about me, look at the hate that I endure, she could be singing; I had no choice but to fire back in this song. Look what you made me do.I have to wonder: Does it matter who the song is about? To many people, the answer is yes. I suppose I’m undecided. I don’t want to enjoy the song because it’s adding fuel to the fire of Taylor’s celebrity fights. I want to enjoy it because it sends the message that if, for whatever reason, you feel knocked down by something, you can use that as motivation to come back and be stronger than ever. This is embodied in the lyrics, “But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time. Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time.” To me, the entire premise of the song is that her past struggles have “made” her come back and release what already looks to be a successful single.I worry that for young Taylor Swift fans, though, that message could be misconstrued. Because, following those emboldening lines about rising from the dead are these lyrics: “I’ve got a list of names and yours is in red underlined.” Those words seem to suggest that if you don’t like someone, you should publicly announce it and act in retaliation; get revenge instead of trying to come to a mutual agreement and heal your wounds. I hope that listeners, especially young ones, can look past the drama and bad blood (see what I did there?) and see that the song has an empowering message.But maybe that is the point—that many members of the media and many people in society simply can’t look past the drama. We say we don’t care, but we can’t look away from the headlines, the gossip and the snarky social media posts. Taylor’s drama with Kanye, Kim and Katy would almost certainly not have reached the levels it did had it not played out in the news for everyone to watch. And that damage, real or perceived, to Taylor’s “good girl” image, may very well be the driving force behind this single and this new era of music for Taylor.Even in the songs from 1989, her last album, she seemed willing to challenge that label of the innocent, golden girl. I wonder now if she’s throwing it out the window entirely. I’m inclined to believe her when she sings, “I’m sorry, the old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now. Why? Oh ’cause she’s dead!” In each of her albums so far, Taylor has experimented with new sounds and new themes. She successfully crossed the line from country to pop, shedding her skin like the snake on her Instagram. Taylor Swift is no stranger at reinventing herself, doing so in the public eye, therefore altering her—wait for it—reputation.Still, despite the fact that she consistently sheds her skin, so to speak, the theme of rising above negativity or hatred is nothing new for Taylor Swift. Take, for example, the first single from her last album. In Shake It Off, she sings about “what people say”—that she stays out too late, has nothing in her brain and “goes on too many dates” but “can’t make them stay.” She counters these claims by singing that the haters are, well, gonna hate; and that she’s just gonna shake it off.An even earlier version of this comes from Taylor’s song Mean from her album Speak Now. In that song, she hits back at a music critic who said that she couldn’t sing. The chorus goes, “Someday, I’ll be living in a big old city, and all you’re ever gonna be is mean. Someday, I’ll be big enough that you can’t hit me and all you’re ever gonna be is mean. Why you gotta be so mean?”Those songs, though, seem to fight back against people who are just plain mean, not people with whom you’ve been engaged in a two-way argument. So does the song send the message that if you are fighting with someone, you should publicly declare your dislike for them and make it clear that you’re seeking revenge? Or does it send the message that you can rise above actions that hurt you and be successful despite what you’ve endured?It’s open to interpretation, really; but one thing is for certain: If you don’t like this song, Taylor Swift isn’t interested. After all, “you” made her do this—and I have a feeling that this single is just the first nail in the coffin. Welcome to the Reputation era. Enjoying your stay so far?"

ICE released Riccy Enriquez Perdomo later Thursday evening. The officers had detained her last week when she went to an immigration office in Louisville, Kentucky, to help someone from her church post bond. She told the officers she was allowed to stay in the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but they didn’t listen, according to her family members and immigration advocates.ICE officials said in a statement that officers searched for Enriquez’s information in their databases and determined she was not a lawful permanent resident, which they said she initially claimed to be. During that review, they saw she had DACA status that expired in March, the officials said.“Only after further investigation was it determined that her DACA status had been renewed on Jan. 31, 2017,” according to the statement.Although ICE released Enriquez, she remains under an order of supervision and ICE kept her work permit, driver’s license and Social Security card, Lynn Tramonte, deputy director of America’s Voice Education Fund, a pro-immigrant group, told HuffPost. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on her documents or whether she still has DACA status. DACA recipients ― so-called Dreamers who came to the U.S. as children without authorization ― aren’t supposed to be deported under the program Obama set up by executive action in 2012. But immigrant rights advocates say they are seeing an uptick in Dreamer detention under President Donald Trump. Enriquez’s case was particularly unusual because the government was set to deport her even though it hadn’t revoked her DACA status, which she received in 2015 and renewed in January, according to her family and lawyers helping with her case. She wasn’t arrested for a crime first, nor had she done anything else to lose her protection under DACA, they said. She was detained anyway ― and it took a week for her to get out, even though her DACA status had not actually expired.The case has raised questions about the Trump administration’s commitment to upholding the terms of DACA, which has been granted to nearly 800,000 people. The president has disparaged the program and pledged to end it, but he hasn’t done so ― even amid legal threats to its continuation.Even as the program remains in effect, however, Trump has pushed for tougher enforcement of immigration laws by ICE officers. And immigrant rights advocates said this is increasingly leading the agents to make their own decisions about whether to respect the protections provided by DACA. “In Riccy’s case we have yet another example of ICE field agents who have been emboldened ... to act in a way that clearly violates the federal government’s promise to DACA recipients, and it’s simply unacceptable,” National Immigration Law Center supervising attorney Josh Stehlik said on a call briefing reporters about the woman’s detention. Enriquez came to the U.S. from Honduras without authorization at age 9. Although she had a prior deportation order, she has been approved for DACA twice. (Individuals with removal orders are still eligible for DACA if they meet other requirements.) She is a married mother of two children, a 5-year-old and an 11-month-old, and lives in northern Kentucky in the greater Cincinnati area. Enriquez’s brother-in-law, Robert Cote, said ICE moved her around to different facilities including one near Chicago ― and kept the family up in the air concerning her whereabouts. He said an ICE officer in Chicago, whose name he did not get, told him that DACA was no longer in effect since Trump became president. Cote called it “great news” that Enriquez would not be deported, but he expressed concern about what her case meant for other DACA recipients.“We still can’t miss the point that this is still going on,” Cote said on the call with reporters. “It’s still happening to people. ... If [agents] are not enforcing the DACA program, this might not end here.”Enriquez’s cause received national attention, including from Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), a co-sponsor of legislation to give Dreamers permanent legal status. He said on Wednesday he was disturbed by reports that a DACA recipient had been detained, and that then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who now serves as White House chief of staff, had previously assured him “that no one with DACA would lose this protection unless they violated the terms of the program.”“I intend to hold him to that commitment,” Durbin said in a statement.Immigrant rights advocates said they want Trump to make clear to ICE agents that DACA remains in place and that a repeat of Enriquez’s ordeal shouldn’t happen again. “This never should have happened in the first place,” Tramonte said. “This is supposed to be a policy that’s still in place and this administration needs to act like it.”This story was updated to include information about Enriquez’s status with ICE and the confiscation of several documents."
71,COLLEGE,Why Universities Are Phasing Out Luxury Dorms,"The Atlantic, ContributorExploring the American idea since 1857",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-universities-are-phasing-out-luxury-dorms_us_599ed202e4b0cb7715bfd371,"As colleges increasingly worry about boosting their retention and graduation rates, campuses are returning to their old-school ways.",2017-08-24,<p>Floor plan of a Patton Hall suite (Courtesy of GSU)</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599ed2b31900001600dd528b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jeffrey SelingoWhen I was a college freshman in the early 1990s, I lived in a dorm that was as sterile as a hospital room, a 193-square-foot box with white cinderblock walls that I shared with two other guys. The bathroom was also shared — with an entire floor.Such basic living quarters greeted generations of college students before me. For much of the history of American higher education, dorms and other student amenities — from dining halls to recreational centers — were an afterthought to the primary business of campus planning: grand academic buildings. In fact, in the 1840s, the president of Brown University described dorm life as “unnatural” and blamed student housing for most of the evils of college life. Brown and Columbia University even attempted to eliminate dorms from their campuses. While that move ultimately proved unsuccessful, student housing and other facilities that supported student life on most campuses remained a fairly spartan experience up until the 1990s.By the turn of this century, colleges had an increasing appetite for campus luxuries. A surge of students from the millennial generation were graduating from high schools nationwide, and many colleges found the simplest way to compete for attention in a crowded market was to build fancier facilities. Construction cranes became ubiquitous on campuses, and often the most high-profile projects involved student amenities — rock-climbing walls in recreation centers, swanky student unions with first-rate food services, and luxury “residence halls” with private bathrooms — usually financed by borrowing. Between 2001 and 2012, the amount of debt taken on by colleges rose 88 percent, to $307 billion.RELATED: The Fall of MIT’s Counter-Culture DormGettysburg College spent $27 million on a 55,000-square-foot recreational center with a bouldering area. Drexel University devoted $45 million to its own 84,000-square-foot recreation center, complete with a walking and jogging track. The University of Memphis paid $50 million for a 169,000-square-foot campus center that houses a theater, food court, and a 24-hour computer lab. Texas Tech University boasts “the largest leisure pool on a college campus in the United States, with a 645-foot-long lazy river as the centerpiece of the design.”New student fees approved by undergraduates funded the debt for many of these amenities. These were students who, by the time the fees were implemented, had long since graduated, leaving the tab for their successors. Now, after a building boom that lasted more than a decade, the pace of spending on lavish campus frills is slowing. Some 6.6 million square feet of space for dorms and student services opened on campuses in 2015, according to the higher-education construction consulting firm Sightlines, the leanest year for new buildings dedicated to student spaces since the company started tracking construction in 2000. The high point for student amenities came in 2004, when more than 11 million square feet opened.The reason behind this shift is a combination of growing concerns about rising tuition and student debt, declining numbers of high-school graduates, and the ever-fluctuating tastes of students and parents.RELATED: A College Is a Community but Cannot Be a Home“We don’t see the amenities arms race anymore,” said Susan Fitzgerald, an associate managing director at Moody’s Investors Service, which examines the finances of more than 500 colleges that issue bonds through the public markets. “We’re seeing a move away from trophy buildings as universities prioritize their spending.”After building one of the country’s most-expensive student-housing projects, a $168 million complex of apartment-style residences called University Commons, in 2007, Georgia State University officials worried about the impact of pricier housing on the ability of students to earn a degree. The university found that for every $5,000 in unmet financial need, a student was 12 percent less likely to graduate.So Jerry Rackliffe, Georgia State’s vice president for finance and administration, asked the university’s facilities and housing leaders to develop a plan for a simple and tiny dorm-room option that would cost students less than housing in University Commons and include a dining plan (which wasn’t included with the on-campus apartments). “When I first brought this up, the housing folks said it wouldn’t work because every college is building apartment buildings,” Rackliffe said. “We agreed to do a few hundred beds as a test.”RELATED: Why Men Are the New College MinorityThe result was Patton Hall, which opened in 2009. Each room holds three students, with a single bed on one side and two on the other side connected in the middle by a Jack-and-Jill bathroom (private bathrooms save money in housekeeping costs when compared to communal bathrooms). Overall, everything is smaller in Patton Hall: 191 square feet per resident compared to 443 square feet in University Commons. Patton also has a dining hall on the first floor. The cost of Patton’s shared room and an unlimited meal plan is less than the room alone in University Commons. From the day it opened, the new dorm has filled up faster than other campus housing. Patton Hall was so popular that in 2011 the university converted two local hotels using its basic dorm concept. The rooms “might be tiny, but they still include modern conveniences,” Rackliffe said, such as washers and dryers and lounges on each floor, Wi-Fi, and air conditioning.Affordability is also driving new housing projects at the University of California’s San Francisco and San Diego campuses. In San Francisco, a shortage of on-campus beds and affordable off-campus housing “threatens enrollment,” said Leslie Santos, the executive director of housing services at UCSF. The San Francisco campus is breaking ground this fall on a new housing complex that reduces square footage per bed by a third in some cases, mostly by eliminating the living room.“Students are more open to these new living arrangements than we give them credit for,” said Thomas Carlson-Reddig, a partner at Little, an architectural firm that designs a dozen campus projects a year. “If you can get the cost down, students will live in a closet.”Another reason for colleges withdrawing from the amenities arms race is that higher education is “no longer in a growth mode,” said Fitzgerald of Moody’s, so there are fewer dollars available to build student luxuries. Enrollment numbers in higher education have fallen for five consecutive years. This year alone there were 81,000 fewer high-school graduates nationwide than a year ago. The decline in college-going students has hit small colleges — a sector of higher education that used new dorms and student centers to lure applicants over the last decade — the hardest. Nearly one-third of small colleges operated with a budget deficit last year, according to Moody’s, up from 20 percent three years ago.New buildings are often the first stop on campus tours for prospective students and their families. Jeff Kallay, who has been hired by dozens of colleges as a consultant to improve their tours and make them more effective in motivating prospective students to apply, said he has seen a shift from “grandiose palaces to niche amenities,” such as gaming lounges for Wii and Xbox. The University of Alabama at Birmingham and Saint Leo University in Florida are among those with elaborate game rooms. “Today’s Generation X parents don’t care as much if their kids suffer in older-style dorms,” said Kallay, the chief executive and cofounder of Render Experiences.It’s also unclear if the “build it and they will come” approach actually worked in attracting students or keeping them through graduation. “It doesn’t cohere to how students make choices about where to go to college,” said Kevin McClure, an assistant professor of higher education at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, who studies campus housing.Take Indiana University of Pennsylvania as an example of a school that made a big bet on amenities to gain students but without success. Late last decade, the state school 60 miles northeast of Pittsburgh replaced all student housing on campus with apartment-style suites, at a cost of $270 million. Since 2010, its undergraduate enrollment has dropped 17 percent to just over 10,000 students. Even so, for less-selective schools like Indiana University of Pennsylvania, it is usually easier to construct new buildings than improve academic quality, which not only takes longer to achieve but is also less visible to families on tours. That’s the takeaway from a 2015 study from researchers at the University of Michigan, who analyzed a phenomenon they described as “college as country club” and the pressure on schools to cater to students’ desire for “consumption amenities.”The study found that lower-tier schools “have greater incentive to focus on consumption amenities” because prospective students of less-selective colleges may care more about the “resort” experience of college than teaching and academics. The researchers drew parallels to health care, “where patient amenities are a much stronger driver of hospital demand than clinical quality.” But that analogy is not quite apt since the goal of hospitals is not to keep patients for a specific amount of time, as is the case in higher education where the goal is to keep students until they receive a diploma. Fewer than 40 percent of students enrolling for the first time at a four-year college actually graduate in four years, and many drop out never to return.Some higher-education experts argue that ever-fancier amenities for students distract them from their studies — college students spend only a quarter of their week on academic pursuits—and encourage them to spend time alone in private kitchens and bedrooms rather than with other students in dining halls or lounges. Research shows that without the sense of community that often comes from living together in close communal quarters, students may have fewer opportunities to learn how to get along with different people and manage conflicts, or develop the friendships and networks that keep them in school.As colleges increasingly worry about boosting their retention and graduation rates, campuses are returning to their old-school ways. The barrack-like communal living of my undergraduate days probably won’t ever return, but dorms and other student amenities are going back to more modest times with the conveniences of the modern age.This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: Why Do Women Bully Each Other at Work?, A Dinosaur So Well Preserved, It Looks Like a Statue"

The 31-year-old’s blog and Instagram feed are an aspiring adventurer’s dream, showing him navigating rapids, exploring desert canyons and, in a wink to “The Sound of Music,” scaling mountaintops with his arms outstretched. Based on the photos, it’s easy to assume Meyer is enjoying an epic – and seemingly never-ending – summer getaway. The Nebraska native, who is gay, is actually is in the midst of a three-year journey that will take him to all 417 National Park Service (NPS) sites in America. When Meyer completes the journey in 2019, he’ll not only join a group of about 40 people to have visited all of those sites, he’ll also reportedly become the youngest person to do so. And that’s not all: he’ll also become the first person in history to hit all of those sites in one continuous trip, according to the NPS. (He reached the halfway point Aug. 14, when he visited Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota, his 209 site.) The feat, Meyer told HuffPost, will stand as a tribute to his father, Larry, who died of esophageal cancer at age 58. Meyer, who was 19 at the time of his father’s death in 2005, says it “totally changed” his world view. “He was a good Midwestern Protestant who thought you work hard, and then when you turn 65, you get to follow your dreams,” he said. “He never got to that point.”Days after his father’s funeral, Meyer embarked on his first road trip through Minnesota and South Dakota, and has continued to travel every year since then. The plan to visit the national parks came about as Meyer’s 30 birthday loomed, and coincides with the NPS’s Find Your Park initiative, which marks the organization’s centennial anniversary. He travels in between sites in a white, windowless cargo van he’s nicknamed “Vanny McVanface” which fits a queen-sized bed and is outfitted with solar panels to power a small refrigerator and other electronics. “I wanted to do something bigger and more epic as a way to honor my father and honor this lesson that I’d learned,” he said, “and share that lesson with other people so that they didn’t have to learn it the same way I did.”When Meyer kicked off his trip in April 2016, he opted not to reveal the fact that he was gay and a practicing Christian, fearing that his sexuality and faith would impact sponsorship.

73,QUEER VOICES,This Gay Outdoorsman's Epic Adventure Is A Testament To Family -- And Equality,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mikah-meyer-national-park-service_us_59933cc7e4b0e789a9472c7d,Mikah Meyer wants to break barriers and open minds in his three-year trek.,2017-08-24,"“It took me until my mid-20s to come to a place where I was able to accept that I was gay, and that I didn’t have to lose my Christian identity in order to accept it,” Meyer, shown here at White Sands National Monument in New Mexico, said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599ef2881f00003d001aab7f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Mikah Meyer proudly wears his vagabond heart on his sleeve. The 31-year-old’s blog and Instagram feed are an aspiring adventurer’s dream, showing him navigating rapids, exploring desert canyons and, in a wink to “The Sound of Music,” scaling mountaintops with his arms outstretched. Based on the photos, it’s easy to assume Meyer is enjoying an epic – and seemingly never-ending – summer getaway. The Nebraska native, who is gay, is actually is in the midst of a three-year journey that will take him to all 417 National Park Service (NPS) sites in America. When Meyer completes the journey in 2019, he’ll not only join a group of about 40 people to have visited all of those sites, he’ll also reportedly become the youngest person to do so. And that’s not all: he’ll also become the first person in history to hit all of those sites in one continuous trip, according to the NPS. (He reached the halfway point Aug. 14, when he visited Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota, his 209 site.) The feat, Meyer told HuffPost, will stand as a tribute to his father, Larry, who died of esophageal cancer at age 58. Meyer, who was 19 at the time of his father’s death in 2005, says it “totally changed” his world view. “He was a good Midwestern Protestant who thought you work hard, and then when you turn 65, you get to follow your dreams,” he said. “He never got to that point.”Days after his father’s funeral, Meyer embarked on his first road trip through Minnesota and South Dakota, and has continued to travel every year since then. The plan to visit the national parks came about as Meyer’s 30 birthday loomed, and coincides with the NPS’s Find Your Park initiative, which marks the organization’s centennial anniversary. He travels in between sites in a white, windowless cargo van he’s nicknamed “Vanny McVanface” which fits a queen-sized bed and is outfitted with solar panels to power a small refrigerator and other electronics. “I wanted to do something bigger and more epic as a way to honor my father and honor this lesson that I’d learned,” he said, “and share that lesson with other people so that they didn’t have to learn it the same way I did.”When Meyer kicked off his trip in April 2016, he opted not to reveal the fact that he was gay and a practicing Christian, fearing that his sexuality and faith would impact sponsorship. (His current roster of supporters includes Grand Canyon Whitewater and outdoor apparel retailer Mountainsmith, among others.)

74,ENTERTAINMENT,Game of Thrones: 11 Ways To Improve Episode 6,"Gil Kidron, ContributorGot Academy, Co-Owner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-11-ways-to-improve-episode-6_us_599eb027e4b0a62d0987acf0,"Love it or hate, the last episode in Game of Thrones was the talk of the internet. Finally, the dragons were fighting beyond",2017-08-24,"<p>When they were zooming on the dragon’s eye, was anyone surprised it opened up all blue?</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599eb0921e00005719c5f16b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Love it or hate, the last episode in Game of Thrones was the talk of the internet. Finally, the dragons were fighting beyond the wall! Against the White Walkers! And a dragon died! And then re-animated! And Arya threatened to kill her sister! And Jon and Daenerys teamed up to fight evil!Some epic shit right there.So how come this episode was for many viewers so underwhelming, to say the least?One could blame the show’s creators, Dan and Dave, for sprinting towards the finish line and rushing the plot, but that would be a copout. You could rush to the finish line and still write good dialogues and not leave a thousand plot holes in the ice for the characters to fall into.A little bit of humbleness and openness to criticism could have made this episode much much better. And in this spirit of humbleness, here are a few examples of how these renown writers could have made this episode better:1. Every single viewer knew the dragon was going to come back to life the moment they pulled him out of the water. But we had to sit through a minute of the King Night walking over, placing his hand and then zoom on his eye opening all blue for ab additional 20 seconds. When something is so predictable, it’s less enjoyable, so why not show the Night King walking towards the camera, have us focus on him, and then – BOOM! – the dragon bursts out of the water behind him, catching us all unprepared.2. Or maybe the Night King could have mounted the dragon at the end? That would have been a better finish to the episode.3. Since we KNEW that Daenerys was coming over to save them, because she told us, we were ready for to reach our band of brother right at the nick of time. And in case we weren’t sure when she’d get there, the battle was going all slo-mo and the music was telling us all is lost – cue saving dragons. Why not end the scene between Tyrion and Daenerys arguing thinking that Tyrion convinced her not to go? Then we would have been pleasantly surprised when she in fact did get there.Was Game of Thrones Season 7 Episode 6 the worst of the show? Game of Thrones Academy say yes. Watch this video4. The same kind of faux-suspense was used several more time. When our heroes see the undead bear, instead of it coming from nowhere and – again – surprising us, he was introduced slowly and explained that his eyes were blue, and then he came over slowly and only then attacked. Sigh.5. Easy on the Deux Ex Machina. So when all is lost the dragons save the day. And 10 minutes later again all is lost and Benjen save the day. Wouldn’t have it been better to have Jon ride a dragon away? Or maybe sneak away unnoticed? What did we gain by Benjen’s one line of “there is no time” and 15 seconds of screen time?6. We know Jon is not going to die, so there’s no point pretending we were scared that he drowned.7. Dan and Dave stated that the way they write the story is by highlighting several big plot goals they want to reach, and then work around towards them. The plot goal in episode 6 was to have one dragon die and become a zombie dragon. How will we get there? Through a poorly thought-out plan of a team of Avengers who sail up north and go beyond the wall in hope to meet a small White Walker and Zombie scouting party, separate one zombie, keep it alive, then bring it over to King’s Landing. Funny how that’s exactly what happened, huh? Why not have Bran see that the White Walkers were going to attack East Watch By The Sea and then Jon and Daenerys had go over there to fight? Simpler and more plausible.8. The previous change would have removed the need for ""red shirts"" extras who join the mission just in order to die.9. Less airy dialogue about past feuds and backstory, full of self-references that seem like lazy writing. Thank you.10. Instead of shooting this episode as if it's an action and fantasy story, go for dark realism Battle of the Bastards-style. That was a predictable episode, and still easily in the top 5 best episodes of the show.11. If you've been mining dragonglass for half a season, take a lot of it to the north and use it and mention it. Otherwise, why bother?Game of Thrones was not supposed to be a story about absurd, with thousands of winter creatures who wait for a lake to freeze over before they attack the human invaders. Really? The zombies can't swim? Why? And the White Walkers do bring winter, so how come the lake took so long to freeze? And why not attack them all at once but rather send the zombies one after the other? And why shoot the ice lance at a flying smaller dragon with no rider rather than the stationary big dragon with the fire queen on it?It sure seems like the show writers and director just went through the motions in anticipation that people will enjoy themselves only because we know the characters and dragons and zombies are cool. It sure did feel as if the viewers who enjoyed the episode put in much more effort into the plot, providing a dazzling display of water cooler explanations for the many head scratching moments. Let's hope for a better season finale.Check out Gil Kidron’s YouTube channel Game of Thrones Academy for a look at Game of Thrones through the lens of history.Follow Gil Kidron on Twitter: www.twitter.com/GoT_Academy"
75,SCIENCE,Can Dogs Smell Their ‘Reflections’?,"The Atlantic, ContributorExploring the American idea since 1857",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/can-dogs-smell-their-reflections_us_599ddaaee4b056057bddd06c,"If you want to know if they have a concept of self, it makes little sense to confront them with a mirror.",2017-08-24,"<p>""Who is that pooch I see, staring straight back at me?""</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599ddafd1e00001600c5f075.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Ed YongIn 1970, a psychologist named Gordon Gallup Jr. anesthetized four chimpanzees and applied red dye to their eyebrows. When the chimps came around, they caught sight of their reflections in a mirror that had been placed in their enclosure. And they did what you or I might do in those circumstances — they touched their eyebrows, prodding at the marks. Gallup concluded that chimps could recognize their own reflections — a feat that “would seem to require a rather advanced form of intellect” and that “implies a concept of self.”Thus was born the mirror test — one of the most famous techniques in the study of animal intelligence, and one of the most controversial. The test has been administered to dozens of species, and usually takes roughly the same form. An animal is marked on a part of its body that it can’t usually see, and given access to a mirror. If it inspects the mark on its body, and not on the reflection, and if it interacts with that area more often than usual, then it passes the test.Chimps and orangutans have consistently passed, as have some bottlenose dolphins, Asian elephants and European magpies. That seems like a list of animal intelligentsia, but other clever creatures have largely or completely failed the test, including crows, parrots, gorillas, monkeys, dogs and even some young children. As I wrote earlier this year, these failures say very little about whether these individuals have a sense of self, and a lot about whether the mirror test is actually appropriate for them.RELATED: A New Origin Story for DogsConsider the dogs. Dogs don’t groom each other to the same extent that apes do, so there’s no reason to expect that they would try to examine a mark on their heads. What’s more, the mirror test is a visual test, designed by visual animals (us) for other visual animals. Dogs see just fine, but they mainly live in a world of smell. If you want to know if they have a concept of self, it makes little sense to confront them with a mirror. You need to work in their world. A world of chemicals drifting through the air. A world that’s hard for us to imagine.“Smell is so distant to our experience,” says Alexandra Horowitz from Barnard College. “We’re just not engaged with olfaction, so it’s taken a long time to see — or even imagine — what the world might be like for non-visual creatures, and to design experiments with that in mind.”Marc Bekoff from the University of Colorado, Boulder, did just that with his own dog Jethro. Over five winters, he would scoop up snow that Jethro and other dogs had peed upon, and move it to new locations. “For some reasons passers-by thought I was strange and generally left me alone,” Bekoff later wrote. He found that Jethro spent less time sniffing his own urine than that of other dogs. He wouldn’t have been able to recognize himself in a mirror, but he could recognize his own distinct odor.RELATED: Dogs’ Love Isn’t Unconditional After AllInspired by this “yellow snow experiment,” Horowitz (who once studied with Bekoff) designed a bigger and more thorough study. She recruited 36 New York dog owners and presented their pooches with two canisters. In one, she put a tiny drop of each dog’s own urine. In the other, she put the same urine along with a different scent — the equivalent of marking an animal’s head with red dye.The dogs spent more time sniffing the canister with the modified odor than the one with their unadulterated urine. The presence of the extra scent changed how they behaved toward their own smell, just as the presence of a red mark changes how a chimp behaves toward its image in a mirror.Does this mean that they’re recognizing their own olfactory “reflection”? Not quite. Horowitz also gave the animals a choice between their adulterated urine, and the adulterating smell on its own. And this time, they sniffed both canisters just as often. This suggests that the dogs were drawn to the modified urine not because it contradicted some sense of self, but simply because it was unfamiliar. Dogs, after all, are drawn to new things.RELATED: What Is Jogging Doing to Your Dog?After seeing these results, Horowitz wondered if she had made her life more difficult than necessary, by choosing a scent that was too powerful. She had adulterated the dogs’ urine with an extract of cancerous tissue, taken from a dog at a nearby veterinary school. Perhaps that was just too interesting a scent.To control for this possibility, Horowitz repeated her experiment with 12 new dogs. This time, she altered their urine with a more neutral odor — anise essential oil. Once again, they spent more time sniffing their urine when it had been modified. But this time, they also sniffed that modified urine more than a sample of anise oil on its own. “I think it’s a nice analogy to the chimpanzee seeing a red mark on her forehead,” Horowitz says. “Seeing a red mark isn’t intrinsically interesting. It’s only interesting when it’s situated on oneself.”Admittedly, the crucial second study is a third the size of the first. But mirror-test experiments with other animals have often relied on sample sizes that are even smaller. And Horowitz adds that the dogs reacted to the scents at a speed that’s rarely seen in mirror studies. “Gallup’s chimps had ad-lib access to the mirror, and he was looking at behavior over many hours,” she says. “These dogs had limited time to investigate [the canisters] and yet we got this result. I’d assume that if we gave them that ad-lib exposure, we’d see a lot more exploratory behaviour of the modified scent.”“This research demonstrates that the way we ask about animal cognition can be just as important as the questions asked,” says Monqiue Udell from Oregon State University, who also studies dog intelligence. “In some cases, asking a dog to complete a task designed for chimpanzees may be like asking a native English speaker to complete an intelligence test in a foreign language they have never studied.”Does this mean that dogs have a sense of self? Or a theory of mind — an ability to understand the mental states of others as distinct from one’s own? Such questions may be too simplistic. “I think that all of these abilities, which we mostly decline to see in nonhuman animals until they’ve passed our tests, are defined in a far too binary way,” Horowitz says.“What we usually see is that an animal’s performance lies somewhere along a spectrum of skill, and dogs are not at the zero part of that spectrum,” she adds. “I’d say that they have a rudimentary theory of mind — one that’s not equivalent to a human adult, but that isn’t an absence of thinking about one’s self and others. They have, as we would suspect, some understanding of self, and some recognition of who they are as distinct from others.”This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: Why Do Women Bully Each Other at Work?, A Dinosaur So Well Preserved, It Looks Like a Statue"

But He's Hurting His Own Agenda In Doing So.,"Andrew Revkin, ProPublica",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-fossil-fuels-carbon-cost_us_599f14d2e4b0821444c1bb55,"""Rather than speeding the process of infrastructure and energy development, the Trump administration has risked slowing it down.”",2017-08-24,"Robert Powelson, nominee to be a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for President Donald Trump, speaks during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee nomination hearing in Washington, D.C., on May 25, 2017. He now serves on the commission.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599f24a51e00002700c5f2e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s efforts to boost fossil fuel extraction face a courtroom hurdle of his own making.Trump’s March 28 executive order “promoting energy independence and economic growth” rescinded the Obama administration’s calculation of the “social cost of carbon” — a metric that had been central to the process of crafting and justifying government rules addressing human-driven climate change.All government regulations are subject to cost/benefit analysis. The “social cost of carbon” was developed in large part to compare long-term costs from coastal flooding and other impacts of emissions of climate-warming carbon dioxide with upfront costs to the economy from curbing the burning of fossil fuels, the main source of such emissions.The value at the end of the Obama presidency was set at roughly $40 for each ton of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas emitted by human activities, or equivalent amounts of other gases such as methane. At that price, the benefits of Obama’s proposals to reduce emissions outweighed the economic costs.The Trump order required a new calculation and ordered agencies to use procedures issued by the Office of Management and Budget in 2003 to craft relevant regulations.A protracted delay in the Trump administration coming up with its own carbon-cost estimate could empower environmentalists pursuing legal challenges to mining, drilling or pipeline projects, said Richard Revesz, director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law.In an email on Tuesday, he pointed to two recent court decisions. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, must consider the impact of greenhouse gas emissions that will result from construction of three new interstate pipelines in the Southeast.The Sierra Club, other environmental groups and some affected landowners had challenged the commission’s environmental review of the project. “In the ruling, the judges held that FERC ‘must either quantify and consider the project’s downstream carbon emissions or explain in more detail why it cannot do so,’” Revesz said, adding: “The court further explained that FERC should either use the social cost of carbon to monetize the climate effects associated with those emissions or explain why it chooses not to do so.”Just last week, another federal court decision blocked a proposed coal mine expansion in Montana in part over the government’s failure to assess the environmental impact of burning additional coal. (Nearly all of the coal from that mine has been exported to Asia or Europe of late, according to court documents). In that ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Donald W. Molloy of Montana pointed to the government’s failure to use the existing calculations for the social costs of carbon, arguing that government officials “could, and should, have tied its greenhouse gas emissions calculation to the effects of those emissions.’’ The decision, Judge Molloy wrote, was arbitrary and capricious because officials quantified the benefits of expanded mining “while failing to account for the costs, even though a tool was available to do so.’’The lawsuit about the Montana coal mine was filed in 2015, but expansion of western coal mining and exports has been a signature aspect of the Trump agenda. Similar mining plans have eventually gotten court approval, but only after officials submitted estimates of the environmental and climate impacts.“These rulings show how President Trump’s executive order withdrawing support for the social cost of carbon is misguided and shortsighted,” said Revesz. “As these recent rulings show, agencies will lose legal challenges when they don’t appropriately consider climate change impacts. Rather than speeding the process of infrastructure and energy development, the Trump administration has risked slowing it down.” Given the pace of appointments at relevant agencies, the work of revising the cost of carbon calculation is likely to drag on. So far, the Trump administration has been slow to embrace science advice — with no presidential adviser yet named and many relevant positions at the Office of Science and Technology Policy cut or empty.In June, Jim Laity, a career Office of Management and Budget employee who runs the environmental branch of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, signaled that work to revise the carbon calculation was underway. During an online presentation at a public workshop on the social cost of carbon at the National Academy of Sciences, Laity said relevant agencies were “actively working on thinking about the guidance,” according to Greenwire.Asked what has changed since then, a spokesman for OMB, Jacob A. Wood, said in an email on Wednesday that the Trump administration “is still considering how to implement” the portion of the executive order on the social cost of carbon. “As of right now, there is no other update,” he wrote.There’s plenty of advice the Trump administration can draw on to make a new estimate, ranging from a January report on ways to improve carbon-cost calculations from the independent National Academy of Sciences to a call to scrap the social cost of carbon altogether, made by the Institute for Energy Research, an industry-backed Washington policy group that strongly influenced the Trump campaign and presidential transition process.Laity’s presentation in June did hint at a much lower cost of carbon to come, noting the significance of Trump’s reference to the 2003 Office of Management and Budget guidance for writing regulations. (Here’s the webinar recording.) “[I]t says pretty unequivocally that the main focus … should be costs and benefits that accrue to citizens and residents of the United States,” Laity said. “After that it says if a regulation does have significant impacts outside the United States that are important to consider in the regulation for some reason then they should be clearly segregated out and they should be reported separately.”Under the previous administration’s process, he said, “That wasn’t what we were doing.”The Obama-era cost of carbon included costs of impacts outside the U.S. — with more than $30 of that $40 a ton coming from projected climate change impacts abroad, according to several economists who have studied the process.As OMB proceeds with its study, it will have plenty of input from groups affiliated with industry, including the Institute for Energy Research. In an email on Wednesday, Robert P. Murphy, a senior economist for the group, said: “We appreciate that agencies are in an awkward position right now, but our view is that the correct decision is to avoid using such a dubious concept as the ‘social cost of carbon’ in its present form.”He said the calculations mask enormous value judgements, arguing that the resulting dollar value has little to do with science and much to do with an administration’s view of the world. “Even if we agreed on a particular computer simulation of the monetary damages accruing from climate change over the next few centuries, the calculation of the ‘social cost of carbon’ would vary widely, depending on our choice of parameters that have nothing to do with climate science,” he said.In that, Murphy’s sentiments reflect those of some analysts whose views on climate are at odds with the Trump administration. David Roberts, now writing on climate and energy at Vox, wrote a much-cited column for Grist a few years ago dissecting economic calculations used to determine how much it is worth today to limit climate-related harms generations in the future.Roberts warned, “They are social and ethical disputes being waged under cover of math, as though they are nothing but technical matters to be determined by ‘experts.’”There’s really no legally defensible stance for having no social cost of carbon, said Michael Greenstone, a University of Chicago economist who in 2009 co-led the Obama administration working group that updated federal carbon-cost calculations. That group was disbanded under Trump’s March order.In a phone interview on Wednesday, Greenstone said, “There are several elements that go into the social cost of carbon about which we’re uncertain. But it’s specious to imply that the best response to that uncertainty is to do nothing.”Interviews earlier this year with a range of economists and policy analysts suggested that the Trump administration would end up setting a very low cost of carbon, perhaps $5 a ton, but not reject the metric entirely. This would be consistent with an influential federal appeals court ruling late in 2007, which found that the administration of George W. Bush improperly ignored costs from global warming in setting gas-mileage standards for sport utility vehicles and small trucks.“[W]hile the record shows that there is a range of values, the value of carbon emissions reduction is certainly not zero,” the ruling said.Read the story at ProPublica here.

As these white supremacists try tirelessly to normalize their racism and bigotry, Trump continually fails to denounce it. I would argue that he is supporting it.This week at an erratic campaign speech in Phoenix, Trump tried yet again to convince the American people that he is not a racist. His words are meaningless as long as he continues to support policies that advance a campaign of xenophobia and hatred against black and brown communities. Meaningful change would mean our president taking action that condemns hate and reflects the values that the majority of Americans treasure. Values of family, opportunity, and equality. Values that our neighbors – including immigrants who have helped build our communities – uphold and strengthen every day. Values that a generation of immigrant youths, including DREAMers – 800,000 young people who are actively contributing to their communities, working and going to school – believe in and fight for every day.The world is watching as Donald Trump fails to defend and protect families of color. His most recent example of his failure: Holding DREAMers hostage for a border wall that does not even address the real immigration concerns of this country. The wall is a trophy, a vestige of his vile and bigoted campaign rhetoric that continues to infect the presidency.If Trump is really interested in showing the country that he isn’t aligned with the white supremacists spreading violence and hatred in our communities, he should act quickly to defend DREAMers by protecting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program that has allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to work and go to school without fear of deportation. These young people are working to build not just better lives for themselves, but stronger communities across our country.If Trump acts on his threat to end DACA, it would force hundreds of thousands of Dreamers to retreat into the shadows and live their lives in fear of deportation or be forced to return to countries they barely remember. The devastating consequences of this are almost too much to bear – shattered lives, impacted communities and destroyed dreams. Doing so would also send a clear signal to the alt-right that the president of the United States does in fact support their agenda of ethnic cleansing.

As these white supremacists try tirelessly to normalize their racism and bigotry, Trump continually fails to denounce it. I would argue that he is supporting it.This week at an erratic campaign speech in Phoenix, Trump tried yet again to convince the American people that he is not a racist. His words are meaningless as long as he continues to support policies that advance a campaign of xenophobia and hatred against black and brown communities. Meaningful change would mean our president taking action that condemns hate and reflects the values that the majority of Americans treasure. Values of family, opportunity, and equality. Values that our neighbors – including immigrants who have helped build our communities – uphold and strengthen every day. Values that a generation of immigrant youths, including DREAMers – 800,000 young people who are actively contributing to their communities, working and going to school – believe in and fight for every day.The world is watching as Donald Trump fails to defend and protect families of color. His most recent example of his failure: Holding DREAMers hostage for a border wall that does not even address the real immigration concerns of this country. The wall is a trophy, a vestige of his vile and bigoted campaign rhetoric that continues to infect the presidency.If Trump is really interested in showing the country that he isn’t aligned with the white supremacists spreading violence and hatred in our communities, he should act quickly to defend DREAMers by protecting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program that has allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to work and go to school without fear of deportation. These young people are working to build not just better lives for themselves, but stronger communities across our country.If Trump acts on his threat to end DACA, it would force hundreds of thousands of Dreamers to retreat into the shadows and live their lives in fear of deportation or be forced to return to countries they barely remember. The devastating consequences of this are almost too much to bear – shattered lives, impacted communities and destroyed dreams. Doing so would also send a clear signal to the alt-right that the president of the United States does in fact support their agenda of ethnic cleansing. But defending DACA, and advancing a 2018 federal budget that invests in education and healthcare instead of spending more than $6 billion on a deportation force, would be a critical stand against the anti-family, anti-equality, pro-hate forces that threaten to destroy the fabric of this country.All around the nation immigrants are standing strong to protect the values we profess as a country, all the while risking the threats of deportation, severed families and direct attacks from newly emboldened white supremacists and xenophobes.

This is not solely the cheery gloat of the quarterback’s greatest detractors ― it is the begrudged admission of some of his adamant defenders and Kaepernick himself. But if this is truth ― if there is no room for Kaepernick in the National Football League ― there best be room for the activism he wrought, according to supporters of the former 49er. On Wednesday evening, they demanded as much in no uncertain terms.A crowd swelled outside NFL headquarters, at the intersection of 51st Street and Park Avenue, and spilled onto the sidewalk, churning with agitation. The “United We Stand Rally for Colin Kaepernick” was, effectively, a warning ― a declaration that the quarterback’s dissenters, be they within the league or without, would not have final say on the validity of his message.It had been almost a year to the day since Kaepernick divulged his rationale for silent protest at the outset of the 2016 season: he believed showing blind deference to the national anthem as people of color suffer under the weight of disproportional policing was hypocritical. Since providing this rationale, Kaepernick endured a whirlwind season. He battled back from injury, earned a starting job, headed a lowly 49ers squad, and finished the season a middle-of-the-pack play-caller boasting the tangible adoration of his teammates. Under ordinary conditions, a free agent with his player profile would have found a new team with relative ease. Yet, weeks before the start of the season, Kaepernick is without a single offer. Demonstrators and coordinators alike attribute this to ostracism. “It is an egregious example of the injustices in today’s world when an expressed advocacy by Colin Kaepernick seems to have resulted in him not being signed by a team,” said Symone D. Sanders, former press secretary for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign and rally co-organizer. “We believe that the NFL is complicit in this ostracization of Colin Kaepernick — that they have, essentially, sat silently, and we are calling on the NFL to act.”Sanders said the rally’s aims were twofold, intending both to highlight the peculiarity and injustice in Kaepernick’s unemployment and to establish a means by which future players can undertake advocacy without fear of backlash.The concerns expressed by Sanders and her team of notable co-organizers have not yet been addressed. “We sent a letter to the NFL requesting policy changes,” Sanders said. “The NFL declined to meet with us today and have yet to set up a follow-up meeting; they say they’re working on it.”The rally featured a gamut of clergymen, activists, authors, and artists holding court and animating a crowd that ballooned to hundreds. Event co-organizer and Women’s March co-chair Tamika Mallory offered a particularly impassioned plea that drew thunderous applause.“If the NFL can’t stand up for your children,” she said, “turn the damn game off.”It was this theme, one of ultimatum and righteous detachment from a sport held dear, that carried the evening. Amid the crowd was a smattering of Kaepernick jerseys, a rather relatable contradiction: at once, supporting an allegedly discriminatory league and the very player disrupting it. But undeniably, of concern to the league and its stakeholders are sentiments like those of Kathleen Lowy, who suggested she “won’t watch the NFL if they continue to boycott [Kaepernick]. And I won’t buy any products that sponsor the NFL.”Two feet away, a woman by the name of Goldie — with an “America was NEVER great” sign in hand — suggested Kaepernick’s activism should promote further action from players and fans alike. “The bottom line is, I wanna be on the right side of history,” Goldie said. She would later continue, “It shouldn’t even be a thing where they’re just taking a knee; that’s not enough.”That proclamation — that the convergence of activism and sport need seek new, more impactful action — would later be realized, with rally organizers calling for the divestment of Verizon, a prime NFL sponsor, from the league. (Verizon owns Oath, HuffPost’s parent company.)It is wholly possible Colin Kaepernick will never see an NFL field again. The same, however, may be said of those who support the quarterback from their couches every Sunday, and that concern about potential financial loss in the league is, undoubtedly, now the primary focus of those who believe Kaepernick’s cause to be a righteous one.

Exxon Mobil called the Harvard study findings “inaccurate."" ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599e98f61900003900dd5227.jpeg?cache=dpNcXpcFES&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Exxon Mobil Corp. deliberately deceived the public about the dangers of climate change for four decades, a new Harvard University study finds.For the peer-reviewed study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters Wednesday, two Harvard researchers analyzed nearly 200 documents related to Exxon Mobil’s climate change communications. The researchers found that America’s largest oil producer had repeatedly made “explicit factual misrepresentations” about global warming in advertisements aimed at the general public, while simultaneously acknowledging its risks behind closed doors. “Our findings are clear: Exxon Mobil misled the public about the state of climate science and its implications,” study authors Naomi Oreskes and Geoffrey Supran wrote in a New York Times op-ed this week. “Available documents show a systematic, quantifiable discrepancy between what Exxon Mobil’s scientists and executives discussed about climate change in private and in academic circles, and what it presented to the general public.”The discrepancy, the researchers said, was staggering. About 80 percent of Exxon Mobil’s research and internal memos acknowledged that climate change was real and caused by humans. However, 80 percent of the company’s newspaper ads regarding climate change questioned this fact, the study found.An internal Exxon Mobil memo penned in 1979, for instance, acknowledged a possible link between fossil fuel combustion and an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Another memo from 1982 described “potentially catastrophic events” that could arise from climate change, such as the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet.A peer-reviewed study conducted by Exxon Mobil scientists in the 1990s concluded “the body of evidence ... now points towards a discernible human influence on global climate.” Another one from 2002 found that limiting atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could be needed to “forestall coral reef bleaching, thermohaline circulation shutdown, and sea level rise.”But in 1997, the same year that the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, Exxon Mobil released an ad that called the science of climate change “too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” A 2000 Exxon Mobil advertorial in The New York Times described climate change as an “unsettled science.”The oil giant has previously defended itself by saying that it has never “suppressed climate change research.” But Oreskes and Supran said in their study that “the question is not whether Exxon Mobil ‘suppressed climate change research,’ but rather how they communicated about it.”Exxon Mobil’s peer-reviewed studies about climate change weren’t widely distributed or readily available to the general public, while their ads were meant to reach millions, the researchers noted.The company had “really good scientists,” Oreskes, a history of science professor, told the Times. “That finding then makes the contrast with the advertorials that much more notable.”The study comes as Exxon Mobil faces several lawsuits and investigations related to its transparency, or lack thereof, regarding climate science.Reacting to the Harvard study, Exxon Mobil called the research “inaccurate and preposterous.” “Our statements have been consistent with our understanding of climate science,” said spokesman Scott Silvestri in a statement, according to Agence France-Presse news agency.Silvestri added that the researchers had “cherry-picked” data to “attack” Exxon Mobil’s reputation. Speaking to the Times, he highlighted two Exxon Mobil ads that had suggested that climate change “may pose” long-term risks.The scientists, however, rejected Silvestri’s claim. Supran told AFP that they’d “looked at the whole cherry tree” in their research, including the ads that the spokesman had mentioned.While Exxon Mobil did publish some ads that suggested potential risks associated with global warming, the “predominant stance taken [in the company’s climate change] advertorials is ‘Doubt,’” said the study, which was funded by the Rockefeller Family Fund. Following the publication of the Harvard paper on Wednesday and the related op-ed, the hashtag #ExxonKnew began appearing on social media. The hashtag first gained popularity in 2015 after InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times published reports alleging that the oil had purposefully covered up what it knew about climate change.Since then, numerous investigations at the state and federal level have been launched and lawsuits have been filed related to whether Exxon Mobil deceived the public or its investors about the risks posed by climate change, both to the environment and to its business. Last month, three communities in California sued 37 oil, gas and coal companies including Exxon Mobil, Shell and Chevron for their alleged contributions to sea level rise and for concealing the hazards posed by global warming.The companies “have known for nearly a half century that unrestricted production and use of their fossil fuel products create greenhouse gas pollution that warms the planet and changes our climate,” the complaint reads. ″They have nevertheless engaged in a coordinated, multi-front effort to conceal and deny their own knowledge of those threats, discredit the growing body of publicly available scientific evidence, and persistently create doubt in the minds of customers, consumers, regulators, the media, journalists, teachers, and the public about the reality and consequences of the impacts of their fossil fuel pollution.” "
