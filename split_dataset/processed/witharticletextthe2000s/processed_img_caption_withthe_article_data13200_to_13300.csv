Prince Harry’s father announced Monday that the 33-year-old British royal and the 36-year-old American actress, who had been dating since 2016, got engaged earlier this month.Obama’s sweet tweet to the happy couple immediately took off, with Twitter users asking him to “come back” and exclamations of “we miss you!” but also with many saying they couldn’t wait to see the stylish Obamas “pull up to this wedding.”Prince Harry and the ex-president have been seen out together since Obama left the White House and they seem pretty chummy, so we’re sincerely hoping that an invite for the former POTUS and FLOTUS ends up in the mail.Some Twitter users even wondered whether Michelle Obama was the friend who introduced the prince to Markle.The newly engaged couple revealed in a BBC interview that they were introduced by a mutual friend, but declined to reveal who that mysterious friend was. Perhaps we’ll find out in the future. In the interim, we can only cross our fingers for a Barack-Michelle/Harry-Meghan double date night."

Sederer, MDThree Billboards at first seems like a film about solving a mystery. But it is not. It is more about the mystery of people: how pain, circumstance and the interplay with others can transform the most hardened and lost.The film opens with a driver’s view of three old roadside Billboards. They sequentially disclose the ineptitude of a local police chief who after seven months still has no clue as to who raped and killed a teenage girl outside of rural Ebbing, Missouri. Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand, hopefully an Oscar nominee for the role) has lost her daughter and cannot abide not only with her horrific tragedy but also failed justice, after an ocean of time, grief and guilt.She determines to bring the unsolved mystery into the center of attention, to shine the Billboard lights onto the heinous crime and its now state of inattention. She goes on local TV standing before the Billboards and launches the story that follows.We soon meet Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), who explains the trail has gone cold. Even the DNA traces provide no match on national databases. When Mildred learns that Willoughby, married with two young daughters and an apparent true public servant, is dying of cancer she tells him that he better get working since he won’t find the perpetrator after he is dead. The deadpan delivery of this and many other lines of dialogue is as sharp as the agony of those assembled.Willoughby is vomiting blood and knows he has not long on this earth, a time that will surely be filled with watching his family grieve him while he is still alive. One of his men, Dixon (Sam Rockwell, in a superbly rendered supporting role), is a truly repellent, white racist, sadistic, mama’s boy; his mother (Sandy Martin) passes her time on the porch drinking, smoking and stoking her son up. Mildred’s ex-husband Charlie (John Hawkes) is a wife-beater dating a girl barely legal. Family dysfunction abounds. The only peace to be found is in the fields surrounding the Billboards, not in any human abode. Not exactly a cavalcade of heroes, rather mere humans just like us.Yet we root for Mildred, even when she is awful to her son (Lucas Hedges) and others who cross her bleak path. McDormand never cracks a smile, except in irony until near to the end. And we gain hope for other characters in this fine ensemble whose nuanced transformation is portrayed before our eyes.Through the often-inexplicable way that grace can come to the bitter, defeated or cruel, we are taken through a set of unexpected plot twists and turns, painful or funny or both, as we witness ugly character-caterpillars become not quite butterflies but maybe moths.There is no happy ending, or Detective Poirot solving a complex case in Three Billboards. But there is a deeply moving, if dark and searing, tale of how life can hurt and heal, how redemption can come in strange and - in the end - beautiful ways.…………….Dr. Lloyd Sederer is a psychiatrist and public health doctor.

2,POLITICS,A Star Psychiatrist Swerves From Nuclear Armageddon To Climate Change,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robert-lifton-climate_us_5a186457e4b0649480742c6b,Robert Jay Lifton studied Nazi doctors and the threat of nuclear annihilation. But global warming changed everything.,2017-11-26,Robert Jay Lifton jots down notes in the office of his Upper West Side apartment on a sunny October morning. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a18654a1400004b4b50f211.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Robert Jay Lifton has spent his life trying to understand some of the most unfathomable milestones of the 20th century. The famed psychiatrist and author started his career in the mid-1950s studying Chinese government-sponsored brainwashing, or “thought reform.” In the ’60s, he began interviewing survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan, becoming obsessed with how the human mind copes with the possibility of nuclear annihilation. By the late ’70s, he turned his focus to the doctors responsible for the Nazi regime’s human experiments, men who occupy a uniquely revolting niche in popular culture. At 91 years old, he has arrived at his most daunting subject yet: climate change. In his latest book, The Climate Swerve, Lifton examines humanity’s struggle to understand what’s happening, how to deal with it, and why powerful people and institutions sabotage attempts to avoid destruction of the planet. “The climate threat is the most all-encompassing threat that we human beings face,” Lifton said in an interview last month. He walks hunched with a cane now, but sports a mop of long, wavy white hair. He peered through dark, thick-rimmed glasses out the window of a book-stacked office in his modest Upper West Side apartment, located just blocks from Trump Tower. “The nuclear threat is parallel to it in many ways … but the climate threat includes everything.”In other parts of the world, little doubt exists over the similarities between nuclear weapons and climate change, which Lifton calls the “apocalyptic twins.” The Marshall Islands served as a U.S. testing site for atomic weapons throughout the 20th century. The Pacific archipelago nation bears the scars of that experience today, with entire islands vaporized in hydrogen bomb blasts and high rates of cancer linked to radioactive contamination. Now the country struggles with rapidly rising sea levels, which swallow large habitable areas, make storms more destructive, and salinate freshwater supplies necessary to farm breadfruit, a staple crop.The phrase “climate swerve” gives name to the increasingly ubiquitous sense of awareness that global warming is happening, and humans have something to do with it. The term comes from the Roman poet Lucretius, who wrote a poem identifying the “swerve” as the chaotic, unpredictable movement of atoms that powers the creation and destruction of all things in the universe. Renaissance scholar Stephen Greenblatt titled his Pulitzer Prize-winning 2011 book on the rediscovery of Lucretius’ manuscript by a 15th-century papal emissary sparking the age of modern thought The Swerve.“I consider the climate swerve a movement toward the recognition of climate danger and what I call species awareness ― awareness of ourselves as a single species in deep trouble,” Lifton said. “The swerve is toward that recognition, that consciousness.”Despite many Republican Party leaders rejecting climate science outright, few so-called skeptics today deny that change is afoot. Rather, after years of dismissing scientists’ warnings, many ― including fossil fuel billionaire Charles Koch, a chief bankroller of the denial movement ― now acknowledge the climate is changing, but cast doubt over whether, or how big, a role humans play in the process. Years-long droughts, sea-swallowed coastal communities, and a millennium’s worth of violent storms and floods making landfall back to back have offered tangible evidence to bolster the popular consensus. In the United States, 71 percent of Americans agree that most scientists believe global warming is occurring, and 68 percent believe humans are the cause, according to a Gallup poll released in March. Forty-one percentsaid they now worried “a great deal” about global warming, a three-decade high. HuffPost sat down with Lifton recently to talk about global warming, his new book, and the state of climate change denial in the era of President Donald Trump. The following interview was edited and condensed: When did the “climate swerve” reach critical mass? It’s hard to give a definite date to when the climate swerve came into significant force but I would say in the last decade or so, there have been strong indications of the climate swerve. You can find them in studies that were done of people’s awareness of climate change. Not only of awareness of storms and climate threat, but awareness that it’s human-caused. This has increased in recent years, as has the coverage by the press and the general social knowledge. Before that, there were significant moments as when [former NASA scientist] James Hansen testified before a congressional committee in 1988. It was a significant moment in making known climate threat and its danger. Over the past decade, there’s been a shift in news coverage and how we talk about climate change, to less of a “he said-she said” between deniers and scientists and more rooted in actual fact and our actual understanding of climate change. How have climate change deniers reacted? In general, I see a shift from what I call fragmentary to formed awareness. What I mean by that is for some time we’ve had fragmentary images of ice melting in the Arctic or hurricanes or floods. But there may be just an image that’s brief and disappears. Increasingly over the last decade or more there have been formed ideas, a full narrative, the idea that there’s something called “climate threat” and it has to do with carbon emissions and that certain steps are necessary to mitigate the threat. This a full narrative, it’s formed, and people are now absorbing it in that formed awareness as opposed to the more fragmentary kind. Of course, in the past, as you implied, there used to be a ridiculous kind of equal time, those who confront climate change say this, deniers say that, and we have to listen to both. There’s been a greater recognition that deniers or rejecters are giving false information according to everything we know and all of the evidence leads to climate change danger. That increasing recognition is crucial to our possibilities for a wiser future.But how has the tone or arguments of what the deniers or rejectors said changed, if at all? How has that movement changed in reaction to the climate swerve hitting critical mass? There used to be full and absolute denial, and the insistence on the part of various people that the whole idea of climate change is a hoax and even a conspiracy on the part of scientists to get more research grants or for their own benefits in some way. You don’t hear that so much anymore. What you begin to hear is, ‘Oh we don’t know. Some scientist say this, some scientists say that, I’m not a scientist.’ Even that seems to be diminishing. These recent hurricanes that we had which are severe as any on record and unique in sequence of at least four major ones in rapid fire, they’ve created a kind of world-ending image close to what we get with nuclear weapons. It becomes more and more difficult to say there’s no such thing as climate change. It’s true that the scientists tell us that climate change doesn’t necessarily cause these hurricanes, but it turns severe storms into catastrophic ones. This becomes known so that the whole idea that denying or leaving in limbo any ideas about climate change becomes more and more difficult and those who express resistance to climate change are more and more on the defensive. Do you see the U.S. as unique in how mainstream the climate rejection has been? Do you see the Republican Party in particular as unique in how aggressive its stances have been on this issue? Of course there’s climate rejection and denial all over the world. The U.S. seems to be unique in that a major party which now holds power in most areas is committed to rejecting a fundamental truth that endangers human civilization. That’s uniqueness, especially in terms of America’s power in the world and the extent of American culpability in endangering the planet with carbon emissions over the years. The Republican Party finds itself in the position of controlling the country in most ways and yet endangering our future and the human future in this rejection of climate change. In that way, and in many others, one can say that Republican leaders and Trump in particular may be the most dangerous men in the world. What about the climate rejection movement has allowed it to become so entrenched in those partisan politics and in the conservative movement overall? It’s hard to know exactly how resistance to climate truths has become so entrenched in American political life and especially on the part of the right and the Republicans. But it has to relate to a long-standing American distrust of government, of social policy involving government, the kind of which is very necessary in relation to climate change. [There is] a whole nativist and know-nothing tradition in American history which has stood for anti-government and anti-governance, and above all any kind of internationalism.Who are the villains of this narrative, if it can be defined that way? There are many villains. Before Trump, the Republican Party had had a pretty consistent climate rejection position. Trump embraced that position, carried it to greater extremity in his cabinet appointments, more than was expected, and then you have the philanthropists like the Koch brothers and others who finance it. It’s particularly egregious to observe the hypocrisy of those who know quite a bit about the existence of climate change but fail to change their position for reasons of political convenience. There are many such people among Republicans who will face a very stern judgment indeed from history and will have been responsible for the suffering and death of very large numbers of people. There are lots of villains. I would add to that such climate villains are helped by a general tendency in human thought to resist the idea that nature can turn on us. There is strongly the idea that nature will protect us, nature represents growth. That sense, often a vague one, can contribute to elements of resistance to the idea that the climate can change in ways that are threatening to us.At the root of all this, don’t you see a certain indictment of capitalism in general?There are many forces in capitalism that contribute to resistance to climate truths. We’ve seen in it in the major corporations. But it goes beyond capitalism per se, in my view. You get versions of socialism and capitalism in China, or different forms of government in Russia or in Europe, but all of them contribute to climate damage. So capitalism and the way it functions has to be looked at critically, especially high capitalism and extreme capitalism. There are those, for instance like [former New York City] Mayor [Michael] Bloomberg, who’d do their best to save capitalism by rendering it more wise in relation to climate change. It’s a problem that goes beyond capitalism, but versions of extreme capitalism which are focused on fiduciary principles, you protect your investors and therefore you must take the fossil fuels out of the ground, even though if we took them all out of the ground it would do us in and threaten the whole human future, that kind of extreme capitalism is deeply dangerous. … If we were to carry on now simply as we are, in these mixtures of capitalist greed and failure to act and the enormous, exaggerated exploitation of fossil fuels, if we were to carry on and change nothing over a period of decades, within the century we would do ourselves in. We don’t have to do anything to change, just do what we were doing. I call this the ultimate absurdity.With nuclear weapons, you’ve got to build the weapons. You got to actually use them in a nuclear war, maybe create nuclear winter which could result in death of all people on planet, but you have to bring in these objects and set them off. You don’t have to do anything like that with climate. Just do as we’ve been doing. This gets a bit into the concept of “malignant normality,” as you laid out in the book. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that. I came upon the idea of malignant normality in studying Nazi doctors. If a Nazi doctor was assigned to Auschwitz, it was normal, it was expected of him that he would do the selections of Jews for the gas chamber. Take a leading role in the killing process in a reversal of healing. With climate change and nuclear weapons, there is also a malignant normality. With nuclear weapons, it’s that the weapons should be stockpiled, maybe even used if necessary because that’s the way you carry through deterrence. Deterrence always carries a willingness to use them in certain conditions. So therefore we should be ready with our duck-and-cover drills to carry out a nuclear war, survive it, win it and carry on with life. These are absurdities that became part of nuclear normality. With climate, climate normality was in the everyday practice. We were born into climate normality. This is the world which we entered and in which we live now and which continues. If we allow it to continue as it is now, it will result in the end of human civilization within the present century. I came to the idea of malignant normality that has to be exposed for its malignancy. Intellectuals and professionals have a particular role, what I call witnessing professionals, bear witness to the malignancy, the danger, of what’s being put forward to us as normal and as the only way to behave. That’s happening more but we need a lot of additional expression of resistance on the part of intellectuals in protest and activism. Bearing active witness against malignant normality in climate, nuclear threat or anything else, requires protest and activism. I believe in the combination of scholarship and activism and have tried to live by that in my own work. Where do you see the climate swerve at the end of this administration? I’m hopeful enough to believe that the climate swerve will far outlive this administration. The climate swerve is something that takes on a much longer life. It’s only taking shape now and beginning. It’s a larger wave of feeling and belief and consciousness and awareness that will last for generations. Each generation will need to estimate, examine climate danger and the embrace of a version of the climate swerve that does the maximum amount to combat that danger. I see the climate swerve as lasting for a very long time with ebbs and flows and problems, but not being ended in any sense within the foreseeable future. In that sense, that’s not a form of wild optimism but that is an expression of some hope in relation to the human future and our struggle with climate."

But global warming changed everything.,2017-11-26,President Donald Trump posing with a hard hat in coal country during the 2016 presidential campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1866ef140000030eb69ad0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Robert Jay Lifton has spent his life trying to understand some of the most unfathomable milestones of the 20th century. The famed psychiatrist and author started his career in the mid-1950s studying Chinese government-sponsored brainwashing, or “thought reform.” In the ’60s, he began interviewing survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan, becoming obsessed with how the human mind copes with the possibility of nuclear annihilation. By the late ’70s, he turned his focus to the doctors responsible for the Nazi regime’s human experiments, men who occupy a uniquely revolting niche in popular culture. At 91 years old, he has arrived at his most daunting subject yet: climate change. In his latest book, The Climate Swerve, Lifton examines humanity’s struggle to understand what’s happening, how to deal with it, and why powerful people and institutions sabotage attempts to avoid destruction of the planet. “The climate threat is the most all-encompassing threat that we human beings face,” Lifton said in an interview last month. He walks hunched with a cane now, but sports a mop of long, wavy white hair. He peered through dark, thick-rimmed glasses out the window of a book-stacked office in his modest Upper West Side apartment, located just blocks from Trump Tower. “The nuclear threat is parallel to it in many ways … but the climate threat includes everything.”In other parts of the world, little doubt exists over the similarities between nuclear weapons and climate change, which Lifton calls the “apocalyptic twins.” The Marshall Islands served as a U.S. testing site for atomic weapons throughout the 20th century. The Pacific archipelago nation bears the scars of that experience today, with entire islands vaporized in hydrogen bomb blasts and high rates of cancer linked to radioactive contamination. Now the country struggles with rapidly rising sea levels, which swallow large habitable areas, make storms more destructive, and salinate freshwater supplies necessary to farm breadfruit, a staple crop.The phrase “climate swerve” gives name to the increasingly ubiquitous sense of awareness that global warming is happening, and humans have something to do with it. The term comes from the Roman poet Lucretius, who wrote a poem identifying the “swerve” as the chaotic, unpredictable movement of atoms that powers the creation and destruction of all things in the universe. Renaissance scholar Stephen Greenblatt titled his Pulitzer Prize-winning 2011 book on the rediscovery of Lucretius’ manuscript by a 15th-century papal emissary sparking the age of modern thought The Swerve.“I consider the climate swerve a movement toward the recognition of climate danger and what I call species awareness ― awareness of ourselves as a single species in deep trouble,” Lifton said. “The swerve is toward that recognition, that consciousness.”Despite many Republican Party leaders rejecting climate science outright, few so-called skeptics today deny that change is afoot. Rather, after years of dismissing scientists’ warnings, many ― including fossil fuel billionaire Charles Koch, a chief bankroller of the denial movement ― now acknowledge the climate is changing, but cast doubt over whether, or how big, a role humans play in the process. Years-long droughts, sea-swallowed coastal communities, and a millennium’s worth of violent storms and floods making landfall back to back have offered tangible evidence to bolster the popular consensus. In the United States, 71 percent of Americans agree that most scientists believe global warming is occurring, and 68 percent believe humans are the cause, according to a Gallup poll released in March. Forty-one percentsaid they now worried “a great deal” about global warming, a three-decade high. HuffPost sat down with Lifton recently to talk about global warming, his new book, and the state of climate change denial in the era of President Donald Trump. The following interview was edited and condensed: When did the “climate swerve” reach critical mass? It’s hard to give a definite date to when the climate swerve came into significant force but I would say in the last decade or so, there have been strong indications of the climate swerve. You can find them in studies that were done of people’s awareness of climate change. Not only of awareness of storms and climate threat, but awareness that it’s human-caused. This has increased in recent years, as has the coverage by the press and the general social knowledge. Before that, there were significant moments as when [former NASA scientist] James Hansen testified before a congressional committee in 1988. It was a significant moment in making known climate threat and its danger. Over the past decade, there’s been a shift in news coverage and how we talk about climate change, to less of a “he said-she said” between deniers and scientists and more rooted in actual fact and our actual understanding of climate change. How have climate change deniers reacted? In general, I see a shift from what I call fragmentary to formed awareness. What I mean by that is for some time we’ve had fragmentary images of ice melting in the Arctic or hurricanes or floods. But there may be just an image that’s brief and disappears. Increasingly over the last decade or more there have been formed ideas, a full narrative, the idea that there’s something called “climate threat” and it has to do with carbon emissions and that certain steps are necessary to mitigate the threat. This a full narrative, it’s formed, and people are now absorbing it in that formed awareness as opposed to the more fragmentary kind. Of course, in the past, as you implied, there used to be a ridiculous kind of equal time, those who confront climate change say this, deniers say that, and we have to listen to both. There’s been a greater recognition that deniers or rejecters are giving false information according to everything we know and all of the evidence leads to climate change danger. That increasing recognition is crucial to our possibilities for a wiser future.But how has the tone or arguments of what the deniers or rejectors said changed, if at all? How has that movement changed in reaction to the climate swerve hitting critical mass? There used to be full and absolute denial, and the insistence on the part of various people that the whole idea of climate change is a hoax and even a conspiracy on the part of scientists to get more research grants or for their own benefits in some way. You don’t hear that so much anymore. What you begin to hear is, ‘Oh we don’t know. Some scientist say this, some scientists say that, I’m not a scientist.’ Even that seems to be diminishing. These recent hurricanes that we had which are severe as any on record and unique in sequence of at least four major ones in rapid fire, they’ve created a kind of world-ending image close to what we get with nuclear weapons. It becomes more and more difficult to say there’s no such thing as climate change. It’s true that the scientists tell us that climate change doesn’t necessarily cause these hurricanes, but it turns severe storms into catastrophic ones. This becomes known so that the whole idea that denying or leaving in limbo any ideas about climate change becomes more and more difficult and those who express resistance to climate change are more and more on the defensive. Do you see the U.S. as unique in how mainstream the climate rejection has been? Do you see the Republican Party in particular as unique in how aggressive its stances have been on this issue? Of course there’s climate rejection and denial all over the world. The U.S. seems to be unique in that a major party which now holds power in most areas is committed to rejecting a fundamental truth that endangers human civilization. That’s uniqueness, especially in terms of America’s power in the world and the extent of American culpability in endangering the planet with carbon emissions over the years. The Republican Party finds itself in the position of controlling the country in most ways and yet endangering our future and the human future in this rejection of climate change. In that way, and in many others, one can say that Republican leaders and Trump in particular may be the most dangerous men in the world. What about the climate rejection movement has allowed it to become so entrenched in those partisan politics and in the conservative movement overall? It’s hard to know exactly how resistance to climate truths has become so entrenched in American political life and especially on the part of the right and the Republicans. But it has to relate to a long-standing American distrust of government, of social policy involving government, the kind of which is very necessary in relation to climate change. [There is] a whole nativist and know-nothing tradition in American history which has stood for anti-government and anti-governance, and above all any kind of internationalism.Who are the villains of this narrative, if it can be defined that way? There are many villains. Before Trump, the Republican Party had had a pretty consistent climate rejection position. Trump embraced that position, carried it to greater extremity in his cabinet appointments, more than was expected, and then you have the philanthropists like the Koch brothers and others who finance it. It’s particularly egregious to observe the hypocrisy of those who know quite a bit about the existence of climate change but fail to change their position for reasons of political convenience. There are many such people among Republicans who will face a very stern judgment indeed from history and will have been responsible for the suffering and death of very large numbers of people. There are lots of villains. I would add to that such climate villains are helped by a general tendency in human thought to resist the idea that nature can turn on us. There is strongly the idea that nature will protect us, nature represents growth. That sense, often a vague one, can contribute to elements of resistance to the idea that the climate can change in ways that are threatening to us.At the root of all this, don’t you see a certain indictment of capitalism in general?There are many forces in capitalism that contribute to resistance to climate truths. We’ve seen in it in the major corporations. But it goes beyond capitalism per se, in my view. You get versions of socialism and capitalism in China, or different forms of government in Russia or in Europe, but all of them contribute to climate damage. So capitalism and the way it functions has to be looked at critically, especially high capitalism and extreme capitalism. There are those, for instance like [former New York City] Mayor [Michael] Bloomberg, who’d do their best to save capitalism by rendering it more wise in relation to climate change. It’s a problem that goes beyond capitalism, but versions of extreme capitalism which are focused on fiduciary principles, you protect your investors and therefore you must take the fossil fuels out of the ground, even though if we took them all out of the ground it would do us in and threaten the whole human future, that kind of extreme capitalism is deeply dangerous. … If we were to carry on now simply as we are, in these mixtures of capitalist greed and failure to act and the enormous, exaggerated exploitation of fossil fuels, if we were to carry on and change nothing over a period of decades, within the century we would do ourselves in. We don’t have to do anything to change, just do what we were doing. I call this the ultimate absurdity.With nuclear weapons, you’ve got to build the weapons. You got to actually use them in a nuclear war, maybe create nuclear winter which could result in death of all people on planet, but you have to bring in these objects and set them off. You don’t have to do anything like that with climate. Just do as we’ve been doing. This gets a bit into the concept of “malignant normality,” as you laid out in the book. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that. I came upon the idea of malignant normality in studying Nazi doctors. If a Nazi doctor was assigned to Auschwitz, it was normal, it was expected of him that he would do the selections of Jews for the gas chamber. Take a leading role in the killing process in a reversal of healing. With climate change and nuclear weapons, there is also a malignant normality. With nuclear weapons, it’s that the weapons should be stockpiled, maybe even used if necessary because that’s the way you carry through deterrence. Deterrence always carries a willingness to use them in certain conditions. So therefore we should be ready with our duck-and-cover drills to carry out a nuclear war, survive it, win it and carry on with life. These are absurdities that became part of nuclear normality. With climate, climate normality was in the everyday practice. We were born into climate normality. This is the world which we entered and in which we live now and which continues. If we allow it to continue as it is now, it will result in the end of human civilization within the present century. I came to the idea of malignant normality that has to be exposed for its malignancy. Intellectuals and professionals have a particular role, what I call witnessing professionals, bear witness to the malignancy, the danger, of what’s being put forward to us as normal and as the only way to behave. That’s happening more but we need a lot of additional expression of resistance on the part of intellectuals in protest and activism. Bearing active witness against malignant normality in climate, nuclear threat or anything else, requires protest and activism. I believe in the combination of scholarship and activism and have tried to live by that in my own work. Where do you see the climate swerve at the end of this administration? I’m hopeful enough to believe that the climate swerve will far outlive this administration. The climate swerve is something that takes on a much longer life. It’s only taking shape now and beginning. It’s a larger wave of feeling and belief and consciousness and awareness that will last for generations. Each generation will need to estimate, examine climate danger and the embrace of a version of the climate swerve that does the maximum amount to combat that danger. I see the climate swerve as lasting for a very long time with ebbs and flows and problems, but not being ended in any sense within the foreseeable future. In that sense, that’s not a form of wild optimism but that is an expression of some hope in relation to the human future and our struggle with climate."

By the time the shooting stopped, many of the village’s men were lifeless.No group has claimed responsibility.ATTACK RATTLES EGYPTIANSEgyptians were stunned because the attack was directed at a mosque - a rarity in the country’s history of Islamist insurgencies.The possibility that ultra-hardline Islamists are shifting tactics and picking new targets is worrying for Egypt, where governments have struggled to contain groups far less brazen than Islamic State.Egyptian leaders have adopted a zero-tolerance policy, with air strikes, raids on militant hideouts and long prison sentences.President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has once again threatened to crush the militants.“The armed forces and the police will avenge our martyrs and restore security and stability with the utmost force in the coming period,” he said after Friday’s carnage.Sisi has called for a comprehensive campaign to counter what he describes as the existential threat of radical jihadism, deploying moderate clerics to promote moderate Islam, for instance.He is expected to run for a second term early next year. Even with a convincing win, he will face pressure to deliver on promises of stability, especially if attacks like that on Al Rawdah persist.For Islamic State, the village was a target because of its ties to Sufism, a mystical form of Islam that hardline Islamist groups consider heretical.Some villagers recalled how these threats were made about a year ago in an Islamic State internet publication.In a December 2016 issue of al-Nabaa, one of the group’s religious leaders left little doubt that Sufis would be targeted. It mentioned Al Rawdah directly.“Our primary focus lies in the war against polytheism and apostasy, and of those, Sufism, sorcery and divination,” he said. More threats were made in early 2017.SUFIS CONDEMNED FOR BELIEFSIn March, Islamic State’s branch in the Sinai posted a video of its religious police forcing a group of Sufis to renounce their beliefs under threat of death.It showed what it said were militants beheading two elderly Sufi men in the desert after they were found guilty of witchcraft and sorcery.Egypt has about 15 million Sufis, and their shrines and saints appear in villages across the country.Ultra-conservative Salafists abhor Sufi practices and some have in the past threatened to smash their symbols with hammers and iron bars.Five police and army sources said there was no recent specific threat against Sufis in Al Rawdah.Friday’s attack began in the early afternoon.The mosque’s imam said he had just stepped onto the podium for his sermon when gunfire erupted and worshippers struggled to escape.“I found people piled on top of each other and they kept firing at anyone,” imam Mohamed Abdel Fattah told Reuters from his hospital bed in Sharqiya city. “They fired at anyone who breathed.”Ramadan Salama, 26, said all he remembers before ending up in hospital was gunmen entering the mosque during the sermon and spraying worshippers with gunfire.As Egyptian security forces try to reassure an anxious public, they face yet another dangerous enemy.A new group with military training is already posing a more complex threat. In October it mounted a sophisticated attack, not far from Cairo.The little-known Ansar al-Islam claimed responsibility for the attack on police in the Western desert, far from northern Sinai. Security sources said dozens of police officers and conscripts were killed. The government said 16 police and conscripts died.Security sources said the heavy weapons and tactics employed indicated ties to Islamic State or more likely an al Qaeda brigade led by Hesham al-Ashmawy, a former Egyptian special forces officer turned jihadist.For now, security and intelligence officials will continue to hunt Ashmawy, described as the country’s most wanted man.Egypt’s prosecutor’s office, citing its investigation and interviews with wounded survivors, says gunmen carried an Islamic State flag as they stormed the Al Rawdah mosque.Authorities say 305 people, including 27 children, died as gunmen even attacked ambulances arriving on the scene. Another 128 were wounded.“They entered the mosque from outside, almost 10 to 20 people with weapons, and they destroyed everything,” said resident Magdy Rezk from hospital.It was a huge toll for a tiny village. Tribal leader Ibrahim el-Menaie, told Reuters via social media that it has a population of only 800.“The whole village is black with mourning,” said resident Haj Ahmed Swailam.

In a recent interview, the vocal actress called out everyone from Caitlyn Jenner to a RuPaul’s Drag Race star for transgressions against the transgender community.“How do you know that line of what’s offensive and what’s just playful or jokey?” the transgender Emmy nominee asked on Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl.“Really I think it comes down to this one key factor, which is ‘relationship,’” she told the podcast. “Do you have the relationship to come up to me and be like ‘Hey, bitch!’?”Murphy’s upcoming series Pose launches on FX Network in 2018. For it, the American Horror Story mastermind has assembled the largest collection of transgender actors in network television history, including Ross as “Candy.”Days before the series was publicly announced, Ross joined Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast to promote current short film project Missed Connections. While discussing her role as “Jennifer,” a young woman opening up about her gender identity to a love interest she met at Burning Man, the actress explained how frequently — and easily — acceptable boundaries are crossed.“With my friends behind-the-scenes, I might be like, ‘Bitch!’ and yadda-yadda-yadda,” Ross admitted, then relayed the same level of intimate interaction is not acceptable for all. That is where many get in trouble, she surmised.“Somebody, just because they are black too or just because they are trans too or just because they’re gay and recognize I’m trans, does that mean you have the familiarity to use certain language?” she asked. “And I don’t mean with just me but with the community.”During the conversation, Ross gave Drag Race alum Willam as an example. In a YouTube video with fellow contestant Courtney Act, Ross said the reality TV favorite said “awful things” about trans men, discounting their masculinity. Many viewers — including some trans individuals, who she called particularly “problematic” — defended the recording artist. To Ross, the popular comic pushed well beyond what is appropriate, stating flatly: “Willam doesn’t have that relationship with the community.”“They’ve got that one-on-one relationship [with trans individuals] but then they get it twisted and go out into the masses and the mainstream and think it is cool to use that language there,” said the Wisconsin native.“You always have some trans girl saying, ‘Oh, they were just being funny! They aren’t really transphobic,’” she continued, “Just like you will always have some black folks defending some white person for using the ‘N’ word because they are ‘cool.”“That’s where you’ve got to learn it’s all about freedom of speech,” Ross asserted. “It doesn’t mean freedom of consequences.”During her career prior to being cast on Pose, Ross has appeared on acclaimed Transparent, earned an Emmy nod for trans-focused web series Her Story, is a voice actor on Amazon animated series Danger & Eggs and recurring character on TV comedy Claws. The long-time trans rights activist also appeared as one of several mentors to Caitlyn Jenner on reality series I Am Cait. During her extended Party Foul Radio interview, Ross held nothing back when talking about the former Keeping Up with the Kardashians star and her place in the trans movement.“Caitlyn Jenner-type advocacy is all about making it look like I’m doing something,” said Ross, “And we [the trans community] are frickin’ tired of that!” LISTEN: Angelica Ross Talks Caitlin Jenner, The “Extraction” of Trans CultureSuch choice words should surprise few. In 2015, after watching her episodic arc on I Am Cait, Ross directed a scathing HuffPost op-ed toward the retired Olympian. In it, she called to task the reality series and Jenner, specifically, as its Executive Producer. According to “Call Me Caitlyn. Sincerely, Miss Ross,” the show inaccurately portrayed an educational meeting between a collection of trans women of color and the former decathlete. Ross agreed to appear, the article said, to highlight her work as CEO of TransTech Social Enterprises. Rather than showcase the Chicago-based, nonprofit creative design firm she founded to train and employ transgender individuals, she was painted as a former sex worker. Though she would “be the first” to iron things out should Jenner reach out, Ross told podcast listeners she has yet to hear from the elder woman. That hasn’t stopped Jenner from continuing to position herself as a voice for the transgender community, Ross noted, while “white-washing” LGBTQ activism.“You continue to put those smiling faces upfront, and everybody continues to think everything is ok,” she said of the ongoing fight for trans visibility and rights. “The community is, ‘Oh, we’re doing fine.’ Well, no, no, no,” Ross pressed. “The girls in the margins are still homeless, are still dying of HIV, are still marginalized into sex work, are still not supported in sex work, if that is what they choose to do. It’s rampant.”Ross was quick to note her issues with Jenner aren’t a result of the latter’s right-leaning politics. What only a handful recognize, the outspoken actress said, is she is also a self-described “conservative” by many standards.“I actually run a nonprofit that’s all about giving people opportunities to be their own heroes and do their own work,” said Ross. “I’m not going to do it for them,” she detailed, “I’m not going to give you anything, but what I will do is create space and give you opportunities and access, so you can do something about your circumstances.”Where Ross takes particular aim is Jenner’s penchant for being vocal on matters where she is not well-educated. More so, she explicitly points to the reality TV star’s limited life experience as an openly trans individual. “The problem with the spectrum that is trans-ness and where people like Caitlyn Jenner lie,” Ross stressed, “Transitioning and being trans is more than a physical thing. Transition is a process.”According to Ross, many equate gender confirmation to the metamorphosis from a caterpillar to a butterfly. For Jenner, she said, finances allowed her to fast-forward the physical transition while other areas lagged considerably. “Imagine a caterpillar who had its process interrupted or has not been able to fully undergo that transition they undergo to become that beautiful butterfly,” she described. “We get so captivated in the after effects and what people look like in female transition photos,” Ross went on to say. For transgender individuals, that is only a fraction of the “process” — the majority of which is internal, the emotional, spiritual and mental changes which must accompany the physical transition. “How have you transitioned? What does your transition look like from day-to-day on the inside? How are you more authentic? How are you more you and more connected to the whole and to humanity?” she posed to listeners. “Caitlyn just had the money to buy the transition, but you can’t buy the process,” she said emphatically. “That’s what the problem is here.”Visit Angelica Ross’ Website.Follow Party Foul Radio on Twitter.LISTEN: Angelica Ross Lays Into Caitlyn Jenner on Party Foul Radio."

In it, she called to task the reality series and Jenner, specifically, as its Executive Producer. According to “Call Me Caitlyn. Sincerely, Miss Ross,” the show inaccurately portrayed an educational meeting between a collection of trans women of color and the former decathlete. Ross agreed to appear, the article said, to highlight her work as CEO of TransTech Social Enterprises. Rather than showcase the Chicago-based, nonprofit creative design firm she founded to train and employ transgender individuals, she was painted as a former sex worker. Though she would “be the first” to iron things out should Jenner reach out, Ross told podcast listeners she has yet to hear from the elder woman. That hasn’t stopped Jenner from continuing to position herself as a voice for the transgender community, Ross noted, while “white-washing” LGBTQ activism.“You continue to put those smiling faces upfront, and everybody continues to think everything is ok,” she said of the ongoing fight for trans visibility and rights. “The community is, ‘Oh, we’re doing fine.’ Well, no, no, no,” Ross pressed. “The girls in the margins are still homeless, are still dying of HIV, are still marginalized into sex work, are still not supported in sex work, if that is what they choose to do. It’s rampant.”Ross was quick to note her issues with Jenner aren’t a result of the latter’s right-leaning politics. What only a handful recognize, the outspoken actress said, is she is also a self-described “conservative” by many standards.“I actually run a nonprofit that’s all about giving people opportunities to be their own heroes and do their own work,” said Ross. “I’m not going to do it for them,” she detailed, “I’m not going to give you anything, but what I will do is create space and give you opportunities and access, so you can do something about your circumstances.”Where Ross takes particular aim is Jenner’s penchant for being vocal on matters where she is not well-educated. More so, she explicitly points to the reality TV star’s limited life experience as an openly trans individual. “The problem with the spectrum that is trans-ness and where people like Caitlyn Jenner lie,” Ross stressed, “Transitioning and being trans is more than a physical thing. Transition is a process.”According to Ross, many equate gender confirmation to the metamorphosis from a caterpillar to a butterfly. For Jenner, she said, finances allowed her to fast-forward the physical transition while other areas lagged considerably. “Imagine a caterpillar who had its process interrupted or has not been able to fully undergo that transition they undergo to become that beautiful butterfly,” she described. “We get so captivated in the after effects and what people look like in female transition photos,” Ross went on to say. For transgender individuals, that is only a fraction of the “process” — the majority of which is internal, the emotional, spiritual and mental changes which must accompany the physical transition. “How have you transitioned? What does your transition look like from day-to-day on the inside? How are you more authentic? How are you more you and more connected to the whole and to humanity?” she posed to listeners. “Caitlyn just had the money to buy the transition, but you can’t buy the process,” she said emphatically. “That’s what the problem is here.”Visit Angelica Ross’ Website.Follow Party Foul Radio on Twitter.LISTEN: Angelica Ross Lays Into Caitlyn Jenner on Party Foul Radio."

In a gut-wrenching letter to her local representative, Illinois Rep. Ryan Spain (R-Peoria), Anne M. (as she asked to be named) described the harrowing trauma her daughter Hannah suffered following the Las Vegas tragedy. Without stronger gun laws, Anne M. warned, tens of thousands of Americans are set to suffer the same fate. “As you are gathering with your family during these holidays, I ask that you remember us and all the other families who have suffered losses due to gun violence,” she pleaded. “Reflect on the power and responsibilities that your office entails and be prepared to act for positive change when the new legislative session begins.”“Anne M.” told HuffPost her story and that of “Hannah” on the condition of anonymity. She lives in a region of Illinois that she describes as anti-gun control and is fearful for her family’s safety following the shooting. Additionally, her daughter is employed by one of the companies involved with the music festival and was not authorized to speak publicly about the incident. We’ve identified them both by the pseudonyms they used in the letter to the state lawmaker.  Hannah had been preparing for the Route 91 Harvest Festival, a three-day country music fest that drew tens of thousands to the Las Vegas Strip, for days. On Oct. 1, she was working from a trailer near the stage when gunman Stephen Paddock unloaded hundreds of rounds into an unsuspecting crowd listening to Jason Aldean perform. At first, Hannah thought the popping sounds were the sound system experiencing problems. Then it dawned on her she was hearing rapid gunfire blasting overhead. Hannah barricaded the doors of her trailer, turned off the lights, computers and audio equipment. She huddled under the tables, fervently texting her colleagues to see if they were safe. Outside she heard crying and screaming as dozens lay dying. “I am safe. Many dead,” she texted her family from the trailer. Hannah stayed hidden in the trailer for about an hour, eventually making her way out of the venue with the help of law enforcement. She was later released and escorted to another hotel to rest. As morning broke in Las Vegas, she took a photo of the sunrise from her hotel room and texted her mother.“I never thought I’d live to see this day.”By the following afternoon, Hannah was on a plane back home. But once back in Illinois, she had trouble picking up her life.  “In many ways I feel like every bullet that didn’t physically hit me, because none of them did, all hit me mentally and emotionally,” she told HuffPost. “If you could do a fictitious scan of my head, it would look like Swiss cheese, because they all went through me on some level.”Profoundly haunted by the killings, Hannah would come home from work and collapse in her mother’s arms, recounting the details of the shooting, over and over again. She’d complain of chest pain and had trouble breathing. Being in public became stressful, and being near strangers frightened her. The sounds of dogs barking and children laughing were too much to bear. One evening shortly after the shooting, as fireworks popped off during the halftime show of a school football game nearby, Hannah burst into tears and became panicked ― she didn’t hear fireworks, she heard gunfire, and she was instantly pulled back to her trailer at the festival hearing instead the bullets flying. Anne had to pull Hannah into the bathroom and turn on the exhaust fan, to drown out the fireworks, and hold her daughter as tight as she could. Anne, a former therapist, recognized her “bright, happy, spunky girl” was suffering from severe trauma and found her a therapist who specialized in treating post-traumatic stress disorder.While most often discussed as a disorder that affects members of the military, any person who experiences trauma can suffer from PTSD. About 7 to 8 percent of Americans will experience PTSD at some point in their lifetimes, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ National Center for PTSD. In any given year, about 8 million adults have PTSD, and it is common among survivors of mass shootings: About a third of them will experience PTSD. Watching her daughter suffer the effects of the shooting made Anne keenly aware of the trauma that tens of thousands of Americans ― gun violence survivors and the members of their families ― go through. The only way to prevent the trauma is to stop the shootings, she argues. “We can no longer deny that mass shootings are a terrifying, nearly daily part of American culture,” Anne wrote in her impassioned letter to Spain. “We have allowed assault rifles to become weapons of mass destruction in our everyday lives.”“Our schools, hospitals, concert venues and churches are now all battlefields,” Anne wrote. There are no readily available answers for Anne, Hannah, their family and the thousands of others affected by this national tragedy. Nearly 3,000 people have been shot in the weeks that followed the Las Vegas massacre, according to data collected by the Gun Violence Archive. About 800 of those victims have died. Just two weeks ago, a gunman opened fire at a church in a small town in Texas, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others.Despite numerous high-profile massacres involving firearms in recent years, from Aurora to Sandy Hook to Orlando, Congress has not passed meaningful legislation that could prevent another mass shooting. And while lawmakers briefly voiced support for a restriction on bump stocks following the Las Vegas shooting, the devices that facilitate rapid firing are still legal. Any hope for a legislative fix was dashed when the National Rifle Association issued a statement urging the Trump administration to address the matter via existing regulations and not new laws. Gun rights activists consider gun laws in Illinois to be strict. Gun owners are banned from carrying handguns that are visible to the public, and those with concealed carry permits are banned from bringing their firearms into schools, public parks and government buildings. Still, bump stocks remain legal, and the semi-automatic firearms that Paddock used during his rampage are as well. The state’s legislature has adjourned for the year without passing any new gun control legislation.Anne is trying to change that. She’s starting locally, with her state representative. “Until and unless stronger gun laws with thorough background checks are in place, our country is not safe,” Anne told Spain. “Not for my Hannah. Not for [Spain’s daughter] Eleanor. Not for any of us.”Rep. Spain told HuffPost in an email that he received Anne’s letter and found it to be “heartfelt and impactful” and that it gave him an opportunity to take time before the state’s next legislative session to find common ground on gun laws. “Out of strong respect for what her family has been through, I am looking for opportunities to work together toward addressing the scourge of mass-shootings on our society and that is what I told [Anne M.]. She asked me to take time to think about this issue and I am doing so.”Hannah hopes that, at the very least, making her story public will remind the nation of what she and the thousands of other people ― numbers that are growing ― who have been been hurt by gun violence are living through and to keep remembering it. And in doing so, perhaps Americans will decide they’ve finally had enough and fight for safer gun laws.“Nobody should have to experience this. Whether you’re 7 years old at Sandy Hook or 55 years old at a country music festival, there’s real action we can take. Somebody’s right to a gun should not be more important than anyone’s piece of mind.”"

Though there haven’t been significant changes to her case’s basic details since her first trial in 2006, celebrities and advocates are turning a light on Brown’s story and sex trafficking with the viral social media campaign, #FreeCyntoiaBrown. After running away from home, Brown lived with her 24-year-old boyfriend who, she has said, abused her, raped her, threatened to kill her and forced her into a life of drug use and sex work. “He would explain to me that some people were born whores, and that I was one, and I was a slut, and nobody’d want me but him, and the best thing I could do was just learn to be a good whore,” Brown testified at a 2012 hearing that sought a new trial for her.In August 2004, Brown killed Johnny Mitchell Allen, 43, after he paid her for sex. Her lawyers at her first trial argued that Brown was a victim of sex trafficking and she acted in self-defense. According to defense version of what transpired, Allen took Brown to his house where he showed her a collection of firearms. When they were in bed, Allen grabbed her between her legs and reached for something that Brown believed to be a gun. Fearing for her life, Brown reached into her purse and shot Allen in the back of the head. Prosecutors, however, charged that Brown’s motive was robbery, given that she took money and two of his guns after she shot him. Brown, according to her lawyers, took the cash and firearms because she feared returning to her pimp empty-handed.She was tried as an adult and convicted of first-degree murder. Brown, who was diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome disorder in 2012, is currently being held at Tennessee Prison for Women in Nashville. She’ll be up for parole at age 69, The Tennessean reports.In 2011, Brown’s case gained some national attention after filmmaker Dan Birman’s documentary, “Me Facing Life: Cyntoia’s Story,” aired on PBS. “This is a young girl who’s at the tail end of three generations of violence against women,” Birman told Nashville’s Fox 17 earlier this month, referring to the rapes of Brown, her mother and her grandmother. “She had no chance.”Now, celebrities including Rihanna, LeBron James, Snoop Dogg, and Kim Kardashian West are advocating for Brown in an effort to win her clemency. “Did we somehow change the definition of #JUSTICE along the way??” Rihanna wrote on Instagram on Tuesday. “Something is horribly wrong when the system enables these rapists and the victim is thrown away for life! To each of you responsible for this child’s sentence I hope to God you don’t have children, because this could be your daughter being punished for punishing already!” Kardashian West has called on her own lawyers to help free Brown. “The system has failed,” she tweeted on Tuesday. “It’s heartbreaking to see a young girl sex trafficked then when she has the courage to fight back is jailed for life! We have to do better & do what’s right. I’ve called my attorneys yesterday to see what can be done to fix this. #FreeCyntoiaBrown”A petition was started to urge Governor Bill Haslam (R) to grant Brown clemency. As of Sunday afternoon, more than 379,000 people have signed it.Attorney Charles Bone, who began working for Brown pro bono after watching Birman’s film, told NBC that the young woman is “shocked and surprised” that celebrities are rallying behind her, and is “appreciative” of their support.“This is meaningful not to Cyntoia, but to the cause of sex trafficking and sex slavery and juvenile justice,” Bone said. He said that he and a team of lawyers are still fighting for another trial, in which Bone believes Brown would be “charged with second-degree murder at the most.”He said that the lesser charge “would put her in a situation now where she would be qualified to be considered for parole.”“She was sentenced as a child, and the fact that she was a sex slave and the pimp she was living with was trafficking her is worthy of not just celebrities but all of us,” Bone told BuzzFeed News. “To be aware of the gravity of what’s going on, not just in Tennessee but the entire world, needs a lot of attention and a lot support.”Since being locked up, Brown has been described as a model prisoner, according to The Tennessean. She received her G.E.D. and went on to receive an associates degree from Lipscomb University’s in-jail program in December. Kathy Sinback, Brown’s previous lawyer and continued advocate, told BuzzFeed News that Brown is working on a project about human trafficking for her bachelor’s degree program."

For the record, Trump was named Time’s “Person of the Year” in 2016 and has appeared on the magazine’s cover at least 14 times, which is nothing to sniff at.Most of his covers, however, show him in an unflattering light, with one issue labeling him as a bully, showman, party crasher and demagogue. Two separate issues depict his face dripping off the cover while having literal meltdowns, and another shows him sitting in the Oval Office with the declaration: “Nothing to see here.”There is one Time magazine cover that he appears rather fond of, despite it being 100 percent fake.That glowing 2009 cover, which celebrates him for supposedly “hitting on all fronts,” has been seen in a number of his golf courses, the Washington Post reported in June.“Reality can’t match Trump’s fantasy, which probably explains the knockoff’s place on his club’s walls,” Post media reporter Callum Borchers said."

When did they start charging?!” You might ask, indignantly, soon. Then you’ll look more carefully, and realize that it’s your cable/Internet provider that’s charging for this. Don’t worry, though! For $19.99/mo more, you get UNLIMITED access to all of your favorite content on the Web. For $29.99 more you can watch your new TV Apps from CBS, NBC, and ABC. HBO/Showtime? They’re extra on top of their own fees.While you were shopping for your Thanksgiving dinner, the turkeys at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) were quietly creating another pathway to profit for cable TV, satellite and Internet providers that already make prime dollar providing you access to the Worldwide Web.Under the laughable “Restoring Internet Freedom” heading, commissioners voted to strip the Obama administration’s Federal Communications Commission “Net Neutrality” rules that prevent these owners of the on-ramps to the Web from charging tariffs against specific sites or types of content.You already pay a hefty premium for generally poor data service from most Internet providers in North America. Cable providers get paid many times by you. You pay for the monthly service and the boxes that translate their signal to your TV. You also are hit with cable-specific advertising that is “cut in” to your regular programming and you pay a premium for certain services, such as HBO or Showtime.So why do Comcast, Time-Warner, Cox and other gatekeepers want more? Their bread-and-butter-biz, big premiums for you to watch television, is going away.Every flat screen sold now goes out the door bypasses that old-school setup with apps for your TV instead of channels. App-driven television is available from every flat-screen television manufacturer, and TVs can also access these apps through Apple TV 4K, Google Chromecast, Amazon’s Fire TV, Roku, and many many others.Currently the cable providers are hamstringing the owners of this content by making you own access to a cable company’s traditional hardware and packages to use many of these apps. The future is going away from them though.CBS now offers an “All-Access” for a monthly charge which opens up all of their shows for binge-watching stretching back to the I Love Lucy days of the dawn of television.Effectively cable operators are in the paid wire business. The delivery of the Internet. Net neutrality keeps them from inventing new ways to gouge you for service.These fees now can extend past your television. Want to shop on Ebay? Comcast could hit you with a $1.99/mo charge. Or buy the whole “Internet Shopping package” of approved sites for $11.99/mo.Of course, if you run a small business in Kentucky selling hams, and you can’t afford to pay a few hundred Internet gatekeepers the fees to be part of that access group, users trying to access your pages may wait minutes, or never see them at all, because there is no bandwidth for you if you don’t pay up.Water rights are an easy analogy. If towns on tributaries to the Mississippi began damming up creeks, and charging the cities downstream for the water, people living all along the river would be livid.In Germany, men grew rich by building castles in the Rhine and attacking ships that failed to pay for passage through their section of the river.Federal water rights laws remain unchallenged, and have worked for more than a century. Access to the Internet should be no different.Many countries offer the Internet free of charge. Net Neutrality was designed to keep the Internet a viable economically vibrant source of jobs and gross domestic product in the United States.

Tanner on Full House. Today, a whole new generation is falling in love with Bure on Fuller House, which is currently in its third season on Netflix. The success of Fuller House has paved the way for other beloved shows like Will & Grace and Roseanne to return to television. Unlike many other child stars, Bure has never faded away from the spotlight. Whether competing on Dancing with the Stars, co-hosting The View or being the darling of the Hallmark Channel, Bure’s smile and infectious outlook on life has become part of our lives.As a wife and mother of three, women look to Bure for inspiration. Her books about living confidently and with courage and faith have become best sellers. Bure’s latest book, Staying Stylish: Cultivating a Confident Look, Style, and Attitude, is a guide for looking and feeling your best. As Bure writes, ""The absolute best way to stay stylish is to stay true to you."" This holiday season, Bure is back in familiar territory. She's starring in the Hallmark Channel's Switched for Christmas, which premieres on November 26. The movie centers around estranged, identical twins who are envious of each other's lives and decide to trade places. Bure's daughter, Natasha, co-stars in the romantic comedy. On a chilly afternoon in New York, Bure opened up about her style, shared heartfelt Christmas memories and revealed her favorite episode of Full House. In your new book, “Staying Stylish: Cultivating a Confident Look, Style, and Attitude,” you give a lot of tips on putting together different looks for various occasions. There is even a chapter dedicated to traveling in style. What do you recommend for travel?  I do like to be comfortable, but I do like to look put together and stylish. A go-to look is a jogger pant. There is a difference between having sloppy sweats or pajama pants that we see. I'm like, ""Please don't wear your pajamas on the plane. We're not in your bedroom."" A t-shirt is comfortable, and you can wear one that doesn't look sloppy. What is the most frequent question you get asked about your style?One of the most-asked questions is, “How did you get fit? How did you end up enjoying fitness and making that a regular part of your life?” For me, I found the fun in fitness.What does being stylish mean to you?It's about being confident and comfortable in your own skin. That's really what the book is about for me because everyone's style varies. Everyone's perception about what style is varies. What could look beautiful to me may not look beautiful to you. True style is really about radiating confidence. It’s a beauty, a warmth, a spirit, a kindness, and a love that's on the inside that radiates on the outside. Everyone has looked back on some of their old looks and wondered, “What was I thinking?” When you watch “Full House,” what do you think about some of the clothes you wore?They make me giggle. I remember we would joke about it all the time saying, ""If this show ever goes into reruns like The Brady Bunch, we're all going to be laughing at our style."" It’s fun. It was the fashion then, and it's actually some of the fashion now. The '90s have come back. They don't embarrass me at all. In the book you say, ""As I became more comfortable in my own skin, I started to think differently about style."" How did you become comfortable with yourself?It's an ongoing process. With age and maturity, I think you just become more comfortable with who you are because you have more life experience. You hopefully have more wisdom. Different seasons of your life change you and grow you. I have worked since I was 5 years old. Becoming a mother was a whole different season that gave me a whole new depth of myself that I didn't know and a whole lot of patience, too. You also become more confident, hopefully, by knowing what you believe in.Do you have a motto that you live by? I tell a lot of younger people that no matter what career you're going into, know who you are. Have your convictions in place. Know what your values are. Know what your morals are before you walk out into the world because if you don't have those, the world will shape them for you. So many child stars faced difficult times as they grew older. How have you been able to avoid the pitfalls that often fall on child stars? I have incredible parents who were right by my side. They were very protective. Show business was not the end all by any means for them. They didn't have stars in their eyes hoping their children would become stars. It was kind of like an extracurricular activity. My parents always had a healthy perspective of us working as children. I believe faith has played a huge role in keeping me and my parents grounded. You once said that your husband doesn't like watching your kissing scenes. Do you have any kissing scenes in your new movie “Switched for Christmas?”I do! I have several because I kiss two men in this movie because I'm playing two different people, and they both find love. I keep those kisses very simple. There's a general term for that in the whole entire industry. It's called a Hallmark kiss.You've worked with your daughter Natasha before, but in “Switched for Christmas” she has a leading role. What was it like working together? We had so much fun together. She did a great job. I was really proud of her. It was like our normal relationship when we were off camera, but when we started working, I treated her like a co-star and not like my daughter. I let the director do her job. I just sat back. It was good for me as a mom because she's 19 years old, and I have to let go and allow her to be more independent. It was good practice for me.Having done six Christmas movies, you may be the reigning queen of holiday movies. What are your favorites? Elf is my favorite. I have to watch it every year and multiple times a year. Sometimes Christmas Vacation. I also love Home Alone. And it's not because I'm on the channel, but I love my partnership with Hallmark because I'm a Hallmark watcher. I watched Hallmark long before I was on the network. That channel is on practically 24/7 in my house during the holidays. Do you have any Christmas traditions in your family?They are really simple. It's an event to go and get our Christmas tree with the kids and our dog. Then we spend an evening decorating it. We have a Christmas Eve tradition where my husband cooks and makes beef Wellington. My parents come over, and we have a more formal dinner. Christmas morning we started a new tradition five or six years ago where we serve at a homeless shelter. That's the first thing we do when we wake up. That for me now is the best part of Christmas. What were some of your most memorable Christmas gifts as a little girl?I still remember opening up my very first pink two-wheeler bicycle. And I remember my first Apple computer. I think I was about 12. I could not even believe that Santa brought that for me. I didn't ask for it. I was like, ""This is amazing!""After everything you've done professionally, what are you the most proud of?It's definitely Full House and Fuller House. That show has just left a legacy. It's not because it's what I'm probably best known for. I'm just proud of it because that show is living on for generations to watch. I've heard unbelievable stories of how that show--as silly as it sometimes--has deeply affected families and relationships because people have found family within the show.What is your favorite episode of “Full House?”The New Kids on the Block episode from Fuller House. That is probably my favorite episode of Full House and Fuller House. I mean, that was like my dream come true. When you were growing up, who was your favorite from New Kids on the Block?Joey McIntyre!""Staying Stylish: Cultivating a Confident Look, Style, and Attitude"" is now available. ""Switched for Christmas"" premieres Nov. 26, 8/7c on Hallmark Channel. "
15,WORLD NEWS,A Dissident Cuban Artist Reflects On The Anniversary Of Castro's Death,Zach Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-dissident-cuban-artist-reflects-on-the-anniversary-of-castros-death_us_5a145ec3e4b025f8e931ec1e,"A year after he was arrested for celebrating the ex-president's death, a Cuban dissident looks back on the first year without Fidel.",2017-11-25,Cuban artist Danilo Maldonado Machado poses with his daughter during a photo exhibition in Havana,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a14602a180000849ff6d5ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On the night Fidel Castro died, Danilo Maldonado Machado went for a walk in downtown Havana. The streets were peaceful; most residents of the city were asleep or at home listening to the news. Maldonado took out his smartphone and starting recording a video of himself.“Here we are on [Avenue] 23,” he laughed, leaning against a street sign. “El año que se murió la yegua.”This last sentence is a little awkward to translate; literally it means “the year the mare died.” Yegua, or “mare”, is a fairly strong insult in Spanish, which is to say it’s not the type of thing the average politically-conscious Cuban would be calling the recently-deceased Comandante during a time of official national mourning.“El año que se murió la yegua!” Maldonado repeated, to uncomfortable looks from passersby. He was jubilant, yet disappointed at the tepid reaction to the president’s death. “Unfortunately,” he told me later, “The number of people I would have liked to see shouting ‘freedom!’ in the streets didn’t turn out.” As he passed by the Hotel Tryp Habana Libre, Maldonado had a sudden inspiration.The building, one of the tallest and most prominent in the Havana skyline, has an unusual history. It was originally the Havana Hilton; after Fidel Castro’s triumphant entry into Havana in 1959, he made it his headquarters. It was later nationalized, and in the early years of the revolution it housed a temporary Soviet embassy. Seized by the moment, Machado pulled out a can of spray paint and on the wall of the Habana Libre he wrote the words “se fue” ― roughly, “he’s gone”. Then he uploaded the video to Facebook.“My friends sometimes think that I knew I was going to end up in prison,” he told me. “But the truth is I imagined there’d be a party in the streets, celebrating freedom.” Just a few hours later, state security was outside his door.Maldonado, better known by his artistic alias El Sexto, has become one of Cuba’s most prominent political dissidents in recent years, notorious for his anti-government artwork. His arrest late last year was just the latest of many; he was detained in the run-up to president Obama’s 2016 diplomatic visit, and in 2014 for a scheme that involved painting the names “Raúl” and “Fidel” on a pair of pigs and releasing them in the streets, an homage to George Orwell’s anti-totalitarian novel Animal Farm. “10 months in prison, that cost me.” he recalls. “I got out thanks to a ton of people who helped make sure people found out about it on social media: Amnesty International, The Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba.”A sketch by El Sexto, made in 2015 in the Valle Grande Prison In the year since his most recent arrest made international headlines, Maldonado has been traveling outside of Cuba, promoting his art, speaking to audiences in various countries. In the aftermath of Castro’s death, many predicted a thaw in the Cuban government’s attitude toward political dissent. Instead, recent weeks have seen the detention of several prominent artists and activists on the island. “Robert Jiménez and César Mendoza are friends of mine,” says Maldonado, referring to two activists recently arrested in Cuba. “They’re human rights activists, but that’s dangerous… because the dictatorship prefers silence on the part of the people.”Cuba’s 1976 constitution guarantees freedom of speech, with the caveat that such speech must be “in keeping with the objectives of socialist society”. In practice, that means that dissidents like Maldonado live in perpetual fear of a visit from state security. In another recent case, the artist Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara was arrested for illegal possession of construction materials. At the time, Otero was planning an independent artistic exhibition ― that is, one without government approval. The Cuban blogger Yoani Sánchez described the police action as a pretext to force him into an “endless legal process.” She says the government’s goal in such cases is twofold: to discourage and isolate dissidents, and to make them consider whether leaving the country might be their best long-term option. Call it self-deportation, Cuban-style.Now, on the anniversary of Castro’s death, Maldonado and the dissident community see little cause for celebration. “The political environment on the island remains the same,” he told me by email. “I would even say it’s worse: total uncertainty.” In just a few months time, Fidel’s brother Raúl, who assumed the presidency in 2008, is slated to step aside, making way for an as-yet unknown successor. Details on the political process are not forthcoming. “There haven’t been candidates, or campaigns to show political proposals,” says Maldonado. “Everything seems to indicate that the next person in charge will come to power the same way as the current dictator, by inheritance, like in a monarchy. Maybe [Raúl’s] daughter Mariela Espín will be the next president.” Cuba observers generally agree that the most likely president-in-waiting is the current Vice President, Miguel Díaz-Canel. His record gives little indication that he might be a reformer; in a leaked video published to youtube in August by the Cuban dissident Antonio Rodiles, Díaz-Canel discussed plans for further crackdowns on “counter-revolutionaries”: specifically, independent media and political opposition.Shortly after Maldonado’s release from prison in January, I reached him by Skype. I asked him why, in the case of his graffiti celebrating Castro’s death, he felt the need to combine art with vandalism. Why not express your political views without defacing public property? Maldonado scoffed at the very premise. “I don’t think it’s vandalism to paint on the walls in Cuba, where every wall belongs to the state,” he told me. “If they have the right to those walls, don’t I as well? Aren’t we all the ‘state’? Or is there some owner in particular? Once you put it that way, you can recognize clearly that it’s the dictator who owns every wall in Cuba.”Maldonado traces his artistic and political thinking back to an interaction with his mother when he was only 9 years old. “I did a drawing of Fidel Castro, and I put a monkey head on him,” he remembers. His mother saw it and was horrified. “And she told me that you can’t do that and made me erase it.” His mother’s panic at a simple drawing puzzled young Danilo. “And from that moment I started to think.” Years later, he would become a street artist under the alias El Sexto. The name itself was a finger in the eye to the authorities; at the time, a team of Cuban espionage agents known as “The Cuban Five” were imprisoned in the U.S., and the government was busy lionizing them in official propaganda. So Danilo styled himself El Sexto, “The Sixth”. If the “Five” were the ideal of revolutionary zeal, then the sixth was just a regular guy. “El Sexto was a representation of the people… a kid, an old person, anyone,” explains Maldonado. “So that’s what the story of El Sexto was based on.” He started painting all over Havana.After just over a year, the police finally caught up with El Sexto. “I was 26 or 27,” he recalls, “and they arrested me as I was leaving my house.” Danilo was “disappeared” for 4 days, exactly where to he wasn’t sure. Yet losing his anonymity had an upside; once the dissident community realized that he was behind the mysterious anti-government graffitis that had been popping up around the city, they were eager to meet him. “When I got out, they were all waiting at my house,” he says. It was then that he met Yoani Sánchez (the blogger mentioned earlier), and Gorki Águila, leader of the anti-Castro punk band Porno Para Ricardo. “I knew Gorki’s songs, and I had heard about Yoani on TV and even met her once; but to emerge from prison and see them waiting for you is something else!”Maldonado with blogger Yoani SánchezIn the years that followed, Maldonado began to cultivate his image online and internationally, through interviews and an active social media presence. He realized that this could be a strategy for protecting himself from the state; in modern Cuba, the government sometimes treads lightly with its most famous or visible dissidents, fearful of international condemnation. “You can see that in the case of my friend and mentor Yoani Sánchez,” says Maldonado. “If not for this protection, I wouldn’t even be free to respond to your questions... but this doesn’t mean that I’m not vulnerable in a dictatorship like this one.” Nor is state retaliation against Maldonado himself the only risk he runs; his 18 year-old younger brother, who recently graduated from studying mechanics, was expelled from a job this month. Maldonado claims the decision was purely political. “Just for being my brother,” he says.“I have to return [to Cuba] in the next two months and no one knows what will happen when I do. I miss my daughter, all my family, and my friends. I have to believe that everything will turn out ok.” When I spoke to Maldonado in February after his release from prison, he cited his daughter as one of the reasons he felt compelled to continue his activism. “I don’t want my daughter, because of an ideological difference, to not exist as a person. I want my daughter to think what she wants, to do what she wants, to present herself in life on the basis of her character… I don’t want anyone to be there to crush her dreams.”Maldonado and his girlfriend, Alexandra Martínez, recently welcomed another daughter, Luna María, in Miami.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Mariela Espín was the daughter of Fidel Castro. She is the daughter of Raul Castro."

And there was one detail in particular that stood out and captured the interest of many folks on social media.According to Recoil, Gorka’s “everyday carry” — meaning the items a person typically carries with them on a daily basis — includes two pistols, two flashlights, a knife, a tourniquet and a copy of the U.S. Constitution.The contents, particularly the number of weapons, struck a lot of social media users as a little excessive.For his part, Gorka seemed to be a huge fan of the article, calling it the “best most accurate interview” on Twitter. He also noted that he loved “watching Lib heads explode in response!”"
17,POLITICS,Trump Is Quietly Making It Even Harder To Report Sexual Harassment And Discrimination,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-sexual-harassment-discrimination_us_5a15b385e4b03dec8249b7e5,The White House has been trying to shut women up this whole time.,2017-11-25,Members of the National Organization for Women hold a rally to call upon Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. to reopen a criminal investigation against Harvey Weinstein.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a15b933150000bb348597be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To the droves of women speaking up about sexual harassment and discrimination, the Trump administration’s message is clear: Shut up. Behind the scenes, and mostly through executive orders, the White House is making it harder for women to report sexual harassment and fight sex discrimination.The clearest example came in March. It received little coverage at the time. President Donald Trump reversed an Obama-era order that forbid federal contractors from keeping secret sexual harassment and discrimination cases. The 2014 rule prohibited these companies, which employ about 26 million people, from forcing workers to resolve complaints through arbitration, an increasingly common method businesses use to settle disputes out of the public eye.“This was a clear sign of the administration silencing women,” said Jessica Stender, senior staff attorney for Equal Rights Advocates, a women’s rights nonprofit.And it’s only a small piece of the picture. “The Trump administration has a clear anti-women agenda,” Stender said. “I say that with complete certainty. This is an all-out, full frontal attack on women.”The attack so far has seen the most success via executive order, but a vast swath of the public policies proposed or endorsed by administration officials attempt to scale back women’s rights. From Trump’s repeal of executive orders meant to reduce pay discrimination to the budget floated in May, the failed repeal of Obamacare, and now the Republican tax bills, actions taken or backed by this administration harm women. This war on women comes at a time when feminist ideals have never seemed more powerful. Finally, sexual assault victims are being heard and believed. Sexual predators like Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein are facing real consequences, losing their jobs, their movie deals, their companies. And, though it’s hard to believe now, the U.S. just last year came extremely close to electing its first female president.In this atmosphere, the Trump administration’s actions look remarkably like a real-time backlash to the growing assertion of female power. The assault on women began almost instantly after the primal female scream that was the women’s march in January.That month, Trump signed his first executive order (surrounded by men). Literally a “gag rule,” meant to prevent health clinics around the world from even talking about abortion.He was just warming up his pen. After the order on arbitration came in March, the administration in August ditched an innovative equal pay initiative launched by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Currently, women on average make just 80 percent of what men earn. And women of color face even wider pay gaps.The scrapped provision would’ve required companies to report data on how much they pay workers ― broken down by race and ethnicity ― in order to make it easier to figure out the scope of the pay gap and ideally help close it.The EEOC spent six years devising this rule. The agency worked with the National Academy of Sciences to set-up a study on the pay gap, and revised and tweaked its proposal after consulting with employers and opening it up to public comment.The Office of Management and Budget scrapped the rule with little explanation, beyond saying it would create too much paperwork and impose too much of a burden on corporations. It would’ve cost each company $416.58 to comply, according to an EEOC estimate.“We think it’s outrageous,” said Robin Thurston, the lead litigator in a lawsuit filed by the National Women’s Law Center and the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement that seeks to overturn the decision. The data collection would have had benefits that far outstripped these costs, she said, enabling the EEOC to better enforce civil rights law and find companies with noticeable pay gaps.The agency hasn’t yet responded to the suit.Keeping information on pay discrimination out of the public’s eye is, of course, another way to silence women ― and it’s quite effective. Without pay transparency, women and people of color have no way of knowing if they’re paid unfairly and the practice can linger.If women do figure out they’re underpaid, their complaint could wind up in private arbitration. Colleagues facing similar situations won’t know anything. Nothing changes. But the administration wasn’t done trying to silence women. In September, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos rescinded a key Obama-era effort meant to help victims of sexual harassment and assault on college campuses: A 2011 letter sent by the administration to colleges defining sexual assault and setting a new standard for how schools should respond to such accusations. Trump, himself accused of sexual misconduct or sexually assaulting at least 13 women, has been largely silent on the recent outpouring of stories of such abuse by well-known and powerful men. One exception: Trump used Twitter to mock Sen. Al Franken after misconduct allegations surfaced against the Minnesota Democrat.On Tuesday, Trump publicly defended Republican Roy Moore, the 70-year-old Senate candidate in Alabama who has been accused of preying on underage girls as a younger man. “He says it didn’t happen. You have to listen to him also,” the president told reporters.Of course, part of his reticence to acknowledge the veracity of these women’s claims may be that it would undercut Trump’s repeated insistence that all the women who accuse him of sexual predation are simply liars. Also on Tuesday, Trump was asked for his message to women during this “pivotal moment.”“Women are very special,” he said. “I think it’s a very special time because a lot of things are coming out, and I think that’s good for our society and I think it’s very, very good for women, and I’m very happy a lot of these things are coming out. I’m very happy it’s being exposed.”His answer is totally empty of meaning. “These words mean nothing. They are a yearbook signature,” writes Alexandra Petri in the Washington Post. And his statement is completely belied by his actions.Women aren’t standing for it. This moment, where more and more women are coming forward to expose sexual abuse, feels like just a beginning.“It almost seems like this outpouring is a backlash against Trump,” Stender said. “It’s heartening.”"
18,ENTERTAINMENT,Lucas Hedges In Real Life,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lucas-hedges-in-real-life_us_5a15ba40e4b09650540ef99f,"The star of “Lady Bird” and “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is an art-school dropout who's worried about dating apps, just like you.",2017-11-25,"Lucas Hedges arrives at the Oscars on Feb. 26, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a15e5e9150000bb34859854.jpeg?cache=TOdRmPhvHA&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― At 5 years old, Lucas Hedges was known around his block as the Austin Powers kid. Neighbors would egg him on, and he’d yell, in an ostentatious British cadence, “Do I make you horny, baby?” “I remember really killing it, too,” he said. “Like, really giving to the impersonation.”Hedges is 20 now, and an Oscar nominee for his very un-Austin-Powers-like role as a Boston-area teenager processing his father’s death in last year’s “Manchester by the Sea.” His first memories of performing aren’t in a school play, though he did that, too ― namely, a seventh-grade production of “Nicholas Nickleby,” where a casting director saw him and eventually helped to secure him a small part in Wes Anderson’s “Moonrise Kingdom.” No, his first memories, Hedges told me over coffee earlier this month, are of the days when he would channel Mike Myers’ trendy innuendos for anyone who’d ask. Compared to the image of little dirty-blond Lucas dashing through his Brooklyn neighborhood, Hedges’ screen roles have been aggressively restrained. This month, he appears in “Lady Bird,” Greta Gerwig’s bittersweet coming-of-age gem starring Saoirse Ronan, and “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” Martin McDonagh’s tragicomedy about a fiery gift-shop owner (Frances McDormand) avenging the rape and murder of her daughter. Hedges plays quiet teenagers still coming into their own. In “Lady Bird,” he’s embroiled in the confusing throes of young love. In “Three Billboards,” he’s a smart, depressed Midwesterner who’d rather his mother stop causing such a spectacle.Across our hourlong conversation, during which he took approximately one bite from the quinoa salad sitting in front of him, Hedges’ self-deprecating earnestness was punctuated by a comic ease that lent credibility to his onetime Austin Powers theatrics.He grew up a mere subway ride away from the café where we met, yet still asked where we were exactly ― Manhattan’s Upper East Side ― because he needed to meet a friend for lunch in the West Village afterward. He issued a collected “nahhhh” when asked whether he was a party guy in high school, but grew cheerfully closemouthed in response to a question about the first time he got drunk, like a typical 20-year-old not quite prepared to part with his innocence: “I don’t even know if I’ve told my parents about this. Ummm. I’m worried my publicist is going to freak out. I’m sorry.”He agreed that, even though he isn’t dating at the moment and isn’t keen on meeting anyone through “superficial” smartphone apps, he would “give anything” to scroll through the service that allows creative types (aka celebrities) to pay to match with other creative types (aka celebrities). I assume he’s referring to Raya, though he couldn’t recall the app’s name. I also assume he could easily scroll through it if he chose, because some of his famous pals use the app, though he wouldn’t tell me which ones. This all says a lot about the multitudes of Lucas Hedges, who found a relatively easy portal into Hollywood. His parents are Peter Hedges, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of “Dan in Real Life,” “About a Boy” and “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape,” and Susan Bruce, an actress and poet who has appeared in “Law & Order: Criminal Intent” and “Pieces of April.” They were the sort of parents who let him watch rowdy sex comedies at 5 and the violent thriller “Deliverance” in fourth grade. Hedges ripened in an affluent section of Brooklyn, where he attended a private arts school that didn’t assign students letter grades. Famous parents like Maggie Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard and Jennifer Connelly attended his plays. Kenneth Lonergan, who wrote and directed “Manchester by the Sea,” was a friend of Hedges’ father long before he cast Hedges in that breakout role, filmed toward the end of his senior year of high school.As privileged and fortuitous as all of this was, by the time he was about to graduate, Hedges needed to escape from the home life he knew ― “like Lady Bird,” Ronan’s titular character, he said.“I just didn’t know how to take care of myself,” Hedges reflected. “I didn’t know how to work hard and exercise and read. I was just confused and scared.”So, Hedges spent a year studying theater at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, where he decided he was “addicted” to his iPhone and traded it for a flip phone. Hedges was giving an interview to Variety in his “dusty, dusty dorm room” when he first learned his “Manchester” performance was netting Oscar buzz.“Part of the reason why I wanted to go to acting school is I thought I would be the man there,” he said. “I thought, ‘I’ve been working, and because I’ve been working, that says something about my talent and what I’m inherently capable of doing.’ So when I got to school, I was like, ‘OK, I’m going to have the best of both worlds. I have training, everyone’s going to think I’m the best.’ I went and none of that happened. I truly felt like I was the worst. The teachers were all trying to help me, but really anything other than ‘You’re a genius, oh my God, I can watch you for hours’ would have hurt my ego. I went there with the wrong intention. And if you do anything with the wrong intention, you’re going to get fucked.”It was “Lady Bird” that brought Hedges back to Brooklyn ― or, rather, sent him to Sacramento, California, where the movie shot last autumn. He dropped out, because “school’s hard” and acting professionally is more invigorating than being judged by classmates during relentless workshops. “I’m so happy I’m not in school right now,” he said. “I felt like I was the one bad actor at this school. And then [‘Manchester’] came out and everyone really loved the performance.”As these things often go for Hollywood-adjacent kids, one stroke of fortune led to another. At the Sundance Film Festival in January 2016, standing onstage after a screening of “Manchester,” Hedges made eye contact with Gerwig, who was sitting in the audience. (“Gosh, she’s just the greatest,” he told me.) Gerwig would soon offer him a choice between Danny, the earnest musical-theater tenderfoot in “Lady Bird,” or Kyle, the too-cool rocker stud who hates the economy and has little interest in attending prom. He chose Danny, who more resembled Hedges’ own teenage experience, largely because he, too, dreamed of living in Europe. But Danny departed from Hedges in at least one key way: Hedges wasn’t, and still isn’t, “brave” enough to do musical theater. As for the role of Kyle, well, that gave Hedges another new buddy. Timothée Chalamet, the scruffy-haired beanpole who is winning raves for this month’s “Call Me by Your Name,” got the part. Together, Hedges and Chalamet represent Hollywood’s new class. Both are babes who grew up attending New York arts schools; they now wax thoughtful about craft and the business in a way that most young actors do not. “He is my homie,” Hedges said before pressing me about “Call Me by Your Name,” having not yet seen it. When I told him Chalamet should win the Oscar for best actor in March, Hedges’ jaw dropped in excitement. “He’s about to be an icon,” he said. “There’s something special about that dude.”That seems to be Hedges’ default mode: thrilled for the people who surround him, as long as their judgments aren’t too harsh. Currently, he is trying to court Xavier Dolan ― the acclaimed director and actor from Quebec with whom he co-stars in next year’s conversion-therapy drama “Boy Erased” ― to cast him and Chalamet in a movie. Hedges and the 28-year-old Dolan became chummy while making the Joel Edgerton-helmed “Erased,” shot in September. They shared scenes with Nicole Kidman, whom Hedges called “the best actor I’ve ever worked with.” Hedges couldn’t single out a favorite Kidman performance ― tsk, tsk, young man ― but he gushed about Dolan’s infatuation with the psychodrama “Birth,” specifically the haunting close-up of Kidman in an opera house. Hedges rattled off names of his North Carolina friends, who have been his strongest support during this transition toward becoming a celebrity. They don’t mind that he’s been texting with Julia Roberts, his co-star in the forthcoming drama “Ben Is Back,” written and directed by Hedges’ father. Or that he’s starring in Jonah Hill’s directorial debut, which he called an “exciting” departure from the Apatovian actor’s usual fare. One of those unruffled friends is in possession of an essay Hedges was compelled to write three years ago after first seeing “The Celebration,” a heady Danish film that claims a passionate art-house following. Along with “Super 8” and that “Deliverance” viewing in fourth grade, it’s the movie that made Hedges fall in love with movies.“I carried it around in my wallet for so long, and now it’s so faded that you can’t even really read it,” he said of the essay. “I was just visiting my friend in North Carolina, and for some reason it’s on his bedside table. It’s just, like, there.”For Hedges, his pals’ support is encouragement as his nascent fame seemingly ebbs and flows. For about a week after “Manchester by the Sea” opened last November, Hedges felt recognized everywhere he went. And then it ended, just like that, or so he says. Today, he mostly operates with ordinary anonymity, even as his media profile rises.Ahead of Oscar night this past February, he knew he wouldn’t win the best supporting actor trophy ― “Moonlight” actor Mahershala Ali had scored enough precursor prizes to effectively end the race before the big moment arrived ― yet for one split second, when presenter Alicia Vikander opened the envelope, a flashbulb went off in Hedges’ head. He was convinced he’d prevailed. “I was like, ’Oh my God, I won,” he said, chuckling. “It was like a split second. It was based in nothing. It might have been some sort of evolutionary reflex. It wasn’t even like it happened. It felt like something literally came out of my mouth or my body... I was ultimately very grateful that I didn’t win, because I think I’d be very confused and very scared right now if I had. It also just puts the spotlight. I imagine there’s already a lot of attention on me just for getting nominated, but there’s a lot of scrutiny on your performances after that. I still just want to be experimenting and failing and learning. I think that becomes difficult if you win an Oscar. They expect you to be an expert. They expect you to have it all made.”Whatever Hedges means by invoking this nebulous “they,” it’s clear that he’s coming of age in an industry that’s being forced to reckon with its history of transgressions. As if paparazzi at LAX weren’t taxing enough for a 20-year-old, he now has to accept that this thing we call Hollywood is riddled with bullies and perverts. He put his head in his hands when asked about the many men being outed as sexual predators this year. “Hollywood is being purged of a lot of its demons right now,” he said, hatching a perfectly succinct response despite his apparent nerves about discussing the subject. “It’s a terrifying thing, learning about these things. And it’s also a terrifying thing in and of itself to just watch people get canceled. You just wonder who’s going to get canceled next and what don’t you know about what you’re going to find out. Yeah, it’s scary. It also just makes me wonder, what was Picasso doing that nobody knows about? All of the great artists in history whose work we cherish, which ones were perverts? Which ones were really destructive forces in many respects? I’m sure so many of our heroes were like that, and then how do we separate the art and the ― what’s the phrase?”The art and the artist, I said.“The art from the artist, yeah.” Hedges and I rose to leave shortly after finishing this heavy discussion. A middle-aged woman sitting nearby pointed out his untied shoelaces. Hedges was wearing a navy blue cardigan and jeans cuffed above his ankles ― a preppy but nonchalant ensemble, both youthful and mature. The woman said she’s a mother, so she notices such things. “Thanks, Mom,” Hedges replied, his lighthearted ease returning. "

Bush has now lived longer than any other U.S. president to date, officially beating Gerald Ford’s record of 93 years and 165 days on Saturday.Ford lived his long life between July 14, 1913 and Dec. 26, 2006, serving in office from 1974 to 1977 after Richard Nixon’s resignation. He died after a series of hospitalizations for heart treatments. Bush entered the world on June 12, 1924, and served his term in the Oval Office between 1989 and 1993.In recent years, he has used a wheelchair or motorized scooter. He was placed in intensive care at a Houston hospital for pneumonia shortly before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President Donald Trump, and could not attend.Bush also suffers from vascular parkinsonism, which mimics Parkinson’s disease. Although he was discharged in time to flip the coin at the Super Bowl in February, he’s been hospitalized at least twice more since then. Teen political blogger Gabe Fleisher brought attention to the milestone on Twitter on Saturday.In the line of longest-lived presidents, Ronald Reagan comes in third, at 93 years and 120 days. He died in 2004 after a long battle with Alzheimer’s disease.Jimmy Carter comes in fourth, at 93 years and 56 days. Carter announced a cancer diagnosis in August 2015, saying he initially thought he had just weeks to live, but was declared cancer-free later that year.Carter joined Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama earlier this year as four of five living former presidents who watched Trump become No. 45."

The 2018 edition sees the Rowers, who are students at the University of Warwick in England, posing au naturel on the grounds of regal-looking estates in Spain and the U.K. The guys began stripping nude for the project in 2009 to raise funds for rowing gear, and though their earliest efforts were considerably less cheeky, their calendar quickly found an audience among gay men. (Watch a video trailer for the new calendar above.) Once the Rowers caught on to who their most fervent admirers were, they opted to re-conceive their mission. Since 2012, proceeds from calendar sales have been donated to Sport Allies, a U.K. advocacy organization aimed at combating homophobia and gender bias in team sports. Recent editions of the calendar have raised more than $300,000 and are sold in 77 countries. As in previous years, the 2018 calendar features many of the men sunbathing together and lounging around in various stages of undress. In a 2015 interview, rower Tristan Edwards explained that the photos are meant to be more playful than explicit, in hopes of normalizing male-on-male intimacy among both athletes and sports fans. “A lot of the problems around homophobia in sport come from the enforcement of gender norms… people saying what a man is or what a woman is,” Edwards told HuffPost. “We don’t want to be put into a box in terms of what a man ‘should be’ in sport. This is how we think you can act.”As for what would be considered “too hot” for the calendar, he continued, “We know our audience, we know our boundaries and we know what we’re trying to achieve. So we’d never do anything that would brand us as porn.”Catch a sneak peek at the 2018 Warwick Rowers calendar below. Catch the latest in LGBTQ news by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter. "

If you don’t already know that’s a pretty universal experience, you must be living on a space station (though come to think of it, I bet there’s sexual harassment there, too). And you definitely aren’t a woman.Despite my cynicism, each time I saw a #MeToo tweet or post, something inside of me stirred. Part of it was a sense of sisterhood and solidarity. Part was a feeling of joyous wonder, because a huge crack seems to be opening in the patriarchy that has oppressed women for millennia. And that crack may go deeper than the stucco that hides the hatred and fear that’s at patriarchy’s core. That crack may come to undermine its very foundation.I’ve also been struck by posts and comments on the #MeToo revelations from some men, thoughtful types who are examining their own history and consciences and urging their male peers to do the same. Those expressions brought out mixed feelings in me, too. My prevailing reaction was, “Bless you, but good guys like you are not the problem. Rather than excoriate yourself, save your energy for helping women fight the Donald Trumps and Harvey Weinsteins of the world.”The less noble undercurrent of feeling I had was a bit confused, but it went something like, “This is kind of a turn-off, you hand-wringing snowflake.” Mixed with a little, “Are you just saying this stuff to get laid?”I cop to the fact that those may be unfair and unworthy sentiments, but since this is clearly a moment of airing awkward truths, I’ll share them. Especially because it’s evidence of how the patriarchy gets into the heads of people of all genders and political persuasions, warping our thoughts and making us all at least a little bit crazy.Et Tu, Brute?Since the early days of the #MeToo campaign, our focus has shifted from the more familiar ground of thinking about how many women have been harassed to something that we as a society seem to be finding even more challenging: confronting just how many men have been doing the harassing. And the revelations have been jaw-dropping.History (not to mention generation after generation of priests) has taught us that holy-roller types tend to be covering up a tendency for sexual predation. Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore—with his 5,280-pound Ten Commandments monument and wife who sports crucifixes as earrings—is basically wearing a neon sign that flashes “Ask Me About My Perversion.” The only thing that surprises me about the accusations against this holiest of holy rollers is that the victims he’s alleged to have sexually harassed and assaulted are women and girls. In the admittedly skewed sample we have from the U.S. government, Republicans tend to go after men (remember Senator Larry Craig’s “wide stance” in the restroom stall?), while Democrats tend to target women (see JFK and Bill Clinton).For feminists who appreciate our male allies, the recent naming and shaming of liberal icons has been both outraging and disheartening. Apparently, allies can be enemies, too. Just look at that photo showing Senator Al Franken, a champion of women’s rights, grinning like an idiot while he mimes feeling up a sleeping woman. Or consider some of the left-leaning celebrities who’ve recently been charged with sexual predation. First there was Louis C.K., the supposed sensitive sad-sack, admitting that he’d asked woman after woman if they wanted to see his dick—then whipping it out and…er…doing things with it. Then we heard tales that Jeffrey Tambor, whose sympathetic portrayal of a transgender woman in Transparent has been a cultural game-changer, harassed trans women on set. A different kind of revolting is the thought of avuncular talk-show host Charlie Rose putting his “crusty paw” (a term coined by female staffers on his show) on the shoulders, legs, and breasts of women decades younger than him.I don’t know what will happen to the careers of these men in the long term. If history is a guide, they may actually be rewarded for their actions, at least financially. When Roger Ailes was ousted from Fox News for sexually harassing female staff, he got more than $40 million. The same network paid Papa Bear Bill O’Reilly $25 million when it showed him the door for similar reasons. Those kinds of payouts stink to high heaven. I am hopeful that in the new era we seem to be entering, they may stop. Especially if networks like PBS and Netflix know that we’re watching closely.It isn’t just male politicians and celebrities who seem to think they’re entitled to do just about anything to women (and sometimes, to men). It’s businessmen who masturbate in front of hotel maids. It’s frat boys hosting “cattle call” parties where they try to get freshmen women drunk and take advantage of them. It’s field supervisors who demand sexual favors from immigrant women picking fruit. It’s the Manhattan construction workers whose catcalls blighted my walk to work on far too many mornings when I was in my 20s. (I learned never to wear white, since that seemed to elicit the most frenzied and obscene onslaughts of verbal abuse. I’m not sure if the color simply made me more conspicuous among the women hoping to tiptoe unmolested past the construction site, or if the connotation of purity turns men’s thoughts to defilement.)Given the myriad forms sexual predation can take, I’m starting to wonder if some of the earnest men posting about supporting women on Twitter and Facebook may actually have good reason for their public soul-searching. After all, in a male society that’s structured like a wolf pack, even the beta males will bare their teeth occasionally.Something about being a man increases the likelihood of sexual predation, but I don’t think it’s a defect on the Y chromosome. I think it’s a defect of our cultural conditioning—and patriarchy cuts across many, but not all, cultures. Part of the reason for that may be that in a patriarchal society, men are generally expected, even now, to be the ones to initiate romantic and sexual relations. If you’re a man pursuing a woman for a date, a hook-up, or a relationship, I can imagine that there could conceivably be challenges involved in staying on the right side of predation.My response to men who’ve wondered about making women uncomfortable is that they can still count themselves as one of the “good guys” if a woman they’ve approached in the past thinks something along the lines of “There’s that guy who has a crush on me” when they run into each other. If she thinks, “I hope that guy doesn’t do that thing again”—whatever that thing may be—it’s likely he crossed the line.I suggest three simple guidelines: 1) Men shouldn’t touch or kiss a woman without her permission. 2) After one or at max, two tries, stop asking. 3) No, she doesn’t want to see your dick—not in person, not on her phone screen.The Bitch Is BackThe fact that men pretty much have a monopoly on sexual predation makes Donald Trump’s “I moved on her like a bitch” remark on the Access Hollywood tape one of the most puzzling and nonsensical things the Pussygrabber-in-Chief has ever said. And let’s face it, that’s a high hurdle.It’s not just moronic Neanderthals like Trump who wield that misogynistic term like an imprecise club. It’s also supposedly clever liberals, such as comedian and talk-show host Bill Maher, whose preferred slur for Trump is “whiny little bitch.”Why is that for certain kinds of swaggering (or overcompensating) men, phrases like “bitch” and “pussy” are the ultimate insult? Because underlying that potty talk is an even dirtier reality: They view being a woman as the lowest possible fate. So it follows that if they want to insult another man, they’ll equate him with a woman—or part thereof.Well you know what? We bitches are not going to take it anymore. Just as civilized people everywhere have abandoned language that maligns racial, ethnic, or religious groups, it’s time we move beyond language that maligns women. This is our “Women’s lives matter” moment.Not that men’s lives don’t matter—or that gay, trans, and straight men can’t be harassed and assaulted. But just like we use the phrase “Black lives matter” to express outrage that up until now, they haven’t mattered enough; this is the moment to say that women’s lives matter. That our days of being demeaned—and ashamed about being demeaned—are over.Women’s shame at being victimized is giving way to outrage, and that’s a world-tilting shift. As we move on, the #MeToo movement is gong to need a new hashtag. Maybe we can go with something along the lines of France’s #BalanceTonPorc (“Squeal on Your Pig”) campaign. As one of the women who has come forward to accuse Uncle Charlie Rose put it, we’re currently in “a fierce moment of cultural reckoning.”A week or two ago, I was at a party when a lame guy made an even lamer sexist joke, then looked around nervously when instead of laughing it off, everyone around him pretty much froze. “You don’t get it,” I said, keeping my voice even as I leaned in with body language that was ever so slightly aggressive. “We’re not taking that shit any more.” Man, did that feel good.I feel more hopeful about the likelihood of casting off misogyny, and the blinders we have about gender issues, than I ever have in my lifetime. We’re actually figuring some things out about ourselves. Including how warped and warping gender roles can be—still.Pardon the expression, but we’re dealing with seminal issues here, so the going will be tough at times. And with each step forward, there’s always a risk of missteps. Some worry about seeming too exacting, or accusatory, or paranoid. There’s also a fear of backlash. A few have termed the recent outcry against sexual predation a “witch hunt”—forgetting that women were the victims, not the perpetrators, of those hunts.Even the language we use to talk about sexual predation is thorny. As Rachel Malik wrote in an excellent blog post, “The ‘trouble’ with words like assault or harassment is that they don’t seem to belong in everyday discourse, they sound technical, perhaps a little alien. And from here it’s a short step to seeing this type of language as unnatural: the unwelcome entry of officialdom into the private world—too much red tape and political correctness gone mad.” Malik goes on to say that the way around that is to move beyond the jargon by telling personal stories and speaking our own truths.We must do that—as well as listen to each other. Recent discussions about intersectionality in the feminist movement have helped me see, and start to get a grip on, my own white privilege in a visceral way. The process has been uncomfortable at times, but it’s also been enlightening and moving. It’s also brought me closer to people from groups that in the past may have felt a little “other” to me.The current exposure of just how prevalent sexual predation is across all social sectors may do similar things for men. Besides making some offenders think twice before speaking or acting out, it may turn non-offenders into actual agents of change. Both would be huge steps forward. And maybe it’s too much to hope for, but wouldn’t it be wonderful if in the future, men and women didn’t feel quite so alien to each other?As we examine what’s going on in our societies and our souls, we should remember that patriarchy doesn’t just warp men, it warps women, too. (Consider how I’m ever so slightly turned off by men who publicly scour their souls for gender-based guilt.) And patriarchy is damn hard to escape, since it rears its oh-so-ugly head (even uglier than the one Louis C.K. likes to flash around) in everything from our self-image to our relationships to our porn.We’re in unchartered waters now, and current shifts can be disorienting. We must examine our own assumptions and call each other out, but we also must be compassionate and when it’s warranted, forgiving. Since it isn’t just you or me who’s been warped by patriarchy. It’s all of us.

At more than 57,000 square miles — roughly the size of Georgia — Revillagigedo Archipelago National Park becomes the largest fully protected marine reserve in North America, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. All fishing and other extractive activities will now be banned in the area.Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto established the sanctuary via a decree on Friday. The archipelago and the rich waters surrounding it are critical habitat for numerous species and have already been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2016.Mario Gómez, executive director of Beta Diversidad ― which along with Pew and other groups had supported the reserve’s creation ― called Revillagigedo “the crown jewel of Mexican waters.”“We are proud of the protection we will provide to marine life in this area, and for the preservation of this important center of connectivity of species migrating throughout the Pacific,” Gómez said in a statement. The island chain, part of a submerged volcanic mountain range, lies some 250 miles south of the Baja California peninsula. There two ocean currents collide and draw up nutrients that help feed some 400 species of fish, sharks and rays, according to Pew. The area is also an important site for whales, dolphins and seabirds. Matt Rand, director of the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy Project, told HuffPost that the reserve is “biologically spectacular.” And he applauded Mexico’s leadership. “It wasn’t an easy decision because they had significant opposition from the commercial fishing industry, which I think is unfortunate,” Rand said. “I would love to see a commercial industry embrace this notion that certain areas should be protected.” The scientific community has called on world governments to set aside large swaths of ocean for preservation purposes. The United Nations has established a goal of protecting 10 percent of the world’s oceans by 2020. Joining the movement in recent years have been countries like Chile, New Zealand and Tahiti. During the 2015 Our Ocean conference in Valparaiso, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet announced the creation of both the Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park, located some 550 miles off the coast of Chile ― giving that country claim to the largest marine reserve in the Americas ― and the Easter Island Marine Park, which will be the third-largest fully protected marine area in the world. The Easter Island reserve bumped New Zealand’s Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary to the No. 4 spot.Meanwhile in the United States, President Donald Trump is considering shrinking two marine national monuments in the Pacific — Rose Atoll and the Pacific Remote Islands — as well as opening those and a third ― Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, off the coast of New England ― to commercial fishing, according to a leaked report published by The Washington Post.

23,WORLD NEWS,Anxiety Runs High In China As Another Kindergarten Is Accused Of Child Abuse,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beijing-kindergarten-ryb-education-abuse_us_5a185f31e4b0649480742988,"Teachers at a Beijing school allegedly forced children to take pills, jabbed them with needles and made them strip naked.",2017-11-24,"A parent is surrounded by the media outside RYB New World Kindergarten in Beijing on Nov. 24, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a186e1c140000024450f221.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Disturbing allegations of child abuse at yet another Chinese kindergarten have prompted a government investigation into early education facilities across the country, as Chinese parents and other netizens express their fury and anxiety online.Several children, some as young as three, who attended RYB New World Kindergarten in Beijing’s Chaoyang district told their parents they’d been fed pills that made them “drowsy,” jabbed with needles as punishment and forced by naked adults to strip naked, according to local media.The school is run by RYB Education, a company that is based in Beijing but listed in New York. It operates kindergartens and day care centers in about 300 Chinese cities.China’s Ministry of Education said on Thursday that it had launched a special investigation into the operation of kindergartens nationwide, Reuters reported. Beijing’s municipal education authority said that it had begun its own probe.Authorities have not confirmed any of the allegations of abuse.One mother said that at least eight parents had told police that their children were “drugged and molested” at RYB New World kindergarten, CNN reported, citing a video circulating on Chinese social media.The same mother later told reporters that her 3-year-old daughter had been “injected with a brown liquid by a teacher” and made to strip naked by a naked man who conducted a “medical check-up” on her and other students.Another parent told Xinhua news agency that some students had been given unidentified pills “to take after lunch.” These pills made the children “drowsy,” reported other news outlets.Local police said on Friday that needle marks had been found on some students.One parent told reporters that the teachers had intimidated the children into believing that their words and actions were being watched ― even when at home.“The teacher told the kids, ‘I’ve got a long, long telescope that can see right into your home, and I’ll know just what you’ve been saying and doing,’” the unidentified mom said, according to The New York Times. “How could a child not be scared? That’s why the kids didn’t dare tell their parents.”RYB Education, whose shares plummeted on Friday by almost 40 percent on the New York Stock Exchange as the abuse allegations made global headlines, apologized in a statement and said it was cooperating with police in their investigation. “We deeply apologize for the serious anxiety this matter has brought to parents and society,” RYB said, per Reuters. “We are currently working with the police to provide relevant surveillance materials and equipment. The teachers in question have been suspended and we are cooperating with the police investigation.”The statement added that the school’s principal had filed a police report against “individuals who have engaged in false accusations and framing.” It didn’t elaborate on the specifics, however.This is at least the third time that an RYB kindergarten has been accused of child abuse. Earlier this year, a teacher at an RYB facility in northern Beijing was allegedly caught on camera kicking a student. In April, four teachers at an RYB kindergarten in northeast China were sentenced to more than two years in prison for using sewing needles to pierce more than 20 children on their bodies.Several other educational facilities in China have also recently come under fire for alleged abuse of students. Just this week, a video showing a kindergarten teacher in Zhejiang province grabbing a boy by the neck and slapping a young girl went viral.Earlier this month, reports emerged of teenagers at a “digital detox” camp in Jiangxi province being flogged with cables and kept in “dark rooms” in solitary confinement.

24,WORLD NEWS,Anxiety Runs High In China As Another Kindergarten Is Accused Of Child Abuse,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beijing-kindergarten-ryb-education-abuse_us_5a185f31e4b0649480742988,"Teachers at a Beijing school allegedly forced children to take pills, jabbed them with needles and made them strip naked.",2017-11-24,"RYB New World Kindergarten in Beijing on Nov. 24, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a186e021500008845859bd7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Disturbing allegations of child abuse at yet another Chinese kindergarten have prompted a government investigation into early education facilities across the country, as Chinese parents and other netizens express their fury and anxiety online.Several children, some as young as three, who attended RYB New World Kindergarten in Beijing’s Chaoyang district told their parents they’d been fed pills that made them “drowsy,” jabbed with needles as punishment and forced by naked adults to strip naked, according to local media.The school is run by RYB Education, a company that is based in Beijing but listed in New York. It operates kindergartens and day care centers in about 300 Chinese cities.China’s Ministry of Education said on Thursday that it had launched a special investigation into the operation of kindergartens nationwide, Reuters reported. Beijing’s municipal education authority said that it had begun its own probe.Authorities have not confirmed any of the allegations of abuse.One mother said that at least eight parents had told police that their children were “drugged and molested” at RYB New World kindergarten, CNN reported, citing a video circulating on Chinese social media.The same mother later told reporters that her 3-year-old daughter had been “injected with a brown liquid by a teacher” and made to strip naked by a naked man who conducted a “medical check-up” on her and other students.Another parent told Xinhua news agency that some students had been given unidentified pills “to take after lunch.” These pills made the children “drowsy,” reported other news outlets.Local police said on Friday that needle marks had been found on some students.One parent told reporters that the teachers had intimidated the children into believing that their words and actions were being watched ― even when at home.“The teacher told the kids, ‘I’ve got a long, long telescope that can see right into your home, and I’ll know just what you’ve been saying and doing,’” the unidentified mom said, according to The New York Times. “How could a child not be scared? That’s why the kids didn’t dare tell their parents.”RYB Education, whose shares plummeted on Friday by almost 40 percent on the New York Stock Exchange as the abuse allegations made global headlines, apologized in a statement and said it was cooperating with police in their investigation. “We deeply apologize for the serious anxiety this matter has brought to parents and society,” RYB said, per Reuters. “We are currently working with the police to provide relevant surveillance materials and equipment. The teachers in question have been suspended and we are cooperating with the police investigation.”The statement added that the school’s principal had filed a police report against “individuals who have engaged in false accusations and framing.” It didn’t elaborate on the specifics, however.This is at least the third time that an RYB kindergarten has been accused of child abuse. Earlier this year, a teacher at an RYB facility in northern Beijing was allegedly caught on camera kicking a student. In April, four teachers at an RYB kindergarten in northeast China were sentenced to more than two years in prison for using sewing needles to pierce more than 20 children on their bodies.Several other educational facilities in China have also recently come under fire for alleged abuse of students. Just this week, a video showing a kindergarten teacher in Zhejiang province grabbing a boy by the neck and slapping a young girl went viral.Earlier this month, reports emerged of teenagers at a “digital detox” camp in Jiangxi province being flogged with cables and kept in “dark rooms” in solitary confinement. In August, two teachers at a special needs school in Beijing were fired after they were captured on video allegedly mistreating children with autism.As such abuse allegations have grown more common in China, the public has become increasingly incensed at what many now see as a systemic problem.The latest RYB allegations have touched a particular nerve. According to Reuters, there was more than 76 million mentions of “RYB” on China’s popular WeChat messaging service on Thursday alone.

27,BLACK VOICES,"The Stronghold Of American, Anti-Black Injustice That Easily Claimed Tamir Rice's Life","Gregg L. Greer, ContributorContributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-stronghold-of-injustice-in-black-america-that-easily_us_5a1766efe4b068a3ca6df731,Decades of racist rhetoric and policy greased the skids leading to the 12-year old's killing.,2017-11-24,<p>A family photo of Tamir Rice from the fall of 2014. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a17690e140000954250f0b4.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yesterday marked the three year anniversary since the shooting of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy (June 25, 2002 – November 23, 2014), on a tragic incident which occurred on November 22, 2014, in Cleveland, Ohio.The two police officers responsible, were 26-year-old Timothy Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, who responded after receiving a police dispatch call of a black male who “kept pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people.”Full disclosure, I was a primary organizer for the family in defense against the two officers who shot Tamir (pic,below). With that in mind, I can say that I believe the Black or African American community has a long way to go to understand the how to combat and even get past the deep rooted effects of racism in America.Tamir’s case was always the one that affected me the most and will haunt me for the rest of my life. Why? Because I never really understood how a 12 year old boy’s life could be so easily taken without any real consequence for the police who committed the murder. This, even though we fought for over a year and won in civil litigation against the City of Cleveland.For those close to the case, we believe it was influenced by poor legal representation, lack of commitment from those close to the issue and lack of understanding and support from family.In the aftermath of the shooting, media outlets reported on the background of the police officers involved. Both officers had prior issues when dealing with minorities, and at the time, both were placed on paid administrative leave. On December 28, 2015, the grand jury returned its decision declining to indict the police officers. In truth, the shooter, Timothy Loehmann, should have been charged with a crime; possibly even one of three: involuntary manslaughter, or negligent homicide and even dereliction of duty could have worked. With that being said, it would definitely benefit those in the African American community to begin to understand that the absence of social mobility in the black community not only affects us economically but overwhelmingly, it affects us in the most negative sense possible with issues like unfair sentencing, mass incarceration and underfunded, low-quality public education. This striking undertone has given birth to the widespread human rights abuses that to date exist overwhelmingly in the black community. How does the Black community address huge racial disparities in how U.S. police use force, when reports have shown that black people are much more likely to be shot and killed by police than their white peers.An analysis of the available FBI data by Vox’s Dara Lind found that U.S. police kill black people at disproportionate rates: Black people accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims, even though they made up just 13 percent of the U.S. population.Also, how does the black community address the longterm systematic genocide that simply reiterates the known fact that our community has been so powerfully underwritten or even written off by those seeking to maintain the status quo?Yes, in truth, the deep-rooted class system that has existed for hundreds of years is still very much in play to date. Racial inequality in America has its parallel in a class inequality system, even though by definition, race and class are not the same thing.The class system, for the record, is a defined system of stratification based on economic position in which people are ranked based on achievements such as education and wealth.The Black community has to understand that the one-sided rhetoric of “law and order,” first used by Southern segregationists of the Jim Crow Era, has become more attractive as mainstream Americans try to increasingly reject outright racial discrimination. Another example of the attitudes of racial tension is seen in the coded messages which have become the staple of the Republican Party over decades. These include Donald Trumps message, “Make America great again,” which simply means “let’s go back to the whiter, racialized America of the past, where people owned other people and civil rights were misaligned and stomped on without regard to constitutional protection.”Yes, I believe that if Tamir Rice were a white, middle-class kid from suburbia, he would not have been murdered by those rogue officers three years ago in Cleveland. Again, If Tamir lived in an affluent suburb, he would not have been murdered.Although we fought hard to put the name of Tamir out to the national and international media, we never truly got the opportunity to take the issue where I wanted it to go, which was the Supreme Court, even though I was successful in organizing at the United Nations on behalf of Tamir and others. There are some who would say there was no way for such an event to happen in the Supreme Court. I say to them, “you are in error.” Why? Because history has shown us time and again that the story of one’s struggle for social justice can illuminate the pitfalls and prospects of success for others. United States Supreme Court decisions have shaped history ― important decisions have ended racial segregation, enforced child labor laws, kept firearms away from schools and more. In my opinion, Tamir’s murder case could have made it to the Supreme Court. Going forward, the Black community must question any legislation that endorses police vigilantism. Speak up, speak out and organize more aggressively against police inaction and official misconduct. Then, teach your child that they are protected, first by God, and then by you. Afterward, we must be the champion over our children’s rights.I say to the black community, we have to learn form the past and work for the future. If not, there will be more Tamir Rice-type murders; perhaps, involving your own child. ――-Gregg L. Greer a Public Speaker, Minister, Social Activist, and the Editor of the One World Internet journal.

Al Franken (D-Minn.) on Thursday, saying that President Donald Trump once “hit on my wife” at a Manhattan hotel. Baldwin also slammed the president as a “5th degree black belt when it comes to sexual impropriety allegations.”Baldwin jumped into the fray after the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. tweeted about new allegations against Franken. He was referring to a HuffPost report published Wednesday in which two other women stepped forward saying Franken inappropriately touched them on the butt. That makes the third and fourth such allegations against Franken in the past week.Baldwin responded with the quip about the president’s “black belt” status, adding that Trump once “crashed” a Baldwin party at the Plaza Hotel and “hit on my wife” until she “showed his fat ass the door.”Baldwin has been married to Chynna Phillips, a singer with the band Wilson Phillips, since 1995 and the two have three children. The actor didn’t reveal what year the Plaza party occurred; Trump purchased the hotel in 1988.But Trump has publicly discussed hitting on married women. In the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape revealed in 2005, he talked about being attracted to a married woman and said he “moved on her like a bitch.” He added: “But I couldn’t get there; and she was married.” He also said that as a celebrity, “You can do anything ... grab them by the pussy.”Some 16 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Summer Zervos, a contestant on Trump’s former reality TV program, “The Apprentice,” is suing the president for defamation for calling her a liar after she accused him of groping her.The president has slammed Baldwin’s brother, Alec, a number of times on Twitter for his scorching portrayal of Trump on “Saturday Night Live.”Most Twitter responses to Donald Trump Jr.’s tweet were in the same vein as Baldwin’s, with people calling out the president’s son on his hypocrisy. One response called the president the “holy grail” of sexual impropriety."

But a nearby homeless man didn’t let her go far, telling her to climb back in the car and lock the doors while he went instead. McClure said the man, Johnny, spent his last $20 on a can of gas for her. Now, she’s trying to help him get back on his feet. While she didn’t have cash to repay him at the time, McClure told The Philadelphia Inquirer that she and her boyfriend returned to Johnny’s spot along the side of the road the next day to return the money. Over the following weeks, she kept stopping by to chat with Johnny and give him a few dollars. Finally she decided to set up a GoFundMe page for him earlier this month.“I wish that I could do more for this selfless man, who went out of his way just to help me that day,” McClure wrote on the page. “He is such a great guy, and talking to him each time I see him makes me want to help him more and more.”To date, the campaign has raised over $300,000 ― far surpassing its $10,000 goal. Many of the 10,400 donors chipped in with $10 or $20. McClure originally intended to use the funds to set Johnny up in his own apartment with some essentials and enough money to last him a few months while he looked for employment.“He is very interested in finding a job, and I believe that with a place to be able to clean up every night and get a good night’s rest, his life can get back to being normal,” she wrote. “Truly believe that all Johnny needs is one little break. Hopefully with your help I can be the one to give it to him.”Before he became homeless, McClure said Johnny served with the Marine Corps and worked as a firefighter and paramedic. She shared some photos of him from an old Facebook page.As support kept pouring in, McClure briefly suspended the campaign earlier this week on the request of Johnny, who didn’t want to take advantage of the kindness of strangers. She restarted it, however, by popular demand.Faced with a huge surplus of funding, McClure said Johnny has “more than a few ideas of where this money can go.” “He is fully aware of the world wide interest in this over the last few days,” she wrote. “It will be his decision and his decision only on what organizations and or private parties he decides to help!!”"

Over the following weeks, she kept stopping by to chat with Johnny and give him a few dollars. Finally she decided to set up a GoFundMe page for him earlier this month.“I wish that I could do more for this selfless man, who went out of his way just to help me that day,” McClure wrote on the page. “He is such a great guy, and talking to him each time I see him makes me want to help him more and more.”To date, the campaign has raised over $300,000 ― far surpassing its $10,000 goal. Many of the 10,400 donors chipped in with $10 or $20. McClure originally intended to use the funds to set Johnny up in his own apartment with some essentials and enough money to last him a few months while he looked for employment.“He is very interested in finding a job, and I believe that with a place to be able to clean up every night and get a good night’s rest, his life can get back to being normal,” she wrote. “Truly believe that all Johnny needs is one little break. Hopefully with your help I can be the one to give it to him.”Before he became homeless, McClure said Johnny served with the Marine Corps and worked as a firefighter and paramedic. She shared some photos of him from an old Facebook page.As support kept pouring in, McClure briefly suspended the campaign earlier this week on the request of Johnny, who didn’t want to take advantage of the kindness of strangers. She restarted it, however, by popular demand.Faced with a huge surplus of funding, McClure said Johnny has “more than a few ideas of where this money can go.” “He is fully aware of the world wide interest in this over the last few days,” she wrote. “It will be his decision and his decision only on what organizations and or private parties he decides to help!!”"

Right now, in America, on average our kids spend less time outdoors than prison inmates… and chickens. When I first heard that statistic from IslandWood CEO Ben Klasky, my teeth started to grind and make a nasty noise in my skull.  If you’re not the type to be motivated by that, here’s another startling fact. The average person in the most developed nation in the world spends 95% of his or her life indoors. That adds up to somewhere near 70 years indoors. For a species that benefits so much from nature, this is an unnatural state.  For many, today’s poultry-centered celebrations will be interrupted abruptly by a clarion-call to hit the malls for Black Friday.No-one is arguing that the economy should screech to a halt, only that rampant consumerism can be rebalanced. I just think it’s worth pausing to ask why we can’t take a break. There are plenty of other days for sales. Every one of those minutes spent fighting for stuff in a state of heightened, adrenaline-fueled anxiety is a minute spent away from the people (and the places) we love most.  This time is set aside for reflection and reconnection, and it should stay that way.  Being outdoors forges bonds and breaks down divides like nothing else. For REI and millions in the outdoor community, this is year three of #OptOutside. REI is shutting down all our stores and processing no sales online.On Thanksgiving and the day after, more than 12,000 REI employees are heading outdoors to spend time with family and friends (all are paid on Black Friday even though they are not working). Last year, more than 6 million people from around the country, including participating employees and anyone who loves the outdoors joined #OptOutside. Perhaps more surprisingly, 700 organizations from the for profit and non-profit sectors did the same (thank you, all).The scale of nature offers perspective. Even a short break in a local park measurably reduces stress. Doctors are prescribing outdoor time to heal. Others are onto it, too.Just yesterday, Lyft started offering people $10 off #OptOutside rides to major parks in 12 cities around the country. More than 30 state park systems have joined-in. Hundreds of events are being held by non-profits in communities around the country.  If you have experienced the transformative power of the outdoors in your life, you understand why this movement has momentum.Compare the quick fix of swiping a credit card with the sensation of being immersed in nature. Compare the fleeting high of unpacking a new pair of running shorts with the lasting feeling after a long run. Compare how you feel sifting through page after page of websites with the awe of being lost in the vastness of a forest – its sounds and smells enveloping you.  There is no comparison. One passes in an instant, the other lasts and leaves you enlivened. If you’re lucky to have experienced those moments, you will never forget them.  But not everyone has.  That’s why, for #OptOutside 2017, REI has developed free digital tools and provided inspiration and advice, attacking the barriers to getting outdoors. Nearly 20 videos created with images contributed by REI members tell the story of life outside through the eyes of people in communities all over the country.   We are digging deeper into tougher questions about the current health and future of life outdoors. In The Path Ahead, we explore nine macro trends in a 50-page publication. Topics include the link between health and the outdoors, the role of technology, urban development, the importance of access for all, the implications of our choices for the planet and, more immediately, for our kids.  The Path Ahead asserts that we do have a choice, which is what #OptOutside is really about. In a world that feels like it’s moving at warp speed, we choose to find a moment of peace to quell the overwhelming noise. To remember what matters most.  After all, it’s tough to protect something if you feel disconnected from it.For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group. "
33,POLITICS,Group Lobbying To End Trophy Hunting Ban Is Alarmingly Close With Ryan Zinke,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-safari-club_us_5a15c2dee4b025f8e93338bb,"Animal advocates fear an ""uncomfortably cozy and even improper"" relationship.",2017-11-23,Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke signs an order in early March to overturn a federal ban on hunting with lead ammunition.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b882f71500002100abcde0.jpeg?cache=q285R08KuJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Along with receiving thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Safari Club International while running for Congress, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke spoke at the hunting advocacy group’s 2016 veterans breakfast, had a notable photo-op with its director of litigation on his first day as head of the Interior Department, and dined with its vice president in Alaska earlier this year. The appropriateness of the relationship has come into question after the Interior Department lifted Obama-era bans on importing elephant and lion trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia.Last week, SCI announced via a celebratory news release that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had begun issuing permits for American hunters to import elephants killed for sport in the two African countries. SCI and the National Rifle Association had sued to block that ban in 2014.President Donald Trump put the import permits on hold Friday ― reversing his own administration’s decision just minutes after the Fish and Wildlife Service released an official announcement.But before that, Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of The Humane Society of the United States, called the announcement of the reauthorized permits “jarring.” That it was made by SCI “suggests an uncomfortably cozy and even improper relationship between trophy hunting interests and the Department of the Interior,” he added in a blog post last week.Founded in 1972, SCI is an advocacy group with more than 50,000 members that focuses on “protecting hunters’ rights and promoting wildlife conservation.” It has been criticized for giving out awards — with names like “Grand Slam African 29,” “African Big Five” and “Bears of the World” — to hunters who kill exotic and sometimes threatened species, like elephants, rhinos and polar bears. SCI’s support for Zinke, an avid hunter whose office features a slew of taxidermied creatures, dates back to at least 2014, when the native Montanan first ran for the U.S. House of Representatives. The group’s political action committee donated a total $13,500 to Zinke’s 2014 and 2016 congressional campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission data. During the 2016 election cycle, SCI was one of Zinke’s top 20 contributors, according to data compiled OpenSecrets.org. And only one candidate, Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R-Maine), received more money from the group.In February 2016, during his first term in Congress, Zinke was a featured speaker at SCI’s annual veterans breakfast, where he “expressed his support of SCI and all the veterans they serve, then [led] the room in the Pledge of Allegiance,” according to a release by the group. SCI endorsed Zinke in the election later that year. SCI celebrated last December when Trump tapped Zinke to lead the Interior Department — an agency that manages some 500 million acres of federal land, including the 59 national parks. The former Navy SEAL “has stood with hunters for greater access and for wildlife conservation policies based on sound science instead of emotion,” SCI President Larry Higgins said at the time.The group urged hunters to phone their senators and encourage them to support Zinke’s nomination. And it applauded his confirmation in early March. A day after being sworn in, Zinke signed a pair of hunter-focused secretarial orders. One overturned a federal ban on using lead ammunition and fishing tackle on Fish and Wildlife Service lands, including wildlife refuges. The other was aimed at expanding hunting, fishing and recreation access on federal lands.At the signing ceremony at department headquarters in Washington, D.C., Zinke was flanked by representatives of nearly 20 outdoor and pro-hunting groups. SCI was, as the group described in a release, “front and center.” “SCI’s Director of Litigation, Anna Seidman, had a prime spot, right at Secretary Zinke’s elbow, to witness the signing of these important orders for the hunting community,” SCI wrote on its website. A little more than two months after being sworn in, Zinke was scheduled to deliver remarks at SCI’s annual “Lobby Day,” a day of meetings with legislators that coincided with the group’s monthly board meeting. According to SCI, other Interior Department officials took Zinke’s place after he was pulled away on official business related to Trump’s executive orders threatening 27 of America’s national monuments.After the event, SCI wrote in a report on its website that it was “obvious” that the department officials who attended “understood the value that SCI brings to the table in helping them to execute their missions.” Less than a month later, Zinke met face-to-face with the group’s vice president, Eddie Grasser, according to documents obtained by the Western Values Project through a Freedom of Information Act request. After swinging by a fundraiser for Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) at a steakhouse in Anchorage, Zinke and several staff and security had dinner at a local brewery with Grasser and John Stacey, president of the Alaska Professional Hunters Association. The reservation was for 14 people. The purpose of the meeting is unclear. Neither the Interior Department nor SCI responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. As Zinke has prioritized energy development over conservation, a number of hunting and fishing groups that came out as early supporters, including a few present at the March signing ceremony, have grown frustrated with him. But SCI has remained a loyal ally, even supporting Zinke’s controversial, oil-friendly order targeting an Obama-era conservation plan for the greater sage grouse. SCI supports amending the Antiquities Act — signed by President Theodore Roosevelt more than a century ago — in order to strip away presidents’ power to unilaterally designate national monuments. Zinke has said the act has “become a tool of political advocacy rather than public interest.” And he has recommended Trump shrinking or otherwise weakening at least 10 existing national monuments, according to a leaked copy of the report Zinke submitted to the White House in late August. While there is plenty to suggest there is a strong alliance, the recent decision by Zinke’s agency regarding trophy hunting stands out. Greg Sheehan, principal deputy director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, broke the news to SCI during the African Wildlife Consultative Forum in Tanzania, an agency spokesperson told HuffPost last week. The forum, which ended Friday, was hosted by the Safari Club International Foundation and the United Republic of Tanzania.Facing immediate backlash, Trump suspended his own administration’s decision shortly thereafter. And in a post to Twitter on Sunday, the president called trophy hunting a “horror show” and said he’s unlikely to allow for such imports. Citing White House aides, The New York Times reported Monday that Trump learned of the reauthorized import permits via news reports and had not been involved in the decision.“I, personally, absolutely think this is a Zinke thing,” Tanya Sanerib, a senior attorney with the conservation group Center for Biological Diversity, told HuffPost. She noted Zinke’s installation of a “Big Buck Hunter” arcade game in the cafeteria of Interior Department headquarters, a bizarre attempt to highlight the contributions the hunting and fishing communities make to conservation. “He seems to be well-embedded with the sport hunting crowd,” Sanerib said. “And obviously, this is something Safari Club has had at the top of their list.” The Center for Biological Diversity and the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Trump administration in an effort to maintain the Obama-era bans on importing elephants and lions. In a letter to Trump on Monday, SCI ran to Zinke’s defense, saying he and the Fish and Wildlife Service “made crucial, scientifically supported determinations about hunting and the U.S. importation of African elephants from Zimbabwe and Zambia.” “By supporting Secretary’s Zinke’s authorization of import permits, you can reverse the senseless acts perpetrated by the Obama administration against hunting and the sustainable use conservation of African wildlife,” the letter reads. The announcement about elephant trophy imports came just days after Zinke announced the creation of an International Wildlife Conservation Council to advise him on “the benefits that international recreational hunting has on foreign wildlife and habitat conservation, anti-poaching and illegal wildlife trafficking programs.” The 18 members of the council, who have not yet been selected, will work to expedite the process of importing sport-hunted wildlife. It seems likely that SCI, the NRA and other industry groups will have seats on the council.In an op-ed published last week by National Geographic, Katarzyna Nowak, a conservation scientist affiliated with the zoology department at the University of the Free State, Qwaqwa, in South Africa, expressed alarm at the news.“The U.S. role in international treaties concerning wildlife conservation will be inexorably weakened once the fox guards the hen house, in which are the hallowed species Americans have chosen to legally protect,” she wrote.

38,POLITICS,There’s A Reason Powerful Americans Love To Attack Black Sports Figures,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-america-black-athletes_us_5a15db6ce4b064948072a8c4,Donald Trump is just keeping with a long tradition in this country.,2017-11-23,"Trump has feuded with LaVar Ball, the father of one of the UCLA players arrested on suspicion of shoplifting in China earlier this month. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a15dd1d1400001f00b6972a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Powerful white Americans have been scoring political points off black athletes for as long as there have been organized sports in America. In this respect, at least, Donald Trump is a traditionalist.On Wednesday, Trump renewed his feud with LaVar Ball, the father of one of three UCLA players arrested in China on suspicion of shoplifting early this month. Ball stands accused of showing insufficient gratitude to the president for having secured the release of his son, along with the other players.Over the weekend, Trump returned to another hobbyhorse of his, blasting Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch for refusing to stand for the U.S. national anthem before a game in Mexico City on Sunday. Lynch, the president noted (while calling for Lynch’s suspension), had stood for the Mexican anthem at the same game. In Wednesday morning’s string of tweets, Trump also continued to slam the NFL’s handling of the protests against racial inequality that began with former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick last year.Ball and Lynch, like the other sports-related figures who have drawn Trump’s ire, are black. The president is merely working from a familiar playbook: He’s goosing his small but fervent base of supporters by attacking black sports figures who have dared to cross him. Trump, as he has in the past, would surely declare that there is no racial motivation to his criticism, but all the familiar code words are there. Ball is an “ungrateful fool,” Trump said. Lynch showed “great disrespect” to a country that has allowed him to become a wealthy professional football player.If this has become a familiar routine for Trump, it is because it is a familiar one for America. The country has never been comfortable with assertive black sports figures. Despite all the caterwauling about athletes who refuse to “stick to sports,” powerful Americans have always understood the mere presence of black athletes to be fundamentally political, a threat to the larger project of black subordination. And if black athletes themselves could no longer be kept out of sports, the culture at large would have to circumscribe their behavior, crush any outward assertiveness, segregate their blackness.By the time slavery was abolished, professional baseball had a number of black players and teams who competed capably against and alongside whites, and the sport had already taken on political significance: in 1859, a liberal Republican congressman from Ohio appeared in an integrated game to protest slavery and segregation.Whereas some newspapers at the time saw the game as capable of promulgating the destruction of racial and social barriers, baseball in the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw itself as part of the effort “to preserve a familiar social order” dominated by whites. So shortly after the Civil War, one of the first bans on black players was enacted against the Philadelphia Pythians, an all-black team formed in 1867. By the end of the 1880s, baseball fully mirrored and advanced the horrors of Jim Crow society around it, with “gentlemen’s agreements” between white owners and players that prohibited the signing of black players.The founders of the Pythians, who found success against some of Philadelphia’s all-white teams, saw baseball as “literally another field upon which African Americans could assert their skills and independence, and prove their right to full citizenship and equality.” But the National Association of Base Ball Players, in implementing the ban against the Pythians and any team that had a black player, thwarted that effort, arguing that “if colored clubs were admitted there would be, in all probability, some division of feeling, whereas by excluding them no injury could result to anyone.”The ban, the association said, could also help the Philadelphia baseball convention, where the decision to ban black players was made, avoid “the discussion of any subject having a political bearing.” That is, the popular “stick to sports” refrain was used more than a century ago as part of an effort to eradicate black men from professional baseball, segregating them from a sport that was fast becoming one of America’s most culturally and economically relevant industries.Black baseball still thrived, but the ban, which came even earlier than the Supreme Court’s Plessy v. Ferguson ruling that institutionalized segregation across America, helped set the stage for the sort of separate-but-equal mantra that plagued the country for decades. Baseball became a tool for segregating public spaces, too: Georgia, for instance, passed a statute that prohibited black and white people from playing the sport at public parks within two blocks of each other.Where baseball beat America to re-codifying segregation into law, the other major sport of the time ― boxing ― followed it, and did so even more directly. Jack Johnson, the black boxing champion, became an avatar of black brutality and menace who, in the eyes of white America, required direct political action to counter. Johnson became the first black heavyweight champion in 1908; four years later, Georgia Rep. Seaborn Roddenbery introduced an anti-miscegenation constitutional amendment that specifically cited Johnson ― who was twice married to white women ― as an example of the “villainous character” and “atrocious qualities” of interracial marriage. (It never became law, but state anti-miscegenation laws weren’t fully repealed until the Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional in 1967.)Even before Johnson won his title, a black boxer named Joe Gans pummeled a white fighter to win the light heavyweight championship in Baltimore. In response, the city moved to reform its boxing laws, and banned black and white fighters from meeting each other in the ring, as author Lou Moore wrote in his 2017 book about the history of black boxing, I Fight for a Living.Baltimore was, at the time, one of America’s blackest cities, and “whites feared that the combination of Gans’s championship status, his standing in the black community, and prowess in the ring would have a damaging effect on their ability to control black citizens,” Moore wrote. “Baltimore could not be a ‘White Man’s City’ with a black champion who beat up white men.”Similar bans were enacted after black boxing victories in Louisiana, Missouri, Los Angeles and Louisville, Kentucky, among other cities and states, all in an effort to limit black participation in sports, local communities and politics, as Moore documents in his book. By 1910, the bans on white vs. black boxing matches had even spread to Great Britain, where politicians feared such matches “could incite black unrest in the empire and erode the mythology of white supremacy.”The point of all of this was easy to see: if black athletes could assert themselves in the ring or on the baseball field, black people could assert themselves everywhere else, too. If black athletes weren’t forced to stay in their place, black people wouldn’t be compelled, either. And so laws were passed, and policies were implemented, to ensure the absence of black athletes who could give voice to black people.Baseball’s color barrier, of course, collapsed in 1947, and boxing’s most discriminatory policies were either abandoned or thrown out in courts. So the methods of limiting black expression in sports evolved: Muhammad Ali was sentenced to prison and stripped of his title for being a black man who refused to fight in the Vietnam War. The U.S. Olympic Committee, amid political and societal outrage, kicked Tommie Smith and John Carlos off the Olympic team after their Black Power salute at the 1968 Mexico City Games. Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Craig Hodges were ostracized and blackballed from the NBA for protesting America’s racial inequalities, much as Kaepernick has been today.Trump’s method of breathless tweetstorms may be new. But his demands are the same ones white America has always made. LaVar Ball and the UCLA basketball players must either display quiet fealty to the president, or get told they should be imprisoned in China. Marshawn Lynch should stand for the national anthem, and Jemele Hill refrain from criticizing the president, or face immediate calls for their firing.Black sports figures must always know their place, so that black Americans will, too.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Tommie Smith and John Carlos were stripped of their medals.

But immigration officials and local police entered the facility on Thursday, according to media reports and videos, aggressively shouting at holdouts to leave.Some of the men at the center were reportedly in need of medical help during the encounter, and others said authorities were destroying their property in an attempt to make them leave.“Immigration and police started searching the rooms and are saying ‘Move, Move,’ you only have an hour to move,” Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist and asylum seeker inside the detention center, wrote on Twitter. “Too much stress and tension here in Delta. Some refugees are crying.”Australia, by law, refuses to resettle any migrants who attempt to travel to the country by boat to seek asylum, an attempt to discourage people from making the dangerous and often deadly crossing. The Australian government had paid Papua New Guinea to house hundreds of detainees captured at sea since 2013 at the Manus Island detention center but announced earlier this year that it would close the controversial facility on Oct. 31.More than 400 people were inside the facility before authorities began storming it on Thursday, a mix of recognized refugees and people still seeking political asylum.Last month, access to water, electricity and food at the center was cut off, and Australia said those still in the facility would need to move to another in a nearby town, but hundreds of the men refused. Conditions quickly deteriorated at the center, and on Wednesday the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said the event was a “manmade and entirely preventable humanitarian crisis.”“It is a damning indictment of a policy meant to avoid Australia’s international obligations,” Nai Jit Lam, the UNHCR’s deputy regional representative for Australia, said. “Australia has in effect created and then abandoned a humanitarian crisis at the doorstep of the international community.” On Thursday, Australia’s immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said he believed it was “outrageous” that people were still living at the Manus facility after the government attempted to close it.“They’ve trashed the facility. They’re living in squalor,” Dutton told local radio station 2GB. “The Australian taxpayers have paid about $10 million for a new facility and we want people to move.”Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called on the men to move peacefully to the new center.“They should do so in accordance with the lawful directs of Papua New Guinea,” he said.Dominic Kakas, a spokesman for Papua New Guinea police, told Australia’s Fairfax Media that around 50 people were at the center “just talking to people and getting them to move out.” Kakas said authorities were destroying rainwater tanks in an effort to prevent a health crisis.“We just don’t understand why they are refusing to move. The longer they stay, people might get sick and die,” he said.The ongoing situation on Manus and at another detention center on the island country of Nauru have become contentious political issues in Australia, sparking a string of protests, including a rally that effectively shut down parts of Melbourne earlier this month.Some have launched ongoing calls for Turnbull to allow the detainees to resettle in the country. He has repeatedly refused, saying the strict policies have curbed dangerous immigration practices.New Zealand’s new prime minister, Jacinda Arden, has offered to accept 150 people under a deal brokered by her predecessor, but the Australian government has been reluctant to accept that pledge, with Turnbull saying it could open a “back door” into his country."

Hundreds of civilians ― more than half of them children ― have died from food and medication shortages since the start of the siege, the Syrian Network for Human Rights said in a report last month.The regime has intensified its blockade in recent months, preventing its own desolate citizens from fleeing and denying access to urgently needed aid supplies.

42,WORLD NEWS,Video Of Migrants Sold In Apparent Slave Auction In Libya Provokes Outrage Worldwide,Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/video-slave-auction-migrants-libya_us_5a161d56e4b064948072e9f3,"“I am horrified,” the UN secretary-general said.",2017-11-23,"Migrants from Africa who are trying to reach Europe walk toward a detention center off the coastal town of Guarabouli, Libya, on July 8.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a161eb6140000553950ef10.jpeg?cache=epm047Yp1X&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After a video surfaced showing migrants apparently being sold at auction in Libya, people worldwide have been calling for action. Last week, CNN published a report on modern slavery in Libya, featuring a video that reportedly was shot in August and appeared to show a man selling African migrants for farm work. “Big strong boys,” the man said in the video, according to a CNN narrator. “400 … 700 … 800,” he called out the mounting prices. The men were eventually sold for about $400 each, CNN reported. The Libyan government said it has launched an investigation into slave auctions in the country. Following the CNN report, demonstrators took to the streets in Paris and other cities last week to express their outrage, and Libyans showed their solidarity on Twitter with the hashtag #LibyansAgainstSlavery. Several world leaders spoke out as well. The chairman of the African Union, Guinean President Alpha Condé, called it a “despicable trade ... from another era” on Friday. The U.N. Support Mission in Libya said Wednesday that it was “dismayed and sickened,” and is “actively pursuing” the matter with Libyan authorities.“I am horrified at news reports and video footage showing African migrants in Libya reportedly being sold as slaves,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said to reporters on Monday. “Slavery has no place in our world, and these actions are among the most egregious abuses of human rights and may amount to crimes against humanity.”Guterres called for the international community to unite in fighting the abuse and smuggling of migrants, notably by increasing avenues for legal migration and enhancing international cooperation in cracking down on smugglers and traffickers.However, rights advocates caution that real action may be slow in coming. “People are rightfully outraged,” Human Rights Watch researcher Hanan Salah told Reuters of CNN’s video on Monday. “But don’t hold your breath that anything real is going to happen.”There are more than 45 million people worldwide who are victims of modern slavery, including forced labor and human trafficking, according to a September report from the human rights group Walk Free Foundation.In Libya, migrants have become particularly vulnerable to human trafficking. The country functions as the main gateway for Africans to reach Europe, but it is also one of the world’s most unstable, mired in conflict since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed in 2011.Hundreds of thousands of migrants fleeing poverty or conflict travel to Libya each year, hoping to set off from the country’s coast to Europe. Once in Libya, they find themselves at the mercy of smugglers operating the dangerous boat passages across the Mediterranean. Operating without many constraints, smuggling networks have adopted ruthless methods ― often killing, torturing, extorting and detaining migrants at will. The Libyan government does not have the means nor the commitment to crack down. European countries’ efforts to keep migrants from their own borders have forced the travelers to take ever greater risks to reach the continent. “To end the slave trade we need to stop human smuggling,” William Lacy Swing, director general of the International Organization for Migration, said Thursday. “You do that by destroying their business model. And you do that by ... decriminalizing migration and encouraging migration that is documented, safe and secure for all.”"
43,POLITICS,Rep. Joe Barton’s Explicit Photo Leak Could Be Revenge Porn,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-barton-revenge-porn_us_5a171883e4b0d4906caddd94,"The Texas Republican’s sexts don’t appear to be non-consensual, though posting them online certainly was.",2017-11-23,Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) is one of the most senior Republicans in the House. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a17190f140000cc4350f083.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), who apologized on Wednesday after an explicit photo of him circulated on Twitter, could be the victim of revenge porn, according to a top legal expert. The congressman, who said Capitol Police are investigating the case, appears to have sent the photo, along with other images, to a woman with whom he had a consensual sexual relationship. If the person who posted lewd images of the congressman is in Texas, where Barton represents a suburb of Dallas, it would be a “clear cut” violation of the state’s 2015 law criminalizing revenge porn, said Mark Zaid, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer.“Legally speaking, as far as I’m concerned, Congressman Barton is a victim,” Zaid, who has handled revenge porn cases, told HuffPost by phone on Thursday.Barton’s spokesman did not immediately reply to a HuffPost email requesting comment on Thursday. In an interview published Wednesday in The Washington Post, an unnamed woman who said she had two sexual encounters with Barton, 68, over five years claimed he sent her intimate photos, videos and text messages. She said she did not post the photo ― a selfie from a low angle, showing Barton’s penis, belly and face ― but did share it with other people. The right-wing conspiracy theory site InfoWars posted a video of Barton masturbating, which the unnamed woman also showed to The Washington Post, but the video appears to have taken it down. Revenge porn refers to intimate photos posted online without the subject’s consent, often in retaliation after a consensual relationship ends negatively. California became the first state to make publishing revenge porn a crime in 2013. Now 38 states, plus the District of Columbia, outlaw revenge porn. The New York Senate passed a bill in June that would make revenge porn illegal, and the New York City Council voted this month to do the same, though neither has been signed into law. Barton’s case comes during a time of intense scrutiny toward the personal sexual interactions of powerful men. Dozens of men ― including star Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, comedian Louis C.K. and Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) ― have been accused of sexually harassing, assaulting, groping or raping women, particularly younger women over whose careers they wielded significant influence.Unless new details emerge that shift the narrative of Barton’s behavior in the relationship, his case marks a reversal of the typical pattern for revenge porn, in which men usually publish images in retribution, or extort money from the victims by threatening to post photos or videos. In the most recent high-profile case of alleged revenge porn, reality TV star Rob Kardashian posted explicit photos of a woman he claimed was Blac Chyna, his ex-girlfriend, amid a relationship feud. “The law is gender neutral and the law should be enforced equally,” Zaid said. “Everyone should be just as incensed that this would happen to an older male as they would to a younger woman.”He added: “You can factor in the morality and the politics of the situation and come to a different determination of how much empathy you want to give.” The woman who received the images from Barton said she began a friendship with him in 2011 after he started messaging her on Facebook about shared political interests. He soon began to flirt, she told The Washington Post, and became sexually explicit: “He says to me, ‘Do you want me to send you a picture of myself?’ I said, ‘Oh no, no. Please do not do that.’ It kind of started there.”In 2012, she met him in Washington, and they had sex. She met him again in Texas in 2014, where they had sex for a second and final time, she told the newspaper.In 2015 ― the same year Texas banned revenge porn ― Barton threatened to call Capitol Police on her if she shared the images. According to a transcript of the phone call posted by The Washington Post, he said:“I would tell them that I had a three-year undercover relationship with you over the internet that was heavily sexual and that I had met you twice while married and had sex with you on two different occasions and that I exchanged inappropriate photographs and videos with you that I wouldn’t like to be seen made public, that you still apparently had all of those and were in position to use them in a way that would negatively affect my career. That’s the truth.”On Wednesday, Barton issued a statement saying reports in The Dallas Morning News and The Washington Post offered “evidence” of a “potential crime against me.” He said Capitol Police offered to launch an investigation, and he accepted.“This woman admitted that we had a consensual relationship,” Barton said in the statement. “When I ended that relationship, she threatened to publicly share my private photographs and intimate correspondence in retaliation.”The former chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who now serves as vice chairman of the panel, is the fifth-longest-serving Republican in the House of Representatives. Now on his 17th term, he made a name for himself as a close ally to the oil and gas industry, earning the nickname “Smokey Joe.”He’s a member of the Freedom Caucus, and boasts 100 percent ratings from conservative groups like the Family Research Council and the Christian Coalition for America for his opposition to abortion and LGBTQ rights. In 2010, Barton backed a policy platform that called for re-criminalizing sodomy in Texas. The woman told The Washington Post she came forward to expose the congressman’s hypocrisy for advocating conservative family values while courting women online amid the dissolution of his second marriage. “It’s not normal for a member of Congress who runs on a GOP platform of family values and conservatism to be scouring the internet looking for a new sexual liaison,” she said. The leaked photos raise concerns about congressional security protocols, said Zaid, who works on national security issues. If a foreign intelligence officer had wooed the congressman into sharing compromising photos, then threatened to reveal them unless the lawmaker took actions favorable to the other country, “we could have had a much worse situation,” he said. “Are the security offices in Congress addressing in any way this continuing concern that its members ― no pun intended ― are exposing themselves to potential blackmail by a foreign adversary? Is that being addressed at all?” Zaid said. “Because if not, it needs to be.” "

Flynn’s lawyers had been cooperating with Trump’s legal team, as defense teams often do, but recently notified the White House they could no longer discuss the investigation.Such a move isn’t a definite sign Flynn is negotiating some sort of agreement. The Times report was based on information from four people familiar with the case, whose identities could not be revealed as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.Flynn resigned from the Trump’s administration in February after it was revealed he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. He has long had associations with Russia and sat next to President Vladimir Putin at a dinner in Moscow in 2015.NBC News reported this month that Mueller’s team had enough evidence to bring charges against Flynn and his son, Michael G. Flynn, who served as his father’s chief of staff during the campaign.The elder Flynn had previously signaled that he would not cooperate with a Senate intelligence committee investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in May. But the Times notes he may move to work with Mueller in an effort to save his son.His cooperation would provide insight about Trump’s campaign and his early days in the White House.Mueller’s probe snagged its first targets last month, when former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Richard Gates, were indicted on charges of conspiracy and money laundering. Both have pleaded not guilty."
46,POLITICS,FCC Commissioner Pleads: 'Please Stop Us From Killing Net Neutrality',Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rosenworcel-net-neutrality-fcc_us_5a16e240e4b0cee6c04e8a40,The FCC plans to vote on a plan to eliminate net neutrality next month.,2017-11-23,"Jessica Rosenworcel speaks during an open meeting in Washington, D.C., last Thursday. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a16e33c150000413e8599a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the Federal Communications Commission’s top five officials has urged Americans to “make a ruckus” in response to the agency’s plan to vote next month on a policy to gut net neutrality. In an op-ed published Wednesday in the Los Angeles Times, FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel issued an urgent plea for the public to call or write to the FCC before the Dec. 14 vote.“Reach out to the rest of the FCC now,” wrote Rosenworcel, who served as a commissioner under the Obama administration from 2012 to 2017 and was unanimously confirmed to return under Chairman Ajit Pai in August. “Tell them they can’t take away internet openness without a fight.”Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers can’t offer faster speeds and access to websites that pay them more, meaning that juggernauts like Netflix and Facebook are essentially treated equally to smaller companies. In February 2015, the FCC adopted new rules to preserve net neutrality, classifying broadband providers as public utilities like electricity or phone companies under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.Opponents of net neutrality, including Comcast, AT&T and Verizon ― which owns HuffPost’s parent company, Oath ― argue that services such as Netflix and Amazon should have to pay more for the disproportionately high bandwidth they use. During peak hours in North America in 2015, Netflix used over one- third of internet data received by computers. That number has since declined as Amazon and other streaming services have gained market share.Republicans opposed the Obama-era net neutrality rule. On Tuesday, Pai released his long-expected proposal to reverse the policy, calling the 2015 regulations “politically motivated” and based on “a misguided and flawed interpretation.”But Rosenworcel says Pai’s proposal is a “lousy idea,” writing that “it deserves a heated response from the millions of Americans who work and create online every day.”“There is something not right about a few unelected FCC officials making such vast determinations about the future of the internet,” she added. “I’m not alone in thinking this.”Earlier this year, the FCC received more than 22 million comments on the rule, most supporting repeal. But more than 80 percent of them were sent by bots, according to an analysis by the data analytics company Gravwell. The 17.4 percent determined to be authentic were “overwhelmingly in support of net neutrality regulations,” the company said. On Wednesday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman publicly criticized the FCC for refusing to turn over evidence of fake comments to his office, which is investigating. “When they do this, they will likely find that, outside of a cadre of high-paid lobbyists and lawyers in Washington, there isn’t a constituency that likes this proposal,” Rosenworcel wrote. “In fact, the FCC will probably discover that they have angered the public and caused them to question just whom the agency works for.”Repealing the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rule would notch a win for monopolistic companies that are already wield tremendous market power. Unlike in other countries, where companies compete in local markets to offer the fastest or cheapest services, internet providers in the U.S. enjoy near monopolies in local markets. As a result, the U.S. is far behind other developed countries in high-speed internet access, which is severely limited in poor rural areas. “You go girl!” Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic presidential nominee, wrote in a tweet promoting Rosenworcel’s op-ed. “This is important; costs will go up, & powerful companies will get more powerful. We can’t let it slip through the cracks.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the majority of the comments to the FCC as opposed to repeal. Most of the comments, in large part from bots, favored repealing net neutrality rules."

In the days immediately after Hurricane Maria hit the island in September, leaving still much of its population without power, the Spanish-American chef arrived to help build a network that includes kitchens, food supply chains and delivery services for those in need. Both he and his organization, World Central Kitchen, have remained on the island for the past eight weeks, he tweeted Wednesday.According to World Central Kitchen’s website, more than 2.3 million meals have been prepared for Puerto Ricans through their chefs and volunteers.As The New York Times reported last month, no other single agency, including the Red Cross and Salvation Army, has fed more people freshly cooked food as Andrés’s group has since the storm hit.“Every day I have this personal anxiety inside,” Andrés told the Times. “We only came here to try to help a few thousand because nobody had a plan to feed Puerto Rico, and we opened the biggest restaurant in the world in a week. That’s how crazy this is.”In a video message on Wednesday, Andrés welcomed volunteers to join him and his crew as they continue to help the people in need.“You want to make gravy? Come to Puerto Rico!” he said.In another video, he asked the public to remember those who are less fortunate on this Thanksgiving and give thanks to those who are working both in the U.S. and around the world to make a positive difference.

52,GREEN,Anti-Pipeline Activist Found Guilty After Being Barred From Mentioning Climate Change,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/valve-turner-protest-pipeline-leonard-higgins_us_5a171e07e4b0d4906cade139,"Leonard Higgins, the ""valve turner"" who shut down a tar sands pipeline in Montana last year, was found guilty of a felony charge on Wednesday.",2017-11-23,"A tar sands operation near Fort McMurray, Alberta, as seen in 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1725ac140000cc4350f092.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After a short trial lasting just a day and a half, climate activist and retiree Leonard Higgins was found guilty on Wednesday of a serious felony charge for his role in the “valve turner” protest last year that resulted in the brief shutdown of a tar sands pipeline in Montana.The 65-year-old former state worker from Portland, Oregon, said he’d carried out the protest to raise awareness about the dangers of climate change. Higgins and his defense team, however, were barred from referring to climate change during the trial.Last October, Higgins was one of five climate activists who coordinated efforts to stop tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada, from flowing over the Canadian-U.S. border. He cut two chains to enter a fenced enclosure in Coal Banks Landing in Montana to turn off the emergency shutoff valve on a Spectra Energy pipeline. The four other activists successfully shut off four pipelines in Minnesota, North Dakota and Washington state, thus temporarily halting the flow of Alberta tar sands oil into the U.S.During his trial, Higgins, an activist with Climate Direct Action, told a Montana district court that his goal had not been to cause major damage to the pipeline but to raise awareness about the threat of climate change.“It’s my obligation to my kids,” he told the Great Falls Tribune on Tuesday.Higgins’ defense attorney noted in court that Spectra had been notified about 15 minutes in advance that the valve shutdown was imminent. After turning off the valve, Higgins stayed onsite, awaiting arrest.On Wednesday, a jury found Higgins guilty of misdemeanor trespassing and felony criminal mischief after just an hour of deliberation, reported the Corvallis Gazette-Times. The jury determined that Higgins had caused more than $1,500 in damage to Spectra Energy (recently acquired by Enbridge Inc.).Higgins’ sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 2. He faces a potential maximum penalty of 10 years behind bars and fines of up to $50,000.Activists say the jury was not given the full picture of Higgins’ motivations since mentions of climate change were off-limits during his trial.In a statement sent to HuffPost, Steve Kent, a spokesman for Climate Direct Action, explained that Higgins had hoped to present a “necessity defense,” which would have allowed him to argue before the jury that “his action was necessary in order to prevent climate harms much more severe than the consequences of trespassing and turning the pipeline emergency valve.”However, Judge Daniel Boucher denied this motion without a hearing, saying that “the energy policy of the United States is not on trial.” That meant Higgins could not discuss or provide evidence of climate change in court. As Kent noted, a Minnesota judge recently allowed a similar climate necessity defense in the trial of some of Higgins’ fellow valve turners. “I think it’s a sensible ruling that will allow the jurors to take into consideration all of the information that they really need to rule on this case properly,” Marla Marcum, director of the Climate Disobedience Center, told Inside Climate News in reaction to the Minnesota judge’s decision. After his conviction on Wednesday, Higgins, who is free on bail pending his sentencing, said he was “disappointed and surprised” by the verdict and that he intends to appeal.“I’m happy for the opportunity to share why I had to shut down this pipeline, and I really appreciate the time and dedication of the jury and the judge,” Higgins said outside the courthouse. “I was disappointed and surprised by the verdict, but even more disappointed that I was not allowed a ‘necessity defense,’ and that I wasn’t allowed to talk about climate change as it related to my state of mind. When I tried to talk about why I did what I did, I was silenced.”According to the Gazette-Times, about 40 climate activists, including three of Higgins’ fellow valve turners, were at the courthouse on Wednesday to offer their support.Commenting on Higgins’ verdict, valve turner Michael Foster, who is awaiting sentencing after being convicted on two felonies in a North Dakota court for his role in the protest, said he still feels optimistic.“We win even when we lose because we get stronger,” Foster told the Gazette-Times. “What did Gandhi say? First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you. And then you win.” According to Greenpeace, Alberta’s tar sands industry produces some of the world’s “dirtiest” oil — with each barrel resulting in three to four times as much greenhouse gas emissions as regular crude oil. A 2013 report by Ecofys concluded that Canada’s tar sands ranked fifth among the world’s 14 largest carbon intensive projects."
53,ENTERTAINMENT,How ‘Mudbound’ Director Dee Rees Convinced Mary J. Blige To Join Her Cast,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dee-rees-mudbound_us_5a146b8ae4b09650540dc78b,"”For me, it was a long shot. It was a Hail Mary. But she said yes.”",2017-11-22,"Dee Rees directs Mary J. Blige on the set of ""Mudbound.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a148289140000602b50eacd.jpeg?cache=RpkfWTKh7m&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"“Mudbound,” a sprawling, ambitious drama that debuted on Netflix and in select theaters last Friday, has earned its director, Dee Rees, a deserved crown.Rees’ first movie, the 2011 coming-of-age jewel “Pariah,” was a festival hit that netted her an Independent Spirit Award and a small but devoted audience. She followed that with 2015′s “Bessie,” the Emmy-winning HBO movie about famed blues singer Bessie Smith. Both showcase a filmmaker with a sharp eye for the nuances of human connection, but “Mudbound” is in a class of its own, chronicling two families ― one black, one white ― on a dusty plantation in World War II–era Mississippi. Racial stratification plagues everyday existence on and off their farmstead, especially once the clans’ sons (played by Jason Mitchell and Garrett Hedlund) become friends. Rees, who adapted Hillary Jordan’s novel of the same name with “ER” writer Virgil Williams, weaves numerous characters’ perspectives together to create a searing, audacious masterwork. None of Netflix’s original releases have secured acting, directing or writing nominations from the Oscars, but the acclaim that has greeted “Mudbound” could help to end the streaming service’s dry spell. I talked to Rees in New York in October ― right as awards-season campaigns were first escalating ― about portraying the Jim Crow South, working with Mary J. Blige and the films she thinks are worthy of history classes.“Mudbound” was among the toasts of this year’s Sundance Film Festival. It felt very much like your moment in particular ― you were no longer just a director on the rise. Did you feel those good vibes, too?So that’s exactly why I love doing press. My partner, Sheila, filters stuff to me, or friends will send me bits and pieces. But to me, I try to keep focused on the work and be sobered by the fact that it’s not a meritocracy, this world. If things happen, great. If they don’t, great. At the end of the day, I think, just as a maker, just as an artist, hopefully this makes my way a little bit easier. Or it makes the way of someone else a little bit easier. Or it it’ll make some film exec go watch shorts programs at festivals instead of going to the gala. To me, that would be the big thing ― for the studio system in general to do more interesting material. Go to shorts programs and find a voice there that you’re interested in and make their next film. It’s a reminder that discovery is the thing.“Pariah” is a micro-budget indie movie that won incredible acclaim and found a second wind in streaming. Maybe the average moviegoer isn’t familiar with it, but in certain circles it’s a very big deal. Were the doors that opened to you after “Pariah” the ones you hoped would open?I feel like they opened in that I never stopped working. Did the kind of doors open for me that would have happened if another maker made that film? Probably not. You know what I mean? But after “Pariah,” I never wasn’t working in film. Part of it was this deal for Focus Features. I wrote a script for them about a detective ― a Memphis cop ― that they didn’t produce because it wasn’t, you know, big enough. But I got a feature script, and then I got a job writing “Bessie.” It was this whole thing where someone was like, “Oh, wait, actually do you want to direct it? This is written so specifically.” It’s kind of like “Pariah” opened doors. I wrote a pilot for HBO for Viola Davis. It didn’t get produced, but I was always writing, so I was blessed in that, since January 2011, I’ve never stopped working. I’m kind of pushing along on my own. Lee Daniels gave me my first shot in TV.Did you do an episode of “Empire”?Yeah, in the second season. It was when it was still new. Lee, like, bullied me into the studio and was like, “Dee is doing this.” I feel like “Pariah” was a blessing. I feel like all of us from that film work. It launched Bradford Young as a DP.That’s right. He got an Oscar nomination this year for “Arrival.”Yeah! Exactly. And Adepero Oduye. So “Pariah” launched all of us, I think, in different ways. I’m grateful for the fact that I kept working, that I could build up street cred. It becomes this cumulative effect thing that happens.Here we are talking on National Coming Out Day …Yeah, but then the Mississippi religious freedom act goes into effect today, too.That’s the way it works, I suppose. But with “Pariah,” you made a movie that’s like a warm blanket in its ability to speak to young queer people’s experiences. And now, with “Mudbound,” you’ve made something far more sweeping. It has a large ensemble, its topicality is grander. What does it mean to you to have given people movies that speak to their history?I think I’m realizing now that, thematically, there are these ideas that I keep returning back to. Because for me, in many ways, “Mudbound” is about not being able to go back home. You have these soldiers who actually can’t go back home. They’ve been outside of this context, and they’ve seen the world, and they’re asked to step back into these family dynamics that don’t work for them. Also, I’m realizing that friendship is a theme — how friendship can shackle you or hurt you, in a way, because [Jamie, Hedlund’s character] and [Ronsel, Mitchell’s character] have this brotherhood that is unconsummated. This relationship is queer in that way — black and white guys aren’t supposed to be friends, so it’s subversive. Same with “Pariah.” They have this friendship where Alike feels limited by Laura’s idea of butchness or lesbianism or presenting masculinity. I feel like thematically there’s things I keep coming back to, maybe subconsciously.Since “Pariah” didn’t crack $1 million at the box office, what do you hope for in terms of the legacy of “Mudbound”?I just want to make films that last. I want “Mudbound” to last. In the same way that “Pariah” is still being discovered, I want “Mudbound” to be a film that, five years from now, is still being discovered. It’s not just a Kleenex film, where you watch it once and you’re done with it. That’s why I was glad Netflix got this film, because, for me, “Pariah” got picked up by Focus and got this small platform release ― it got kept alive because of Netflix. I was aware of that, so I had a different idea: When they got “Mudbound,” I was like, “OK, great, it’s going to be kept alive and be available.” It’ll have this simultaneous global audience, which is a different feeling. In terms of their support of the film, this is the most marketing support I’ve ever had for a film. It feels great to have them actively putting this film in front of audiences. The festival support has been amazing. It’s almost been like a reunion. All the festivals we’ve done so far are the festivals with the “Pariah” wins: Sundance, Toronto, London and then New York. In a weird way, it’s like six years later we’re making the same rounds again.It’s just interesting for me as a filmmaker. A bigger budget can buy you more background. It can buy you more days ― which, in this case, it didn’t, really ― but it’s not going to buy you better performances. For me, the directing work is still in the performances. It’s still in the blocking, the composition. Money doesn’t buy you better frames, you know what I mean? I want to show that storytelling is storytelling. I’m always attracted to characters and relationships first, and then themes. Even though it happens to be topical, I’m never wanting to be polemic. I’m not preachy or didactic. I’m just going to tell you the story. If you’re into it, cool. To me, you can’t lead with the message because that’s a turn-off. Lead with characters that are interesting, and then people kind of won’t care what happens because they’re interested in people.Let’s talk about Mary J. Blige, who disappears in the role of Florence. Many people have said they can’t believe it’s her.Yeah, totally. Her manager, Shakim [Compere], also manages Queen Latifah, so I knew Shakim from “Bessie.” I called Shakim and said, “Hey, do you think there’s any way Mary would want to do this?” I had also gone to CAA, and in the first meeting I said, “I want Mary. Would she be willing?” For me, it was a long shot. It was a Hail Mary. But she said yes.I just really wanted someone unexpected. I wanted someone for Florence who could have this very reserved exterior but have a very empathetic, alive, vulnerable inner life. With Mary’s music, if you’ve been to her concerts, it’s literally like a therapy session for thousands of people. She’s not just performing; she’s living it. Every verse, she’s reliving the heartbreak or she’s reliving the joy, and you feel it. I needed a character that can make people feel, and I knew she could bring it. She has a beautiful, tear-drop-shaped scar, and I wanted to use it, this perpetual tear. Actresses, especially with huge ones, it’s rare that they’ll will want to strip down. We do this very naturalistic makeup look on her: no lashes, no nails, no hair. Mary’s bold enough and brave enough to go there. Most actresses would be like, “Nope, I still need my wig.”Was that part of your original pitch to Mary?Yeah. Well, I kind of waited until a little bit later to say it to her. I remember the first day she walked into my office. I was a little bit starstruck, like, “Oh my god,” because she’s, like, Mary. She’s amazing. We just talked about it. I just wanted her to feel safe. I wanted to talk to her as an actress and let her feel comfortable in being able to be vulnerable and allow herself to be seen. She was amazing with that.We did these little acting exercises. It was the same way with “Pariah,” in terms of the performances. I took these one-on-one pairings. I did Mary J. Blige and Carey Mulligan. We did repetition things. “Look at each other in the eyes.” For me, the core of that relationship was power, so I had them repeat it back and forth: “You have the power.” “No, you have the power.” That was a way to break the ice. It starts them looking at each other. They’re just holding eye contact, which I think is everything. It’s awkward, it’s uncomfortable, then you start laughing. It’s just being seen and seeing another person. Just looking at each other is huge.Same thing with Mary J. Blige and Jason Mitchell. I’d seen Jason in “Straight Outta Compton,” and I loved his performance as Eazy-E. I grew up listening to the bootleg tapes because my parents wouldn’t buy it because of the parental advisory. I thought I knew the story [of N.W.A.], but through him I realized I didn’t know the story at all. I didn’t understand who this person was at all, and the fact that he’d do that, in the scene where he’s in the hospital dying of AIDS and hugging this man and showing that male vulnerability. I knew he could be Ronsel, who’s very square and stony. He’s this solid guy who, at the end of the day, is very sensitive and seeing, in a way. Anyway, I had them stand with each other, Mary saying over and over again, “You’re making a mistake”; Jason saying, “No, I’m not.” It’s just letting the actors talk to each other in character off-script. That’s what I find interesting.At what point did you do those exercises? On the set?No, it’s in my office, in prep, during pre-production. That’s my idea of rehearsals. I think I did it over two days, these different pairings. We’d meet in my office and close the door — it was just me and the actors. I’m not drilling them on lines, I’m not rehearsing the words. I feel like if we can get the subtext of it, then I’m trusting you’re going to know the text. So, understand the subtext, and the text will almost be — not inconsequential, but you have to know why you’re there, and you have to really believe it and feel it. Everything else is informed by that.People have said this movie should be taught in history classes.Yeah, if that happens, I just don’t want this to be turned into a didactic thing.Right. “Selma” got the same attention a couple of years ago, but that was a historical drama.Right. I think hopefully the takeaway is that history doesn’t just happen to us. We’re creating it; we’re making it. We’re not passive — we are actors in our own story, so it’s just being aware of how we’re acting and the ideas we’ve inherited. It’s instructive maybe, but it’s not didactic in that way. Understand these relationships, maybe to the extent that it makes you ask, “Hey, what was my grandpa like, or how did he get what he got? How did my parents get what they got?”Even if your parents came over from Italy with $2 in their pocket — if that’s your story, then why did we need to own slaves? But it’s like, OK, but if the narrative of coming over with $2 in your pocket is a noble narrative, then why can’t someone come from Belize with $2 in his pocket? If that’s a noble story, then use that knowledge to say, “Wait a minute, our ideas about immigration are flawed, because we all have this immigration story, which we brag about now.” We should be welcoming other people who are coming with $2 and a dream.It’s that kind of interrogation of our own personal histories and how we came to have what we have and be where we are. It’s being mindful of what we’re maybe unconsciously passing on to others. I think inheritance is a more expansive way to talk about it. In history classes, this is not just to me, like, “This is a picture of Jim Crow South.” It’s meant to be about all those things about how we’re actors and we can’t just stand there and watch things.If you were to devise a syllabus of movies taught in history courses, what would would be on it?I like “Killer of Sheep,” by Charles Burnett, because even before [the filmmaking movement] Dogme 95, it’s a way of filmmaking that was raw and honest and feeling. It was about a way of life. I like “Midnight Cowboy,” just because I like it. It feels like it’s about New York and this kind of ingenue in a package you don’t expect. He’s this big, hulking hunk of a guy. It’s about naiveté and the city. I like “Network” because of how fast it moves, and the dialogue, just the feeling of it. What else do I love? I love “A Woman Under the Influence” by John Cassavetes, because, again, I love that style where I can never hear the lines and you don’t think of the script.It’s those movies that I love, where you can just feel something in them and it’s not this down-your-throat thing. I was also going to say “Blood Simple” or “Raising Arizona,” even. It’s a goofy Coen brothers film, but it’s fun. It was the birth of Nicolas Cage, when movies used to launch people before they were stars. It’s how cinema can be about discovery — John Goodman and those guys. I watch a lot of stuff. People ask “what are your favorite films,” and the answer is, there’s so many. In terms of a syllabus, I would just choose films that show life that you haven’t seen, or different parts of life that you haven’t seen, or people we haven’t seen.I love that, because the temptation might be to name a slew of biopics, adaptations of historical court cases, fact-based fodder.Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, like, “Network” talks about the industry and the manufacturing of news ― the spectacle. They could release that today, and it would be like, “Oh my god, this is happening now.”This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

But she said yes.”",2017-11-22,"Mary J.

She followed that with 2015′s “Bessie,” the Emmy-winning HBO movie about famed blues singer Bessie Smith. Both showcase a filmmaker with a sharp eye for the nuances of human connection, but “Mudbound” is in a class of its own, chronicling two families ― one black, one white ― on a dusty plantation in World War II–era Mississippi. Racial stratification plagues everyday existence on and off their farmstead, especially once the clans’ sons (played by Jason Mitchell and Garrett Hedlund) become friends. Rees, who adapted Hillary Jordan’s novel of the same name with “ER” writer Virgil Williams, weaves numerous characters’ perspectives together to create a searing, audacious masterwork. None of Netflix’s original releases have secured acting, directing or writing nominations from the Oscars, but the acclaim that has greeted “Mudbound” could help to end the streaming service’s dry spell. I talked to Rees in New York in October ― right as awards-season campaigns were first escalating ― about portraying the Jim Crow South, working with Mary J. Blige and the films she thinks are worthy of history classes.“Mudbound” was among the toasts of this year’s Sundance Film Festival. It felt very much like your moment in particular ― you were no longer just a director on the rise. Did you feel those good vibes, too?So that’s exactly why I love doing press. My partner, Sheila, filters stuff to me, or friends will send me bits and pieces. But to me, I try to keep focused on the work and be sobered by the fact that it’s not a meritocracy, this world. If things happen, great. If they don’t, great. At the end of the day, I think, just as a maker, just as an artist, hopefully this makes my way a little bit easier. Or it makes the way of someone else a little bit easier. Or it it’ll make some film exec go watch shorts programs at festivals instead of going to the gala. To me, that would be the big thing ― for the studio system in general to do more interesting material. Go to shorts programs and find a voice there that you’re interested in and make their next film. It’s a reminder that discovery is the thing.“Pariah” is a micro-budget indie movie that won incredible acclaim and found a second wind in streaming. Maybe the average moviegoer isn’t familiar with it, but in certain circles it’s a very big deal. Were the doors that opened to you after “Pariah” the ones you hoped would open?I feel like they opened in that I never stopped working. Did the kind of doors open for me that would have happened if another maker made that film? Probably not. You know what I mean? But after “Pariah,” I never wasn’t working in film. Part of it was this deal for Focus Features. I wrote a script for them about a detective ― a Memphis cop ― that they didn’t produce because it wasn’t, you know, big enough. But I got a feature script, and then I got a job writing “Bessie.” It was this whole thing where someone was like, “Oh, wait, actually do you want to direct it? This is written so specifically.” It’s kind of like “Pariah” opened doors. I wrote a pilot for HBO for Viola Davis. It didn’t get produced, but I was always writing, so I was blessed in that, since January 2011, I’ve never stopped working. I’m kind of pushing along on my own. Lee Daniels gave me my first shot in TV.Did you do an episode of “Empire”?Yeah, in the second season. It was when it was still new. Lee, like, bullied me into the studio and was like, “Dee is doing this.” I feel like “Pariah” was a blessing. I feel like all of us from that film work. It launched Bradford Young as a DP.That’s right. He got an Oscar nomination this year for “Arrival.”Yeah! Exactly. And Adepero Oduye. So “Pariah” launched all of us, I think, in different ways. I’m grateful for the fact that I kept working, that I could build up street cred. It becomes this cumulative effect thing that happens.Here we are talking on National Coming Out Day …Yeah, but then the Mississippi religious freedom act goes into effect today, too.That’s the way it works, I suppose. But with “Pariah,” you made a movie that’s like a warm blanket in its ability to speak to young queer people’s experiences. And now, with “Mudbound,” you’ve made something far more sweeping. It has a large ensemble, its topicality is grander. What does it mean to you to have given people movies that speak to their history?I think I’m realizing now that, thematically, there are these ideas that I keep returning back to. Because for me, in many ways, “Mudbound” is about not being able to go back home. You have these soldiers who actually can’t go back home. They’ve been outside of this context, and they’ve seen the world, and they’re asked to step back into these family dynamics that don’t work for them. Also, I’m realizing that friendship is a theme — how friendship can shackle you or hurt you, in a way, because [Jamie, Hedlund’s character] and [Ronsel, Mitchell’s character] have this brotherhood that is unconsummated. This relationship is queer in that way — black and white guys aren’t supposed to be friends, so it’s subversive. Same with “Pariah.” They have this friendship where Alike feels limited by Laura’s idea of butchness or lesbianism or presenting masculinity. I feel like thematically there’s things I keep coming back to, maybe subconsciously.Since “Pariah” didn’t crack $1 million at the box office, what do you hope for in terms of the legacy of “Mudbound”?I just want to make films that last. I want “Mudbound” to last. In the same way that “Pariah” is still being discovered, I want “Mudbound” to be a film that, five years from now, is still being discovered. It’s not just a Kleenex film, where you watch it once and you’re done with it. That’s why I was glad Netflix got this film, because, for me, “Pariah” got picked up by Focus and got this small platform release ― it got kept alive because of Netflix. I was aware of that, so I had a different idea: When they got “Mudbound,” I was like, “OK, great, it’s going to be kept alive and be available.” It’ll have this simultaneous global audience, which is a different feeling. In terms of their support of the film, this is the most marketing support I’ve ever had for a film. It feels great to have them actively putting this film in front of audiences. The festival support has been amazing. It’s almost been like a reunion. All the festivals we’ve done so far are the festivals with the “Pariah” wins: Sundance, Toronto, London and then New York. In a weird way, it’s like six years later we’re making the same rounds again.It’s just interesting for me as a filmmaker. A bigger budget can buy you more background. It can buy you more days ― which, in this case, it didn’t, really ― but it’s not going to buy you better performances. For me, the directing work is still in the performances. It’s still in the blocking, the composition. Money doesn’t buy you better frames, you know what I mean? I want to show that storytelling is storytelling. I’m always attracted to characters and relationships first, and then themes. Even though it happens to be topical, I’m never wanting to be polemic. I’m not preachy or didactic. I’m just going to tell you the story. If you’re into it, cool. To me, you can’t lead with the message because that’s a turn-off. Lead with characters that are interesting, and then people kind of won’t care what happens because they’re interested in people.Let’s talk about Mary J. Blige, who disappears in the role of Florence. Many people have said they can’t believe it’s her.Yeah, totally. Her manager, Shakim [Compere], also manages Queen Latifah, so I knew Shakim from “Bessie.” I called Shakim and said, “Hey, do you think there’s any way Mary would want to do this?” I had also gone to CAA, and in the first meeting I said, “I want Mary. Would she be willing?” For me, it was a long shot. It was a Hail Mary. But she said yes.I just really wanted someone unexpected. I wanted someone for Florence who could have this very reserved exterior but have a very empathetic, alive, vulnerable inner life. With Mary’s music, if you’ve been to her concerts, it’s literally like a therapy session for thousands of people. She’s not just performing; she’s living it. Every verse, she’s reliving the heartbreak or she’s reliving the joy, and you feel it. I needed a character that can make people feel, and I knew she could bring it. She has a beautiful, tear-drop-shaped scar, and I wanted to use it, this perpetual tear. Actresses, especially with huge ones, it’s rare that they’ll will want to strip down. We do this very naturalistic makeup look on her: no lashes, no nails, no hair. Mary’s bold enough and brave enough to go there. Most actresses would be like, “Nope, I still need my wig.”Was that part of your original pitch to Mary?Yeah. Well, I kind of waited until a little bit later to say it to her. I remember the first day she walked into my office. I was a little bit starstruck, like, “Oh my god,” because she’s, like, Mary. She’s amazing. We just talked about it. I just wanted her to feel safe. I wanted to talk to her as an actress and let her feel comfortable in being able to be vulnerable and allow herself to be seen. She was amazing with that.We did these little acting exercises. It was the same way with “Pariah,” in terms of the performances. I took these one-on-one pairings. I did Mary J. Blige and Carey Mulligan. We did repetition things. “Look at each other in the eyes.” For me, the core of that relationship was power, so I had them repeat it back and forth: “You have the power.” “No, you have the power.” That was a way to break the ice.

We did repetition things. “Look at each other in the eyes.” For me, the core of that relationship was power, so I had them repeat it back and forth: “You have the power.” “No, you have the power.” That was a way to break the ice. It starts them looking at each other. They’re just holding eye contact, which I think is everything. It’s awkward, it’s uncomfortable, then you start laughing. It’s just being seen and seeing another person. Just looking at each other is huge.Same thing with Mary J. Blige and Jason Mitchell. I’d seen Jason in “Straight Outta Compton,” and I loved his performance as Eazy-E. I grew up listening to the bootleg tapes because my parents wouldn’t buy it because of the parental advisory. I thought I knew the story [of N.W.A.], but through him I realized I didn’t know the story at all. I didn’t understand who this person was at all, and the fact that he’d do that, in the scene where he’s in the hospital dying of AIDS and hugging this man and showing that male vulnerability. I knew he could be Ronsel, who’s very square and stony. He’s this solid guy who, at the end of the day, is very sensitive and seeing, in a way. Anyway, I had them stand with each other, Mary saying over and over again, “You’re making a mistake”; Jason saying, “No, I’m not.” It’s just letting the actors talk to each other in character off-script. That’s what I find interesting.At what point did you do those exercises? On the set?No, it’s in my office, in prep, during pre-production. That’s my idea of rehearsals. I think I did it over two days, these different pairings. We’d meet in my office and close the door — it was just me and the actors. I’m not drilling them on lines, I’m not rehearsing the words. I feel like if we can get the subtext of it, then I’m trusting you’re going to know the text. So, understand the subtext, and the text will almost be — not inconsequential, but you have to know why you’re there, and you have to really believe it and feel it. Everything else is informed by that.People have said this movie should be taught in history classes.Yeah, if that happens, I just don’t want this to be turned into a didactic thing.Right. “Selma” got the same attention a couple of years ago, but that was a historical drama.Right. I think hopefully the takeaway is that history doesn’t just happen to us. We’re creating it; we’re making it. We’re not passive — we are actors in our own story, so it’s just being aware of how we’re acting and the ideas we’ve inherited. It’s instructive maybe, but it’s not didactic in that way. Understand these relationships, maybe to the extent that it makes you ask, “Hey, what was my grandpa like, or how did he get what he got? How did my parents get what they got?”Even if your parents came over from Italy with $2 in their pocket — if that’s your story, then why did we need to own slaves? But it’s like, OK, but if the narrative of coming over with $2 in your pocket is a noble narrative, then why can’t someone come from Belize with $2 in his pocket? If that’s a noble story, then use that knowledge to say, “Wait a minute, our ideas about immigration are flawed, because we all have this immigration story, which we brag about now.” We should be welcoming other people who are coming with $2 and a dream.It’s that kind of interrogation of our own personal histories and how we came to have what we have and be where we are. It’s being mindful of what we’re maybe unconsciously passing on to others. I think inheritance is a more expansive way to talk about it. In history classes, this is not just to me, like, “This is a picture of Jim Crow South.” It’s meant to be about all those things about how we’re actors and we can’t just stand there and watch things.If you were to devise a syllabus of movies taught in history courses, what would would be on it?I like “Killer of Sheep,” by Charles Burnett, because even before [the filmmaking movement] Dogme 95, it’s a way of filmmaking that was raw and honest and feeling. It was about a way of life. I like “Midnight Cowboy,” just because I like it. It feels like it’s about New York and this kind of ingenue in a package you don’t expect. He’s this big, hulking hunk of a guy. It’s about naiveté and the city. I like “Network” because of how fast it moves, and the dialogue, just the feeling of it. What else do I love? I love “A Woman Under the Influence” by John Cassavetes, because, again, I love that style where I can never hear the lines and you don’t think of the script.It’s those movies that I love, where you can just feel something in them and it’s not this down-your-throat thing. I was also going to say “Blood Simple” or “Raising Arizona,” even. It’s a goofy Coen brothers film, but it’s fun. It was the birth of Nicolas Cage, when movies used to launch people before they were stars. It’s how cinema can be about discovery — John Goodman and those guys. I watch a lot of stuff. People ask “what are your favorite films,” and the answer is, there’s so many. In terms of a syllabus, I would just choose films that show life that you haven’t seen, or different parts of life that you haven’t seen, or people we haven’t seen.I love that, because the temptation might be to name a slew of biopics, adaptations of historical court cases, fact-based fodder.Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, like, “Network” talks about the industry and the manufacturing of news ― the spectacle. They could release that today, and it would be like, “Oh my god, this is happening now.”This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

But advocates say they plan to keep trying.,2017-11-22,"<p>Tuskegee Airman Don Elder speaks out in favor of a ballot measure to curtail state spending on medications at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus in September. The measure, and another like it in California, was defeated, but advocates say they plan to try again in South Dakota and Washington, D.C.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a15a87a140000593950eddd.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Michael OlloveJust 9 percent of Americans think pharmaceutical companies put patients’ interests above their own profits, according to a Harris poll published earlier this year.That dismal finding, which mirrors other recent polling, would seem to have boded well for a ballot initiative in Ohio intended to limit the amount the state pays drugmakers for prescription medicines.Yet earlier this month, Ohio voters rejected the measure by a decisive margin of 79 to 21 percent, the most lopsided tally in recent history for a ballot initiative in the state. A nearly identical measure fell a year earlier by a narrower, but still substantial, margin in California, a left-leaning state where voters could have been expected to back limits on the industry.The defeats come at a time when consumers, health advocates and public officials have voiced alarm and outrage over rising prescription drug costs. And they demonstrate the difficulties activists face in taking on a powerful industry prepared to spend millions to block efforts to control what it charges for its products.Supporters of the Ohio measure — spearheaded by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, an international nonprofit that advocates for HIV testing and provides care to thousands of patients in the United States — said the initiative would have saved taxpayers $400 million a year.In both states, the principal opposition to the measures came from the pharmaceutical industry, which argued that rather than reducing state costs, the proposed changes would lead to higher prescription drug prices for many people. Drugmakers outspent supporters more than 3-to-1 in Ohio.“Conversations about the cost of medicines are important,” the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the lobbying arm of the drugmaking industry, said by email. But the group called the Ohio proposal “flawed policy [that] was not the answer to the challenges people face accessing and affording their medicines.”Despite the two decisive defeats, the lead advocate behind the initiatives, Michael Weinstein, co-founder and president of the AIDS foundation, said he intends to finance similar efforts in South Dakota, where he said a Democratic activist has asked for his help, and Washington, D.C., which was attractive because of its liberal electorate and the relative ease of getting an initiative on the ballot.Weinstein did not specify any change in strategy and said he was confident that the tide will turn. “This … is one of the major social issues of our time.”Soaring Prescription CostsStates are major purchasers of prescription drugs, mostly through Medicaid, the health plan for the poor that is jointly financed by states and the federal government, but also for state employee benefit plans, public hospitals and prisons.And those costs are rising. In Medicaid alone, spending on prescription drugs increased by 42 percent between 2013 and 2015, to $31.8 billion. (Overall in the United States, spending on prescription drugs grew by 22 percent in that period.) States have tried a variety of approaches in recent years to stem rising drug prices or reduce their impact. Some have enacted laws that require drugmakers to disclose their development and marketing costs in the expectation that transparency will encourage them to lower prices. Some have limited out-of-pocket expenses for patients who use expensive specialty drugs, like many used to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases.And Massachusetts recently asked the Trump administration for permission to exclude certain drugs from its Medicaid program in an attempt to improve its bargaining position with drugmakers.But the referendums in Ohio and California appear to be the first time voters have had a chance to weigh in on what to do about rising drug prices. And their choice in both cases was to do nothing.California’s liberal politics made the state an obvious choice to first try out the referendum, Weinstein said. He chose Ohio, he said, “because it had a large core of activists, and it is a large swing state with national importance.”In Ohio, where the state spent $2.8 billion on prescription drugs in 2016, mostly through its Medicaid program, health policy experts who watched the campaign unfold said voters were confused by the language of the ballot initiative and feared that if it passed, it would lead to higher prescription drug prices for many of them.“One thing we can say with certainty is that almost no one in the state understood the actual referendum,” said Daniel Skinner, an assistant professor of health policy at Ohio University.The Ohio initiative would have required that state agencies pay the same or lower prices for prescription drugs as the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which by law is entitled to a discount of at least 24 percent below the average manufacturer price. The VA is generally seen as getting the best prices available for medicines.The measure also would have required the state to pay the legal expenses of proponents in the event the initiative passed and was challenged in court by opponents.The group opposing the initiative, Ohioans Against the Deceptive Rx Ballot Issue, was largely funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Final campaign finance reports have not yet been filed, but reports in late October showed that opponents had raised $58 million, compared with just under $15 million for proponents, making it the costliest ballot initiative in Ohio history.Opponents pointed out that the VA gets undisclosed discounts beyond the 24 percent, and without knowing what those are, Ohio would not be able to comply with the initiative. They also pointed out that the list of drugs the VA covers is tailored to its clientele of mostly older men and doesn’t include many drugs used by younger women and children, who comprise a majority of the Medicaid population — and that those other drugs wouldn’t have been covered by the initiative.But perhaps opponents’ most effective argument was that limiting the price the state paid for prescription drugs would lead pharmaceutical companies to raise prices on consumers in employer plans or with individual policies.“It was bad public policy that not only wouldn’t fix the problem but make things worse,” said Dale Butland, communications director for the opposition campaign.Proponents deny that characterization. Dennis Willard, spokesman for the proponents, Ohio Taxpayers for Lower Drug Prices, said Ohio officials would have been able to work with the VA to get all the information they needed to ensure the state got the same deal on prescription prices.And even if all drugs aren’t covered in the VA formulary, the initiative would have saved taxpayers $400 million a year through the drugs that are, he said. “If this measure was going to have no impact, why would they spend all this money opposing it?”Paul Beck, a retired political scientist from Ohio State University, said the campaign against the measure used television and radio ads to sow confusion. And, he said, “when voters are confused about an issue, their tendency is to vote no.”Going ForwardEven before the ballot initiative battles, Weinstein was controversial in some circles. Unlike other AIDS foundations that raise money through grants and fundraising, his operates a string of medical clinics and pharmacies, whose profits finance care for 700,000 HIV patients around the world.Many in AIDS advocacy opposed the California referendum, fearing that drugmakers would respond to limits on state prescription drug spending by raising prices on other consumers.But Weinstein has proven more than willing to depart from the orthodoxy of AIDS advocacy, not least of all by his hostility to PrEP, a drug that reduces the likelihood of contracting HIV by up to 99 percent. Virtually alone among AIDS activists, Weinstein has warned that the use of PrEP would discourage condom use.As to the referendums, though, he said he is motivated by his conviction that drug companies are gouging consumers.In Ohio, the no campaign painted him as a California carpetbagger who wanted to fleece Ohioans. The campaign suggested that the provision on legal fees was designed to pay for his future legal expenses, and it referred to him as a health care CEO.“They made people think I was the drug executive, not them,” he said.In California, Weinstein’s foundation spent $19 million on its campaign, compared with $111 million by the opposition, largely from drugmakers. It was the most expensive ballot measure battle in 2016, according to Ballotpedia, which monitors spending on elections.Political analysts say Weinstein will run into similar problems if he doesn’t craft better initiative language or improve the messaging.Public disapproval of the pharmaceutical industry should provide an opening with voters, said Skinner, the Ohio University political scientist. “But they also should have used their argument about saving taxpayer money much more effectively.”And, Skinner noted, whatever the messaging, proponents are still likely to face the same spending disadvantage.Buoyed by their recent victory, opponents also are doubtful about Weinstein’s chances going forward. “If you can’t get it passed in California, one of the most progressive states,” Butland said, “and you can’t get it passed in Ohio, it raises the question of where you can get it passed.” Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"

The jeep later veered into a ditch before the soldier jumped out and ran across the border, where four of his comrades can be seen firing upon him.South Korean soldiers quickly moved to rescue the soldier and bring him to safety.The man was shot at least five times and is in critical condition at a South Korean hospital. Doctors said Wednesday he had regained consciousness after having two operations to remove bullets from his body, according to Reuters.“He is fine,” Lee Cook-Jong, the lead surgeon, said at a news conference. “He is not going to die.”The Washington Post notes one of the pursuing North Korean soldiers can be seen on camera crossing the Military Demarcation Line between the two Koreas, a violation of the armistice agreement signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953. U.N. Command also said the North violated the agreement by firing across the MDL.“UNC personnel at the [Joint Security Area] notified [the North’s Korean People’s Army] of these violations today through normal communications channel in Panmunjom and requested a meeting to discuss the investigation results and measures to prevent future such violations,” U.N. Command told the Post in a statement.Such a defection at the heavily armed DMZ is rare, and a soldier has not done so at the Joint Security Area since 2007, according to The New York Times. Thousands of North Koreans have defected in the past decades, although most travel through China.The Associated Press last week reported that doctors had to remove dozens of parasites, including intestinal worms as long as 10 inches, from the soldier while he was in the hospital. Some have said the health of the man reflects the ongoing humanitarian crisis within North Korea, which often struggles to feed its own people."

Its 2010 decision that corporations are people still leaves many citizens scratching their heads. Comedian Jon Stewart made more sense when he noted wryly that corporations can’t be people since they have an “inability to love”.Nevertheless, the Court’s 5-4 ruling to personify corporations remains the law of the land.It is another ruling, however, that best demonstrates how naïve the Justices can be about the America that exists outside their chambers. In 2013, the Court struck down a critical provision of the Voting Rights Act, the law Congress enacted in 1965 to prevent states from racial discrimination in their election rules.President Lyndon Johnson and Congress approved the Act two years after Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech and one year after Congress passed the Civil Rights Act. Several southern states were still actively engaged in racial discrimination by levying poll taxes and requiring literacy tests. But what drew the nation’s full attention was violence, including murder, against volunteers who helped register African Americans and other minority voters. Congress noted that there was entrenched racial discrimination in state voting rules and called them “an insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution”.The Act required several states with an especially bad history of racial discrimination to obtain approval by the Attorney General of the United States for any changes they wanted to make in their voting laws. But by declaring part of the Act unconstitutional in 2013, the Supreme Court made this requirement unenforceable.Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts reasoned that in the half-century since passage of the Act “things have changed dramatically” in the South. While no one doubts that voting discrimination still exists, Roberts explained, more African Americans than white Americans were voting in several of the states covered by the law and the racial gap in voter registration had narrowed. Speaking for the Court’s minority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned that previous types of discrimination had merely been replaced by more subtle methods such as gerrymandering.So, who was correct? Is the racially motivated rigging of voting rights a thing of the past? Or is the right to vote still being sabotaged by some of our states? Consider the following data from the Brennan Center for Justice, one of America’s most respected watchdogs on voting rights:As of last May, at least 99 bills in 31 states had been introduced to restrict access to registration and voting.Voter suppression strikes at the heart of democracy, but it has taken on partisan political dimensions. Traditionally, African Americans have tended to vote for Democrats. Thus, rules designed to deny racial minorities their voting rights increase the chances that Republicans will win elections. Along with other threats to the integrity of democracy — among them partisan gerrymandering and the corrupting influence of money in politics — voter suppression has weakened the two-party system and the checks and balances established by the Constitution. Republicans now control all three branches of the federal government; they control both the legislatures and governorships in 26 states.In several states, the evidence shows that incumbent Republicans are actively engaged in trying to tilt elections in their party’s favor. In Ohio, for example, Republican Secretary of State and gubernatorial candidate Jon Husted reportedly has “purged” more than 2 million voters from the state’s roles since 2011. Purge notices are sent to residents who have moved or who have not cast a ballot for two years. If the residents don’t respond, they are categorized as “inactive.” Mother Jones reports that in Ohio’s three largest counties, voters in Democratic-leaning areas have been purged twice as often as people in Republican-leaning areas.In Wisconsin, whose legislature passed a strict voter ID law in 2011, Mother Jones found that black voters were roughly 50 percent more likely than whites to be blocked from voting because they didn’t have the required identification. Blacks were less likely to drive and to have drivers’ licenses, and they were less likely to have other required documents, especially when they had moved to Wisconsin from other states.After conducting a survey of registered voters in Wisconsin, political scientists Kenneth Mayer of the University of Wisconsin-Madison concluded, “we have hard evidence there were tens of thousands of people who were unable to vote because of the voter ID law.” That was more than enough votes to change the outcome of the presidential vote in Wisconsin last November.There is some good news. The Brennan Center says more than 530 bills had been introduced in 45 state legislatures to expand voting access. Some state laws to suppress voters have been challenged in lawsuits that are now before the U.S. Supreme Court.But the larger question goes back to the Roberts ruling. Has racial discrimination largely disappeared from the right to vote and for that matter, from society at large? The bad news appears to outweigh the good. Since last fall’s election, white supremacists and neo-Nazis have come out of the shadows to march openly in our streets. There are clear racial dimensions to the controversy over statues honoring leaders of the confederacy. Black Lives Matter has been interpreted as a racial rather than humanitarian movement. There are disturbing racial undertones, too, in Donald Trump’s presidency including his methodical attempt to destroy the legacies of the nation’s first Black president; his hesitance to condemn white supremacists for the violence that killed a woman in Charlottesville, Virginia; his attempts to restrict travel into the U.S. by certain religious and ethnic groups; his cancellation of DACA, the program that allowed nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants to stay in America because they had been brought into the country as children; and his plan to build a wall to keep illegal Mexican immigrants out, an idea that has less to do with effective border control than with Trump’s appeal to those who object to immigration of virtually any kind.In 2015, several members of Congress, led by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, introduced legislation to repair the Voting Rights Act by requiring that all states obtain federal approval before creating laws that make it more difficult to register and vote or that gerrymander congressional and legislative districts. The bill did not pass, but its sponsors hoped it might at least inspire a grassroots movement among Americans who believe that all citizens regardless of race, religion, political affiliation or place of residence should have an equal opportunity to participate in elections.To a degree, that is coming to pass. Scores of organizations in the United States, some old and some new, are working quietly to fix our broken democracy. At Oberlin College in Ohio last week, some of the nation’s leading thinkers about democracy and its challenges kicked off a series of five conferences that will be held in different cities to diagnose and fix what is broken. The organizations need more resources, but even if they obtain them, their work will not be enough. The revival of America’s democracy must become a nonpartisan national crusade to restore and protect the right to vote. The objective should be the suppression of voter suppression in next year’s midterm elections, in the 2020 presidential election, and beyond.For its part, the Roberts Court may want to revisit its decision to weaken the Voting Rights Act. We would all like to believe that racial discrimination has mostly disappeared over the last 50 years. Unfortunately, the evidence proves otherwise."

A long hushed horror over sexual harassment risks spilling over into hysteria, mainly because its mere mention has been repressed for so long. Our citizenry seems hopelessly divided; mutual distrust runs rampant. And a foreign power seeks to influence our national politics, driving a wedge between otherwise loyal Americans. Have we ever seen such a confluence of confounding events?Perhaps Warren Harding might have something to teach us. He is the favorite target of HBO’s John Oliver, but if only Oliver knew the half of his story.Harding was our 29th president, elected almost a century ago in 1920. He is considered one of our worst presidents, but his record defies that badge of dishonor. He helped stitch the nation and world back together after the most disruptive war in human history. He established the Office of the Budget, oversaw the world’s first arms limitation treaty, traveled to Birmingham, Alabama, to warn that democracy was a lie if African Americans were not provided full rights as citizens, and he let Socialist Eugene Debs out of prison, commuting a ten-year sentence he received for simply speaking out against the war.Woodrow Wilson refused every request for clemency; Oliver Wendell Homes affirmed Debs’ conviction in the Supreme Court. It was Warren Harding who did the decent thing—defending the Constitution and the First Amendment’s precious protection of the right of free speech.A newspaper editor from a small town in Ohio, Harding would be blazingly angry over the current White House occupant’s attack on the free press. Even in a time of world war, Harding voted against a provision Woodrow Wilson wanted to insert in the Espionage Act of 1917 that would have censored the press over war news.So tell me you know about Warren Harding and how he was such a bad president.But there is even more about Harding’s story that is edifying in our confusing times. Because his mistress kept his love letters, we have an inside look at why politicians (or any men of power) find their love lives so byzantine and troubled. And because there is pretty good evidence that this mistress was working with the Germans during the lead-up to war, we have a remarkable record of how espionage can attempt to influence and pervert our democracy.A two-fer.Actually a three-fer. Hysteria took no backseat to any time in history during the years 1914 to 1918. In the United States, almost 20 percent of Americans were German-born or of recent German descent. The nation was hopelessly divided over to whether to join the war in Europe and if so on which side. Many saw the English as the villains with their unlawful blockade on the high seas; most saw the Germans as beasts after they smashed through neutral Belgium to try to take Paris in a lightening maneuver out of the Schlieffen Plan.Consequently, this country was awash in German and British spies. Both sides bought and sold journalists who wrote propaganda stories for their masters (something we would call fake news today). Because the United States was sending munitions to the Allies and the British choked all trade with Germany, German spies in the United States sabotaged factories and ports here. In the summer of 1916, the Statute of Liberty was riddled with shrapnel from the explosion of munitions caused by deliberately set fires on the nearby Black Tom Island.To counter the internal threat, President Wilson sanctioned the formation of a huge vigilante organization of businessmen in every city and village of the nation known as the American Protective League. Overnight, almost 250,000 American citizens were deputized, provided badges, and asked to spy on their neighbors. Arrests were made, homes were searched, and mail was opened. No one knew who to trust.German Ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, an analogue for our modern-day Sergey Kislyak, was eventually expelled from the United States once his meddling was established through the aid of documents stolen from a German Privy Counsellor who fell asleep on a train in New York City. The contents were Wikileaked to New York’s The World newspaper by the Wilson administration. “How Germany Has Worked In U.S. To Shape Opinion, Block The Allies And Get Munitions For Herself, Told By Secret Agents’ Letters,” read the scandalous headline in August 1915.Warren Harding’s affair with his married neighbor, Carrie Phillips, was uncovered by the Wilson administration through the efforts of the American Protective League, military intelligence and the Bureau of Investigation. She was followed by authorities because of her pro-German talk and the fact that she and her daughter turned up outside an Army training camp on Long Island just as draftees, including Irving Berlin, arrived to prepare to join the European conflict. The Germans stationed women spies outside camps across the United States to get intelligence on how quickly the U.S. was mobilizing.While this affair was entirely consensual, the question that arises is why? What was it about Harding’s make-up that provided the impetus for this long-time extramarital affair (it lasted over 15 years)? We know through recent DNA testing that he also had an affair with a younger woman, Nan Britton, with whom Harding had a daughter. What hole was he filling in his life that led to these dalliances? And do we see this pattern in other men of power, especially politicians?I found a recent article in The Atlantic by Caitlin Flanagan to be particularly enlightening on this topic. Flanagan’s article, entitled “Bill Clinton: A Reckoning,” provides this highly illuminating observation: “History instructs us that for countless men, the ability to possess women sexually is not a spoil of war; it’s the point of power.”I suspect Caitlin Flanagan has never read The Harding Affair or tried to sift through his difficult-to-read letters now available in the Library of Congress. But she is on to something.Harding wrote repeatedly of his desire to “possess” Carrie Phillips. That was a catchall for his longing for sexual intimacy and exclusivity. But he also wrote that his involvement in politics was to make himself desirable to her, to make him seem “worth while” in her estimation. She was the point of his seeking higher office.In 1911, as a result of years of misunderstandings from the illicit affair, not to mention local whispering in Marion, Carrie decided to take her daughter, Isabelle, to Berlin to educate her. She intended to remain one school year but found life in the Imperial Capital of the German nation bedazzling, so she stayed. She would not return to the U.S. permanently until the summer of 1914, just before general war was declared (she did travel back twice to meet secretly with Harding, but stayed only for a week or two each time).By the time Carrie arrived in the United States in July of 1914, Warren was knee-deep in a run for the United States Senate. It was the first direct election of senators (previously senators had been appointed by state legislatures) and Harding poured himself into the campaign, convinced that he had lost Carrie. He won by a large margin, making him an instant presidential prospect, especially given his Ohio pedigree (Ohio was the “mother” of eight presidents, most post-civil war).Harding planned a vacation to Texas, California and Hawaii in January 1915 to get away. Carrie was hurt and wrote as much in a letter she slipped him as he boarded the train. When he read the letter, his heart sank. He had believed she no longer cared.From the Palace Hotel in San Francisco (ironical given he would die in this hotel while president in August 1923), Harding wroteI am wilder than ever to possess you and hold you all mine. True, I went into politics for diversion and distraction at a time when you seemed lost to me (and evidently you were in part at least) but all the while I was thinking I could hold your esteem by being worth while, and never a day passed but I felt political success could afford us opportunity.What Warren Harding did not know—until confronted by military authorities in 1918, was that Carrie Phillips was likely working for the Germans after her return from Berlin in 1914. She threatened Harding in 1916 with exposure of their affair if he pursued the Republican nomination for president. At the time, Wilson was keeping the nation out of the war and the Germans thought that a Republican victory was more likely to bring the United States into war. Harding, a popular Ohioan, would surely have defeated Wilson—as it was Wilson won in part because Ohio went for him. Four years later in 1920, Harding indeed won in a landslide.Carrie and Isabelle did “vacation” outside Camp Upton in Yaphank, Long Island, New York, in the late summer of 1917 as 670,000 recruits made ready to go to war. Isabelle became engaged to a young man whose wealthy New York family was chock full of German spies, including the Baroness Zollner, arrested outside a camp near Chattanooga with a soldier half her age hiding under her bed and code in her purse to alert her when troops would embark for Europe.When Harding was told of suspicions about Carrie, he wrote her to stop what she was doing. He even wrote to Carrie’s husband, Jim Phillips, pleading for Carrie to subside lest she be arrested.There is little question of the intent of the Germans to impact American politics. They wanted the United States to remain neutral. Carrie brought pressure to bear on Harding when it came time for him to vote on war with Germany. Despite her threats and his own recognition that he might be signing his political death warrant by voting for war (Ohio, especially Cincinnati, had a large number of German-American voters who voted Republican), Harding voted for war.The rupture over the war effectively ended their relationship and was coincident with Harding’s affair with Nan Britton.But Carrie Phillips—out of love and fear—kept Harding’s love letters the rest of her life, probably as some sort of assurance she would not be arrested.I established in the Harding Affair that the Wilson Administration knew of Harding’s relationship with a woman who was being watched as a spy—yet they did not use this information in the campaign of 1920. Harding and Coolidge soundly trounced Ohio governor James Cox (today Cox Communications) and a neophyte to national politics, Franklin D. Roosevelt.There are lots of people more qualified than I am to guess what Freudian principles account for politicians, entertainers, rock stars and CEOs being “overcharged” when it comes to their sexual relationships with woman or, worse, their sexual attacks on women. But there seems to be a correlation here—politics attracts the type. Sex is the point of power.None of the Harding letters suggest he ever abused women. However, he did place himself at great risk with Carrie Phillips. In the end, he acted by putting country first, but that is not always going to be the case. Politicians who seek power to gain acceptance from the opposite sex, it seems to me, are also more likely to bow to foreign intrigues that might help them gain that power.

A long hushed horror over sexual harassment risks spilling over into hysteria, mainly because its mere mention has been repressed for so long. Our citizenry seems hopelessly divided; mutual distrust runs rampant. And a foreign power seeks to influence our national politics, driving a wedge between otherwise loyal Americans. Have we ever seen such a confluence of confounding events?Perhaps Warren Harding might have something to teach us. He is the favorite target of HBO’s John Oliver, but if only Oliver knew the half of his story.Harding was our 29th president, elected almost a century ago in 1920. He is considered one of our worst presidents, but his record defies that badge of dishonor. He helped stitch the nation and world back together after the most disruptive war in human history. He established the Office of the Budget, oversaw the world’s first arms limitation treaty, traveled to Birmingham, Alabama, to warn that democracy was a lie if African Americans were not provided full rights as citizens, and he let Socialist Eugene Debs out of prison, commuting a ten-year sentence he received for simply speaking out against the war.Woodrow Wilson refused every request for clemency; Oliver Wendell Homes affirmed Debs’ conviction in the Supreme Court. It was Warren Harding who did the decent thing—defending the Constitution and the First Amendment’s precious protection of the right of free speech.A newspaper editor from a small town in Ohio, Harding would be blazingly angry over the current White House occupant’s attack on the free press. Even in a time of world war, Harding voted against a provision Woodrow Wilson wanted to insert in the Espionage Act of 1917 that would have censored the press over war news.So tell me you know about Warren Harding and how he was such a bad president.But there is even more about Harding’s story that is edifying in our confusing times. Because his mistress kept his love letters, we have an inside look at why politicians (or any men of power) find their love lives so byzantine and troubled. And because there is pretty good evidence that this mistress was working with the Germans during the lead-up to war, we have a remarkable record of how espionage can attempt to influence and pervert our democracy.A two-fer.Actually a three-fer. Hysteria took no backseat to any time in history during the years 1914 to 1918. In the United States, almost 20 percent of Americans were German-born or of recent German descent. The nation was hopelessly divided over to whether to join the war in Europe and if so on which side. Many saw the English as the villains with their unlawful blockade on the high seas; most saw the Germans as beasts after they smashed through neutral Belgium to try to take Paris in a lightening maneuver out of the Schlieffen Plan.Consequently, this country was awash in German and British spies. Both sides bought and sold journalists who wrote propaganda stories for their masters (something we would call fake news today). Because the United States was sending munitions to the Allies and the British choked all trade with Germany, German spies in the United States sabotaged factories and ports here. In the summer of 1916, the Statute of Liberty was riddled with shrapnel from the explosion of munitions caused by deliberately set fires on the nearby Black Tom Island.To counter the internal threat, President Wilson sanctioned the formation of a huge vigilante organization of businessmen in every city and village of the nation known as the American Protective League. Overnight, almost 250,000 American citizens were deputized, provided badges, and asked to spy on their neighbors. Arrests were made, homes were searched, and mail was opened. No one knew who to trust.German Ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, an analogue for our modern-day Sergey Kislyak, was eventually expelled from the United States once his meddling was established through the aid of documents stolen from a German Privy Counsellor who fell asleep on a train in New York City. The contents were Wikileaked to New York’s The World newspaper by the Wilson administration. “How Germany Has Worked In U.S. To Shape Opinion, Block The Allies And Get Munitions For Herself, Told By Secret Agents’ Letters,” read the scandalous headline in August 1915.Warren Harding’s affair with his married neighbor, Carrie Phillips, was uncovered by the Wilson administration through the efforts of the American Protective League, military intelligence and the Bureau of Investigation. She was followed by authorities because of her pro-German talk and the fact that she and her daughter turned up outside an Army training camp on Long Island just as draftees, including Irving Berlin, arrived to prepare to join the European conflict. The Germans stationed women spies outside camps across the United States to get intelligence on how quickly the U.S. was mobilizing.While this affair was entirely consensual, the question that arises is why? What was it about Harding’s make-up that provided the impetus for this long-time extramarital affair (it lasted over 15 years)? We know through recent DNA testing that he also had an affair with a younger woman, Nan Britton, with whom Harding had a daughter. What hole was he filling in his life that led to these dalliances? And do we see this pattern in other men of power, especially politicians?I found a recent article in The Atlantic by Caitlin Flanagan to be particularly enlightening on this topic. Flanagan’s article, entitled “Bill Clinton: A Reckoning,” provides this highly illuminating observation: “History instructs us that for countless men, the ability to possess women sexually is not a spoil of war; it’s the point of power.”I suspect Caitlin Flanagan has never read The Harding Affair or tried to sift through his difficult-to-read letters now available in the Library of Congress. But she is on to something.Harding wrote repeatedly of his desire to “possess” Carrie Phillips. That was a catchall for his longing for sexual intimacy and exclusivity. But he also wrote that his involvement in politics was to make himself desirable to her, to make him seem “worth while” in her estimation.

That stands in contrast to the 1,337 bombs from all of 2016 and the 947 bombs dropped on Afghanistan in the entirety of 2015.Trump announced earlier this year that the U.S. would expand its military presence in Afghanistan in an effort to wipe out the Taliban ― despite his “original instinct ... to pull out” of America’s longest war.“[D]ecisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office,” Trump said in an August speech. In September, the Pentagon said 3,000 additional troops would be deployed to the war zone, bringing the total number of U.S. troops there to at least 14,000.Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said on Monday that Trump had emboldened him with “new authority” to launch a bombing campaign against opium labs that have been lining the Taliban’s pockets with cash.“In striking northern Helmand and the drug enterprises there, we’re hitting the Taliban where it hurts, which is their finances,” Nicholson told reporters in a teleconference, speaking from Afghanistan. “These new authorities allow me to go after the enemy in ways I couldn’t before.” Despite the increase in bombing, however, the Taliban’s presence in Afghanistan has not waned ― and according to some experts, has continued to grow. Nicholson said this week the number of Afghan districts controlled by the Taliban was “roughly the same as last year.” But Bill Roggio, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, refuted this statistic, telling NBC that the Taliban now “controls or contests about 40 percent of Afghanistan — more than twice the area it had in 2015.” The Afghan Taliban said in August that Trump was “wasting” American lives with his new war strategy. “If America doesn’t withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, soon Afghanistan will become another graveyard for this superpower in the 21st century,” Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told Al Jazeera.Some Afghan government officials, however, have lauded Trump’s decision to ramp up U.S. military intervention.U.S. airstrikes have been “saving Afghan military lives,” Hamdullah Mohib, the Afghan ambassador to the U.S., told NBC. Earlier this year, Mohib called Trump’s new war policy a “10 out of 10.” "

The people, the lights, the extreme nervousness, but most of all I’ll never forget that first compliment about my painting. Throughout my life, I’ve had the privilege to shadow exceptionally brilliant artists who have extraordinary talent. Coming from a household of artists, I’ve always had a yearning to create, but I didn’t know what I was searching for. As a minority growing up in a low-income environment, I did not have as many opportunities or the exposure to understand what art truly means.Over time an idea developed inside me, an idea that you can express yourself through the stroke of a brush, through the capturing of an idea, a feeling, a moment in a medium ― be that paper, canvas, brick, or a computer screen. In that moment of epiphany my alter ego Bleu Pablo was born. Art has given me the ability to express who I am to the world. My paintings are an extension of myself and are my soul laid bare.To put a single feeling or expression to one piece is to say I am only one feeling or expression; they are as complex and varied as I am. I am my art, and my art is me. Articulating my feelings and thoughts through my art has given me the ability to express myself to the world in a way I never could with words.My goal is to create a platform, a safe space if you will, for emerging artists in the inner city to display their work. I want to give this generation and the ones to follow to have the opportunity to express themselves and empower each other through their work. Through sharing our cultures, experiences and ideas, we cultivate inspiration and grow a communal understanding of life in all its forms. I know it sounds corny, but I want us to create, innovate and motivate within ourselves and our peers.I owe my love of the arts to my creative family, especially my uncle Albert Wrighton who inspired me to give life to my canvas. When I first started and was unsure of my work he would tell me “Don’t stop. You will find yourself.” I feel I finally have done just that. Painting abstract art is my love ― as no other form allows you to draw love, happiness or despair as you see it. I describe my style as abstract with a touch of uptown sauce.Contact me: bleupablo9@gmail.comWriting Cred: Thomas Morgan"
64,POLITICS,FCC Faces Scrutiny For Refusing To Turn Over Evidence On Net Neutrality Comments,Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fcc-net-neutrality-comments_us_5a15b869e4b025f8e9332c04,New York's attorney general says the federal agency is holding up an investigation.,2017-11-22,"Ajit Pai, the Trump-appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, speaks during an open meeting on Nov. 16.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a15e13e150000b53485983d.jpeg?cache=hsyuwFDWYo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Federal Communications Commission received millions of suspicious comments in support of its plan to repeal net neutrality, and it ignored multiple requests for evidence that would explain their origin. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman isn’t happy about that.On Tuesday, one day after Trump-appointed FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai announced he would forge forward with a plan to gut net neutrality, Schneiderman published an open letter calling out the agency for some serious misdeeds.In particular, he noted the FCC “has refused multiple requests for crucial evidence” that is essential to his office’s ongoing investigation into the “fake comments.” Since many of those comments used the identities of “hundreds of thousands” of real Americans, Schneiderman says, whoever submitted them likely broke the law.The New York attorney general says his office requested the FCC records at least nine times over five months from multiple top FCC officials, yet “received no substantive response.”That lines up with the experiences of others who are looking into the origins of the comments.On Sept. 8, a freelance journalist name Jason Prechtel filed suit against the FCC after it failed to respond in a timely manner to a Freedom of Information Act request he filed for similar information regarding the comments.And at least three other groups also filed lawsuits earlier this year after their FOIAs requesting information on the FCC’s net neutrality comment-gathering process were ignored.An analysis by data analytics company Gravwell of the 22 million net neutrality comments the FCC received found that only 17.4 percent of them were unique and not submitted in bulk. Per Gravwell, those authentic comments were “overwhelmingly in support of net neutrality regulations.” In contrast, a majority of the far more numerous suspicious comments were against net neutrality.(Also troubling: The FCC told reporters Tuesday that it has been more or less ignoring all of the comments anyway, except those that made unique legal arguments or contributed previously unconsidered facts.)Yet, despite how fraught the issues are, Schneiderman says his investigation isn’t actually about net neutrality ― it’s about the far more serious task of protecting the integrity of our democratic process.“This investigation isn’t about the substantive issues concerning net neutrality,” he wrote Tuesday. “It’s about the right to control one’s own identity and prevent the corruption of a process designed to solicit the opinion of real people and institutions.“Misuse of identity online by the hundreds of thousands should concern everyone ― for and against net neutrality, New Yorker or Texan, Democrat or Republican,” he continued. “We all have a powerful reason to hold accountable those who would steal Americans’ identities and assault the public’s right to be heard in government rulemaking.“If law enforcement can’t investigate and (where appropriate) prosecute when it happens on this scale, the door is open for it to happen again and again.” "
65,IMPACT,Why Volunteering Over The Holidays Isn't The Best Idea,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maybe-dont-volunteer-over-the-holidays_us_5a0de1b1e4b0b37054f567f0,Nonprofits really need help when volunteer numbers dry up after New Year's.,2017-11-22,Many nonprofits see an influx of volunteers over the holidays. But those figures usually taper off after New Year's.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a15ddfe140000891d50ee8e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At noon on Nov. 1, Meg Currie Teoh opened up registration for people to volunteer on Thanksgiving for a meal for about 300 people at a church in Lansdale, Pennsylvania. By the following morning, every slot for serving food, greeting guests and cleaning up was filled. And with that, she also had a whole roster of disappointed volunteers hoping to get off a waitlist.“It’s like Ticketmaster,” said Currie Teoh, volunteer director of nonprofit Manna on Main Street, of the fervor she sees around Thanksgiving from people who want to give back. “That does not happen the rest of the year. We cannot fill a spot that fast.” Through its food pantry, soup kitchen, and financial aid program, Manna on Main Street works to end hunger in the North Pennsylvania region.Most nonprofits, particularly those involved in food service, see a surge in volunteers every year from Thanksgiving through New Year’s. These groups say they’re grateful for the increased interest and donations. But they wish they could somehow extend the outpouring of support to slower points of the year.“It’s a struggle. We get enough people to get by. But it’s a struggle every week,” Currie Teoh said of recruiting volunteers after the holidays. “I really wish I could bottle up this energy and tap into it at those times.” Nationally, projects saw a 42 percent increase in volunteers last year over the holidays, compared to sign-ups for the whole year, according to data compiled by HandsOn Connect, a group that helps nonprofits manage their volunteer base. That spike was even more dramatic for some local groups. The Center for Volunteer & Nonprofit Leadership, a California group that offers guidance to nonprofits, reported a 200 percent increase in volunteers over the fall and winter compared to the spring and summer months. But once the holidays come to a close, the number of volunteers wanes almost as quickly as they came rushing in. For groups that rely on volunteers to offset costs, this is one of the biggest challenges they face.The summer, for example, is a critical time for hunger relief groups, because they service children who don’t have access to school meals. But it’s also a period when volunteer figures dry up. “Late August is our worst time,” Currie Teoh said. “Everyone is getting one last vacation in or headed back to school. Everyone has a lot of other stuff going on. It’s tough, I’m not going to lie to you ― it’s tough.”Nearly every school in the U.S. participates in the National School Lunch Program, which provides meals to more than 30 million children every day on average. But when school lets out, students lose out on those meals, which means food banks and pantries have to be prepared for an influx of clients.“The summer is really slow,” echoed Stefanie Arck-Baynes, director of communications at Philabundance, a Philadelphia-based group that feeds about 90,000 people a week. “We’re not going to say that it’s more important to get food out during that time, but it’s just as important [as other points during the year]. When we don’t have enough volunteers, we spend more time recruiting...and it’s just that much harder for us to meet the need.”Even for a nonprofit as robust as Philabundance, volunteers play a crucial role for the organization’s bottom line.About 15,000 people volunteer with Philabundance every year, packing and sorting food donations, among other tasks. That effort saves the group about $1 million in salaries a year, which translates into 3 million more meals that are provided to people in need, Arck-Baynes added.Around the holiday season, volunteer inquiries increase by about 10 percent. The holiday shifts at Philabundance are usually reserved by September, and that’s even with the extra slots added to accommodate the rise in food donations that come in. Once the group reaches capacity, Philabundance directs volunteers to nearby organizations that could use extra hands.Experts in the field say it makes sense that people are more keen on getting involved with those in need over the holidays.“There’s a lot of food and family sharing time together,” said Natalye Paquin, CEO of Points of Light, a global volunteer network. “We want to help as many people as possible have those same experiences.”While nonprofits would like to see such sustained interest from volunteers throughout the year, they also find ways to capitalize on the new faces that show up around the holidays. Some volunteer coordinators encourage people to consider helping out at hospitals, nursing homes or animal shelters, which don’t get as much traction during this time. Currie Teoh registers the new names in her database and reaches out to them as the year progresses. God’s Love We Deliver, a New York-city based group that brings meals to people with serious illnesses, creates special holiday-specific projects.“Like many nonprofits, the demand for volunteering skyrockets during the holiday season, and then tends to drop off,” said David Ludwigson, vice president and chief development officer of God’s Love We Deliver. “But we frequently refer to this influx and high demand as a ‘good problem’ to have.”"

The Center for Volunteer & Nonprofit Leadership, a California group that offers guidance to nonprofits, reported a 200 percent increase in volunteers over the fall and winter compared to the spring and summer months. But once the holidays come to a close, the number of volunteers wanes almost as quickly as they came rushing in. For groups that rely on volunteers to offset costs, this is one of the biggest challenges they face.The summer, for example, is a critical time for hunger relief groups, because they service children who don’t have access to school meals. But it’s also a period when volunteer figures dry up. “Late August is our worst time,” Currie Teoh said. “Everyone is getting one last vacation in or headed back to school. Everyone has a lot of other stuff going on. It’s tough, I’m not going to lie to you ― it’s tough.”Nearly every school in the U.S. participates in the National School Lunch Program, which provides meals to more than 30 million children every day on average. But when school lets out, students lose out on those meals, which means food banks and pantries have to be prepared for an influx of clients.“The summer is really slow,” echoed Stefanie Arck-Baynes, director of communications at Philabundance, a Philadelphia-based group that feeds about 90,000 people a week. “We’re not going to say that it’s more important to get food out during that time, but it’s just as important [as other points during the year]. When we don’t have enough volunteers, we spend more time recruiting...and it’s just that much harder for us to meet the need.”Even for a nonprofit as robust as Philabundance, volunteers play a crucial role for the organization’s bottom line.About 15,000 people volunteer with Philabundance every year, packing and sorting food donations, among other tasks. That effort saves the group about $1 million in salaries a year, which translates into 3 million more meals that are provided to people in need, Arck-Baynes added.Around the holiday season, volunteer inquiries increase by about 10 percent. The holiday shifts at Philabundance are usually reserved by September, and that’s even with the extra slots added to accommodate the rise in food donations that come in. Once the group reaches capacity, Philabundance directs volunteers to nearby organizations that could use extra hands.Experts in the field say it makes sense that people are more keen on getting involved with those in need over the holidays.“There’s a lot of food and family sharing time together,” said Natalye Paquin, CEO of Points of Light, a global volunteer network. “We want to help as many people as possible have those same experiences.”While nonprofits would like to see such sustained interest from volunteers throughout the year, they also find ways to capitalize on the new faces that show up around the holidays. Some volunteer coordinators encourage people to consider helping out at hospitals, nursing homes or animal shelters, which don’t get as much traction during this time. Currie Teoh registers the new names in her database and reaches out to them as the year progresses. God’s Love We Deliver, a New York-city based group that brings meals to people with serious illnesses, creates special holiday-specific projects.“Like many nonprofits, the demand for volunteering skyrockets during the holiday season, and then tends to drop off,” said David Ludwigson, vice president and chief development officer of God’s Love We Deliver. “But we frequently refer to this influx and high demand as a ‘good problem’ to have.”"
67,POLITICS,Russia Wanted Trump As President And It Got Him. Now What Does America Do?,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-russia-one-year_us_5a14a7eee4b03dec8248e1b9,"Despite a year of his denials, the evidence of collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russian intelligence is looking clearer.",2017-11-22,Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin shake hands at a summit in Vietnam on Nov. 10.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a14a864140000602b50eb91.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Russia’s tyrant works to help the Republican nominee win America’s presidential election.Members of the nominee’s campaign know of the effort and try to coordinate with it.The nominee wins the election and then, realizing the FBI is looking into the whole mess, fires the person running the investigation in hopes of putting an end to it.As implausible as that scenario sounds even as a Hollywood screenplay, that’s where the nation stands as Donald Trump enters the final weeks of his first year in office: with a Justice Department special counsel running at full speed, two indictments and a guilty plea already under his belt.“The fact pattern that continues to emerge is amazing,” said Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant and among the first to question Trump’s ties to Moscow during the GOP primary campaign. “When I was a young cold warrior, back at the dawn of time, we had a healthy suspicion of Russia.”The White House lawyer hired to coordinate its response to special counsel Robert Mueller’s work dismissed the very idea of collusion, saying that he expects the probe to finish within weeks. “I think it could be wrapped up in the early part of the new year,” Ty Cobb told HuffPost.Trump personally continues to deride the investigation as “fake news” and a waste of resources. In a series of tweets on Oct. 29, the president complained that Mueller’s probe is looking at “phony Trump/Russia, ‘collusion,’ which doesn’t exist. The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics.”Facts that have emerged over the past year, however, suggest otherwise.On Jan. 6, 2017, the U.S. intelligence community released a declassified version of its analysis finding that Russian President Vladimir Putin had not only interfered in the 2016 election, but had actively tried to help Trump. Among the tools Russia used was the theft of emails from the campaign of Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, and their release through Russia-friendly WikiLeaks.Cobb still denied that the contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russian officials constituted “collusion” and said that Comey’s dismissal had been overblown.“The press has made Comey’s firing a cornerstone of this investigation,” Cobb said. “He had the absolute right to fire him, and when he did fire him, he did it for very appropriate reasons.”But collusion per se is no longer the issue, according to Wilson. “There’s no law against collusion,” he said. “But you know what? There are a whole bunch of other laws that cover conspiracy, money laundering, accepting campaign help of material value from a foreign power to win an election.”Trump’s denials about Russia began on July 27, 2016, at the same news conference where he invited Russia to hack Clinton’s computers to find the thousands of emails she had deleted from her private server. “I mean I will tell you right now, zero, I have nothing to do with Russia,” Trump said.In the months that followed, Trump continued to deny any contacts with Russia. After the Oct. 7, 2016, statement by the Department of Homeland Security that Russia was interfering with the election, he questioned that analysis.At the Oct. 19, 2016, presidential debate, when Clinton said that Putin preferred Trump because he would be Putin’s “puppet,” Trump argued that it was impossible to know who had done election-related hacking. “Our country has no idea,” he said at the debate, blaming instead at various times China, a “400-pound guy” in his bed or someone from New Jersey.Trump for the first time acknowledged that the hacking was done by Russia at his Jan. 11, 2017, news conference ― five days after the intelligence community’s release ― but since then he has reverted to calling the Russia story a “hoax” and an attempt by Democrats to pin blame for their election loss elsewhere.More recently, Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders have taken to attacking the credibility of a report prepared by a former British Secret Service agent, Christopher Steele. That 35-page report, which has become known simply as “the dossier,” included a long list of contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russian officials as well as claims that Russian intelligence obtained blackmail material against Trump by setting up an encounter with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel in 2013. The report was originally commissioned by a Republican donor; after Trump won the GOP nomination, Democrats took over paying for it.Both Trump and Sanders have argued that the Democratic financing makes the findings suspect. They even claim it proves that Democrats were the ones “colluding” with Russians because Steele was communicating with Russian sources.“I think it’s very sad what they’ve done with this fake dossier,” Trump said on Oct. 25. “But I think it’s a disgrace. It’s just really ― it’s a very sad ― it’s a very sad commentary on politics in this country.”But GOP consultant Rick Tyler, who worked for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during the presidential primaries, said that as more details have emerged ― verified meetings between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials, for example ― the more accurate the dossier appears to be.“The dossier seems more authenticated than phony,” Tyler said.Interviewed in a new book about the Russia election interference, Steele himself said he believed that between 70 and 90 percent of the raw intelligence he reported is accurate. The new book also suggests that when Steele took his findings to an FBI agent in Rome, the investigation into the Trump campaign had already started, thanks to communications intercepted by British intelligence between Trump campaign aides and Russians.For Tyler, the issue is not whether Russian assistance ultimately swung the election to Trump ― who won the presidency thanks to a total margin of 80,000 votes across three key states. “The Russians clearly had an influence. Did it make a difference in the race? I don’t know how you get to that,” he said.More important to Tyler is learning what information, if any, that Putin has on the president. “Is he compromised? Every American has a right to know,” Tyler said.Trump claimed in his January news conference that there was no compromising material from his 2013 visit to Moscow. He also said he had no business dealings with Russia. “I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we’ve stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia,” he said.But critics, both Republicans and Democrats, point to Trump’s continued kid-glove treatment of Putin ― in stark contrast to the harsh words he’s had for some traditional U.S. allies ― as a sign that he fears Putin for some reason.Trump expressed anger that Congress had passed a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia for its interference in the election and repeatedly states that he wants good relations with Putin. During his recent visit to Asia, the president met with Putin and claimed he again pressed the Russian leader on the election meddling.“He said he didn’t meddle. He said he didn’t meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times. But I just asked him again, and he said he absolutely did not meddle in our election. He did not do what they’re saying he did,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “And I believe ― I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it. But he says, ‘I didn’t do that.’ I think he’s very insulted by it, if you want to know the truth.”(The Russians, for their part, denied that the elections topic even came up in the meeting.)Democrats, meanwhile, hope to use the Russia investigation to remind voters heading into next year’s congressional elections that most Republicans continue to support Trump. The Democratic opposition research group American Bridge even created a website with a Russian URL to drive home that message.“Trump won’t be on the ballot next year,” said Harrell Kirstein, a former Clinton campaign spokesman and now American Bridge’s “Trump War Room” communications director. “But Republicans in Congress ― the same people who were fully aware of the Russian cyberattack against the United States last year but have still done nothing to stand up for the American people ― will be.”"

An immigrant from China, Liz Dong, thanked a high school guidance counselor who helped her navigate college options as an undocumented student who was ineligible for federal financial aid.“If there’s one characteristic that I’ve found is true almost across the board of the other Dreamers that I’ve interacted with, it’s that we’re very grateful for the opportunities we’ve been given,” Dong, who lives in Naperville, Illinois, told HuffPost. “As we navigate the challenges of living in the U.S. as immigrants, especially those without legal status, we all can point to individuals who have helped us along the way.”Dong said that this Thanksgiving, many Dreamers are also just grateful for America, and all the opportunities it has given them. “We’re not under the illusion that it’s a perfect country, but it is a unique country in many ways, with economic opportunities, relative safety and security, and political freedoms that are not necessarily found everywhere else in the world,” Dong said. “I hope Americans understand that we as Dreamers are thankful for this country, even as we wrestle with the frustration and uncertainties of having DACA terminated and our future unknown. We hope to stay in this place that has been our home.”The video, published Sunday, is an initiative of Voices of Christian Dreamers, an informal network of Christians who were illegally brought into the U.S. as children and have received temporary protection from deportation through DACA. The network has partnered with the aid organization World Relief, the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals.As a whole, evangelical Christians have largely been supportive of President Donald Trump. But the president’s recent actions on DACA have earned him some fierce criticism from evangelical leaders. There are currently about 800,000 DACA recipients, commonly referred to as Dreamers, in the United States today. Their futures have been uncertain since September, when Trump announced plans to phase the program out and give Congress the task of figuring out how to handle the Dreamers’ immigration status. Democrats and Republicans have yet to reach a compromise on the issue and Trump hasn’t made the process any easier. In October, the president sent congressional leaders a letter demanding harsher immigration restrictions and border wall funding in return for protecting Dreamers’ legal status.Many evangelical leaders have spoken out in defense of Dreamers. Research from PRRI indicates that a majority of white evangelical Protestants (65 percent) believe that immigrants brought into the country illegally as children should be eligible for legal resident status if they join the military or go to college.Dong, one of the leaders behind Voices of Christian Dreamers, is an employee at World Relief and a Midwest regional mobilizer for the advocacy organization Evangelical Immigration Table. She believes that evangelical Christians have been speaking up for DACA recipients because these immigrants are part of their churches. She estimates that, given the share of undocumented immigrants overall who are either Protestant or Catholic, at least 600,000 recipients of DACA are likely Christian, and that about 200,000 of those may identify as evangelical Christians. “More and more evangelical Christians, like Christians in other traditions and those of other faiths, personally know a Dreamer, and they then know when they hear rhetoric that suggests that we’re somehow a threat to the economy or public safety that those claims are not true,” she said.Dong also said that the Bible is full of instructions to care for those who are vulnerable to injustice and to show compassion toward immigrants and strangers. “While I certainly have a personal stake in wanting Congress to act in on behalf of Dreamers like me, I also believe that the majority of American citizens who identify as Christians should be urging elected officials — most of whom also identify as Christians — to take these biblical principles into account on immigration,” Dong said. If a solution isn’t found, Dreamers whose DACA validity expires on March 6, 2018, or later may no longer be able to apply to renew it.With the deadline fast approaching, Jenny Yang, World Relief’s vice president of advocacy and policy, urged Congress to act quickly.“World Relief believes Dreamers in many ways represent the future of the church in America,” Yang said in a statement. “They are productive members of society who contribute to their communities in countless ways and as such are of tremendous value to the U.S. We urge Congress to act soon and help resolve their situation.”This story has been updated with comments from Liz Dong."

76,POLITICS,"Trump Is On The Verge Of Politicizing The Census, Advocates Say",Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-census-deputy-director_us_5a159563e4b09650540ea931,One former Census official said the White House's reported pick for a high-level Census post was mind-boggling.,2017-11-22,The president is reportedly planning to tap academic Thomas Brunell to be deputy director of the Census Bureau. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1595c0150000b534859712.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump is reportedly leaning toward tapping an academic for the No. 2 position at the U.S. Census Bureau, a decision that has alarmed advocates who say the pick lacks adequate management experience for a massive operational role and has political views that would undermine the credibility of the agency.Politico reported Tuesday that Trump is considering Thomas Brunell, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas with no management experience, to be the deputy director of the Census Bureau. If Trump does pick Brunell, Politico noted, it would break with longstanding tradition of having a nonpartisan career civil servant in the role. Brunell faces increased scrutiny from civil rights and voting groups because as an academic, he has argued that redistricting for partisan gain can actually be a good thing and has served as an expert witness in support of redistricting plans. Those views are significant because the census, which the U.S. Constitution requires every 10 years, helps determine how electoral maps are drawn. The deputy director is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the bureau ― a position that has increased importance as the agency gears up for the 2020 census.Robert Groves, who ran the Census Bureau from 2009-2012 and is now the provost at Georgetown University, said the deputy director position was traditionally filled by a civil servant who had been promoted through the bureau. Phil Sparks, a former Census official who is now co-director of The Census Project, a coalition that monitors the Census, likened the position to a train engineer who makes sure everything is running on time. “You want to have a strong person in that position because that’s the day-to-day administrator for the Census Bureau,” Sparks told HuffPost. “The fact that they are considering someone with a highly partisan background just boggles the mind.”African Americans and Hispanics, two groups Sparks said the Census has traditionally had trouble counting, could suffer significantly if there is not strong and clear organizational leadership at the Census.Lawmakers are required to draw electoral districts in such a way that each district has roughly the same number of people in it. Federal law prohibits lawmakers from drawing those maps in such a way that intentionally dilutes the impact of minority votes. A good census is crucial to making sure that doesn’t happen by giving lawmakers an accurate sense of the minority populations in each area.The Census is currently down on the number of partnership specialists, Sparks said, who help it reach minority populations, and the deputy director will need to make sure that effort is organized. “There are 1,000 partnership specialists that are gonna be deployed across the country. That’s a major management task: To recruit, orient, and then deploy and then supervise these 1,000 people,” he said. “And again, the deputy director is right in the middle of all of that.”Neither the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, nor Brunell responded to a request for comment. The Census is already facing considerable hurdles as it gears up for 2020. John Thompson, the bureau’s director, resigned in May and the agency does not have a permanent director in place. In October, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared before Congress to ask for an additional $3.3 billion to fund Census upgrades and projects that are already behind schedule.Earlier this year, the White House considered tapping Brunell to be the director, a job that requires Senate confirmation, but faced resistance from lawmakers, Politico reported. The deputy director does not need to be confirmed.In his academic work, Brunell has argued that decreasing competition and packing like-minded voters into congressional districts is good because it increases the likelihood voters will cast a ballot for a winning candidate and consequently increase their trust in government. In 2008, he published a book called Redistricting and Representation: Why Competitive Elections are Bad for America.Brunell waded into a controversy over whether the 2000 census should use a statistical adjustment to get a more accurate count of Americans. At the time, he wrote it was impossible to remove the census from political concerns.“Removing the census from the arena of politics is impossible. Politics cannot be taken out of redistricting, out of making the federal budget, or, especially, out of elections,” he wrote in a 2000 paper. “If the Census Bureau is given complete control over how the census is conducted, including the use of statistical adjustment for the purposes of apportionment and redistricting, what happens when the Bureau officials are faced with competing statistical estimates for the nation’s population.”He has also said the census shouldn’t be too insulated from Congress.“While taking of the census may seem like undue meddling by self-interested politicians, the other alternative of an insulated bureaucracy without a measure of responsiveness is more problematic,” he wrote in 2001.Justin Levitt and David Schleicher, professors at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and Yale Law School, respectively, both said they were familiar with Brunell’s academic work. While they often disagreed with his conclusions, they both said his scholarship was serious. Civil rights groups seized on Brunell’s academic work and said his appointment would mark an effort by the Trump administration to politicize a bureau that has been traditionally dominated by civil servants. Both Sparks and Groves said there were only two political appointees in the bureau out of thousands of employees when they were there.Karen Hobert Flynn, the president of the liberal watchdog group Common Cause, said in a statement the Trump administration was choosing to make the Census partisan.“Politics have no business in the Census but the Trump Administration’s leading candidate for the deputy director slot at the Census Bureau, Thomas Brunell, would introduce blatant partisan politics into the national headcount,” Flynn said.Vanita Gupta, who ran the civil rights division in the Department of Justice during the Obama administration and is now president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said Brunell’s appointment would undermine the credibility of the Census. “With regard to the deputy director, historically and traditionally, that person has had significant civil service experience, strong management credentials overseeing a large organization and operation, and considerable expertise in the federal statistical system,” she said in a statement. “Thomas Brunell is outside that mold. Coupled with the partisan nature of the body of his work, this appointment would undermine the credibility of the bureau’s role as a fundamentally nonpartisan statistical agency. Very little in Brunell’s background suggests that he is the right person for this job.”Sparks said by picking Brunell, the Trump administration would be making a clear statement about how they see the Census.“They’re making a statement if he is appointed. A real political statement that the White House wants to have their thumb on the Census Bureau,” he said. "

In an essay she published Tuesday night on her personal website, Schuman said Carter raped her while she and a friend were hanging out at his Santa Monica apartment. According to Schuman, she was 18 at the time, Carter was 22. In a statement to HuffPost, Carter denied Schuman’s accusations and said he was “always respectful and supportive” of her during the time they worked together.“I am shocked and saddened by Ms. Schuman’s accusations. Melissa never expressed to me while we were together or at any time since that anything we did was not consensual,” the statement reads. “We went on to record a song and perform together, and I was always respectful and supportive of Melissa, both personally and professionally. This is the first that I am hearing about these accusations, nearly two decades later. It is contrary to my nature and everything I hold dear to intentionally cause someone discomfort or harm.” Schuman in her essay said that a small group of friends were having drinks at Carter’s apartment when he asked if she wanted to go to his office to hear some new music. While listening, the two began kissing and Carter led her into the bathroom. “I asked him what we were doing in there. He didn’t respond and continued to kiss me,” Schuman wrote. “He then pick (sic) me up, put me on the bathroom counter and started to unbutton my pants. I told him I didn’t want to go any further. He didn’t listen. He didn’t care.” Schuman wrote that she was a virgin at the time and held herself “to religious conservative christian values,” which she was “vocal about” during her stardom.She said that Carter forced oral sex on her and later pressured her to perform oral sex on him. “I felt scared and trapped. He was visually and clearly growing very angry and impatient with me,” she wrote. “It was evident to me, that I couldn’t leave. He was stronger and much bigger than me, and there was no way I would be able to open that door or have anyone help me.”According to Schuman, Carter took her into a bedroom where he raped her despite her protests. “He threw me on the bed and climbed on top of me,” she wrote. “He was relentless, refusing to take my no’s for an answer. He was heavy, too heavy to get out from under him. Then I felt it, he put something inside of me. I asked him what it was and he whispered in my ear ... ‘It’s all me baby.’ It was done.” Schuman said she considered pressing charges at the time, but decided against doing so for several reasons. “I didn’t have the money, the clout or access to an attorney who was powerful enough to stand up against my abuser’s legal counsel,” she wrote. “I was told I would likely be buried in humiliation, accused of being fame hungry, and it would ultimately hurt me professionally as well as publicly.”She said she’s coming forward now in the wake of the #MeToo movement to show other victims of sexual assault they’re not alone. “I feel I have an obligation now to come forward with the hope and intention to inspire and encourage other victims to tell their story,” she wrote. “We are stronger in numbers. If you are reading this and you have been assaulted, know you don’t have to be silent and you are not alone. I know it’s scary. I’m scared.”The statute of limitations in California for rape cases had been 10 years, unless new DNA evidence emerged. Last year, the state enacted a law doing away ― as of 2017 ― with the time limit for prosecuting alleged rapes.Hayley Miller contributed reporting. "

Both moms have kids ― a son and a daughter, respectively ― who have been diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic condition that causes an insatiable appetite. Foge’s 3-year-old daughter, Eliza, was diagnosed with PWS, which can also cause weak muscle tone and developmental delays, when she was barely 2 weeks old. Fischer’s 6-year-old son, Jude, had a later diagnosis; his family didn’t find out until he was almost two and a half.PWS, which is typically confirmed with a blood test, occurs in about 1 of every 15,000 births, according to the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. To protect their children, day-to-day life at the Foge and Fischer households is a bit unusual. The two women, who met through their pediatrician, have locks on their kitchen cabinets and refrigerators so the kids can’t access food at home without the parents knowing.And they will try. “Their hunger has been equated to feeling like they haven’t eaten in three days,” Foge told HuffPost. The parents maintain consistency around mealtimes and have worked with nutritionists to come up with specialized diets for their kids and families. The children have weekly therapy appointments, ranging from speech to physical to occupational. Jude is in kindergarten, so Fischer has the added dimension of working with a teacher and therapist at school. The little boy is on an individualized education plan, and the school has a “no birthday treat” policy, for which Fischer is especially grateful. “I feel so overwhelmed that our school is so proactive in that regard,” she told HuffPost. “I think it stems from food allergies, but our kids also can’t have those sugary treats.”Naturally, Thanksgiving comes with obstacles. Both moms have learned to “de-emphasize” the meal. Foge said it helps if she explains to guests why they shouldn’t offer seconds to her daughter. Fischer has also learned how to manage her son’s sensitivity to smell during the holiday.“He gets a little anxiety so it’s easier for us to go to a family member’s house where the food has already been prepared rather than sitting in our home and having to smell those smells all day long,” she said. “And then we leave, and the food stays.”The moms have teamed up to offer their Denver community a different take on the food-centric holiday. On Thanksgiving, they will hold their Harvesting Hope 5K for the third time, raising money for the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. The event helps shift the focus of the holiday away from indulging in food to being active. “It really does give our families and our children a tradition outside of the feast,” Foge said. “All of us can relate to how exciting it is to be spending the day in the kitchen and cooking, but for our kids that can create a lot of anxiety.”The event also includes a free fun run for kids ages 10 and under so Jude, Eliza and their friends can be active and feel empowered. So far this year, the moms have 900 people signed up from 15 states.Fischer and Foge credit their local community for making the event such a success. Raising money for PWS research is important, but the moms are also happy their kids are growing up with friends and neighbors who know about the disease and how it affects people. “It’s helpful for Eliza to know that everyone’s on her team,” Foge said.
