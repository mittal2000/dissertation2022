0,BLACK VOICES,Police Officer Who Shot Philando Castile Charged With Manslaughter,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/philando-castile-charges_us_582c8fdfe4b058ce7aa86e4e,The officer fired seven times into the car Castile was driving with his girlfriend and her young daughter.,2016-11-16,"Banners block the entrance gate as demonstrators gather outside the governor's residence, July 8, 2016, in St. Paul, Minnesota, where protests continue over the shooting death by police of Philando Castile after a July 6 traffic stop in Falcon Heights.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582ca48e1800006a0730e733.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Minnesota police officer has been charged with second-degree manslaughter for fatally shooting Philando Castile during a July traffic stop in a Saint Paul suburb. Officer Jeronimo Yanez of the St. Anthony Police Department faces a total of three felony charges: one charge of second-degree manslaughter and two felony counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm, Ramsey County Attorney John Choi announced Wednesday morning. “Based upon our thorough and exhaustive review of the facts of this case, it is my conclusion that the use of deadly force by Officer Yanez was not justified,” Choi told reporters. “No reasonable officer ― knowing, seeing and hearing what Officer Yanez did at the time ― would have used deadly force under these circumstances.”“Philando Castile was not resisting or fleeing. He was respectful and compliant. He volunteered, in good faith, that he had a firearm ― beyond what the law requires,” Choi said. “His dying words were in protest that he wasn’t reaching for his gun.”Choi noted that Yanez’s statements to police immediately after the shooting conflicted with statements he later made to investigators with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Yanez shot Castile, 32, at point-blank range on July 6 during a traffic stop in the suburb of Falcon Heights. Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, was in the car along with her 4-year-old daughter.Castile, who was licensed for concealed carry, notified Yanez that he had a weapon and was licensed for it. Reynolds recorded the aftermath in a graphic video she posted to Facebook Live. In the video, Castile is seen bleeding in the seat while Reynolds calmly talks to Yanez and asks why he shot Castile. “The mere mention of a firearm alone doesn’t justify the use of the deadly force,” Choi said Wednesday. Choi said that experts consulted by his office determined that use of force was “not necessary... and was inconsistent with generally accepted police practices.”A summons was issued for Yanez, rather than a warrant, after the officer said he will turn himself in.Castile was a longtime St. Paul Public Schools employee who in recent years had worked as a lunchroom supervisor for a St. Paul Montessori school. Family, friends and colleagues described Castile as a quiet but funny man who cherished his job. Parents from the J.J. Hill Montessori school told HuffPost in July that Castile was known to have memorized the specific food allergies of every student. Though Castile had no record of felonies, he had previously been cited by police at least 31 times while driving, raising questions about racial profiling practices in the suburban St. Anthony Police Department.Local residents said traffic stops of black motorists along the road where Castile was pulled over are disproportionately high compared to stops of white drivers. Castile’s death fueled days of intense protests in the Twin Cities and nationwide, and came just one day after the death of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana ― another black man who was shot and killed by police. In a surprisingly candid remark following Castile’s death, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton (D) said Castile’s race was likely a factor in the officer’s decision to shoot.“Would this have happened if the passengers were white? I don’t think it would have,” Dayton said in July. “All of us in Minnesota are forced to confront that this kind of racism exists.”Thomas Kelly, Yanez’s lawyer, has insisted the shooting had nothing to do with race and had “everything to do with the presence of a gun.”Choi explained to reporters during Wednesday’s press conference that his office opted to pursue a charge of second-degree manslaughter because it was the one most likely to stick. “We can’t and we don’t charge people if we don’t believe we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt,” Choi said. A second-degree charge is defined by “culpable negligence” and an element of recklessness, he said.If convicted on the manslaughter charge, Yanez would face up to 20 years in prison.Philip Stinson, an associate professor of criminology at Ohio’s Bowling Green State University, notes that an overwhelming majority of incidents where police kill a civilian don’t result in charges.Since the beginning of 2005, nearly 80 officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter resulting from police-involved shootings, according to data Stinson has compiled.Of those officers, 27 have so far been convicted, with only one convicted of murder. A number of other cases are still pending and the rest have ended in non-convictions, either through acquittal or dismissal.

He will face an election in January, when all members of the new House, both Democrats and Republicans, vote on a new speaker.Republicans kept their majorities in both the House and Senate in the Nov. 8 elections in which voters elected Republican Donald Trump to the White House over Democrat Hillary Clinton.“It is a tremendous honor to be nominated by my colleagues to serve as speaker of the House,”Ryan said on Twitter. “Now it’s time to go big.”Republicans also re-elected three other lawmakers to leadership positions: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, and the chairwoman of the Republican conference, Cathy McMorris Rodgers.(Reporting by Susan Cornwell and Susan Heavey; Editing by Mohammad Zargham and Lisa Shumaker)"

The Kansas City Star reports he was the father of Kansas City Chiefs long snapper James Winchester.The suspected shooter was later found dead inside a pickup truck with an apparent gunshot wound to the head, according to Capt. Paco Balderrama of the Oklahoma City Police Department. The white male suspect has not yet been identified “partly because of his injuries,” Balderrama said.Warning: Graphic image may be disturbing to some readers.Police closed the airport around 1:30 p.m. local time and asked people inside the building to shelter in place. All flights to and from the airport were suspended for hours.In a pair of videos posted to the police department’s Facebook page, Balderrama said officers had responded to a report of shots fired in the airport parking lot. Initially, he said, police were searching for a possible second victim. In the later video, Balderrama said police had confirmed they were not dealing with an active shooter situation and there was no second victim, but that the lone suspect was still missing at that time. Southwest Airlines released a statement to CNN about Winchester, who was believed to be working when he was shot.“The Southwest Airlines family is deeply saddened by the passing of our Southwest family member, and we extend our heartfelt sympathies and support to his family and Southwest co-workers at this time,” the airline said. The Kansas City Chiefs and the University of Oklahoma Sooners, for whom Michael Winchester played in the 1980s, also sent their condolences to his family. At around 4 p.m. local time, authorities started moving people out of the airport. Airport operations began to slowly resume around 6:30 p.m. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story reported the wrong age for Michael Winchester."
3,POLITICS,House Democrats Delay Vote On Nancy Pelosi's Leadership Role,Jennifer Bendery and Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-democrats-nancy-pelosi_us_582b4a47e4b0aa8910bd1570,Some want her out. Some don’t. Most just can't make sense of Donald Trump’s win.,2016-11-15,House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) could face a challenge to keeping her leadership post.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Democrats met Tuesday for the first time since Hillary Clinton’s loss to President-elect Donald Trump last week, and the takeaway from their meeting was clear: It’s time for some serious soul-searching. Lawmakers stumbled out of the nearly two-hour meeting with no clear sense of who they are or what their strategy will be in a GOP-led Congress and White House. Is it time for new leadership? Maybe. Did the election deliver a clear message on what their priorities should be? No. Is it a good idea to replace Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)? Unclear.Many of them are still trying to figure out what happened.“We just got a shellacking last Tuesday,” Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) told reporters. “We got an unexpected defeat and we’ve got to recalibrate and decide how we go forward. It’s just like death. There are different stages of grief you go through, and after a defeat such as this, there are different stages we have to go through.”This is not where Democrats envisioned they would be when they hit the campaign trail in September. They thought Clinton would win, and that they might even take back the Senate. They thought they would pick up more House seats. That scenario would have meant opportunities for building on President Barack Obama’s successes and a chance to expand on new Democratic priorities. Instead, they spent Tuesday morning in a closed meeting reconsidering their whole operation.The most immediate question is whether Pelosi should keep her post. Publicly, Democrats said it’s not her fault that their party got trounced nationally.“Ms. Pelosi enjoys great respect and support in the Democratic Caucus,” said Butterfield. “This is no reflection on her leadership at all.”“I think she’s done a damn good job,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.). “I think she’s a far better leader than Boehner was to his caucus.”But some said the election was a wake-up call on the need for major changes.“It is past time” for Pelosi to go, said a Democratic lawmaker who requested anonymity to speak more freely.Pelosi hasn’t had a real challenger since 2010, the last time Democrats endured an electoral blowout, and in that time, she’s raised record-breaking amounts of money for the party. But this time around, even some of her supporters want time to regroup. Democrats voted Tuesday to push back their leadership elections by two weeks, until Nov. 30, to spend time re-evaluating their next steps. This came after some lawmakers circulated a letter urging Pelosi to delay the elections, and after female lawmakers sent around a letter of their own asking Pelosi to stay on.There aren’t obvious replacements for Pelosi, though one name has been floated: Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who represents the kind of white, working class district that sided so heavily with Trump in the election. There’s an obvious problem with Ryan, though.“We’ve got Trump, [Mitch] McConnell, [Chuck] Schumer, [Paul] Ryan. All these white men,” said another Democrat who asked for anonymity to be more candid. “Are we going to put another white guy in?”For her part, Pelosi’s message to members of her caucus was to lick their wounds, learn from what happened and move forward ― united. She said Democrats should focus on finding common ground with Republicans when possible, and otherwise contrast themselves with Trump.“We’ve been through hell,” Pelosi said, per a source in the caucus meeting. “It’s only going to get worse as [Trump] makes his appointments and we have this fight.”Chased by reporters later, Pelosi suggested she had no qualms with leadership elections being pushed back and said November’s losses speak to the presidential race more than to what House Democrats are doing.One reporter asked, point-blank, if she sees the delayed leadership elections as a repudiation of her leadership. Pelosi, about to disappear behind a set of doors, turned back momentarily.“No, I don’t,” she replied."

The Hill first reported Ingraham was being seriously considered for press secretary, a role she acknowledged would be an adjustment from freely giving her own opinions to channeling the White House’s message. She’d also presumably take a pay cut if giving up radio, TV and book deals for a roughly $176,000 government salary. Still, Ingraham signaled being open to it. “I’m at the point where if my country needs me, and if I could do something to actually advance the Trump agenda, which is stuff I’ve written about now for 15 years with trade and immigration and just renewing America, I’d have to seriously consider that,” she said on Fox News. Journalists have reason to be concerned about covering Donald Trump’s White House given how the president-elect blacklisted news organizations during the campaign and vilified the press. As president-elect, Trump has already limited access by not allowing a small pool of journalists to travel with him, as has been tradition. So whom Trump chooses for press secretary will be seen as an indication of how his administration plans to engage with journalists. The selection of Ingraham would suggest a more combative relationship given her past criticism of the media.

He’s familiar with journalists’ access concerns, having been denied the opportunity to serve as the pool reporter at an early Clinton event. More recently, he vented alongside other frustrated reporters after Trump began a rally before the traveling press arrived. Martosko declined to comment on the press secretary position.Even though Martosko’s name is making the rounds, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks indicated to HuffPost that ― contrary to sources ― he’s not in the running. “David Martosko, while a talented journalist, is not under consideration,” she said. Trump could follow the path of other Republican and Democratic White Houses and select a veteran communications official. Fox News reported that Republican National Committee Communications Director Sean Spicer and Trump transition Communications Director Jason Miller are also under consideration.Spicer has long-running relationships with Washington reporters, but is also not shy about aggressively calling out news organizations for unfavorable coverage. He also proved to be a reliable and enthusiastic Trump defender even as some in the party withheld support. Miller, a former senior communications adviser for Sen.

Stockdill told The Huffington Post she came up with the idea for the traveling system, called Born to Fly Baby, after traveling with their daughter Olive, who was 2 months old at the time.“After trying to fly back to my hometown for a visit with a new baby I realized that something much better was needed for traveling,” she said. “There was nothing on the market that was suitable for Olive other than actual strollers, but then I needed to carry all of our things too and it became a total nightmare.”Stockdill tried the baby-carrying approach and looked for bags to buy that kids could sit on, but couldn’t find anything that had brakes and that Olive could rest in, which was important to her. That’s how the idea for Born to Fly Baby came about, and Newman, a product designer, turned it into a reality.Newman told HuffPost he thought the idea was “brilliant.” He’s made four prototypes of Born to Fly Baby so far, which he and Stockdill have used at airports. According to the Kickstarter campaign they started for the product, the stroller-suitcase hybrid adheres to “full American, European and Australian/[New Zealand] safety standard compliance and all fit within the international carry-on luggage sizing.” The campaign page also lists the estimated retail price ― if buyers don’t participate in the Kickstarter ― as $599 AUD (Australian dollars) or about $450 U.S. dollars. Newman and Stockdill said the system works well at airports and testing it there has helped them make improvements to the prototypes.“It got through security fine and the dimensions were appropriate for carry-on (when folded down),” Newman said. “An improvement that I had for this particular prototype was that it needed to be more easily folded down with one hand, as Josie could not pack it away quickly enough whilst holding the baby at the gate. So that has been improved upon.”Through a Kickstarter campaign, Newman and Stockdill have raised $24,000 of their $37,797 goal in just eight days. They still have over a month to go. Stockdill said she “can’t live without the prototype” now and hopes to get the system out to customers in May 2017, though it depends on their fundraiser, pending international patents and other factors.“As with any first time production run, there are a number of things that could possibly delay things by a few weeks,” she said. “So May 2017 is our best estimate, but not a guarantee.” Head to the Born to Fly Baby site for more information and the Kickstarter page for updates.

13,HEALTHY LIVING,Worried About Spending Money? Blame It On Election Stress.,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stress-spending-saving-money_us_5829e73ae4b0c4b63b0d8c9f,At least it might be good for your bank account.,2016-11-15,"Some stressed-out consumers are more likely to save money or spend only on necessities, according to new research.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5829fe081500002600b0cd82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Election stress may be messing with you in all kinds of ways, from triggering overeating to contributing to poor sleep to lowering productivity. But it’s not all bad, especially if you’re on a budget. All that worry and anxiety might actually help you rein in your spending, according to new research.A study published in October in the Journal of Marketing Research found that people under stress are more inclined to save money. When faced with a spending decision, a stressed-out consumer will opt to purchase necessities because they’re more likely to restore a feeling of control than nonessential or luxury goods. In a series of experiments, volunteers who had been put under stress were asked to make a decision about how to spend $250, with one group being asked to spend on everyday essentials and household goods, and the other group spending on nonessentials like entertainment. While neither group spent all of the $250, the group buying “essentials” spent more money. In a second experiment, when the participants’ sense of personal control was restored, they were willing to spend more money.What explains this behavior? When you’re under stress, the body’s levels of the stress hormone cortisol rise, causing you to go into survival mode (also known as “fight or flight”). When this happens, you’re likely to focus your attention on doing whatever you can to overcome the current threat to survival. This plays out in consumers spending more money on items they deem to be “necessities” ― in other words, products that restore a sense of control. “The type of stress you have determines which consumer products are thought to be necessities,” Kristina Durante, a marketing professor at Rutgers Business School who researches the effect of hormones and consumer behavior, told The Huffington Post. “For example, stress related to starting a new job led consumers to feel that expensive clothes were a necessary expenditure because it gave them a greater sense of control of the stress.”For some people, however, stress can lead to the exact opposite behavior: impulse buying and retail therapy. More research is needed to determine why some people spend less under stress and others spend more, Durante said. The bottom line is to be aware of how you react to stress and whether you’re under stress when making important purchase decisions. “Perhaps in times of stress,” she said, “it could help to reflect on how much control we really do have over our lives before making our way to the shopping mall.”"

Carson, a onetime Republican candidate for the presidency, will not seek a position in Trump’s Cabinet “or any position in the administration,” Carson adviser Armstrong Williams told Politico on Tuesday. “Dr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he’s never run a federal agency,” Williams told The Hill. “The last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.”Carson’s name has been floated as a potential pick for either secretary of education or secretary of health and human services. Speaking to multiple news outlets on his behalf, Williams said that no specific role had been offered to Carson, but that numerous options were open. The retired neurosurgeon has never held elected office. He was one of three GOP presidential primary candidates ― the other two being Trump and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina ― who had no prior political experience. After Carson bowed out of the primary, he was among the first former rivals to become a Trump backer. In his election-night victory speech, Trump described Carson as a competitor turned true friend. Carson is still expected to advise Trump in an unofficial capacity. "

The level of potential business conflicts for the president-elect is unprecedented in American politics, as The Washington Post recently wrote. Paul Light, a New York University professor of public service, who’s an expert on presidential transitions and government reform, told The Huffington Post that what Ivanka Trump’s brand did may be fine legally, but it looks “tacky.”“Presidents represent the nation, as do their spouses and children,” Light wrote in an email. “The White House is not a shopping mall.”"

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-doj-civil-rights_us_582a189be4b060adb56fb8c7,The Obama administration rebuilt the Civil Rights Division. Now lawyers there worry Trump will tear it apart.,2016-11-15,"Bradley Schlozman hired ""right-thinking Americans"" for the Civil Rights Division during the Bush administration.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582b6b1f1500002600b0d257.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Lawyers in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division ― a branch President Barack Obama rejuvenated after the Bush administration neglected many of its key duties ― are worried that President-elect Donald Trump’s administration might dismantle the work they’ve done over the past eight years.Under Obama, the Civil Rights Division has fought Republican-backed voting restrictions, prosecuted anti-gay hate crimes for the first time, and mounted major investigations of police departments in Chicago and Ferguson, Missouri. Trump ― who once suggested he’d instruct his attorney general to investigate the Black Lives Matter movement but has called himself “the least racist person” around ― has different priorities. He subscribes to the notion that there’s a “war on police,” has called police “the most mistreated people in America” and spoke about the need to “give power back” to law enforcement. Now the government’s top civil rights attorneys face a choice: Fight for what they believe in under an administration that shows every indication of being hostile to their division’s mission, or quit.“There are a whole lot of career attorneys who are determined not to let their work get dismantled, by working twice as hard, by just being total pains in the butt if people try to undo their work,” said one DOJ official speaking on the condition of anonymity. “People recognize that the resources aren’t going to be there and that the support isn’t going to be there. But people really recognize that the importance of career line attorney in the Civil Rights Division has never been greater.”Former DOJ official Jonathan Smith, whose work included the Civil Rights Division’s investigation into widespread unconstitutional behavior by the Ferguson Police Department, said he suspects many attorneys within the division are already preparing to depart.“My guess is that [Wednesday], half the division spent the day fixing up their resumes,” he said. “I expect that you’re going to see, starting almost immediately, an outflow of very committed lawyers who are going to look for other ways to make a contribution and to not stick through a Trump administration.”“I’m very concerned about what’s going to happen to the Civil Rights Division and the progress that’s been made on critical issues around criminal justice,” he added. “It’s really quite terrifying.”Significant departures are virtually guaranteed, and it’s too early to say just how many career civil rights lawyers at DOJ will stick around for the Trump administration. Civil Rights Division chief Vanita Gupta recently told hundreds of employees that she’s planning to stay on until Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.As of Tuesday afternoon, the Trump transition team had not contacted anyone at the Justice Department, and DOJ officials hadn’t been told the names of the individuals on the Trump team. Many career attorneys are anxiously awaiting Trump’s attorney general pick, which will give them a better sense of the president-elect’s priorities and help them decide whether they could be more effective inside a Trump DOJ or fighting for civil rights from the outside. Opponents of the Civil Rights Division’s work during the Obama administration, meanwhile, are salivating over the changes a Trump administration could bring about.The Civil Rights Division, which was founded in 1957, is one of the sections of the Justice Department that experiences the biggest changes during a presidential transition. Its work is often controversial, and its priorities reflect the politics of the administration in power. There are parts of the division’s mission ― such as investigating unconstitutional policing practices in local police departments ― that many Republicans don’t believe are part of the role of the federal government. In 2009, Obama’s transition team found the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division “demoralized and damaged” by “oppressive” political appointees who were “hostile” to civil rights enforcement, according to a transition team report previously obtained by The Huffington Post. The report found the administration of former President George W. Bush had “abandoned the Division’s traditional mission and goals, consistently sacrificed sound law enforcement principles for political ends, and waged an internal war against career employees.”One Bush official, Bradley Schlozman, was found to have packed the Civil Rights Division with conservatives he labeled “right-thinking Americans.” This was part of his plan to “gerrymander all of those crazy libs” ― who he also referred to as “commies” and “pinkos” ― in the division. In one email, Schlozman said that “bitchslapping” Civil Rights Division attorneys “really did get the blood pumping and was even enjoyable once in a while.” He jokingly suggested the DOJ should create an award in his honor, the “Brad Schlozman Award for Most Effectively Breaking the Will of Liberal Partisan Bureaucrats.”Under Bush, the section that investigates police departments had been “micromanaged in a way that has prevented it from formulating or pursuing a meaningful agenda” and had “not used its authority to address systemic problems of police misconduct,” according to the transition report. Much of that changed under Obama. The division has opened 23 investigations since the administration took office in 2009, and currently has 19 agreements with law enforcement agencies. It has conducted high-profile investigations of unconstitutional policing practices in cities including New Orleans, Ferguson and Baltimore ― where police routinely performed unconstitutional searches and where officers who engaged in misconduct weren’t held accountable, according to an August report. The biggest open question is what will happen to the ongoing investigation into the Chicago Police Department, which began 11 months ago. The investigation is the largest the division has ever conducted, and the DOJ has been telling residents of the city that the federal probe can finally make a difference in policing practices. It would be a heavy lift for the Justice Department to complete that probe before Trump takes office, and it hasn’t been determined if the results of the investigation will be announced before his inauguration. Trump suggested during a debate this year that the ability of people to sue when they experience excessive force was enough: “Everybody sues, right?” (Individual civil rights lawsuits, even when successful, often fail to address widespread misconduct and prevent future unconstitutional arrests, injuries and deaths.)If there’s any glimmer of hope for civil rights advocates, it’s that Trump hasn’t been very specific about his policy beliefs on civil rights, even as he has used rhetoric that makes them cringe. Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had pledged to beef up federal oversight of police departments across the country by pumping resources into the Civil Rights Division. Trump, however, hasn’t really laid out a detailed policy, beyond saying that that the federal government “should not dictate to state and local law enforcement or interfere unless invited in by appropriate authorities or when verifiably improper behavior is clearly demonstrated.”High-profile Trump supporters with backgrounds in law enforcement don’t give civil rights advocates much hope. Rudy Giuliani, who has been mentioned as a potential attorney general pick, has called the Black Lives Matter movement racist and anti-American. Another potential nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions, had called groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP “Communist-inspired” and “un-American” in addition to reportedly making racist comments that led to his rejection as a federal judge in the 1980s. Trump has been surrounded by law enforcement surrogates like Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona and Sheriff David Clarke of Wisconsin, whose records on civil rights leave advocates concerned, to say the least. Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist and senior counselor, does not believe there’s a systemic race problem in the United States. There are many ways that members of the Trump administration could blunt the impact of civil rights attorneys. They could starve the division of resources. They could shift their work (during the Bush administration, lawyers were assigned immigration cases instead of civil rights work). And they could flat-out overrule them. “You can kill the civil rights agenda in a lot of ways that still allow you to still have a public face and a propaganda face that gives you cover,” Smith said. “It’s a scary time coming up.”Opponents of the Civil Rights Division’s recent work are already making plans. Robert Romaro of Americans for Limited Government said that a Trump administration could end what he characterized as a “takeover” of police departments.“The rule of law starts at the top, and with a President Trump, you can bet police will get a green light to get back to work and make America safe again,” he wrote. “No more putting targets on cops.”Former Civil Rights Division attorney J. Christian Adams ― one of the “right-thinking Americans” Schlozmann hired ― wrote that there are “few places as swampy” as the Civil Rights Division. He encouraged Trump’s team to take a number of steps to crack down on the division and to use civil service laws to go after its members. There are some areas where civil rights experts don’t expect to see such a dramatic shift, such as in prosecutions of individual law enforcement officials on civil rights charges. The criminal section of the Civil Rights Division has brought more than 480 civil rights cases against law enforcement officers under the Obama administration, compared to 468 during the Bush administration. But outside groups already consigned to the fact that they’re about to lose a key ally within the federal government. It’s hard to imagine the Trump administration, for example, arguing that cash bail is unconstitutional when it fails to account for poverty, as the Obama administration did in August. Several other DOJ initiatives ― including a letter meant to curb the illegal enforcement of fines and fees in municipal courts around the county ― would have never happened under an attorney general like Giuliani, wrote Thomas Harvey, the executive director of the St. Louis-based organization ArchCity Defenders, in a recent blog post.Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the national Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said there was a “deep and dangerous” politicization of civil rights work during the Bush administration, and it was crucial to stop that from happening again.“We will work to ensure that we do not revisit that dark era, and we will push to ensure that there is continued enforcement of our nation’s civil rights laws,” Clarke said. “It took years to undo the damage that resulted from the politicization of the Civil Rights Division’s work between 2000 and 2008. Our nation will not benefit and our democracy will suffer if we were to return to that era again.” Smith, now the executive director of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, sees dark times ahead within the Civil Rights Division. Although he’s somewhat hopeful that the protest movement is going to inspire the “changing social conditions” needed to help civil rights lawyers bring about change through courts, the Civil Rights Division under Trump will not be the same. “Rather than having an ally in the Justice Department,” Smith said, “it will be an opponent.”Dana Liebelson contributed reporting."

Deloitte declined immediate comment.“It was not commissioned by the government,” May’s spokeswoman told reporters. “It does seem as though this is a firm touting for business now aided by the media.”But such a disorderly portrayal of the government underscores both the extent of the turmoil unleashed by the June 23 vote to leave the EU and the uncertainties ahead as May tries to pull Britain out of the world’s biggest trading bloc.Like the Brexit vote, Donald Trump’s victory in the United States has underscored how swiftly assumptions are being turned upside down, pushing governments, investors and chief executives into the unknown.The pound fell as much as 1.3 percent to 87.07 pence per euro following the memo leak before recovering to 86.92 pence. It also lost more than half a percent to $1.2417.’NO COMMON STRATEGY’The memo said no common strategy had emerged, partly as a result of splits within the government and partly due to the evolving political situation in the rest of the EU where both France and Germany face major elections in 2017.May’s cabinet is split, with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Trade Minister Liam Fox and Brexit Minister David Davis - who all campaigned to leave the EU - on one side and finance minister Philip Hammond and Business Secretary Greg Clark - who wanted to remain - on the other, according to the memo.May’s priority, it said, is survival and keeping her ruling Conservative Party together, rather than business or economic considerations.“Industry has 2 unpleasant realizations - first, that the Government’s priority remains its political survival, not the economy,” the memo said.“Second, that there will be no clear economic-Brexit strategy any time soon because it is being developed on a case-by-case basis as specific decisions are forced on Government.”The document also said that “major players” in industry were likely to “point a gun at government’s head” to secure assurances similar to that given to carmaker Nissan that it would not suffer from Brexit.“The public stance of Government is orientated primarily to its own supporters, with industry in particular barely being on the radar screen - yet,” it said.Government departments were working on more than 500 Brexit-related projects and might require an additional 30,000 civil servants, it said.If the Supreme Court forces the government to give lawmakers a say on triggering the formal talks to leave the bloc, some ministers might be happy to see more radical Brexit options watered down, the memo said.May has promised to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which kicks off two years of talks with Brussels, by the end of March but she has so far given little away about her plans for Britain’s future relationship with the bloc.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that Britain must be clear about its aims for Brexit by the end of March."

De Maiziere said it had several hundred members.Pictures showed masked police officers carrying away computers and files from properties.Chancellor Angela Merkel has come under pressure to harden her line on security after several attacks claimed by Islamic State across Europe, including a bombing and a knifing in Germany that wounded some 20 people in July. She is also under fire for letting in about 900,000 migrants, mostly Muslims, last year.Some Syrians in Germany say many mosques here are more conservative than those at home, and that they are confronted by Muslims who insist on a literal interpretation of the Koran.Last month, a Syrian committed suicide in prison after he was arrested on suspicion of planning to bomb an airport. His brother and friends have said he was “brainwashed” by ultra-conservatives imams in Berlin.The domestic intelligence agency said in June about 8,900 ultra-conservative Islamists known as Salafists were in Germany.De Maiziere said Tuesday’s raids in 10 German states were the biggest crackdown on any group since the government shut down a movement known as Kalifatstaat (Caliphate State) in 2001, accusing it of extremist activities.He said DWR had distributed Korans and other religious material especially to young people, but this was not the reason for the ban.“Today’s ban is rather directed against the abuse of religion by people propagating extremist ideologies and supporting terrorist organizations under the pretext of Islam.”DWR members have tried to hand out material in German town centers to passers-by, often holding banners or wearing garments with the word “READ!” emblazoned in gold. The ban means they are now prohibited from running such campaigns.Fears about the number of migrants entering the country have boosted support for Alternative for Germany (AfD), a populist party that says Islam is incompatible with the constitution and has siphoned off support from Merkel’s conservatives.A spokeswoman for the interior ministry said there was no indication that DWR was planning attacks itself. Overall, some 820 people have left Germany for war zones in Syria and Iraq, and officials fear they may pose a security threat on their return."

The Stockholm initiative concentrated on clearing snow from pavements and cycle lanes - typically more used by women.However, last Wednesday saw one of the worst snowstorms for years in the city and the roads were chaotic, leading to heavy criticism from Swedes that the policy was a failure."

John McCain (R-Ariz.) is not in the running for secretary of state in the Trump administration.On Tuesday, McCain warned against “resetting” relations with Russia, given its recent aggressions in Syria and Ukraine and its interference in the U.S. election. The senator, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, did not mention President-elect Donald Trump by name in his statement.“With the U.S. presidential transition underway, [Russian President] Vladimir Putin has said in recent days that he wants to improve relations with the United States,” said McCain, a longtime critic of Russia. “We should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America’s allies, and attempted to undermine America’s elections.”McCain added that “the price of another ‘reset’ would be complicity in Putin and [Syrian President Bashar] Assad’s butchery of the Syrian people. That is an unacceptable price for a great nation. When America has been at its greatest, it is when we have stood on the side [of] those fighting tyranny. That is where we must stand again.”Trump, however, has repeatedly indicated that he thinks Washington and Moscow should work together more closely. In a telephone conversation on Monday, he and Putin vowed to repair the “unsatisfactory” relationship between the two countries, according to the Kremlin. Trump’s office said the president-elect is “very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia.”During the presidential campaign, Trump and his surrogates had praised Putin as “strong,” going as far as to describe him as a better leader than Barack Obama. The real estate mogul had also called for closer ties with Russia, particularly in the effort to defeat the Islamic State, and questioned the value of NATO.Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for secretary of state, took a different approach than McCain in his signaling about Putin.“We have a lot in common with the people of Russia. If there are ways that we can build a stronger relationship, I think that would be great,” Corker told MSNBC earlier on Tuesday. “They have the same issues relative to terrorism to confront that we do. I think it’s always good when the leader of the United States and when the leader of an important country like Russia begin on a good foot. Hopefully this will lead to different behavior on behalf of Russia and Putin.”"

Russia, on the other hand, has no problem with any of those actors.“They view Hezbollah positively as the errand lackey of Iran in Syria and Lebanon, (and) they are backing the Shi’ite militia activity in Iraq and Syria,” Dichter said of Moscow.“Russia does not view Iran and its proxies according to the level of threat they pose or broadcast towards Israel,” he said.Moscow thinks Assad should stay in power, that Iran is a stabilizing force and that the nuclear deal the United States struck with Tehran was largely positive, Dichter said. Israel views on all accounts are entirely opposite.Under President Barack Obama, the United States has largely pulled back from the Middle East, allowing Russia to exert wider influence. It remains unclear how policy will shift under Donald Trump, but the president-elect has indicated he will align U.S. policy on Syria more closely with Russia’s.Dichter said Moscow had “feelings of contempt” towards European countries that had avoided engagement in Syria, and rather than viewing the region as an area of temporary interest, Russia was making plans for the long term.“It did not return to the Middle East with military capabilities in the air and at sea only to ‘show off’ and then leave,” Dichter concluded. “The new neighbor did not come here only to rent an apartment, he came here to build a villa.”(Additional reporting by Christian Lowe and Tatiana Ustinova in Moscow; Writing by Luke Baker; Editing by Tom Heneghan)"

It places stress on water, food and energy resources,” the members, including several retired U.S. military leaders, wrote. “As competition for already scarce resources increases, climate change could halt or even reverse peace and development gains made over the past decade.”The statement comes as The Center for Climate and Security is delivering its comprehensive climate change “briefing book” to Trump. The lengthy document ― released in September and prepared by the center’s Climate and Security Advisory Group, a non-partisan group of 43 U.S. military, national security and other experts ― recommends the president-elect and his administration include the risks of climate change in their national security planning. The group’s recommendations include assigning a cabinet-level official to lead on domestic climate change and security issues, establishing senior climate security leadership within the offices of the national security advisor and secretary of defense, and prioritizing climate change.“Just as any good business owner or CEO would not consciously ignore a risk to their enterprise based on ideology, a president can’t ignore the risks of climate change,” retired Navy rear admiral and advisory group member David Titley wrote in an opinion piece last week in the Washington Examiner. “They are real, they are happening now, and they impact both men and women serving in our Armed Forces today, and our millions of veterans at home.”Although still early, it’s hard to imagine Trump taking the experts’ advice.The former reality TV star, who once claimed global warming is a hoax “created by and for the Chinese,” vowed in May to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris climate agreement. It was a promise that didn’t sit well with hundreds of the world’s leading scientists, including famed physicist Stephen Hawking.Trump has also said he would cut all federal spending on the issue, including for climate change research, cleaner technologies and assisting communities already threatened by climate impacts. And he has turned to climate change denier Myron Ebell and fossil fuel lobbyist Mike McKenna to help with transition work at the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy, respectively.Climate scientists have not minced words about what a Trump presidency could mean for the environment. “To quote James Hansen, I fear this may be game over for the climate,” Michael E. Mann, a professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University, told The Huffington Post last week. Trump has said that along with increasing America’s production of coal, oil and natural gas, he would do away with Obama administration regulations aimed at cutting emissions.The group of international experts said the effects of climate change, if left unchecked, could force people from their homes and “provide a vacuum for extremist groups to thrive.”“We must think beyond energy policy, and integrate climate risk into national, regional and international security planning in a way that is commensurate with the risks,” they wrote.

Linsey Graham (R-S.C.) doesn't want the filibuster to go anywhere.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582b8a9c180000f7035045f4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With Republicans in control of the House, the Senate and, come January, the White House, calls have come from some quarters of the Republican Party to eliminate the filibuster and ram through an unadulterated Trumpian agenda. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Tuesday thoroughly rejected that approach. “That’s a horrible, terrible idea,” he said after an off-camera briefing with reporters in the Capitol. Asked if he’d vote against the effort if it came to the Senate floor, he said he would “in a heartbeat.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has so far shown no indication he plans to pursue what’s known as the nuclear option. But if he did, just three Republican “no” votes would stop the measure from passing. Republicans hold 51 seats, and will have 52 if they win an upcoming election in Louisiana as expected. Graham would not have great difficulty finding a handful of allies in opposing the elimination of the filibuster. On a political level, McConnell may actually benefit from the filibuster being in place. First, it could serve to check Donald Trump’s power, which has the counter-effect of increasing McConnell’s. And second, Democrats who filibuster Trump’s agenda can then be attacked in 2018 midterms. When the Trump faithful demand to know why, say, Obamacare has yet to be repealed, McConnell will be ready with an answer: obstructionist Democrats.Graham was a strident opponent of Trump during the campaign, but said he has hope Trump will succeed and he stands ready to work with him on areas where there is mutual agreement. Requiring Trump to work with Democrats, Graham added, gives him the chance to make the kinds of deals he wants to make. “There are deals to be made in this body ― big, huge deals,” he said.“I don’t think he’s an ideologue,” Graham went on. “He lives in a world where the other side has to get something. So in that regard, he has a unique position here. He’s not beholden to any one element. He’s truly an outsider and if he will bring us all together and bring us around a table, some of this stuff will fall into place pretty quickly. To those Democrats who are going to hit him at every turn, you do so at your own peril.”Some Republicans in the House, however, want to see the filibuster nuked, saying it is the only thing that can prevent Trump and the GOP from carrying out all their plans.“If the Senate keeps the filibuster rule, they are ceding to the Democrats the power to block every constructive change we need to make legislatively,” said Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) “And so the Senate needs to make a decision. Are they going to be with the American people or were the Republican senators sent to Washington, D.C., to empower Democrats to reimpose gridlock?”Brooks was not impressed by the argument that many senators on both sides of the aisle might object on the grounds of protecting both the institution and minority party rights.“They may object, but if they do not eliminate the filibuster, then they are agreeing to give control of our legislation to the Democrats that we just worked so hard to beat in November,” Brooks said."

You’ve got to put your name on it and be proud of it. Don’t hide your light under a bushel basket.”Earmarks are congressional spending items for specific local projects, including, infamously, a “Bridge to Nowhere” in Alaska that became a symbol of wasteful spending designed only to benefit its sponsor. Republicans banned earmarks in 2011 after taking control of Congress, but some government watchdog groups have judged the ban to be counterproductive ― and constitutionally questionable, since the Constitution specifically gives Congress the power to spend money. Proponents of lifting the ban say doing so would reduce gridlock and also serve as a check on the executive branch of government.“You cannot hand sacks of money to the executive branch and let the unelected bureaucrats pass it out any way they want,” Culberson added.The proposal is likely to be met with fierce resistance from conservative groups. Jim DeMint, president of The Heritage Foundation, panned the effort in a statement released by the conservative think tank on Tuesday.“We need to focus on balancing the budget, not pork-barrel spending that has wasted money on bridges to nowhere, teapot museums, and monuments to politicians,” DeMint said.The Agenda, a newsletter from The Heritage Foundation, also objected to the amendment, arguing it would fly in the face of President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp” in Washington.“You can’t drain the swamp by bringing back earmarks,” the newsletter said.Americans for Prosperity, a conservative budget group, also urged Republicans to oppose lifting the ban. Brent Gardner, the group’s chief government affairs officer, said Americans “did not send their lawmakers to Washington to spend recklessly, but that’s exactly what they’re proposing to do.”A senior House aide told The Daily Signal, a publication of The Heritage Foundation, that the proposal is the “first step to completely ending the earmark ban by slowly peeling it away.”Culberson wouldn’t say whether he believed the measure had enough support to pass. House Republicans may be more amenable to passing new spending now that they maintain full control of the government. A key person to watch will be House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has yet to comment publicly about the issue. A spokesperson for Ryan would not say whether he supports doing away with the ban. His House website notes that earmarks can be abused but says they “aren’t inherently problematic.”“I won’t speak for Speaker Ryan but I’m very encouraged by the support we’ve received,” Culberson said."

Romero said the outpouring of support in the days since will be used to make good on the ACLU’s promise to defend the Constitution, with the focus now being on looking after the rights of those involved in anti-Trump protests spreading nationwide.“Immediately, we are working across the country to protect the rights of protesters and ensuring those who voice their concerns know their rights,” he said. “We are also analyzing the civil liberties records of potential high-ranking federal appointees.”The ACLU said that other areas of action in the coming months will include blocking attempts to implement a mass deportation force, protecting DREAM Act immigrants who may be targeted by the federal government, standing up against discrimination against Muslims and transgender Americans, and curtailing attempts to defund Planned Parenthood and similar healthcare providers.“Since our founding, we have held every president accountable, fighting for the rights of all Americans in courtrooms, legislatures and beyond,” Romero said.In a column published Monday in the New York Review of Books, the ACLU’s incoming national legal director warned that Trump’s administration could be “a disaster” for the rule of law but that resistance on several fronts might still serve as a check on his power.“We live in a constitutional democracy, one that is expressly designed to check the impulses of dangerous men,” wrote David Cole, a Georgetown law professor who will join the ACLU shortly before Trump is sworn into office. “It will do so if and only if we insist on it.”Jenna Amatulli contributed reporting."

Shortly following Trump’s announcement on Sunday, the organization launched a petition to protest his decision and declare that Bannon, who is a chairman at the Breitbart News Network, has “no business in the White House.” “We think the choice of Steve Bannon is a disaster,” Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the SPLC, told The Huffington Post. “There’s absolutely nothing on Trump’s record as a candidate that would suggest that he is going to try and unite us in any way.” Potok said that, so far, more than 270,000 people have signed the petition, which calls out Bannon for publicly claiming that Breitbart is a “platform for the alt-right” ― a group of far-right white supremacists who aim to rebrand racism into a mainstream movement ― among other egregious acts. “Under Bannon, Breitbart published a call to ‘hoist [the Confederate flag] high and fly it with pride’ only two weeks after the Charleston massacre when the country was still reeling from the horrors of the murders,” the petition reads. “Under Bannon, Breitbart published an extremist anti-Muslim tract where the author wrote that ‘rape culture’ is ‘integral’ to Islam.”Potok said he hopes the petition will attract as many signatures as possible and that the president-elect will actually listen to the voice of the people. “Donald Trump has brought white nationalism unvarnished into the White House,” Potok said. “His first appointments [to his cabinet] have underlined how divisive he really is.” The SPLC even took out a full-page ad on the back of Tuesday’s edition of The Washington Post with a headline that read, “Tell Donald Trump To Reject Bigotry and Hate.” Learn more about the petition here.

35,POLITICS,Trump’s Attorney General Pick Could Spell Bad News For Undocumented Immigrants,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-kris-kobach-doj_us_582b5c6be4b01d8a014ad590,Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is an immigration hard-liner -- and potentially the next attorney general.,2016-11-15,Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) was one of the first Congressional Republicans to endorse Trump. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is famous for his hard-line stance on immigration, and under President-elect Donald Trump, he may get to steer the Justice Department in a way that makes life harder for the undocumented community.On Friday, Trump announced he will nominate Sessions to serve as attorney general. It’s not the position most associated with immigration ― the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security oversees enforcement ― but one that still has considerable power to directly or indirectly affect how decisions are made in immigration cases. If confirmed, Sessions could change precedents for how judges and lawyers interpret the law, such as who qualifies for asylum. He could impede civil rights investigations into immigration-related discrimination. He could instruct government attorneys to stop defending policies the Trump administration doesn’t like.It’s a scary prospect for immigrant rights supporters. “The attorney general position requires a person who can serve as a fair and balanced decision maker on a range of issues,” Beth Werlin, executive director of the American Immigration Council, said in a statement on Friday. “How can we trust someone in that role who has demonstrated he thinks all forms of immigration are bad for America?” There are two offices in the Department of Justice that deal specifically with immigration. The one with the most power to change undocumented immigrants’ lives is the Executive Office for Immigration Review, where judges decide whether someone should be deported or granted reprieve. Especially important is its Board of Immigration Appeals ― the “Supreme Court of immigration law,” as Stephen Legomsky, a former senior counselor to the secretary of Homeland Security and professor emeritus at Washington University School of Law, calls it.Attorneys general can do away with certain precedents that are helpful to unauthorized immigrants or create others that hurt their chances of reprieve, such as by shaping what qualifies an individual for asylum under the law. This power isn’t used often, Legomsky said earlier this week, but it has the potential to make a significant difference. Asylum is a particularly important topic now, as a large number of mothers and children from Central America continue to come to the U.S. to seek relief, often claiming persecution from domestic abuse or gang violence. The law doesn’t specifically mention either as grounds for asylum ― that’s for the courts to interpret. In 1994, then-Attorney General Janet Reno, who served under President Bill Clinton, helped shape interpretation of asylum law when she set as precedent a Board of Immigration Appeals decision to grant asylum to an individual who was persecuted by his or her government because of sexual orientation. The attorney general can also fire immigration judges and replace them. It’s unusual to do so in the Board of Immigration Appeals but has happened before, under President George W. Bush. In 2003, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft removed five of the 16 judges on the panel, all of them considered more pro-immigrant than others. Justice Department officials claimed it wasn’t a “purge” based on their policy views, just a streamlining to reduce the board to 11 judges. (It has since been expanded to its original size.)“This was quite a radical move,” Legomsky said. “I’m hoping a new attorney general wouldn’t replicate those actions, but all bets are off.”Immigration judge hires matter. Bush administration immigration judges hired using a political litmus test ― a practice later stopped because it was determined to be illegal ― disproportionately rejected asylum claims, the New York Times reported in 2008.The other directly immigration-focused arm of the Department of Justice is the Office of Immigration Litigation. Its attorneys can influence how the government handles appeals of its actions. It initially handled the lawsuit led by Texas against President Barack Obama’s deportation relief policy proposal for certain undocumented immigrant parents. And also represented the government in a class action suit meant to ensure unaccompanied minors be guaranteed legal counsel in deportation proceedings.Immigration matters come up in other parts of the department as well. U.S. Attorneys Offices handle prosecution for federal immigration crimes, including illegally entering or re-entering the country. The act of being in the country without authorization is a civil offense, but illegal entry and re-entry are prosecuted criminally, often under the controversial Operation Streamline that gives people little opportunity to argue their individual case. Trump has promised to deport criminals, and more undocumented immigrants could be defined as such if prosecuted for illegal entry and reentry. An attorney general who supports mass crackdowns on unauthorized immigrants could also handcuff the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. The division filed a civil rights lawsuit and won against Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio ― a Trump ally who lost his re-election bid earlier this month ― for unlawful detention of Latinos during his immigration raids. Trump plans to ramp up immigration enforcement and compel more local police to take part in it. If there’s another Arpaio ― which is very likely ― they might not be checked by the Civil Rights Division.Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming Senate minority leader, indicated on Friday that Sessions’ priorities on civil rights would be an issue during the confirmation process. “Given some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to say,” Schumer said in a statement.Opponents of unauthorized immigration see Sessions as an ally for cracking down on so-called sanctuary cities, which limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.“Having served as the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, Senator Sessions’ expertise in the area of immigration is unmatched,” stated Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. “It’s hard to imagine a better pick for the Attorney General position than Senator Jeff Sessions.”There’s potential for the next attorney general ― even an immigration hardliner like Sessions ― to make significant improvements in the judicial system if he wants to: He could devote more resources to hiring judges and other staff. The courts have massive backlogs, and there’s some bipartisan support for getting through them, so long as it doesn’t come at the expense of due process, said Greg Chen, the director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “That would make the courts much more efficient in processing cases through,” he said earlier this week, “and it would probably also improve, in the end, fairness in the courts if judges were not so rushed in handling the cases because they have too many cases on their docket.”Michael Calderone and Ryan Grim contributed reporting.This article was updated to reflect President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general over Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who was reportedly also under consideration. "

Now, it’s improved drastically.But, there are a lot of things that haven’t changed much along with it ― adult-centered health care, mental health care, professional opportunities, and overall quality of life have remained relatively stagnant. Even higher education continues to be an ongoing battle for many young adults with spina bifida.However, with increased longevity and a generally improved prognosis comes a new obstacle I never could have foreseen― guilt. I admit, I feel guilty at times that I’ve made it to 29 years old and I have spina bifida. I admit, it’s maddening to imagine what parents like mine must have gone through a mere few decades ago. I confess there are days when I can’t stomach the stories of the high infant mortality rate that still exists for a large portion of the population with spina bifida across the globe— many living in developing countries where prevention (folic acid) education and quality of life measures hardly exist.Tomorrow is my 30th birthday, and I am faced with these shoulda-coulda-wouldas.Because the fact of the matter is, it could have been me.I could have been the one not knowing what it’s like to live a full life. I could have been the one who didn’t graduate high school or college. I could have been the one whose parents have been grieving a horrific loss for decades. But, instead, I was one of the lucky ones. And while that is a blessing in every way, it also comes with a deep burden of grief -- and the cumbersome weight of responsibility.Even as a little girl, I remember feeling self-conscious. Self-conscious among my peers without spina bifida. Self conscious among my peers with spina bifida. When hanging out with friends born with spina bifida, I remember trying to downplay my physical abilities— like being able to walk. I would rely more on my wheelchair in a paltry attempt to appear I was more like them. Many of my friends can’t walk, and I felt guilty that I could. But in school, a mainstream public school in my neighborhood, the scenario was markedly different. I found myself keenly ― and painfully— aware of the social barrier that existed between them and myself. Using a wheelchair at school only seemed to widen and deepen the abyss between my peers and me. So, I graduated high school never having dated, never having attended an overnight class trip, having gone “stag” to prom, and with a fractured sense of identity that took years of therapy, antidepressants, and purging in the form of writing to at least begin to repair.Still, I have continued the negative habit of compartmentalizing my life, my abilities. It’s ironic that, now that I feel freer to express my physical abilities (I have since met many friends and role models with spina bifida who walk, just like me), in my late 20s, I began experiencing increased lower back pain, and my ability to walk feels as though it is propped on a ticking time bomb. So now, I treasure every moment I am able to put my feet on the floor.It’s almost funny to me now, imagining the piles of (now outdated) literature about spina bifida that exists somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle of my house. My Mami would often dig out brochures for me whenever I wanted to give a class presentation or I had that dreaded “meet the teacher,” when I had to divulge personal medical details to my new educators.What’s sad is, not a single pamphlet or brochure seeks to address the invisible impairments, which are often far worse— the social isolation experienced from early childhood, and how that often leads to crippling depression in the teen and young adult years; the fact that there’s no handbook for navigating the sensitive issues regarding dating and spina bifida; or, worse, the heartbreaking questions that cross my mind, often when I’m enjoying the company of loved ones: “Did having me ruin my parents’ plans for their lives?” “Does so-and-so hang out with me out of pity?” “Do friends or relatives look at my parents and feel sorry for them?” Indeed, these questions and self-doubt are far more “disabling” (a word I despise!) than the actual spina bifida.But now, having almost reached the ripe (for my standards!) age of 30, my questions have begun to shift inside my head. I no longer feel as though I ruined my parents’ lives (I know I’ve enriched them!). And I am working on quieting the self-doubting voice that creeps in when spending time with others who I know truly and genuinely love and appreciate me.What do I allow as part of my inner monologue instead? That’s where the sense of responsibility comes in. As an adult who is living somewhat successfully with spina bifida and hydrocephalus, I now feel poised and ready to extend a hand and place the oxygen mask on others.I want others who have experienced those same negative, self-defeating thoughts to know they are not alone. I want parents to know what is possible for their child with spina bifida. I want them to know they can travel and explore the world. They can study. They can work. They can volunteer. They can reach out to others. They can love. Earlier this year, I launched The Laurita Spina Bifida Project. It’s a non-profit organization, as well as a social media community, and a large part of what we’ll be doing is sharing stories from people across the globe who are living with spina bifida, have a loved one with spina bifida, or work with people with spina bifida. I’m already amazed and humbled at stories we have received. From North Carolina to Tanzania, people like me are realizing that they have a voice. And if they have a voice, then they have power. Knowledge is power. Community is power. Paying it forward to others is power. I have so much more to do.And that makes 30 seem a lot sweeter to me.Follow The Laurita Spina Bifida Project on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

38,HEALTHY LIVING,On Turning 30 With Spina Bifida,"Laurita Tellado, ContributorFounder/President, The Laurita Spina Bifida Project • Writer •...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/on-turning-30-with-spina-bifida_us_57bd2330e4b007f1819a59af,"Thirty years ago, this probably wasn’t supposed to happen.

Now, it’s improved drastically.But, there are a lot of things that haven’t changed much along with it ― adult-centered health care, mental health care, professional opportunities, and overall quality of life have remained relatively stagnant. Even higher education continues to be an ongoing battle for many young adults with spina bifida.However, with increased longevity and a generally improved prognosis comes a new obstacle I never could have foreseen― guilt. I admit, I feel guilty at times that I’ve made it to 29 years old and I have spina bifida. I admit, it’s maddening to imagine what parents like mine must have gone through a mere few decades ago. I confess there are days when I can’t stomach the stories of the high infant mortality rate that still exists for a large portion of the population with spina bifida across the globe— many living in developing countries where prevention (folic acid) education and quality of life measures hardly exist.Tomorrow is my 30th birthday, and I am faced with these shoulda-coulda-wouldas.Because the fact of the matter is, it could have been me.I could have been the one not knowing what it’s like to live a full life. I could have been the one who didn’t graduate high school or college. I could have been the one whose parents have been grieving a horrific loss for decades. But, instead, I was one of the lucky ones. And while that is a blessing in every way, it also comes with a deep burden of grief -- and the cumbersome weight of responsibility.Even as a little girl, I remember feeling self-conscious. Self-conscious among my peers without spina bifida. Self conscious among my peers with spina bifida. When hanging out with friends born with spina bifida, I remember trying to downplay my physical abilities— like being able to walk. I would rely more on my wheelchair in a paltry attempt to appear I was more like them. Many of my friends can’t walk, and I felt guilty that I could. But in school, a mainstream public school in my neighborhood, the scenario was markedly different. I found myself keenly ― and painfully— aware of the social barrier that existed between them and myself. Using a wheelchair at school only seemed to widen and deepen the abyss between my peers and me. So, I graduated high school never having dated, never having attended an overnight class trip, having gone “stag” to prom, and with a fractured sense of identity that took years of therapy, antidepressants, and purging in the form of writing to at least begin to repair.Still, I have continued the negative habit of compartmentalizing my life, my abilities. It’s ironic that, now that I feel freer to express my physical abilities (I have since met many friends and role models with spina bifida who walk, just like me), in my late 20s, I began experiencing increased lower back pain, and my ability to walk feels as though it is propped on a ticking time bomb. So now, I treasure every moment I am able to put my feet on the floor.It’s almost funny to me now, imagining the piles of (now outdated) literature about spina bifida that exists somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle of my house.

39,POLITICS,Mark Zuckerberg Continues To Insist Facebook Could Not Possibly Have Influenced Election,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-election-outcome_us_5829eca4e4b060adb56f607c,One critic called the CEO's response a “joke.”,2016-11-14,Mark Zuckerberg insists Facebook is a neutral platform.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5829f273180000f50350400e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Under increasing criticism, Mark Zuckerberg over the weekend again insisted that Facebook played no real role in influencing the outcome of the presidential election. A claim that’s been undercut by the company’s own employees in at least two recent media reports.“Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,” Zuckerberg wrote in a status update posted Saturday. “The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.”Responding to a question in the comments, Zuckerberg said that the 99 percent number refers to all of the content posted to the social network.Critics called it a laughable data point.“It’s a silly use of statistics that anyone could see through,” Jay Rosen, a media critic and journalism professor at New York University told The Huffington Post. “One percent of stuff could be 45 percent of what’s shared. That’s almost like a joke answer. It’s almost like ‘Mexico will pay for the wall’ or something.”Facebook also announced last week that it would do more to combat fake news on the site.On Monday Gizmodo, citing internal sources at Facebook, reported that a previous effort at the company to aggressively go after fake news was quashed because it would have disproportionately affected conservative news sites. Facebook said this was not true, in a statement to Mashable.Facebook’s been under increasing criticism for the way it helped fake news ― from both right- and left-leaning sites ― go viral over the course of the election cycle. Others are emphasizing that the social network helps wall off people from each other, reinforcing already-existing beliefs, amplifying partisan leanings and fundamentally reshaping the functioning of our democracy.As recently as Sunday night, this reporter saw a report on Facebook that Taylor Swift voted for Donald Trump (we do not know who she voted for). A report claiming that the pope was endorsing Trump got 800,000 shares recently. Other viral fake news this past cycle involved issues like Hillary Clinton’s health, which grew into big stories in the mainstream press.Last week, Zuckerberg said that the notion that fake news influenced the election was a “pretty crazy idea.” He has yet to engage with a more nuanced argument about the way Facebook can influence public opinion and perception, however.Zuckerberg’s own employees seem to be grappling with these issues, as well as others in the tech industry. The New York Times reported over the weekend that some Facebook employees are worried about the role the company is playing in politics.“Highly partisan, fact-light media outlets blinded us on the left (HuffPo, Vox), and propelled Donald Trump into the lead on the right (Breitbart),” Bobby Goodlatte, a former Facebook product designer, wrote on Facebook after the election last week. “Sadly, their fuel is the social internet: [Facebook’s] News Feed, Twitter, Reddit too.” The election is a wakeup call, he writes, urging social media sites to figure out a better way to optimize themselves toward truth ― instead of shares.“As we’ve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging,” he writes. In a separate post, Goodlatte clarified that he is not talking about fake news, but rather “heavily biased news.”Yet, Zuckerberg so far is not engaging with these issues, Rosen said, because the solution would ultimately mean that Facebook must hire real people to filter out truth from fiction, rather than relying on an algorithm.“He’s trying to protect against the moment when Facebook has to admit [the] problem and there’s no algorithmic solution to it; there’s only a people solution,” Rosen said. “This is the reason why his answers seem so empty.”A previous effort to use human editors to handle trending news on Facebook was roundly criticized by conservatives and abandoned.Nearly half of Americans now get their news from Facebook, according to data from Pew. Yet Zuckerberg continues to insist that the social network is a technology company primarily focused on friends and family connecting with each other.“News and media are not the primary things people do on Facebook, so I find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance,” Zuckerberg wrote in Saturday’s post. “We are a technology company because the main thing we do across many products is engineer and build technology to enable all these things.” "

He allegedly helped his uncle, Steven Avery, dispose of her body.But in August, U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin overturned Dassey’s conviction, holding that his confession was involuntary under the Fifth Amendment.At the time he confessed, Dassey was a teenager. He did not have a lawyer or a parent with him. And according to court records, his IQ was around the threshold for intellectual disability.Under the terms of Dassey’s release, he cannot have a gun or any other weapons, possess controlled substances, or obtain a passport. He may travel only within the Eastern District of Wisconsin.He is also barred from contacting Avery or the family of Halbach.When Judge Duffin tossed out Dassey’s confession earlier this year, he also said that Dassey would be released within 90 days unless the state chose to retry him. The state has appealed that ruling ― which means the conviction could be reinstated or Dassey could still be retried.Avery, his uncle, is serving a life sentence for murder."

The Flores case, publicized by local immigrant rights group Juntos, highlights once more the ongoing tensions that President Barack Obama has faced over his deportation policy. It also coincides with advocates preparing to face the incoming administration of Donald Trump, the most aggressive immigration hardliner in recent history.“The church has opened its doors to me,” Flores said in an interview with The Huffington Post.By tradition, immigration authorities avoid raiding churches even though U.S. law doesn’t specifically forbid it.Flores first came to the U.S. in 1997 and worked in landscaping in New Jersey for about five years, before moving to Pennsylvania.In 2007, he returned to Mexico to visit his mother, who was suffering from cancer. But when he tried to come back to the U.S., he ran into problems with immigration authorities. When he crossed back into the U.S. to reunite with his U.S.-born daughter, he was detained by immigration authorities on a bus in Chicago, on his way to Pennsylvania. He spent 21 days in immigrant detention and was deported to Mexico.For the next decade, his life would be punctuated by stints in detention centers or in the custody of the U.S. Marshals as he tried to return to his family. Though he managed to return to the U.S. after his 2007 deportation, ICE agents detained and deported him again in 2013 ― by now, Flores had two more children in the country.Twice he tried to cross back into the United States, but was caught by Border Patrol and referred for prosecution for the crime of illegal entry. In two separate instances, Flores served jail sentences of 25 days and 75 days before being deported. In 2014, Flores finally made it back into the U.S. and headed to Pennsylvania to be reunited with his three kids. “I had to come back,” Flores told HuffPost. “As a father, as a human being, you always have to go to be with your children.”But last year, immigration agents came to his home in Philadelphia to detain him once more.This time, Flores hoped to obtain a U-visa, which enables victims of crimes to remain in the country if they cooperate with a police investigation, in light of his cooperation with police after he was stabbed in 2004 to put the two assailants behind bars. He says he would have applied years ago, if he’d had better legal advice.Flores, however, spent more than a year in immigrant detention and authorities didn’t give him the visa because he had been caught re-entering the U.S. as a deportee, his lawyer Brennan Gian-Grasso says. To get the U-visa Flores needs U.S. authorities to grant a waiver of inadmissibility, and so far they haven’t. ICE released him with an ankle monitor in mid-September and gave him 90 days to straighten out the visa situation with U.S. Citizen Immigration Services, but the time ran out without any visa being issued. With the U-visa application unresolved, he says he was scared he’d be deported again and so decided to seek sanctuary in the church.“It typifies the issue we’re all facing with the immigration system right now. Here’s a guy with a family, three kids,” Gian-Grasso told HuffPost. “He’s taking the action that he’s taking because of this situation he’s in.” ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “As long as he wants, he’ll be here,” Reverend Robin Hynicka told HuffPost. Hynicka said both he and the church viewed the protection of undocumented immigrants facing deportation in the absence of immigration reform as part of its mission. “I took baptismal vows that said I would resist evil, injustice and oppression in any form they present themselves,” Hynicka said. “So I am honoring my baptismal vows. … Deporting a father and a husband who wants to keep his family together is unjust and we’re going to resist it.” While Flores took refuge just days after voters elected to put immigration hardliner Trump into the White House, he says he had already planned to seek solace in the church, whatever the election outcome. “Conversations about providing sanctuary predated the election,” Hynicka said. “The election is just one more interesting conversation piece, in a long, long series of conversation pieces about how to deal humanely with immigrants who are in this country trying to make their way, trying to keep their families together, trying to work in a global economy that doesn’t work for anybody that’s vulnerable or poor.”Trump told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired Sunday he planned to deport between 2 and 3 million undocumented immigrants. He offered no timetable for the proposed deportations, but if he were to try to carry them out over a single term in office he would have to roughly double Obama’s record-setting pace of expulsions.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

42,POLITICS,House GOP Leader Unfazed By Trump's White Nationalist Adviser,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kevin-mccarthy-steve-bannon-trump_us_582a0197e4b060adb56f7ffd,"""I know people are trying to create this fear,"" Rep. Kevin McCarthy said of Steve Bannon.",2016-11-14,House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is willing to overlook Steve Bannon's past and give him a chance in the White House.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582a0205180000f703504072.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) clashed with reporters Monday as he defended President-elect Donald Trump’s choice of Steve Bannon ― the Breitbart News executive chairman who is known for having white nationalist views and who has been praised by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke ― as a top adviser in the White House.During an off-camera sit-down with Capitol Hill reporters, McCarthy argued that Trump “has a right” to name anybody to his inner circle of advisers. He said he didn’t want to “pre-judge” Bannon, suggesting the Breitbart executive may not be responsible for the website’s racist and misogynistic content, and said other Republicans have told him Bannon is different in person than how he’s been cast in the media.McCarthy also suggested that critics are demonizing Bannon just to scare people: “I know people are trying to create this fear and everything else.”Here’s a transcript of reporters repeatedly asking McCarthy how he can defend Bannon, and McCarthy getting testy as the questions keep coming. This has been edited slightly for brevity.Todd Zwilich of The Takeaway, from WNYC: Trump appointed Reince Priebus chief of staff yesterday. At the same time, he appointed what he described as a co-equal adviser, Steve Bannon, as his senior adviser and strategist. Steve Bannon, when he was in charge of Breitbart News, that organization ran headlines that include “Bill Kristol Is A Renegade Jew.” Gabby Giffords, your former colleague ― “The Gun Control Movement’s Human Shield.” They had a headline that said “Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive And Crazy.” And “The Solution To Online ‘Harassment’ Is Simple: Women Should Just Log Off.”He had a radio show on Sirius XM where he regularly entertained guests like Frank Gaffney and Pamela Geller, where they regularly trafficked in Islamophobic conspiracy theories, including one that said Huma Abedin was a Saudi agent. And his wife testified under oath in 2007 that Steve Bannon did not want his daughter going to a particular school because they were “too many Jews there.” How can this appointment possibly be appropriate for American people watching this White House, and how can it be appropriate for you?Rep. Kevin McCarthy: Well, the president-elect always gets to pick his team going forward. Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus worked very closely together in this campaign. One thing, when you go through a campaign, especially the campaign we saw on both sides, it’s a difficult campaign, but you forge strong relationships. The president has a right to select who he thinks is best to be able to move through. I don’t know Steve. I did talk to Steve yesterday. I talked to the president-elect again yesterday, I talked to Reince... The president-elect has to be able to select his best team. There will be a lot of different appointments to go through. What do they say, how many slots does a president have to fill? Is it more than 4,000? There’s a lot of people to go through. So...TZ: Hang on, I’m sorry. This is important. Jewish groups ―KM: Are you saying that other people aren’t important?TZ: They are. I’m going to try one more if I can.KM: Well I answered your question.TZ: I’ve been here for 20 years, so I’m going to try one more if I can ―KM: I haven’t been here 20 years, and I’m the majority leader. So I’m going to go ahead ―Another reporter: Do you feel like ―TZ: Jewish groups, Muslim groups, have all criticized this ―KM: Come on, we’re moving on.***Chad Pergram, Fox News: Do you feel, though, that Republicans are willing to cede moral ground when it comes to the some of things that Donald Trump has said, just because you get the opportunity to pass tax reform, just because you get the opportunity to do Obamacare repeal, some of those issues? Do you feel by associating with people like Bannon or Trump, and some of the things he said, that you cede that moral ground just for the policy outcome?KM: Listen. We’re less than one week since this election. We’re just now coming back into session. The president-elect is putting together his team to go out there. That’s the right that he has to do... Our job here is to get this economy moving again and find the abilities that we can work and get the country moving.CP: But that sounds like you are ceding that moral ground.KM: For one thing, don’t put words in my mouth. I answered your question. The president has the right to select his team, just as I do in my office. ***Jennifer Bendery, The Huffington Post: Are you comfortable, personally, with the idea of someone like Steve Bannon having Donald Trump’s ear?KM: I do not know Steve Bannon and I take Reince Priebus, who I know very well ― his comments to me, based upon what I read there, what people have said, that’s not the Steve Bannon that he knows. Reince has said this to me prior to their appointment, within their, in conversations in the campaign in others. I’ve always believed in giving somebody a chance, from that perspective as well. I don’t like to prejudge people from others. Are we going to judge everything ― I don’t know, I don’t have a history of, did he say it or are we putting everything that was on Breitbart under him, so we put everything that’s in your papers under you? I just don’t know enough there from that standpoint. But everybody that I know that worked with him on the campaign says it’s different than who he is ―TZ: Your colleague got shot in the face and he called her a human shield.KM: OK...***John Bresnahan, Politico: You don’t want to talk about Bannon, but there’s millions of people out there who see an appointment of somebody like Bannon... that they are now in danger, that their citizenship, their status as American citizens is seen as “less than.” They’re worried about white nationalism, they’re worried about the alt-right movement. How do you assure them that Republicans in Congress will protect them from the worst abuses of this movement? They’re scared of their own future in this country.KM [after talking at length about the meaning of a painting of George Washington crossing the Delaware River in 1776]: I know people are trying to create this fear and everything else. Elections is a contest and it gets heated moments. We do not have king or queens... I do not believe the Republican Party, from the basis of what we were created and where we stand for, and the premise of your question, is going to have that fear. And so, I do not know Steve. I do not know what he has said. If he has said that about Gabby Giffords, nowhere would I ever agree with those words. Nowhere would I ever stand behind those words. But Donald Trump has the ability to select who he thinks can move forward. The one thing I will say ― in this job, too long we want to tear people down. I’ve seen things said about me that I fundamentally know are not true, but it’s on the Internet so it must be true. I’m tired of that. I don’t care if you’re a Republican or Democrat, I want to give people the benefit of the doubt.***Deirdre Walsh, CNN: But Mr. McCarthy, just like that painting symbolizes something to you, the appointment of Steve Bannon symbolizes something to people who didn’t vote for Trump. By you being OK with it and moving forward like he’s just a co-equal adviser like Reince Priebus ―KM: Reince is the chief of staff, there’s a difference.DW: No, the announcement came out as co-equal advisers of the president-elect. That’s what it said. So that’s what he represents and that’s a symbol, just like your painting is a symbol. So what do you say to people who are really worried about this person being steps from the Oval Office?KM: Don’t prejudge the new president. Give him an opportunity to govern. If there’s something that he proposes that you disagree with, fight it. But why do you prejudge him when the election was less than a week away?DW: You’ve never met the guy. What was his message to you?KM: It was a short one. We’re trying to get acquainted."
43,POLITICS,Big Business Now The Only Thing Standing Between Trump And Climate Devastation,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/microsoft-wind-power_us_5829e134e4b060adb56f5133,Which doesn't say a lot for Earth's chances.,2016-11-14,Wind energy is poised to get a lot less support from the incoming White House.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5829ed62180000f503503feb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Microsoft announced on Monday that it has made its largest wind energy purchase yet.The tech giant bought 237 megawatts of wind energy to completely power its newly built datacenter in Cheyenne, Wyoming, a state where nearly 88 percent of electricity comes from heavy pollutant coal.The latest purchase brings Microsoft’s total wind power capacity up to 500 megawatts ― a significant number, but small when you consider that it’s less than one-eighth of what one nuclear plant produces.Last year, when the Redmond, Washington-based company publicized plans to open the datacenter, Wyoming Gov. Matthew Mead (R) touted his state’s cheap electricity. Microsoft’s datacenters house servers that host websites across the internet, and suck up huge amounts of electricity. Because most electricity is generated by dirty fossil fuels, such as coal, datacenters now contribute nearly as much to global warming as the entire air travel industry. Microsoft’s move comes nearly a week after Donald Trump won his presidential bid, ushering in a transitional team stacked with climate change deniers and oil industry executives keen to reverse much of the last eight years’ hard-forged environmental progress.So far, the president-elect has signaled his desire to quash President Barack Obama’s currently stalled Clean Power Plan, reignite the coal industry and pull out of the historic Paris climate accord. Already, the company behind the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which Obama rejected last year, is looking to repitch the project. Trump has called scientific evidence of climate change “bullshit” and “a hoax.”He has also repeatedly trashed the wind and solar industries for being too costly and for killing eagles that collide with turbines. Oil and coal stocks surged the day after his historic election. The “only hope” for fighting climate change over the next four years, as Fast Company declared last week, may rest in mayors and activistic chief executives.Under policies like Obama’s, Microsoft’s investment in wind power may have seemed like an incremental step in a larger march forward. And it still has some value, as it demonstrates the commercial viability of clean energy. But now, such a move may amount to little more than a ploy by a $454 billion behemoth to compete with rivals like Google and Amazon. Google became the biggest corporate purchaser of clean energy last year, and it’s investing aggressively to meet its goal of powering all its operations with renewables by 2025. The firm is even using its advanced artificial intelligence software to find new ways to stop wasting electricity. Amazon, by contrast, refuses to release data on its own carbon emissions, and has been much slower than its competitors to invest in clean power.

We did not get the results we wanted, but we took a step in shattering a barrier that’s still there. And little girls and little boys are going to have a different sense of the possible thanks to her nomination and her candidacy,” Obama said in a call organized by the Democratic National Committee for supporters Monday evening.“That doesn’t mean we don’t hurt for what was an unexpected loss. Expected losses are hard enough; unexpected ones are just worse. And that’s okay,” he added. “I was telling my team: You’re allowed to mope for a week and a half. Maybe two if you really need it. But after that, we’ve got to brush ourselves off and get back to work. We need to come together and focus on a way ahead.”Obama’s DNC call came shortly after he held his first post-election press conference. He told reporters that while he believed Democrats had better ideas, those ideas didn’t matter if they weren’t reaching voters.“Given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere,” he said.The president reiterated that point in the call later, saying he hoped that in the coming months, Democrats would be competing “at every level from the DNC to local wards and town committees to assess where we’ve fallen short.”The Democratic Party is now doing a bit of soul-searching, playing out with the debate over who should be the next chair of the DNC. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) has emerged as an early frontrunner, endorsed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the progressive group MoveOn.org. As a black man and the first Muslim member of Congress, he would also offer a sharp contrast to President-elect Donald Trump. But he’s far from the only person to throw his hat into the ring. Others considering the job are former Maryland Gov. and presidential candidate Martin O’Malley, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley, who was critical of the debate schedule during the presidential primary and is currently a DNC vice chair. Obama urged people during the Monday evening call to move forward “in a way that’s consistent with who we are as Democrats.”“It means that we’re listening to each other, we’re reflecting, we’re asking tough questions, we’re respectful of different points of view, we’re basing our decisions on facts and careful analysis,” he said. “We’re taking the long view and we’re strategizing.“The bottom line is: I don’t know about y’all,” he added, “but I’m still fired up and I’m still ready to go.”"

When Ashton Kutcher comes out and says we’ve been Punk’d, then I’ll stand again. But I won’t stand anymore.”In a statement, the Buccaneers said that the team encourages all of its members to stand during the national anthem, but respects players’ first-amendment rights not to do so if they wish. In Evans’ case, the protest will continue for as long as Trump holds office. “It’s well documented what he’s done, and I’m not gonna stand for something I don’t believe in,” he said. “That’s the end of that.”UPDATE ― Tuesday, 4:15 p.m.: Mike Evans apologized for his decision to protest in a statement released by the team on Tuesday.

It’s all in the system, sweetie.”One child said that her teacher’s words particularly disturbed her because her father is undocumented.“I worry about my dad because I had a nightmare that he wasn’t with me anymore,” she told CBS 2.Parent Jennifer Reynaga also expressed distress over the seemingly blanketed threat made to the students.“I would think the kids would do it, but I never thought a teacher would do it,” she told NBC 4.Parents told both local news stations that the teacher has been fired, according to their communication with school district officials.The middle school referred all questions to the school district, which did not immediately return requests for comment Monday."

The company became a part of popular culture for its racy advertising and mercurial founder, Dov Charney.American Apparel, known as much for its sexually charged advertising, listed assets and liabilities in the range of $100 million to $500 million, according to a Delaware court filing.Separately, Canadian apparel maker Gildan Activewear Inc said it agreed to buy intellectual property rights related to the American Apparel brand and certain assets from American Apparel for about $66 million in cash.Gildan will not be purchasing any retail store assets, it said in a statement.The bankruptcy filing allows American Apparel to hold an auction for its assets and business under which Gildan’s proposed acquisition would constitute the initial bid.“Gildan has asked for the opportunity to maintain certain of our manufacturing, distribution and warehouse operations in and around Los Angeles,” American Apparel Chairman Bradley Scher said in a letter to employees, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters.Throughout the competitive sale process, American Apparel will run its business as usual in the United States and this will have no noticeable effect on day-to-day operations in the United States, Scher said in the letter.American Apparel has been scouting for a buyer, and began discussing a possible sale with brand licensor Sequential Brands Group Inc as well as financial services company B. Riley Financial Inc after talks with brand licensor Authentic Brands Group LLC stalled.The company said last week it was winding down its operations in the UK. The U.S. proceeding - a so-called “Chapter 22,” a play on words for a second Chapter 11 - is separate.American Apparel filed its first bankruptcy in October 2015 following a steep drop in sales and drawn out legal battle with Charney, who was ousted in 2014. It emerged from bankruptcy in February under the ownership of a group of former bondholders led by hedge fund Monarch Alternative Capital LP.Still, it continued to face declining sales, exacerbated by its costly manufacturing plant in Los Angeles. Under mounting pressure, American Apparel hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey earlier this year to explore a sale. [L1N1AY224] The company has insisted that any deal keep its manufacturing plant in the United States.At least eight U.S. teen retailers, including Wet Seal LLC and Pacific Sunwear of California Inc, have filed for bankruptcy in the past two years, as the spending habits of young people shift and they visit malls less often.The case is in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, case number 16-12551."

His mother, 28-year-old Deanna Minor, was arrested in August after the Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office ruled the child’s death a homicide.Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said the decision to file charges against Brown and Williams was not made lightly and came “after much thought and deliberation.”“We must seek to hold these ‎defendants responsible for their alleged inaction. The ultimate result in this case was the death of a child that never should have happened,” Worthy stated in a release.After a maintenance worker discovered Aaron’s body in May, authorities finally located his mother at an area hospital’s crisis center, but did not have specific information about why she was there. A family member told local news outlet Fox 2 that Minor had a history of “severe depression.”Prosecutors said a mental health worker had flagged Minor to Child Protective Services on April 21. Brown visited Minor and her son on April 21 and 22 and determined that there was not enough food in the house.Brown alerted her supervisor, Williams, but that was reportedly the last time she saw the mother and son.

Neither of them is smiling.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582a3e141800002a0030e03f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Barack Obama on Monday kept a civil tone in discussing last week’s election, noting more than once his desire for “a smooth transition” and generally declining to criticize the man who for five years had openly tried to delegitimize his presidency.Obama was surely expecting questions about President-elect Donald Trump in his first post-election news conference. He had forcefully argued against the real estate mogul during the campaign, characterizing him as “uniquely unqualified” and “unfit to serve” as president.But as he did in the White House Rose Garden immediately following the election results and during his Thursday meeting with Trump, Obama held back.On Monday, Obama repeatedly demurred when asked if he stood by his earlier statements on Trump’s lack of qualifications.“Regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up,” the president said.Obama had also slammed Trump’s temperament during the campaign, but on Monday, he said he believes Trump can adapt to the responsibilities and demands of being president.“Whatever you bring to this office, this office has a habit of magnifying and pointing out, and hopefully then you correct for,” Obama said. He noted that Trump has “certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well, unless he recognizes them and fixes them.”The president refused to comment on Trump’s decision to appoint Steve Bannon, who has espoused white nationalist and anti-Semitic views, as his chief strategist. Prior to becoming Trump’s campaign CEO, Bannon ran Breitbart News, a mouthpiece for the alt-right movement and the kind of racism and bigotry that ran through Trump’s campaign.Obama said he didn’t feel it was his place to weigh in on his successor’s plans.“I think it’s fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the president-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we are going to try to facilitate a smooth transition,” Obama said.Instead, he insisted on promoting civility. Obama described his meeting last Thursday with the president-elect as “cordial.” He called Trump “a gregarious person” and “somebody who I think likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate.” He even praised Trump’s “gifts” and “impressive” ability to tap into the concerns and passions of his supporters.When asked for his impressions after their meeting, Obama said he believes Trump “is sincere in wanting to become a successful president.”He said he told Trump that “campaigning is different from governing, and I think he recognizes that.”Obama suggested that President Trump may prove changeable.“He is coming to this office with fewer set, hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other presidents might be arriving with,” Obama said. “I don’t think he is ideological. I think, ultimately, he is pragmatic.”Obama is ready and willing to offer advice through the transition. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that he intends to spend more time with the president-elect, and at Monday’s press conference, Obama noted that he will remain in contact with Trump while on his last overseas trip as president this week.Even as Trump has threatened to overturn many of his signature policy achievements, Obama sought to assuage concerns about Trump’s presidency. He compared government to “an ocean liner,” arguing that change comes slowly.“Of course I have got concerns. You know, he and I differ on a whole bunch of issues,” Obama said. “But you know, the federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat. It’s an ocean liner, as I discovered when I came into office.”"

The Huffington Post obtained a copy from a Post source.The woman in question was wearing something underneath the napkin dress. But staffers were rankled by the concept, especially as misogyny and sexual harassment were major themes in the 2016 election.“The fact that this happened at a Washington Post party at the conclusion of an election in which the issue of sexual assault played a huge role is upsetting and infuriating and counter to what we thought The Post stood for in this election,” the letter read.The Post’s newsroom employees have little involvement in staging such events, which are primarily produced and overseen by the paper’s business side. The casino-themed Tuesday night event was sponsored by MGM, which is opening a new hotel next month in nearby National Harbor, Maryland. In Friday’s letter, staffers also questioned if that sponsorship arrangement “alone seems a bit inappropriate, given the seriousness of election night and the decision that was made about the future direction of our country (not to mention that one of the candidates was a casino-owning mogul who likes to grab women by the crotch).”While many Post journalists were busy covering Tuesday night’s election and didn’t attend the party, word traveled through a newsroom Slack channel following a Washingtonian story featuring the napkin-clad woman. “People gathered at the Washington Post on Tuesday to watch a woman vie for the presidency,” wrote Washingtonian Senior Editor Andrew Beaujon. “While there, they could pluck napkins off another woman’s body.”On Friday night, Coratti responded to Post staffers, telling them that she’d spoken to Publisher Fred Ryan and that they “take seriously any complaints brought forward by employees, whether from one or many.” “Although it was never our intent, we regret that this occurred and sincerely apologize for any upset created by this situation,” Coratti wrote. “Going forward, be assured that even more scrutiny will be placed on the packages offered by our sponsors — before, during, and after each event.

The Huffington Post obtained a copy from a Post source.The woman in question was wearing something underneath the napkin dress. But staffers were rankled by the concept, especially as misogyny and sexual harassment were major themes in the 2016 election.“The fact that this happened at a Washington Post party at the conclusion of an election in which the issue of sexual assault played a huge role is upsetting and infuriating and counter to what we thought The Post stood for in this election,” the letter read.The Post’s newsroom employees have little involvement in staging such events, which are primarily produced and overseen by the paper’s business side. The casino-themed Tuesday night event was sponsored by MGM, which is opening a new hotel next month in nearby National Harbor, Maryland. In Friday’s letter, staffers also questioned if that sponsorship arrangement “alone seems a bit inappropriate, given the seriousness of election night and the decision that was made about the future direction of our country (not to mention that one of the candidates was a casino-owning mogul who likes to grab women by the crotch).”While many Post journalists were busy covering Tuesday night’s election and didn’t attend the party, word traveled through a newsroom Slack channel following a Washingtonian story featuring the napkin-clad woman. “People gathered at the Washington Post on Tuesday to watch a woman vie for the presidency,” wrote Washingtonian Senior Editor Andrew Beaujon. “While there, they could pluck napkins off another woman’s body.”On Friday night, Coratti responded to Post staffers, telling them that she’d spoken to Publisher Fred Ryan and that they “take seriously any complaints brought forward by employees, whether from one or many.” “Although it was never our intent, we regret that this occurred and sincerely apologize for any upset created by this situation,” Coratti wrote. “Going forward, be assured that even more scrutiny will be placed on the packages offered by our sponsors — before, during, and after each event. You will not encounter anything like this again.”Coratti and Chang declined to comment beyond the email exchange, which continued Monday morning.

56,THE WORLDPOST,Europe Agrees To Defense Plan After Trump Victory Rattles Leaders,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eu-defense-plan-trump_us_582a0e39e4b060adb56f9c1f,"“Europe needs to be able to act for its own security,” French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters.",2016-11-14,France Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault (L) and France's Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian attend a European Union foreign and defence ministers meeting in Brussel.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582a0f18180000ca0330df39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BRUSSELS, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The European Union on Monday agreed on a defense plan that could see it sending rapid response forces abroad for the first time, as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s criticism of allies appeared to galvanize Europe into revamping its strategy.The plan set out by EU defense and foreign ministers could allow the bloc to send forces to stabilize a crisis before U.N. peace keepers can take over, and more broadly cement a willingness to act without the United States.“Europe needs to be able to act for its own security,” French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters.“This will allow Europe to take a step towards its strategic autonomy,” said Le Drian, who has led the EU efforts along with Germany and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, using EU code language for greater independence of Washington.The 16-page plan lists tasks and aims, many of which risk remaining abstract without an increase in funding.But it nonetheless takes on special relevance after Trump’s comments during his campaign for the U.S. presidency in which he sniped at low levels of defense spending by some of NATO’s European members.Mogherini said there was support from governments on using so-called EU battle groups of 1,500 personnel, which have been operational since 2007 but never used.EU leaders must still sign off on the plan in December, while divisive aspects over money were left for officials to work out next year. Proposals for a European military headquarters were scaled back to focus on civilian missions.Figures on the table for funding the EU plan pale in comparison to the $18 billion that the United States aims to spend over the next five years on new technologies.During the U.S. election campaign Trump threatened to abandon U.S. allies in Europe if they did not spend enough on defense, appearing to question almost 70 years of U.S. military support that has been a cornerstone of American foreign policy.“Clearly it is a message for all of to see how we can increase and improve our coordination,” Sweden’s Foreign minister Margot Wallstrom said of Trump’s campaign comments, even though her country is not itself a member of the U.S.-led NATO alliance.The election of a Russia-friendly political novice as president in Bulgaria - a member of both the EU and NATO - has given further impetus to French and German efforts to improve common defense operations.The EU has 17 military and civilian missions underway - many of them out of the classic European theater, from the Democratic Republic of Congo to the Mediterranean where it is seeking to stem migrant flows from Libya and uphold a U.N. arms embargo.But European planners were at pains to stress the plan would not rival the work of NATO which Britain, one of two nuclear-armed European members together with France, is setting as a priority since it voted to pull out of the European Union.NO ‘EU ARMY’British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, who supported Britain remaining in the EU, said Europe had to increase defense spending that has sunk to historic lows in some parts of western Europe since the end of the Cold War.Only five EU countries, including Britain, meet a NATO target of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense, while another 10 have set firm plans to reach that level. That meant only half the EU’s members were putting up enough funds for the training and equipment that Europe needs, Fallon said.“Rather than dreaming of a European army, the best approach to the Trump presidency is for European countries to step up their own defense spending,” Fallon told reporters in the margins of the meeting.The EU’s Mogherini, who chaired the gathering, went out of her way to say there were no plans to form a European army and countries would retain control over their militaries.France has also pushed defense cooperation along with Germany after Britons voted to leave the EU in a June referendum.Some eastern and Baltic EU nations worry stronger European defense coordination could duplicate or undermine NATO, while Ireland, Sweden and Austria are more generally cautious.Though the new steps proposed are generally seen as modest, one diplomat said the proposed plan broke taboos that have held back European defense cooperation since the French parliament rejected a first attempt in the 1950s."

59,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Agenda Already Running Into A Reality: Congress,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kevin-mccarthy-deportations-wall-obamacare_us_5829e567e4b0c4b63b0d89da,Are Trump's proposals possible?,2016-11-14,Kevin McCarthy got creative when discussing Donald Trump's proposals. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5829f6c5180000f70350402f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has already begun the long Washington slog of twisting President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda into something less Trump, with the California Republican insisting on Monday that Trump’s border wall just meant border security and mass deportations just meant deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records.Asked about Trump’s proposed wall during a Monday pen-and-pad with reporters, McCarthy quickly pivoted to a different subject. “If you talk about the security of the border, I think that’s a common place where Republicans and Democrats can all get to,” McCarthy said.Pressed that there was clearly a difference between border security and the physical construction of a wall ― one that Mexico would supposedly pay for ― McCarthy asked, “How is securing the border different?”He then suggested a border security bill would be a priority, and that there would be a wall along some parts of the border and other parts would be dealt with differently “from a technology standpoint.”In other words, the House majority leader does not foresee the construction of a 1,900-mile wall along the U.S.-Mexico border ― a key component of Trump’s platform.McCarthy also suggested that Trump didn’t really mean what he said about another cornerstone of his campaign: mass deportations.The majority leader pointed to Trump’s “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday night, during which Trump said he would immediately deport immigrants with a criminal record, 2 million to 3 million people in Trump’s estimation. Trump did not say he would stop there, and he has repeatedly said throughout his campaign that anyone who came to the United States illegally would have to go back. But McCarthy suggested that Trump would end deportations with those immigrants who have a criminal record.“That’s not new law,” McCarthy said. “That is just one law that is in the books, but it hasn’t been in effect.”The dueling realities of Trump and congressional Republicans promise to be a point of tension between the incoming president and a GOP Congress. Those different realities were also displayed during the “60 Minutes” interview when it came to Obamacare.Trump said during the interview that a repeal of Obamacare would take place “simultaneously” with a replacement bill so that millions of Americans would not lose their health insurance.The obvious problem with such a promise is that congressional Republicans plan to take on Obamacare through budget reconciliation, a process that would only require 50 votes in the Senate but would not allow a full repeal of the 2010 health care law. What Republicans in Congress could do is dismantle a few key parts of the law, perhaps through the elimination of state subsidies and the halting of a Medicaid expansion.That would functionally make Obamacare unworkable and force Congress to pass something to replace the law, though Democrats could play hardball and not go along with that sort of Republican plan.Asked about the difficulties of repealing and replacing Obamacare simultaneously, McCarthy said Republicans would be meeting to discuss how and when they deal with the health care law. “And I think we need to clarify with what he meant,” McCarthy said.“I think he meant that we’re not going to have everything shut right down,” he continued, suggesting that there could be a future date of an enactment of an Obamacare repeal so that Congress could come up with something.Again, though, Republican congressional leaders are already trying to twist what Trump says into something more achievable, confronted by the reality that passing an actual replacement bill is a huge task, and immediately deporting millions of people and constructing a 1,900-mile wall aren’t likely proposals either."

In a press release on Monday, HBO announced it has officially renewed the drama for a second season. The network also renewed two other freshman series, “Insecure” and “Divorce.”The renewal was basically a given for “Westworld,” considering the numbers the show brings in for the network. According to the release, the show is averaging a gross audience of 11.7 million viewers. HBO claims the show is even outperforming “Game of Thrones” and “True Detective” during “similar times in their first seasons.” The series, created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, and based on a 1973 film of the same name, is kind of like “Jurassic Park” with robots. Basically, there’s a Western-themed amusement park full of lifelike robots where human guests can live out their most depraved fantasies, free of consequences.Then things start to change when the robots slowly become aware of what’s going on and begin to act unpredictably.Several episodes in, the show has provided a lot of questions without giving answers — until this Sunday. Now that there’s a second season coming, it looks like more questions will be answered, too. The original “Westworld” film showed other themed lands besides the Old West. More seasons means the possibility that other theme parks could be explored, too. Maybe we’ll even get that “Game of Thrones” crossover George R.R. Martin wants.In “Westworld,” all men must die. Then come back to life. Then die again."

Cosmopolitan magazine offered “14 Effective Ways to Deal With Post-Election Anxiety.”One way is to stay off social media. Another is to “take care of yourself,” and it quotes New Jersey-based family physician Jennifer Caudle as suggesting, “If you need a mani-pedi, the day after the election is the best day to get it.”Alison Howard, a Washington-based psychologist, said some of her patients have been talking about the election for months but that since the results came out have been expressing more grief, sadness and fear in a town where 93 percent of the voters preferred Clinton.“I’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Howard, who stressed that such feelings were natural and not a mental health pathology.Stephen Strosny, a psychologist in a Washington suburb who voted for Clinton, said he started noticing a spike in election-related stress in April, when he coined the term Election Stress Disorder, whose symptoms include anxiety, trouble concentrating and nervousness with resentment. He estimated that nearly half his patients were Trump supporters.He said cases had surged since Labor Day, when the general election season intensifies, and he has taken four emergency appointments since Tuesday’s election for patients who urgently needed a session.“I would bet anything that alcohol consumption has gone up in the past week, and aggressive driving violations,” said Strosny, who sees supporters for both Clinton and Trump.The Trump-Clinton matchup was particularly stressful because both candidates were seen unfavorably by voters in opinion polls, and both campaigns contributed to stress, he said.Both members of a couple who came to Strosny for an emergency session on Thursday were against Trump, and their anger led to them to blame each other, he said. The central nervous system is incapable of distinguishing the cause of stress, so people tend to lash out at those closest to them, Strosny said.Some Trump supporters, many of whom might not have expected their candidate to win given opinion polls showed Clinton in the lead, appeared to be on the opposite end of the emotional spectrum.Some soaked in their victory by staying glued to election news coverage into the early morning on Wednesday, organizing victory parties at bars and flooding social media with photos of Trump with the caption “Our next president.”In Trump-dominated Pottsville, Pennsylvania, one Trump voter said he did not feel anxious before the election and was dismissive of the stress felt by some Clinton supporters.“I’m happy about the election, and I believe that some of these people, the millennials, they need to suck it up a little bit,” said George Logothetides, owner of Beer-N-Burger in Pottsville. “This is not something to be going to see a psychologist over.”(Additional reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"
62,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Pick For Interior Secretary Could Do A Lot Of Damage,Kate Sheppard and Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-interior-secretary_us_582a2cf3e4b0c4b63b0e2063,"Especially when Sarah ""drill, baby, drill"" Palin is on the short list.",2016-11-14,Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) is one potential Donald Trump pick to head the Department of the Interior.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582a34211500002600b0ceaa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump is just starting to arrange the team that will advise him and implement his policy agenda. But the list of names that have been floated to fill the top job at the Interior Department includes many people who would slash environmental regulations.David Bernhardt, who served as the Interior Department solicitor in the George W. Bush administration and is now a lobbyist in the natural resources sector, is leading Trump’s transition work for the department.Those rumored to be on the list of potential picks for secretary of interior include: oil executive Forrest Lucas, venture capitalist Robert Grady, oil and natural gas magnate Harold Hamm, Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R), Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R) and Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R).“That’s a big-oil wish-list right there,” said Athan Manuel, director of public lands at the Sierra Club. “Our biggest concern is that he would unleash more oil drilling, fracking, coal mining all over our federal lands. It would be greasing the skids if he picked someone from that list.”Some on the list come directly from the oil and gas industry, which they would then be in charge of regulating. Others are from states with major oil and gas production, including Oklahoma and Alaska. Palin, of course, is well known for helping popularize the phrase “Drill, baby, drill!”It’s still early in the transition, of course, and a lot of other names have been floated for the position. But many of them have a record of promoting more development and less regulation.The Department of Interior often gets overlooked, despite the fact that it controls 500 million acres of land ― or 20 percent of the U.S. landmass. It oversees a lot of oil, gas and coal development, both onshore and offshore. On the campaign trail, Trump offered very few policy specifics when it came to energy issues, other than to say that he strongly supported increasing the development of oil, coal and natural gas in the United States. Much of the leasing and regulatory work on those issues falls to the Interior Department.  The agency controls the outer continental shelf, a flashpoint in the battle between the fishing and tourism industries and offshore energy developers, particularly after the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Earlier this year, Obama put oil drilling off the Atlantic Coast on pause and halted new coal leases on public lands ― moves his successor seems likely to overturn. The department also oversees the protection of endangered species, the number of which is likely to increase in the coming decade as climate change hastens the first mass extinction since the demise of dinosaurs. The next interior secretary will also decide whether to restart drilling in Arctic waters or open up drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Environmental groups shut down President George W. Bush’s attempts to allow drilling in the ANWR in 2001.Some conservatives advise not going after those areas first, since drilling there would inevitably draw major backlash. “Instead of going after the most controversial piece of ground in the nation, Bush should have ― and Trump should ― start with opening less controversial areas to show that oil development is compatible with wildlife and other resources,” Randal O’Toole, an analyst at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, wrote in a blog post on Monday.

The Department of Interior oversees the National Park System.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582a34ac180000ca0330e01b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump is just starting to arrange the team that will advise him and implement his policy agenda. But the list of names that have been floated to fill the top job at the Interior Department includes many people who would slash environmental regulations.David Bernhardt, who served as the Interior Department solicitor in the George W. Bush administration and is now a lobbyist in the natural resources sector, is leading Trump’s transition work for the department.Those rumored to be on the list of potential picks for secretary of interior include: oil executive Forrest Lucas, venture capitalist Robert Grady, oil and natural gas magnate Harold Hamm, Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R), Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R) and Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R).“That’s a big-oil wish-list right there,” said Athan Manuel, director of public lands at the Sierra Club. “Our biggest concern is that he would unleash more oil drilling, fracking, coal mining all over our federal lands. It would be greasing the skids if he picked someone from that list.”Some on the list come directly from the oil and gas industry, which they would then be in charge of regulating. Others are from states with major oil and gas production, including Oklahoma and Alaska. Palin, of course, is well known for helping popularize the phrase “Drill, baby, drill!”It’s still early in the transition, of course, and a lot of other names have been floated for the position. But many of them have a record of promoting more development and less regulation.The Department of Interior often gets overlooked, despite the fact that it controls 500 million acres of land ― or 20 percent of the U.S. landmass. It oversees a lot of oil, gas and coal development, both onshore and offshore. On the campaign trail, Trump offered very few policy specifics when it came to energy issues, other than to say that he strongly supported increasing the development of oil, coal and natural gas in the United States. Much of the leasing and regulatory work on those issues falls to the Interior Department.  The agency controls the outer continental shelf, a flashpoint in the battle between the fishing and tourism industries and offshore energy developers, particularly after the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Earlier this year, Obama put oil drilling off the Atlantic Coast on pause and halted new coal leases on public lands ― moves his successor seems likely to overturn. The department also oversees the protection of endangered species, the number of which is likely to increase in the coming decade as climate change hastens the first mass extinction since the demise of dinosaurs. The next interior secretary will also decide whether to restart drilling in Arctic waters or open up drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Environmental groups shut down President George W. Bush’s attempts to allow drilling in the ANWR in 2001.Some conservatives advise not going after those areas first, since drilling there would inevitably draw major backlash. “Instead of going after the most controversial piece of ground in the nation, Bush should have ― and Trump should ― start with opening less controversial areas to show that oil development is compatible with wildlife and other resources,” Randal O’Toole, an analyst at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, wrote in a blog post on Monday. One other area that the interior secretary oversees is the National Park System. This is one issue where Trump has shown some willingness to buck the Republican Party. The GOP platform called for turning over some public lands to states, which could then do whatever they want with them. But Trump and his campaign advisers have said he doesn’t support that. “I want to keep the lands great,” Trump told Field & Stream magazine in January.Manuel called that a “glimmer of hope.” He also posited that Trump might include more funding for park improvements in his proposal for major infrastructure investment ― which might help the parks dig out of their $12 billion backlog.

64,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Conflicts Of Interest Are A Swamp Unto Themselves,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-conflicts-of-interest_us_582a24bde4b0c4b63b0e07af,"He owes China hundreds of millions of dollars, for one thing.",2016-11-14,"President-elect Donald Trump plans to hand off his business empire to his children Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. (not pictured).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582a2575180000f50350414a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With business holdings that span the globe, President-elect Donald Trump will take office next year with unprecedented conflicts of interest, both real and perceived. Thus far, he has done almost nothing to address this issue.Government conflict of interest regulations do not apply to the president of the United States. Trump could theoretically continue to manage his Trump Organization while in office. He could also choose to abide by the regulations that apply to other federal government officials.Instead, Trump declared that his three eldest children, Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric, will oversee his company and its holdings through what he has called a “blind trust.” There is, however, no definition of a blind trust that allows for a person’s children to be its caretakers.The Trump children are also on their father’s presidential transition team, helping to make decisions about personnel and incoming policy that could affect the holdings they’re poised to take control of. They may also receive official positions in their father’s administration, although they are banned from being appointed to cabinet positions. Trump’s favored properties are even currently advertised on his government-funded presidential transition website.This is not a relatively passive, inherited investment portfolio like those owned by Presidents Franklin Roosevelt or John Kennedy. No president has ever come into office with so much wealth, so much firsthand knowledge of his assets or such an intimate relationship with the people appointed to handle those assets.The actual contents, debts, investors and partners of this so-called blind trust will remain undisclosed to the public, but will be known to the incoming president and his children, whom he counts as some of his closest advisers. Further, Trump knows his own business intimately, as it is built around his name as its greatest asset.“This move to appoint a so-called blind trust to be run by Trump’s children serves only one purpose,” said Fred Wertheimer, president of the campaign finance and ethics reform group Democracy 21 ― namely, he said, “to hide from the American people any conflicts of interest that we can expect will occur.”Federal disclosure rules require the president to file an annual personal financial disclosure. However, it’s possible to do this while still withholding a great deal of information. An officeholder could simply list a limited liability company with no information identifying its holdings. There are many unknowns, including the contents of some of Trump’s companies, his investors and partners and his debtors, who may hide behind banks or other loan-granting organizations.Trump refused to release his tax returns during the campaign, adding to the general opacity surrounding his finances. He is the first presidential candidate in over half a century to win the White House without releasing his tax returns.Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter on Monday to the committee’s chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), calling for immediate hearings on Trump’s conflicts of interest.“We have never had a president like Mr. Trump in terms of his vast financial entanglements and his widespread business interests around the globe,” Cummings wrote. “Moreover, we have not had a presidential candidate in modern times who has refused to disclose his tax returns to the American people. Mr. Trump’s unprecedented secrecy and his extensive business dealings in foreign countries raise serious questions about how he intends to avoid conflicts of interest as president.”That investigation would have to cover Trump’s business dealings and holdings around the country and the globe. These foreign holdings and business partnerships are already the source of perceived conflicts of interest. Trump owns or has his name on business ventures, hotels and golf courses in countries as varied as Scotland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan, Dubai, Canada, Ireland and Panama.Wertheimer said that these foreign investments are “bound to be conflicts of interest with regard to how President Trump approaches foreign policy.” This would also apply to any future ventures pursued by the Trump Organization under direction of his children, as has been discussed in the Middle East, Russia and former Soviet states in Central Asia.There are also concerns about foreign purchasers of luxury condos in properties that Trump owns, manages or licenses his name to. Global financial and corruption watchdogs are increasingly concerned about corrupt officials and businesspeople using U.S. real estate to launder stolen or ill-gotten funds.The Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Task Force (FinCEN) began investigating and tracking the potential flow of illicit money into the U.S. real estate market in early 2016. FinCEN has since announced that it will require people who buy property with only cash in most major cities in the U.S. to disclose the actual beneficiary behind the purchase.In 2013, Kazakh businessman Viktor Khrapunov, accused by the Kazakhstan government of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars, spent $3.1 million through unnamed LLCs to purchase three luxury condos at the Trump Soho in lower Manhattan, according to the Financial Times. Khrapunov has denied the charge of money laundering. The building is partially owned by Trump and the Bayrock Group.Perhaps the greatest conflict arises from Trump’s $300 million debt owed to the private banking arm of Deutsche Bank. The German bank has lent billions to Trump over his career and is currently in negotiations with the Department of Justice to settle charges that it lied to investors about its investments in subprime mortgages during the housing crisis and ensuing global recession. The Justice Department’s opening offer was $14 billion. The bank is also being probed for shady equity trades that benefited wealthy Russian clients. Trump will now get to appoint officials who could determine the direction of both probes.Trump also owes hundreds of millions in debt to the Bank of China ― which rents space in his Trump Tower ― and to Goldman Sachs. The Manhattan-based Goldman Sachs was issued subpoenas from the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission in July for its dealings with a Malaysian state fund. (Malaysian businessman Joo Kim Tiah licenses the Trump name for the Vancouver-based Trump International Hotel and Tower.) The Bank of China is a state-owned bank, which means the incoming president owes nine figures to the government of China.There is also the just-opened Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. In 2012, Trump’s company won the right to lease the Old Post Office building, where the hotel now stands, from the General Services Administration. The building is itself owned by the government. Trump will be in charge of hiring a new head of the GSA. The government agency could theoretically renew or amend the lease on friendly terms to the president. Or Trump could renege on his payments, as he has done in many other business ventures, forcing the agency to sue the president.“Democracy is best served when elected officials are wholly committed to advancing public interest,” said Shruti Shah, vice president for programs and operations at the U.S. branch of Transparency International, a global anti-corruption organization.“It is important to avoid both actual and perceived conflicts of interest,” Shah said. “This is a non-partisan principle.”"

Because my skin",2016-11-14,<p>Most don’t have the luxury to change the way the world perceives them by simply putting on makeup.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582a075d180000240050408e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I think about skin a lot more than most white people. I know that’s a really weird statement, but it’s true. Because my skin looks so different, I am far more aware of how my skin influences people’s perceptions of me. Having been diagnosed with Scleroderma at age 10, I’ve grown accustomed to people staring at my skin. I feel the lingering gazes when someone first meets me and sense them glancing at the red spots that are sprinkled all over my body. I catch people looking at my pointy elbows and disfigured fingers. As awkward as this is, I certainly have never felt that my altered skin has jeopardized my safety. In fact, I can count on two hands the number of times I’ve felt truly discriminated against due to my disfigurement.A few years ago, I was at a cycling event to raise money for rare cancers. I signed up to cycle on a stationary bike and support my beautiful friend who is a cancer survivor. The fundraiser was held at a fitness club where professionals were giving massages to the participants. I have never gotten a massage in my life because having to explain the details about my rare disease, tight skin, and the red spots that carpet my entire back doesn’t sound relaxing. These massages were being given to fully clothed people on tables that were lined up in the open gym area. I thought it would be my chance to get a quick massage while avoiding being naked in a room with a stranger. When it was my turn, I immediately saw that the massage therapist/trainer was terrified to touch me. This was before I started writing and speaking freely about my disease. I took the plunge and tried to be honest. “Hi- I know I look fragile. I have a rare autoimmune disease that causes my skin to be tight and other physical deformities. It’s not contagious, and I promise, you’re not going to break me!” I explained with a friendly laugh and smile. I fully expected her to reciprocate with a smile and give me my massage. Instead, she avoided all eye contact and mumbled something about how I really should wait until after I rode the bike for my massage. I questioned her, pointing out that all the other people on the tables hadn’t cycled yet and when I asked the woman who signed me up for my massage, she specifically told me it was best to relax and stretch my muscles before I cycled. The woman uttered some nonsensical response and turned her back to me. The woman’s dismissive attitude deflated my sense of self-worth within seconds. I went into a bathroom stall and stifled my sobs the best I could. Why had she treated me so poorly? I had donated to the cause just like every other participant, and yet, I was being marginalized and rejected for something completely out of my control. There I was, a 39-year-old mother of two crying in a bathroom because some mean lady wouldn’t give me a massage. I know what you’re thinking….. Boo hoo for you. So sad that you were denied a massage! Get over yourself and your ridiculous first world problems. Millions of people face real discrimination every day of their lives. I completely agree, which is why I am willing to write about this embarrassing moment. I’m not proud that I was reduced to tears over something so utterly stupid and inconsequential, but this silly situation brings up an important question; If this isolated incident momentarily demolished my self-worth as a fully functional and educated adult, what do similar incidents (most far worse than this trivial example) do to children and adults? What toll does discrimination take on one’s self-concept? Imagine being shown in subtle and not-so-subtle ways that you’re not as good as someone else because of the way you look. Imagine being denied access to experiences because you’re perceived as different. Imagine the constant blows such rejection would have on your social and emotional development. Imagine feeling you are never quite as well-behaved, or beautiful, or intelligent, or kind because of someone else’s actions that have absolutely nothing to do with you. Imagine having these feelings solidified over and over every time you step outside your door, or turn on the news. Imagine having your self-worth chipped away from the moment you were born, simply because of your skin color, or your parents’ level of education, income, social class, or place of birth. Millions of Americans don’t have to imagine. They live it every day. I wish I could say I have some concrete way to contribute to a solution, but I don’t. I do know the first step to resolution is acknowledging there is a problem and starting an honest conversation. Now more than ever, I hope our country is ready to start talking.

After all, the Republican candidate has repeatedly called for Washington to “get along” with Moscow. Tangible positive changes are certainly possible, but fundamental differences over issues such as U.S. missile defense, NATO expansion and Russia’s willingness to use force against its neighbors, as well as the absence of robust economic ties, make a qualitative breakthrough in the bilateral relationship unlikely.There are many reasons why news of Trump’s victory may have sent champagne corks popping behind the Kremlin walls and inside the Russian parliament. Throughout his campaign, Trump made pronouncements that must have pleased leaders in Russia, one of the few countries where he has been more popular than Hillary Clinton: He has promised to consider lifting U.S. sanctions against Moscow and even floated the idea of recognizing Crimea as part of Russia. Trump has also criticized NATO as obsolete and attacked some of America’s European allies as free riders, saying the U.S. would defend them against aggression as required by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty only if they “fulfill their obligations” and spend enough on defense.Trump has broken with virtually every unfavorable view of Russia in Washington. He snubbed Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko when he requested a meeting in September. And he has called for U.S.-Russian cooperation in Syria against the so-called Islamic State, describing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad as possibly a lesser evil than the alternatives. He has also refused to endorse the finding of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security that “the Russian government directed the recent compromises of e-mails” at U.S. political organizations, including the Democratic National Committee. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Trans-Pacific Partnership pushed for by President Barack Obama, much to Moscow’s dismay.Finally, on a personal note, Trump has described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader with whom he would be prepared to meet even before inauguration. Putin has returned some of Trump’s compliments, describing him as a “colorful” candidate during the campaign and congratulating him within hours of his victory. In his message to the president-elect, Putin said “Russia is ready and wants to restore full-scale relations with the U.S. We understand it will be a difficult path, but we are ready to play our part.”These overtures and exchanges of niceties are likely to lead to some genuine improvements in the bilateral relationship, which has “hit rock bottom” in the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. For starters, some substantive coordination between the U.S. and Russian militaries in Syria can be expected beyond the current tenuous level of deconfliction, which has not been robust enough to prevent close calls in the sky. Given his statements on Syria, Trump might also be more amenable to accepting Russia’s view that Assad should stay at least until ISIS and al Qaeda are defeated in Syria. (Of course, that would represent a departure from the current administration’s position, which is that the civil war in Syria cannot end as long as Assad remains in power.)Also, Trump’s criticism of NATO and unfriendly stance toward Ukraine indicate he may be unenthusiastic about further expansion of the alliance, which Russia views as a grave threat to its security. Trump would also be less likely than his Democratic rival to commit to any further reinforcement of the U.S. military presence in Europe beyond Obama’s existing commitments, and may push NATO’s European members to spend more on defense. (Some view Trump’s criticism of NATO as an attempt to gain leverage in such talks.) Given his business background and 30 years of links with Russia, Trump might try not only to lift some sanctions, but also to expand bilateral trade, though he’s unlikely to achieve lasting results, given Russia’s business climate. State-controlled entities account for 70 percent of the country’s GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund. And Russia is currently not even among America’s top 15 trading partners, while the U.S. ranks sixth in Russia’s list (for January-August 2016), trailing behind not only China and Germany, but even Belarus.Trump might also engage Moscow in areas of mutual interest where Russia’s behavior can have a significant impact on U.S. national security, such as preventing accidental war and terrorist attacks and countering proliferation of nuclear weapons.Such engagement would be popular at home. According to a recent poll by the University of Maryland, 67 percent of Republicans and 53 percent of Democrats want the United States to cooperate with Russia to fight ISIS in Syria. Fifty-six percent of Americans believe the U.S. should pursue a general policy of cooperation with Russia, while 39 percent believe Washington should try to limit Moscow’s power, according to recent polls conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the Moscow-based Levada Center.And, yet, we don’t expect a lasting qualitative change in the bilateral relationship. This would require overcoming several fundamental obstacles. One is the U.S. desire to prevent Russia from expanding its footprint in the Middle East. Another includes Russia’s demands for binding guarantees on the non-expansion of NATO and for constraints on U.S. ballistic missile defense systems ― two of the conditions that Moscow recently put forth for reviving bilateral cooperation on nuclear security, both of which run counter to U.S. interests. Russia also wants a 21st century version of the Concert of Europe, but on a global scale, in which Russia plays an equal role with the U.S., China and the European Union; Washington has no intention to concede to such an arrangement.While limited cooperation on non-proliferation will continue, we also expect no breakthroughs in arms control. Russia will not agree to deeper cuts in strategic nuclear arsenals without limitations on U.S. missile defense, and it outright refuses to discuss nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Moreover, the compliance issues looming over the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty would need to be resolved before any further arms control agreements could be concluded.In short, Trump won’t be able to grant Moscow’s wishes even if he wanted to. He will be constrained on the above-mentioned issues and others, including a wholesale lifting of sanctions, by Congress, where many view missile defense as a fundamental U.S. strategic interest. Likewise, many in Washington want to continue holding Russia accountable for what they view as the forcible annexation of Crimea, rejecting Moscow’s position that it was an exercise in self-determination. Equally contradictory claims persist over the insurgency in eastern Ukraine, which Americans believe sets a dangerous precedent that Moscow may seek to replicate in Eastern European countries that are America’s NATO allies. Ultimately, Trump, who bills himself as something of an isolationist, is likely to defer to Western Europe in the negotiations on resolving the Ukraine conflict, and has even called on Germany to take the lead on the issue.As George W. Bush’s experience with Putin showed, personal ties are not enough to create a sturdy partnership, even if both countries share some vital national interests, such as preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and reining in international terrorism. A genuinely strong, fruitful relationship simply cannot be sustained in the presence of fundamental differences and the absence of a solid economic foundation. It was these factors that effectively derailed the 2009 reset and they will go on making any long-term qualitative improvements in the bilateral relationship unlikely."

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) as the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee.“My friend Keith Ellison is a terrific leader and a strong progressive who knows how to get things done,” Reid said in a statement provided to The Huffington Post. “Now is the time for new thinking and a fresh start at the DNC. Now is the time for Keith.”Ellison has not formally declared his candidacy for the DNC post, which would make him the formal head of the Democratic Party. But he has been building support for a bid among party insiders, according to multiple sources. Reid’s successor as Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), has endorsed Ellison, as has Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told MSNBC Thursday that Ellison “would make a terrific DNC chair.” A Sanders petition backing Ellison has already garnered over 520,000 signatures, according to a source close to Sanders.The DNC post is widely viewed as the opening skirmish in a battle over the future direction of the Democratic Party. Though she shifted left during the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton hailed from a centrist, corporate-friendly Democratic wing that has long dominated the party’s leadership. Progressives believe that faction was discredited by Clinton’s loss to Donald Trump.Ellison co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus and has been a steadfast supporter of workers over corporate interests during his time in office. He would be the first Muslim DNC chair and the third black person to hold the position. The head of the DNC is typically anointed by a Democratic president, and is often a figurehead primarily responsible for fundraising, rather than major strategic decisions. With Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress and the presidency, however, the head of the DNC will play a much more influential role in Democratic politics. The formal selection of the chief is decided by a complex voting process involving state party leaders, who drifted strongly for Clinton over Sanders in the presidential primary. Endorsements from Reid and Schumer suggest that the thinking in establishment circles has become more sympathetic to Sanders supporters following Clinton’s loss.Not every Democratic leader is on board with Ellison, however. On Saturday, former Obama confidant David Axelrod tweeted that Democrats need a “full-time party chair,” adding that “the job just became infinitely more demanding and important.” The tenure of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as DNC chair is widely regarded by party insiders as a debacle, and some Democrats cite her dual status as DNC Chair and congresswoman from Florida as a contributing factor in her failure. She is also deeply unpopular with progressives.In a Sunday appearance on ABC’s “This Week,” Ellison diagnosed the party’s recent electoral troubles.“You’ve got to have a vision to strengthen the grass-roots,” Ellison said. “Make the voters first, not the donors first. I love the donors and we thank them, but it has to be that the guys in the barbershop, the lady at the diner, the folks who are worried about their plant is going to close ― they’ve got to be our focus.”"

First, to remember and honor those who lost their life in the attacks. Then, to celebrate life and music.”Extensive security protocols, including barricades and police, went into organizing the evening. Many tweeted photos of bag checks and long lines.“I came alone tonight. It’s very emotional, as I keep getting flashbacks of that night,” Aurélien Perrin, 25, told The Associated Press. “I was standing just there, just the other side of the bar when it happened.

After the attacks, the whole staff had agreed that the concert hall would reopen no matter what. “But we would have to change the whole place in order to erase that abominable night completely,” Langlet told Le Monde.It has scheduled performers well into next year, with tickets available for purchase online.French President François Hollande and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo plan to commemorate all attack victims on Sunday.

French officials unveiled new memorial plaques, which display the names of those who killed in each attack, at seven different sites.Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and French President Francois Hollande commemorated the new memorials, which can be found across the city as well as in the Saint-Denis suburb. One of the tributes, a plaque that reads “a memorial to the victims wounded and assassinated in the November 13th, 2015 attacks,” can be seen near the A La Bonne Biere cafe, where gunmen killed five people.A similar plaque, unveiled by Hollande and Saint-Denis Mayor Didier Paillard, can be seen outside the Stade de France stadium in Saint-Denis, where the first of the attacks occurred. The son of the lone person killed during the stadium bombings gave a speech honoring his father.“Long live tolerance, long live intelligence, long live France,” he said, according to The Associated Press.Victims were also honored with a concert held Saturday night in the Bataclan concert hall, where 90 people were massacred. Sting opened the show and the Eagles of Death Metal, who had been onstage during the attacks, performed as well.Hollande and Hidalgo introduced a memorial plaque outside the venue on Sunday. Mourners gathered to pay respects, comforting each other and placing flowers around the memorial.“We need to mark the year anniversary to show that we’ll never forget them,” one mourner told The Guardian outside of the Le Carillon bar on Rue Alibert. “Life goes on, but our neighborhood will always remember this.”Outside the city hall of the 11th arrondissement, Hollande and Hidalgo led mourners in releasing balloons into the air. France has seen a spate of major terror attacks in the span of a year and a half.

French officials unveiled new memorial plaques, which display the names of those who killed in each attack, at seven different sites.Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and French President Francois Hollande commemorated the new memorials, which can be found across the city as well as in the Saint-Denis suburb. One of the tributes, a plaque that reads “a memorial to the victims wounded and assassinated in the November 13th, 2015 attacks,” can be seen near the A La Bonne Biere cafe, where gunmen killed five people.A similar plaque, unveiled by Hollande and Saint-Denis Mayor Didier Paillard, can be seen outside the Stade de France stadium in Saint-Denis, where the first of the attacks occurred. The son of the lone person killed during the stadium bombings gave a speech honoring his father.“Long live tolerance, long live intelligence, long live France,” he said, according to The Associated Press.Victims were also honored with a concert held Saturday night in the Bataclan concert hall, where 90 people were massacred. Sting opened the show and the Eagles of Death Metal, who had been onstage during the attacks, performed as well.Hollande and Hidalgo introduced a memorial plaque outside the venue on Sunday. Mourners gathered to pay respects, comforting each other and placing flowers around the memorial.“We need to mark the year anniversary to show that we’ll never forget them,” one mourner told The Guardian outside of the Le Carillon bar on Rue Alibert. “Life goes on, but our neighborhood will always remember this.”Outside the city hall of the 11th arrondissement, Hollande and Hidalgo led mourners in releasing balloons into the air.

Thousands gathered across the French capital earlier Sunday to pay respects to the people who lost their lives last year, as commemorative plaques were unveiled outside the various sites of attack. But what will remain of the memory of that tragic day 10 years from now? What is the relationship between individual and collective memory of the same traumatic event? A group of French researchers backed by the The National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) is trying to find out. Only a few months after the attacks, they launched the research project 13-Novembre, during which 300 researchers will collect and analyze the testimonies of nearly 1,000 people whose lives were affected by the event.The interdisciplinary research project, to be carried out in four stages over a 12-year period, intends to study the construction and evolution of memory following the attacks of November 13, 2015, while making a distinction between individual and collective memory.The large-scale project is the brainchild of Denis Peschanski, a historian and research director of CNRS, and Francis Eustache, a neuropsychologist and INSERM’s research director.The pair had collaborated previously on a project that investigates memories of World War II and the attacks of Sept. 11.Together, they answered a callout that CNRS president Alain Fuchs issued to the scientific community just a few days after the attacks, and their project quickly won funding.The researchers have collected 920 testimonials to date. Participants are being categorized into four groups. Survivors and people who had been directly affected make up one group, dubbed “circle 1;” those who live outside of Paris constitute “circle 4.” “Of the 920 testimonies we received, 450 were from people in circle 1,” Peschanski told HuffPost France.The interviews, conducted by psychologists, historians and professionals, consist of two parts.Each interview covers three main questions, Peschanski said. “Tell us about November 13,” is the first. “Tell us about your November 13” is the second. The final one is, “In your opinion, what are the causes and consequences of November 13?”A second part of the interview focuses on emotional memory. “The participants are asked, for example, how this event has had an impact on their family or professional life,” said Peschanski.Follow-up interviews with the same participants are planned for two, five and 10 years from now.Alongside the interviews, the researchers will conduct a biomedical study on post-traumatic stress disorder with 180 participants ― 120 from circle 1 and 60 from circle 4. “The question we’re asking here is: can we find markers of this syndrome in the brain?” asked the CNRS historian.The results of this study will not be made public until 2028, but Peschanski said that already, it’s evident the interviews contain “exceptional richness.” He has put forward a few tentative findings.“If we look at circle 1, we imagine there is one Bataclan. But each story is different. We have collected 100 accounts of the Bataclan, 100 different stories,” Peschanski explained.But what will remain of these individual accounts? he wonders. In 10 years, will people tell their stories differently, or will there be just one overarching narrative that blurs individual details? “Collective memory rarely represents just one voice. But we cannot remember everything, so we keep what is essential,” Peschanski said.He gave the Sept. 11 attacks as an example, positing that they are currently remembered through the prism of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York, leaving aside the attacks on the Pentagon and Pennsylvania.“The same thing will happen with Nov. 13,” he suggested. “The Bataclan’s story is enough to understand the event; it is enough to understand that normal lives were shattered in the span of seconds.”This piece originally appeared on HuffPost France.

His Muslim ex-wife, Djamila, was shot dead, as were nine of Reibenberg’s good friends. The shootings at Reibenberg’s restaurant were part of a series of terrorist attacks in Paris on Nov. 13, 2015, which killed 130 people and left hundreds wounded. “I have 20 deaths weighing on me and I don’t know how to act,” Reibenberg writes in his book, Une Belle Équipe, which is set to be released on Nov. 16. In the book, which Reibenberg said he wrote “in one sitting,” he discusses the four months that followed the attack and led up his bistro’s reopening.He describes how difficult it was to find a sense of regularity in the wake of the events; he spent months in a daze, he writes. He recounts attending funeral after funeral, and leaning on family members, friends and multiple psychiatrists for support. What he found hardest, he admits, was keeping calm in front of his daughter. “I am on the edge of the abyss, and I have to pick up Tess at school,” he writes in one passage. “I must hide my broken appearance completely. I am not a very good actor.” He knew he wanted the book to be more of a personal account than a factual report of the events of that horrific night, he said. “I didn’t find it necessary [to recount the details], and I had grown tired of repeating them,” he told HuffPost France. “Everyone had asked me, right after, what had happened. I don’t want to talk about it anymore, it is nothing but pain. Like a captain on his ship, I was there, I saw everything, all the bodies, all of it,” he said. “As a child, I always asked myself why my grandparents refused to speak openly about what they had seen during the war, the camps, the death, the horror. Now, I know why. I don’t want to either, I don’t want to. Hell is not a place to revisit without cost.” Reibenberg says one of the reasons he wrote the book was to preserve the memory of processing the tragedy with his daughter and to remember the poignant questions she would ask him ― “Is there a chance that Mama will come back, Papa?”“A couple, friends of mine, died that night, leaving their child an orphan. That allows me to get some perspective when I’m feeling bad,” Reibenberg said. “I am lucky to have a little girl to keep me sane and in check.”In his book, Reibenberg also reveals how disillusioned he felt with the French authorities after the attacks. “Am I too demanding of the Republic? I find it pretty cold sometimes,” he writes.  “I met the mayor of the 11th arrondissement and it was appalling,” he told HuffPost France. “He boasts about giving me 40,000 euros like all the other businesses affected by the attacks. He had no words of compassion to add, no sign of empathy. Nothing else. The mayor of Paris was the same.”“No one thought it was a good idea to meet the people in the area, to talk to us, to grasp the impact of the attack on the ground. No, they stayed in their offices and came up with an arbitrary number,” he continued.Despite what he viewed as insubstantial support from the authorities, Reibenberg was determined to reopen his restaurant. In March, a remodeled La Belle Equipe opened its doors ― but customers were slow to return, for various reasons. “The 11th arrondissement [where many of the attacks took place] certainly suffered. Businesses were close to shutting down, because people were afraid of returning,” he said. But Reibenberg said the district has “bounced back” in recent months ― and so will France, he insisted. “November was our Pearl Harbor. We were attacked although we were not at war. France must be stretched to the limit to recover. She will do it,” he said. This piece originally appeared on HuffPost France. It has been translated into English and edited for clarity. "

Hell is not a place to revisit without cost.” Reibenberg says one of the reasons he wrote the book was to preserve the memory of processing the tragedy with his daughter and to remember the poignant questions she would ask him ― “Is there a chance that Mama will come back, Papa?”“A couple, friends of mine, died that night, leaving their child an orphan. That allows me to get some perspective when I’m feeling bad,” Reibenberg said. “I am lucky to have a little girl to keep me sane and in check.”In his book, Reibenberg also reveals how disillusioned he felt with the French authorities after the attacks. “Am I too demanding of the Republic? I find it pretty cold sometimes,” he writes.  “I met the mayor of the 11th arrondissement and it was appalling,” he told HuffPost France. “He boasts about giving me 40,000 euros like all the other businesses affected by the attacks. He had no words of compassion to add, no sign of empathy. Nothing else. The mayor of Paris was the same.”“No one thought it was a good idea to meet the people in the area, to talk to us, to grasp the impact of the attack on the ground. No, they stayed in their offices and came up with an arbitrary number,” he continued.Despite what he viewed as insubstantial support from the authorities, Reibenberg was determined to reopen his restaurant. In March, a remodeled La Belle Equipe opened its doors ― but customers were slow to return, for various reasons. “The 11th arrondissement [where many of the attacks took place] certainly suffered. Businesses were close to shutting down, because people were afraid of returning,” he said. But Reibenberg said the district has “bounced back” in recent months ― and so will France, he insisted. “November was our Pearl Harbor. We were attacked although we were not at war. France must be stretched to the limit to recover. She will do it,” he said. This piece originally appeared on HuffPost France. It has been translated into English and edited for clarity. "

He was 74. Russell’s official website confirmed that the musician “passed away in his sleep” in Nashville on Sunday. Though an official cause of death has not been released, Russell underwent surgery after suffering a heart attack this past July and was reportedly still in recovery, according to The Associated Press. In 2010, he was also treated for heart failure and underwent surgery for a brain fluid leak. The AP noted that Russell had planned to continue touring in January, citing a representative for the musician.Russell, who was known for both his musical abilities and his long, wispy white hair and beard, began his career at 14 as a piano player in Oklahoma night clubs before moving on to California. He described the experience in a 2014 interview, saying “it was pretty rough.” “It was a dry state, and there were no liquor laws so consequently there were no laws about minors playing in night clubs, so I had the opportunity to start early,” he said. “I went out to California the week I got out of high school, I was seventeen, and found out that they weren’t going to have any sense of humor about that, they weren’t going to let me play or even go into the night clubs unless I was 21, so I had to borrow IDs.” Eventually, Russell would go on to make his mark as one of the top studio musicians in the industry in the 1960s and ‘70s. He worked with everyone from The Beach Boys (on “Pet Sounds”) to Phil Spector (he was in Spector’s Wall of Sound Orchestra) to The Rolling Stones, among countless others. He also led Joe Cocker’s “Mad Dogs & Englishmen” tour. Russell reached the height of his popularity in the ‘70s, but continued to perform well afterward. In 1971, he played at the Concert for Bangladesh at Madison Square Garden in New York along with George Harrison and Bob Dylan. He produced Dylan’s song “Watching the River Flow” and a version of “When I Paint My Masterpiece.”He also found plenty of success as a solo artist, releasing his first album in 1970. By then, he had already appeared on hundreds of songs recorded by other musicians. Russell’s solo work crossed musical genres, fusing country, soul, blues, jazz, gospel and pop to create his own style. As The New York Times notes, “Russell made a broad, sophisticated palette of American music sound down-home and natural.” In 2010, he collaborated with Elton John on the album “The Union.” The single “If It Wasn’t For Bad” received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. The following year, Russell was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. John, who dubbed Russell “the master of space and time,” paid tribute to his friend and collaborator following the news of his death Sunday. “He was a mentor, inspiration and so kind to me,” John wrote alongside a photo of the two on Facebook. Plenty of others shared their condolences on Twitter: "
80,ENTERTAINMENT,Emmy Rossum Slams Donald Trump Supporters For 'Disgusting' Anti-Semitic Threats On Twitter,Julia Brucculieri,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emmy-rossum-trump-supporters_us_5828d4b0e4b02d21bbc949b0,This hate needs to stop.,2016-11-13,"""Telling anyone to 'get ready for the trains' in reference to WWII is disgusting & offensive,"" Rossum wrote on Twitter in response to hateful tweets.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5828d4d6180000f703503dbe.jpeg?cache=Wz3DUOgLBp&ops=crop_0_69_3176_2260%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In the days following the election of Donald Trump as president, a number of hate crimes and incidents of hate speech have occurred throughout the country. As it turns out, celebrities are not immune to this type of frightening behavior. On Sunday morning, “Shameless” star Emmy Rossum slammed Trump supporters who she claimed sent her messages “threatening to send me & my ‘ilk’ to the gas chambers.” Rossum called the trolls’ threats “disgusting & offensive” before telling them to back off. The Huffington Post has reached out to a representative for Rossum for further comment; we have also reached out to Twitter for more information about the tweets and whether any action has been taken. Earlier in the week, Rossum, a Hillary Clinton supporter, tweeted about her sadness with the outcome of this election, noting, “it feels personal to so many.” Rossum isn’t the first star to face hate in the wake of this week’s events. “Silicon Valley” actors Kumail Nanjiani and Thomas Middleditch came face-to-face with some disapproving Trump supporters at a bar on Friday night. The Trump fans called them “cucks” (the term, short for “cuckservative,” is used to disparage those who sympathize with liberal values or anyone who is anti-Trump.)Nanjiani, a Pakistani-American comedian, said he was luckily spared from a violent altercation, but noted that others may not have not been so lucky.“We can’t let hate/racism/bigotry/sexism be normalized. If something happens, be safe, but let it be known we won’t stand for this,” Nanjiani wrote on Twitter."

D.C.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582924361500001400b0cb7b.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The 2016 election has shaken this country to its very foundation. This election, like no other in recent history, has shown us the deep divisions that have resulted in a Trump presidency. Social media is abuzz with outrage, or gloating, or I told you so sentiments. People have taken to the streets to protest the outcome. Once again, the Electoral College has been called into question, and rightly so.Reality bites: No matter what we do now, the next president of the United States is going to be Donald Trump, save for some divine intervention that would only give us President Mike Pence - and that would be worse, if worse is even conceivable.Here is what we must do.First: We must lick our wounds and accept reality. Then chill. Enjoy the upcoming holidays with family and friends. Remember what is important. Then get ready to go to work on January 2 to turn this ship around.Second: Democrats have to accept the fact that the DNC severely miscalculated the mood of the electorate. This election was about fundamental change, and Clinton’s message of incrementalism failed to convince voters that she could or would break up the culture of corruption that has gripped Washington. It was the reason Bernie Sanders went from nowhere to packing arenas in record time.I have friends - people I like and respect - who were for Hillary. I was for Bernie and when I talked to them about him, the answer I got was always something like this: “I like what Bernie has to say, but he’ll never get elected.” Or “It’s just like George McGovern. He doesn’t stand a chance.” They were wrong. They, like the Democratic Party machine, were relying on an old paradigm and ignored the signals that were literally being screamed at them. As has become abundantly clear, Bernie Sanders could have won this election and now, too late, even the major media that was so complicit in keeping him out of the news is realizing it. But that is all water under the bridge.Third: The internecine fighting in the progressive movement has to stop. I was a YOOGE Bernie Sanders supporter and for that I was called vile names by some members of the Clinton camp. Then, when Bernie came in second in the primaries and I followed his lead and supported the only sane choice in the election, I was called vile names by some former Sanders supporters. In the end, we all lost.Fourth: We have to start planning for the 2017 elections and the 2018 midterms. The Tea Party gained power because they got involved and won seats in local, state and federal races. The next two years are going to be hideous. That is a given. So we’ve got to be ready. We have got to field candidates all over the country for small races as well as the races for the House and the Senate. We need to take a cue from Bernie Sanders and what he did as Mayor of Burlington, Vermont. We need to elect progressives as mayors and governors; we need to elect them to school boards, city councils, state legislatures and county offices.Did you know that only 2 out of 3 Americans are able to pass the citizenship test? We must make sure that Civics is an integral part of our educational system so people understand how government works. Maybe then people will actually realize just how important it is to vote. In 2016, only about 55% of eligible voters cast a ballot. If you take a look at midterm elections going back to 1962, it’s clear that people stay away from the polls in droves, even though those elections can be some of the most pivotal.Fifth: We need to understand that a lot of the things Donald Trump campaigned on were the same things Bernie Sanders stressed during his campaign: opposition to job-stealing trade deals, the influence of money in politics, access to health care. People on the right are just as concerned about those things as people on the left. Red states passed raising the minimum wage. Some red states even passed medical marijuana laws.There are plenty of areas where common ground can be found and those are the areas where we must utilize local people who know their neighbors and are willing to run for office. Those people, especially those in solidly red states, don’t need to be bright blue progressives. They just need to be able to deliver a message that resonates with their neighbors, while backing away from the fear, hatred, misogyny and xenophobic hysteria that has inflamed a segment of the Trump electorate.Most of us have friends or relatives who voted for Trump but would never ride around in a pick-up truck waving a Confederate flag while brandishing firearms and grabbing women by the crotch. A lot of the Trump voters are decent people who were just plain sick and tired of politics as usual. They voted for him in spite of his racist, sexist rhetoric, not because of it. Donald Trump was the only response they felt they had to give voice to their frustration. Some of them were former Obama voters.In two years, we will see how much of what Donald Trump promised has taken place. Will that wall be built? Will he make Mexico pay for it? How? By declaring war on Mexico? Will he have deported 11 million undocumented immigrants? I would venture a guess the answer to those questions, as well as to all the other stuff he’s promised, will be no. And his voters will be angry. We can use that anger.In those same two years, we’ll see if Republicans finally manage to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Altogether 20 million will lose access to health insurance and many of them are in red states. How do you think that will play? How do think it will play when food stamp benefits are inevitably cut again? Remember, red states are the biggest recipients of all sorts of federal aid that is on the GOP hit list. If we have local people in communities that don’t usually vote progressive, we can flip those votes by appealing to the kitchen table issues Bernie addressed.To do all this, we need to organize. Fortunately, a farsighted Bernie Sanders has set up the apparatus we need. We don’t have to depend solely on the Democratic Party for funding. We can do what we did when Bernie made his bid and contribute to Our Revolution to fund the candidates who will aid us in wresting this country from the clutches of a fascist president and the dregs of what is left of the Republican Party. There is also a new organization with the name Brand New Congress that is committed to finding and supporting candidates to put forward an agenda to serve the people of this country, not special interests. Our candidates can be progressive Democrats, Independents, Greens or even right leaning Democrats in those southern states where too much liberalism will never fly. Howard Dean formed the 50-state strategy and Democrats took back Congress in 2006. We can duplicate that effort to take back our country and make our Congress more politically, racially and culturally diverse. We are not a one size fits all country and to prevail, we have to recognize that what may be great for California isn’t going to fly in Alabama, but there is common ground that can be cultivated.Sixth and finally: All of us have to work together. During her Academy Award acceptance speech, Patricia Arquette made a plea to members of the gay and African-American communities to stand with women in their fight for equality, reminding them that women have stood with them in the battles for their rights. For that she was derided as a rich Hollywood actress who didn’t know the meaning of struggle. That is not progressive. That kind of attitude is selfish and shortsighted. The struggle women face and have been facing since time immemorial is a human struggle that affects all of us: gay, straight, trans; black, white, brown; every ethnicity under the sun; Christian, Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, atheist and agnostic. If one person isn’t equal, then none of us are.So progressives, stop sniping at each other. Stop hurling counterproductive insults at each other. Wake up and smell the reality we are now living in. Unless we pull together, all will be lost. And that is a fact.Ann Werner is an author and socially conscious progressive who is fed up and isn’t going to take it anymore.
